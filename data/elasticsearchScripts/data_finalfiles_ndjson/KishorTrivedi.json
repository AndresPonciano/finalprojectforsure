The models included are combinatorial reliability models (reliability block diagrams, fault trees and reliability graphs), directed, acyclic task precedence graphs, Markov and semi-Markov models (including Markov reward models), product-form queueing networks and generalized stochastic Petri nets. A practical approach to system modeling is followed; all of the examples described are solved and analyzed using the SHARPE tool. In structuring the book, the authors have been careful to provide the reader with a methodological approach to analytical modeling techniques. These techniques are not seen as alternatives but rather as an integral part of a single process of assessment which, by hierarchically combining results from different kinds of models, makes it possible to use state-space methods for those parts of a system that require them and non-state-space methods for the more well-behaved parts of the system. The SHARPE (Symbolic Hierarchical Automated Reliability and Performance Evaluator) package is thetoolchest'that allows the authors to specify stochastic models easily and solve them quickly, adopting model hierarchies and very efficient solution techniques. All the models described in the book are specified and solved using the SHARPE language; its syntax is described and the source code of almost all the examples discussed is provided.

The bulk of this paper presents examples of the dependability evaluation of some typical fault-tolerant systems, including a local-area network, two well-known fault-tolerant computer systems (C.mmp and SIFT), and an example of a flight control system. HARP has been used to solve very large models. A system consisting of 20 components distributed among 7 stages produced a Markov chain with 24 533 states and over 335 000 transitions (without coverage\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "110\n", "authors": ["443"]}

It is the next step in the evolution of parallel and distributed computing. Due to the largeness and complexity of the grid system, its performance and reliability are difficult to model, analyze, and evaluate. This paper presents a model that relaxes some assumptions made in prior research on distributed systems that were inappropriate for grid computing. The paper proposes a virtual tree-structured model of the grid service. This model simplifies the physical structure of a grid service, allows service performance (execution time) to be efficiently evaluated, and takes into account data dependence and failure correlation. Based on the model, an algorithm for evaluating the grid service time distribution and the service reliability indices is suggested. The algorithm is based on Graph theory and probability\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "108\n", "authors": ["443"]}

Hierarchical and iterative models of systems have been used extensively to solve this problem. A problem with models which use fixed-point iteration is the theoretical proof of the existence, uniqueness and convergence of the fixed-point equations, which still remains an \"art\". In this paper, we establish conditions, in terms of the net structure and the characteristics of the iterated variables, under which existence of a solution is guaranteed when fixed-point iteration is used in stochastic Petri nets.

Some recent research efforts have emphasized the need for a quantitative assessment of security attributes for intrusion tolerant systems. Intrusion tolerant systems are not only complex, but also have to operate in an environment made unpredictable due to the unpredictable actions of bona-fide and non bona-fide users.

These SLAs are related not just to functional attributes of the services but to performance and reliability attributes as well. When combining several services into a composite service, it is non-trivial to determine, prior to service deployment, performance and reliability values of the composite service appropriately. Moreover, once the service is deployed, it is often the case that during operation it fails to meet its SLA and needs to detect what has gone wrong (i.e.,\u00a0performance/reliabilty bottlenecks).

The authors consider client-server systems in which a set of workstations access a file server over a local area network. The systems are modelled by a class of stochastic Petri nets. The mean response time, the throughput and the parametric sensitivities are evaluated for a client-server system based on token ring network and a system based on CSMA/CD network. These models are different from the prevalent performance models of token ring or CSMA/CD network systems because of the message interdependencies introduced by the clients-server structure. An approximate analytic-numeric method rather than simulation is used to solve the models. The solution method and the accuracy of approximation are also discussed.< >", "num_citations": "86\n", "authors": ["443"]}

Because of their dynamic behavior, systems showing a phased behavior offer challenges in modeling. We propose the modeling and evaluation of phased-mission system dependability through the Deterministic and Stochastic Petri Nets (DSPN). The DSPN approach to the phased-mission systems offers many advantages, concerning both the modeling and the solution. The DSPN model of the mission can be a very concise one, and it can be efficiently solved for dependability evaluation purposes. The solution procedure is supported by the existence of an analytical solution for the transient probabilities of the marking process underlying the DSPN model. This analytical solution can be fully automated.

It consists of intermittently saving the current status of the program under execution so that if a failure occurs, the program needs to be restarted from the most recent checkpoint rather than from the beginning. Because of occasional long reprocessing times and the possibility of failures during recovery, checkpoints during reprocessing is guaranteed to increase the effectiveness of any checkpointing technique. In all models considered thus far, checkpointing is allowed only during useful processing of the program. In this paper, we carry out the analysis of a model with checkpointing during reprocessing following failures.

The systems modeled are composed of several subsystems having redundant components. Real systems have a large number of subsystems and very general types of interaction between components within a subsystem and between subsystems. Exact solution techniques applied to real systems often result in the generation of a Markov chain with a million or more states which is too large to be solved. Simplifying approximations are often used. However, these approximations often do not account for general types of stochastic dependence between components and between subsystems.

Hence, determining the optimal PM capacity requirements that minimize the overall cost is of interest.

When a mobile station roams into a shadow region, it loses its network connectivity. In cellular networks, in order to minimize the connection unreliability, careful cell planning is required to prevent the occurrance of the shadow regions in the first place. In 802.11 b/g wireless LANs, however, due to the limited frequency spectrum, it is not always possible to prevent a shadow region by adding another cell at a different frequency. Our contribution in this paper is to propose the alternate approach of tolerating the existence of \u201cshadow regions\u201d as opposed to prevention in order to enhance the connection dependability. A redundant access point (AP) is placed in the shadow region to serve the mobile stations which roam into that region. Since the redundant AP operates on the same frequency as the primary AP, it does not constitute a separate cell. In fact, the primary and the secondary AP communicate to grant medium access to stations within the shadow region. We consider two configurations, which differ in how the two APs communicate with each other. In the first, the secondary AP is connected to the same distribution system as the primary AP. In the second, the secondary AP acts as a wireless forwarding bridge for traffic to/from the mobile stations in the shadow region to the primary AP. The paper outlines the details of how redundancy may be implemented by making enhancements to the basic 802.11 channel access protocol.To evaluate the dependability of the network under study, we present the reliability, availability and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "64\n", "authors": ["443"]}

The adaptive estimation uses model-based a priori estimation and obtains a posteriori estimation based on the data measurements. With the adaptive estimation, the rejuvenation policy determines the time epochs for data collection and rejuvenation according to system dynamics.

The reasoning behind this claim can be summarized as follows: even if the new call arrival process is assumed to be Poisson, the handoff process due to dependencies with neighboring cells, call blocking and other reasons is not necessarily Poisson. The above-mentioned fact mandates the need to consider more general performance models that allow for arbitrarily distributed interarrival times. In this paper we provide numerical solutions for new and handoff call blocking probabilities with arbitrary handoff interarrival time distribution.

{"title": "Extended classification of software faults based on aging\n", "abstract": " Jim Gray classifies software faults into Bohrbugs and Heisenbugs. Bohrbugs are essentially permanent design faults and hence almost deterministic in nature. They can be identified easily and weeded out during the testing and debugging phase (or early deployment phase) of the software life cycle. Heisenbugs, on the other hand, belong to the class of temporary internal faults and are intermittent. They are essentially permanent faults whose conditions of activation occur rarely or are not easily reproducible. Hence these faults result in transient failures, ie, failures which may not recur if the software is restarted. Some typical situations in which Heisenbugs might surface are boundaries between various software components, improper or insufficient exception handling and interdependent timing of various events. It is for this reason that Heisenbugs are extremely difficult to identify through testing. Most recent studies on failure data have reported that a large proportion of software failures are transient in nature caused by phenomena such as overloads or timing and exception errors. In this paper, we extend Gray\u2019s classification of software faults based on the phenomenon of software aging which has recently gained recognition and importance.", "num_citations": "59\n", "authors": ["443"]}

The mean cycle time and the mean response time of the system are approximated by the folding method and by the fixed-point iteration method. The effect of an increasing number of customers on the polling systems is studied using these approximations. The approximation methods are shown to save more than 95% of computation cost without a\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "44\n", "authors": ["443"]}

Dependability of systems with UPS cannot be modeled exactly using the prevalent Markov modeling approaches. They develop and solve two approximations to this problem. The first model assumes that battery units will be fully recharged before the next failure occurs. With this assumption, a semi-Markov process (SMP) model is developed and solved to provide formulae to compute availability measures (transient and steady-state), reliability and mean time to failure (MTTF). Another approximation based only on Markov modeling theory is then proposed. The authors show how all the measures can also be computed using the continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) approach, and also compare some of its results with the equations developed.

Input models based on the theory of stochastic reward nets are solved by efficient and numerically stable algorithms. Steady-state, transient, cumulative transient, time-averaged and up-to-absorption measures can be computed. Parametric sensitivity analysis of these measures is possible. Some degree of logical analysis capabilities are also available in the form of assertion checking and the number and types of markings in the reachability graph. Advanced constructs, such as marking dependent arc multiplicities, guards, arrays of places and transitions, are available. The modeling complexities can be reduced with these advanced constructs. In addition, the expressiveness of the package is enhanced. The most powerful feature of SPNP is the ability to assign reward rates at the net level and subsequently compute the desired measures of the system being modeled. Although no previous knowledge of the C language is necessary to use SPNP, the modeling description language is CSPL, a C-like language. In the latest version (V6. 0), the user can specify non-Markovian SPNs and Fluid Stochastic Petri Nets (FSPNs).

It is therefore important to optimize the degree of parallelism in system design. A related issue is that by deferring repair, it is sometimes possible to improve system dependability.

For most software products this is too good to be true even after the testing phase. Moreover, if a non-zero probability is assigned to an infinite time to failure, metrics like the mean time to failure do not exist. In this paper, we try to answer several questions: Under what condition does a model permit an infinite time to next failure? Why do all non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) models of the finite failures category share this property? And is there any transformation mending the time to failure distributions? Indeed, such a transformation exists; it leads to a new family of NHPP models. We also show how the distribution function of the time to first failure can be used for unifying finite failures and infinite failures NHPP models.", "num_citations": "30\n", "authors": ["443"]}

Recently, studies that question the validity of the assumption of handoff arrivals being Poissonian have appeared in the literature. The above mentioned fact mandates the need to consider more general performance models that allow for arbitrarily distributed interarrival times.

To eliminate stiffness and reduce the cost of solution, approximation techniques have been proposed. In this paper, we describe a software package for the specification and solution of stiff CTMC. As an interface, we use a language for the description of Markov chains. The language also provides facilities for controlling the solution procedure. Both exact and approximate solution techniques are provided. To conclude the paper, we use several examples to show the use of our specification language and the utility of our approximation technique.

{"title": "Modeling of online service availability perceived by web users\n", "abstract": " While the Internet and the World-Wide-Web (WWW)-based online services expand at an unprecedented pace, the Web users are still experiencing a high level of unavailability. Paralleling the effort of identifying the failure-recovery behaviors of the underlying supporting infrastructure, attention has also been paid to Web users\u2019 behaviors. However, a link between the two research directions seems to be missing. In this paper, we propose to use Markov regenerative process (MRGP) models to study the availability of Internet-based services perceived by a Web user, which capture the interactions between the service facility and the user. The use of sophisticated MRGP models rather than traditional continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) models is due to the fact that the model of Web user behavior involves non-exponential distributions. The necessity of MRGP modeling is also evidenced by the comparisons with the corresponding CTMC models, which show that the CTMC models tend to overestimate user-perceived service unavailabilities by 26% to 125%. We study two different online service scenarios:(1) single-user-singlehost (Model-1) and (2) single-user-multiple-host (Model-2). Results from the models provide useful implications to both service providers and online end-users. It is found that user-perceived service unavailability depends not only on the infrastructure\u2019s failure-recovery characteristics but also, more importantly, on the user\u2019s behavior. Also, for a service provider, to improve users\u2019 satisfaction, inventing a fast recovery mechanism is more effective than striving for a more reliable platform given the platform availability is the same.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["443"]}

{"title": "Prepaging and applications to the STAR-100 computer\n", "abstract": " The Control Data Corporation (CDC) STAR (STring ARray) computer is a high performance vector machine capable of performing up to 100 million operations per second. Although the size of the main memory is limited to either 1/2 million or 1 million 64-bit words, the use of a virtual memory capability allows a virtual address space size of 4 trillon 64-bit words. The virtual memory is implemented by means of a paging mechanism. The system provides two page sizes, 512 (small) and 65,536 (large) words, respectively. Because of a very high speed cpu, the system is highly I/O-bound for many problems [1],[2]. Since the paging device is a disk, the use of the large page size can reduce the I/O time considerably. Since the total number of large page frames is either 8 or 16, the use of a large page dictates a very small degree of multiprogramming. The second technique to improve the performance is to increase the size of the main memory [3],[4). This allows a larger page allotment per program thus reducing the paging 1/0. However, due to the small size of the main memory available on the STAR, thrashing can occur even with a very small degree of multiprogramming [3],[5]. Such an I/O limited and memory limited situation forces very low degrees of multiprogramming. Currently, many jobs are constrained to run in a monoprogramming mode. This, coupled with a demand paging environment, implies no cpu-I/O over-lap whatsoever. In such an environment, one possible way to introduce the cpu-I/0 overlap (and hence improve the throughput) is to use prepaging.

Given a point-to-point node packet reception probability (NRP) as a function of distance, PDR of nodes on k-D area is derived by converting k-D Poisson Euclidean distance ordered node distribution to a type of one-dimensional (1-D) Poisson distribution so that the joint probability density function of nodes positions in the k-D area is transformed as the joint probability density function on a 1-D line. Then, PDR on a 1-D line is derived from the product of the un-ordered nodes reception probabilities. The PDR approach is applied to a broadcast MANET with Nakagami fading channel with path loss.

Understanding the nature of the dynamics of these data centers from machine and job/task perspective is critical to design efficient data center management policies like optimal resource/power utilization, capacity planning and optimal (reactive and proactive) maintenance scheduling. Whereas jobs/tasks dynamics have received a lot of attention, the study of the dynamics of the underlying machines supporting the jobs/tasks execution has received much less attention, even when these dynamics would substantially affect the performance of the jobs/tasks execution.

By severe, we mean that the vulnerability-based malware could cause significant damage to the infected system in terms of security and dependability while infecting more and more new vulnerable computer systems. We propose a Markov chain-based survivability model for capturing the vulnerable critical system behaviors during the vulnerability elimination process.

Reliability, availability, safety and related measures are collectively known as dependability. In classical modeling, performance of a system has been modeled independent of the faulty (or fault-tolerant) behavior of the system. In many computer and communication systems, however, even if some components fail, the system continues to function correctly, although at a degraded performance level. Analysis of Fault-tolerant systems from pure performance viewpoint tends to be optimistic since it ignores failure-repair, and gracefully degrading behavior of the system. On the other hand, pure dependability analysis tends to be too conservative since performance considerations are not accounted for [40].

{"title": "On reliability modelling of fault-tolerant distributed systems\n", "abstract": " The problem of predicting the reliability of a distributed system based on the principles of Byzantine agreement is addressed. The system is considered inoperable or failed if Byzantine agreement cannot be guaranteed. The reliability models depend on a unified model of interactive consistency, which is based on a unique fault taxonomy appropriate for distributed systems. The unified model takes advantage of the fact that some faults may not be of an arbitrary nature, while still allowing for the fact that some faults may be arbitrary. A closed-form expression for the reliability and the mean time to failure of systems base on the unified model is derived. Each processor is allowed to have multiple failure modes, and the contribution of the interactive consistency algorithm is explicitly taken into account. The practical value of this unified model in designing ultrareliable systems is demonstrated by several examples.< >", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["443"]}

The duration of the restoration activity is random, and depends on whether it was precipitated by a failure or by a preventive maintenance action. The case where the preventive maintenance epoch is deterministic has been studied previously, and shown to be optimal in a certain sense. Here, we consider the case where the preventive maintenance epoch is randomized, which is more realistic for many systems. The system availability is the long run proportion of time that the system is operational (i.e., not undergoing repair or preventive maintenance). The optimal rate of preventive maintenance to maximize availability is considered, along with sufficient conditions for such an optimum to exist.

{"title": "Reliability indices\n", "abstract": " Computer and other technical systems are expected to be reliable during operation. However, their growing complexity, which is related to the intricate interdependencies among many heterogeneous components, makes the development of fault-free systems an unaffordable task, in terms of time and cost. On the other hand, quality standards impose strict requirements on the reliability attributes and measures [1][2]. Fault-tolerance techniques are used to allow systems to continue their operations even in presence of component failures, although in a possibly degraded mode. Hence, the quantification of the system reliability in combination with system performance is necessary. Reliability can be evaluated using several approaches, generally classified into two categories: measurements-based and model-based [3]. Generally, the former is an attractive way to estimate the reliability of a system since it is based on real operational data. But it is costly and time consuming since it is based on real operational data collected from the system or a prototype. Instead model-based approaches offer an abstraction of the real system avoiding unnecessary details and avoiding system implementation. These models can be used to compute the reliability with an acceptable approximation within affordable cost and time.State-space models are often used because of their capacity of handling different failure/repair behaviors, such as imperfect coverage, correlated failures, and repair dependencies [3].

In other words, we can reduce half of the bandwidth of the access link by using Web caching without compromising retrieval latency.

However, design and evaluation of the combined model of a distributed system for performance and dependability analysis is burdensome and challenging.

Modern cyber-physical systems are very large distributed systems, covering wide geographic areas with time-critical operations, asynchronous state updating and implicit interactions through resource sharing. Canonical examples of such systems include the national electric power generation and distribution grid, computing infrastructure, communication networks and manufacturing systems that are built upon multiple layers of software and physical resources. We address three main aspects of challenges and next steps to the modeling and simulation of these systems based on 1) a revised foundation for model representation, 2) advanced model-analytic tools and 3) a general adaptable and reusable simulation environment. Our suggested approach to these challenges incorporates both the generalization and repurposed use of existing technologies to create a rigorous and justifiable foundation for survivability analysis in largescale cyber-physical systems.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["443"]}

However, the large size of state spaces is a problem that plagues Markovian models. Combinatorial models have been used for modeling reliability and availability of complex systems without paying the price of large Markov models. Yet, assumptions of two-state behavior of components (and that of the system), independence assumptions of component failure behavior, and restrictive repair assumptions decrease the potential of combinatorial models for realistic systems. A combinatorial approach is proposed for the combined performance and availability analysis of coherent repairable systems with multi-state components, allowing inter-dependent component state transitions.

For instance, in a block diagram, fault-tree or reliability graph, the components must be completely independent of one another in their failure and repair behavior. A failure in one component cannot affect the operation of another component, and components cannot share a repair facility, Certain restrictions must be satisfied for a queueing network to have product-form or for a task graph to be series-parallel.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["443"]}
{"title": "The leaky bucket as a policing device: Transient analysis and dimensionings\n", "abstract": " Policing, the mechanism that the network uses to ensure that the user conforms with his negotiated contract, is an important aspect of the forthcoming broadband networks based on ATM. The leaky bucket algorithm has been adopted by ITU (formerly CCITT) as the means to police ATM connections. The performance of the leaky bucket (ie, how well can the leaky bucket algorithm enforce the parameters of the negotiated contract) is a topic of major interest. In this paper we derive expressions for the time-dependent state probabilities and the time-averaged state-probabilities for the leaky bucket rate control scheme. Our model is based on the theory of Markov regenerative processes. In particular, we show that the leaky bucket state probabilities are periodic when studied in continuous time. We also compute time-averaged measures and show that our results specialize to those obtained by Sidi et al. 24] for the long-run behavior of leaky bucket. Our results are more general, however, in that they apply to the transient regime and to more general arrival processes. Finally, using our time-dependent analysis, we dimension the leaky bucket parameters and quantify trade-o s on these.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["443"]}

In these centers, decisions to improve clinic flow must account for the high degree of interdependence when critical personnel or equipment is shared between clinics. Discrete event simulation models have provided clinical decision support, but rarely address high-volume clinics with shared resources. While highly complex models are now capable of representing clinics in detail, validation techniques often do not evaluate model predictive performance when presented with new data. Cross-validation provides a means to evaluate the robustness of model treatment time predictions when ongoing data collection in clinics is impractical.

{"title": "Software rejuvenation and its application in distributed systems\n", "abstract": " Software rejuvenation is known to be an effective countermeasure for dealing with software aging phenomena. Software aging refers to an increasing failure rate due to an accumulation of errors with time. Usually gradual performance degradation accompanies this phenomenon as well. Software rejuvenation occasionally involves stopping the aging system (or application), cleaning up its internal state, and resuming its normal operation. Several approaches are known for reducing or even avoiding the expected rejuvenation downtime overhead. These approaches involve strategies like replication and redundancy, checkpoints, micro/fine grain rejuvenation, fast reboot and others. This chapter revisits and classifies these approaches according to i) the method used to determine the optimal moment to trigger the rejuvenation and ii) the rejuvenation granularity. A discussion about the rejuvenation methods and policies implemented is also covered as well as the metrics used to compare different rejuvenation approaches. Finally, since distributed system ecosystems are complex due to their requirements in terms of synchronization, consistency and performance, this chapter also investigates the software rejuvenation approaches proposed in these scenarios by introducing relevant examples.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["443"]}

Unfortunately, such attacks form the most common type of security threats to the computer and information systems. This makes it imperative to find efficient solutions to vulnerabilities centered around buffer overflows. Typically, an attacker is able to affect a successful intrusion by causing overflow in a buffer, such as the stack frame of a function call. Attacker induced overflows in the stack aim to cause the valid return address to be overwritten by a malicious value. This allows the attacker to either crash a system or to redirect the return from a function call to a rogue piece of code introduced by the attacker.

{"title": "Modeling SITAR system security\n", "abstract": " Recent strategies to protect system security lay emphasis on designing intrusion-tolerant systems that are able to tolerate intrusions using techniques such as redundancy, diversity, reconfiguration and graceful degradation. These systems are expected to not only detect and tolerate attacks, but also repair, or rejuvenate themselves so as to remove any damage caused by an intrusion. Several research efforts are currently afoot to design such systems, such as Enclaves, EMERALDS, ITUA, MAFTIA and SITAR.Before any security mechanism can be accepted to provide protection to a system, it is important to assess its efficacy. Earlier security evaluations were mainly based on a qualitative assessment, such as [1],[2]. This may not be enough to characterize intrusion tolerant systems. Recent studies to security evaluation have begun to take a quantitative approach by using probabilistic and statistical methods as in traditional reliability analysis [6],[3],[5],[4]. In this paper we apply probabilistic modeling to the SITAR system, which is an intrusion tolerant architecture developed jointly by MCNC and Duke University. We start with a continuous-time Markov model that describes the dynamic behavior of multiple intrusion tolerance strategies that exist in SITAR. In order to increase the fidelity of the model to the SITAR architecture, we found it difficult to continue with the hand construction of a CTMC, we motivate and use the stochastic reward net (SRN) model to capture the SITAR system behavior as well as the attacker behavior.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["443"]}

In order to increase system end-to-end availability, an RF channel recovery method is proposed in this paper. When an RF channel fails, the channel is replaced by another working channel and the call continues. The method to replace failed RF channels of ongoing calls and to handle channel failures of handoff and new calls is investigated. The numerical results show that the recovery scheme reduces the dropped calls and the blocked calls significantly under both light and normal traffic.

We consider a modified version of Jensen\u2019s method (a probabilistic method, also known as uniformization or randomization), a new version of ACE (Acyclic Markov Chain Evaluator) algorithm with several enhancements, and a third-order implicit RungeKutta method (an ordinary-differential-equation solution method). Modifications to Jensen\u2019s method include incorporating stable calculation of Poisson probabilities and steady-state detection of the underlying discretetime Markov chain. The new version of Jensen\u2019s method is not only more efficient but yields more accurate results. Modifications to ACE algorithm are proposed which incorporate scaling and other refinements to make it more stable & accurate. However, the new version no longer yields solution symbolic with respect to time variable. Implicit Runge-Kutta method can exploit the acyclic sfiucture of the Markov chain and therefore becomes more efficient. All three methods are implemented. Several reliability models are numerically solved using these methods and the results are compared on the basis of accuracy and computation cost. Based upon these results, we conclude:The computation cost of ACE algorithm does not depend upon mission time, error tolerance, or eigen-structure of the generator matrix.

{"title": "A Statistical Approach to Predict Operating System Failures Based on Multiple Failures Association\n", "abstract": " Empirical studies have shown robust evidence of OS failure patterns characterized by multiple combinations of failure events composed of the same or different failure types. In this paper, we present a statistical approach to predict OS failures based on multiple failures association. Once we identify systematic failure associations in field data, then we compute the probability of a given failure to occur within a time interval upon the occurrence of a particular pattern of preceding failures.

Most functions related to control, management and operation are realized in software. With the ongoing virtualization and shift of network functions to new software platforms, the role and criticality of software for ordinary operations as well as handling of disasters increase significantly. As discussed in the introductory section, malfunctioning software may cause disasters as well. The objective of this chapter is to provide insight into the software failing process and give an introduction to quantitative models to predict the impact of software failures to communication systems and services. These models have been applied to software-defined networking (SDN).

{"title": "Software aging and software rejuvenation: Keynote\n", "abstract": " The study of software failures has now become more important since it has been recognized that computer system outages are more due to software faults than due to hardware faults. The phenome-non of\" software aging\", in which the state of the software system degrades with time, has been reported in widely used software and also in high-availability and safety-critical systems. The primary causes of this degradation are the exhaustion of operating system resources, data corruption and numerical error accumulation. This may eventually lead to performance degradation of the software system or crash/hang failure or both. To counteract this phenome-non, a proactive approach to fault management, called\" software rejuvenation\" has been proposed. This essentially involves grace-fully terminating an application or a system and restarting it in a clean internal state.

{"title": "Assessing the Software Maturity of SDN Controllers Using Software Reliability Growth Models\n", "abstract": " In Software Defined Networking (SDN) critical control plane functions are offloaded to a software entity known as the SDN controller. Today\u2019s SDN controllers are complex software systems, owing to heterogeneity of networks and forwarding devices they support, and are inherently prone to bugs. Our previous work showed that Software Reliability Growth Models (SRGM) can model the stochastic nature of bug manifestation process open source SDN controllers. In this article we focus on different applications of our SRGM framework crucial for an efficient management of SDN-based networks. We provide guidelines for network operators to decide when the controller software is mature enough to be deployed in operational environment, based on the reliability requirements of network applications, and quantify the marginal benefits of the prolonged testing phase on the software quality. We show how the accuracy of software reliability prediction in the early phase of the software lifecycle can be improved by extrapolating the behaviour of previous controller software releases. We also propose software maturity metrics, that can be used by operators to discriminate between the competing SDN controller designs, ie, ONOS and OpenDaylight, when software reliability is a major concern.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["443"]}

{"title": "Performance Analysis of Voting Algorithms with Non-zero Network Delay and Site Processing Time\n", "abstract": " Voting is the most popular replica control algorithm due to its simplicity in implementation and low communication and computing overhead. The basic idea of voting is to assign each site a vote. Majority consensus is required for each update request so that at any time only one update can be committed in the system. In order to compare and evaluate different voting algorithms, analytic models have been developed to obtain the desired measures such as the site availability and the mean response time. Early studies related to availability/performance analysis of voting algorithms used Markov chain models [3]. The use of stochastic Petri nets (SPN) in this area has significantly increased the modeling capability and enabled comprehensive evaluations of voting algorithms [2]. All the previous analytic models ignored network delay and site processing time to remain tractable and easily solvable. Although the no-delay assumption is justifiable in the situation where all the sites are contained in a local area network and the processing of each data entity is relatively simple and quick, it is not appropriate in an environment with rapidly developing heterogeneous networks, especially when geographically dispersed sites are connected by a wide area network (WAN) and used to provide webbased multimedia database services. In this paper, we have developed a stochastic reward net (SRN) model which incorporates network delay and site processing time in a distributed database system based on a static majority voting algorithm.

Provably optimal prefetching algorithms are rendered impractical because of complicated techniques to decide when to issue prefetches.

{"title": "Extended classification of so ware faults based on aging\n", "abstract": " Jim Gray classifies software faults into Bohrbugs and Heisenbugs. Bohrbugs are essentially permanent design faults and hence almost deterministic in nature. They can be identified easily and weeded out during the testing and debugging phase (or early deployment phase) of the software life cycle. Heisenbugs, on the other hand, belong to the class of temporary internal faults and are intermittent. They are essentially permanent faults whose conditions of activation occur rarely or are not easily reproducible. Hence these faults result in transient failures, ie, failures which may not recur if the software is restarted. Some typical situations in which Heisenbugs might surface are boundaries between various software components, improper or insufficient exception handling and interdependent timing of various events. It is for this reason that Heisenbugs are extremely difficult to identify through testing. Most recent studies on failure data have reported that a large proportion of software failures are transient in nature caused by phenomena such as overloads or timing and exception errors. In this paper, we extend Gray\u2019s classification of software faults based on the phenomenon of software aging which has recently gained recognition and importance.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["443"]}

Specifying the relevent details of the system being modeled can require a tremendous number of states to be considered in excess of 100,000. Techniques must be developed to reduce the model to one that is computationally tractable, and then to solve the reduced model in a computationally efficient manner. Once the solution is obtained, it must be interpreted carefully. The errors introduced by the model reduction step and in the solutions must be bounded, and sensitivity of the solution with respect to input parameters should be estimated.

{"title": "Analysis of computer performance and reliability\n", "abstract": " The need for increased reliability and computing power coupled with advances in technology has given rise to sizeable and complex computer systems. The users and designers of such systems need tools to evaluate the effectiveness of such systems. Current approaches to reliability evaluation, performance evaluation, performability evaluation and optimisation of systems with multiple objectives are discussed. 28 references.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["443"]}
{"title": "Reliability validation of systems for life-critical applications\n", "abstract": " A framework is proposed which addresses traditional reliability validation approaches consisting of life testing techniques which are inapplicable for digital flight control systems. A specific validation methodology is identified based on logical proofs, analytical modeling, and experimental testing. Research activities required to support continued development of validation technology are identified, and the validation procedure is driven by the reliability model obtained from the system description. The analytical reliability model is shown to be a proper abstraction of the system under consideration, and a proof of correctness of system design and system scheduler performance is proposed.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["443"]}
{"title": "On a semaphore anamoly\n", "abstract": " \u201c&viously, we shah require for each monitor a Boolean semaphore \u201cnrutex\u201d to ensure that the bodies of the local procedures exclucle each other.

When a prp*\u20183 signals a condition on which another process is waiting, the signalli: lg process must wait until the resumt; d process permits It to proceed. We therefore introduce for each monitor a second semaphore \u201curge&\u2019(initialized to 0), on which signalling processes suspend themselves by the operation P (urga~ t). Before releasing exclusion, each process must test whether any other process is waiting on urgen;, and if so, must release it instead by a V (urgentj instruction.

{"title": "Uncertainty Analysis of Reliability of the JPL Remote Exploration and Experimentation System\n", "abstract": " In this paper we discuss a method for computing the uncertainty in model output metrics due to epistemic uncertainties in the model input parameters. This method makes use of Monte Carlo sampling and propagates the epistemic uncertainty in the model parameters, through the system dependability model. It acts as a wrapper to already existing models and their solution tools/techniques and has a wide range of applicability. Though it is a sampling based method, no simulation is carried out but analytic solution of the underlying stochastic model is performed for each set of input parameter values, sampled from their distributions. Statistical analysis of the output vector is then performed to obtain the distribution and con dence intervals of the model output metrics. We illustrate this method, by applying it to compute the distribution and con dence interval of the reliability of the NASA Remote Exploration and Experimentation system. We employ Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) procedure and evaluate the robustness of the output between LHS and random sampling procedures, for this example. km@ ee. duke. edu kst@ ee. duke. edu!

{"title": "Performance evaluation of Web Cache\n", "abstract": " Next we will consider an example of discrete event simulation implemented in CSIM. The example discusses the effect of Web caching on network planning in sense of determining the bandwidth of the access link interconnecting the ISP\u2019s subnet with the internet. This is studied by means of simulations [1]. The latency of a browser retrieving files is studied for given traffic characteristics, number of users, bandwidth of access link and cache hit ratio.We divide our study into two cases. In the first case we assume the arrival process to be Poisson and service times to be generally distributed. In the second case we assume that the arrival process is an ON-OFF process, with sojourn time in ON state being Weibull distributed and in OFF state being Pareto distributed. This model represents typical network infrastructure interconnecting a subnet with the internet. Browsers access the subnet via Modem, ISDN BRI, Ethernet or Token Ring. When a WWW browser clicks on a hyperlink, several URL requests may be sent from the browser to the web proxy which may be just one cache or a collection of caches. If the proxy has a copy of the requested file and is consistent with the original copy on the remote server, the proxy sends the copy to the browser. This is called a hit. If the proxy does not have a copy of the file that the browser is looking for, the proxy retrieves an original copy from the remote server, sends it to the browser and keeps a copy in the cache. This is called a miss. In this example we are interested in file delivering latency or mean response time, which is defined as the time interval from the browser clicking an object to the requested object being\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["443"]}
{"title": "On the use of Java to make Software Tools Accessible on the Web\n", "abstract": " Although the Web makes a large amount of information easy to access for a great number of users, it does not offer simple mechanisms to facilitate the use of a computation-oriented application on the Internet. The Java language developed by Sun Microsystems makes the development of such applications easier. In this paper we show how this technology can be used for creating a network computing platform for the Web sharing of applications which were not specifically devised for network use. The platform developed is also equipped with adequate security mechanisms which provide authentication services and, if required, encryption. The approach proposed has been applied to porting the Sharpe software package for performance, dependability and performability analysis of computer and communication systems onto the Web. A similar approach has been adopted in developing the tool WebSPN for the analysis of non-Markovian Stochastic Petri Nets.
