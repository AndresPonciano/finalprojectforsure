We describe the first edition of the \u201citaLIan Speech acT labEliNg\u201d(iLIS-TEN) task at the EVALITA 2018 campaign (Caselli et al., 2018). The task consists in automatically annotating dialogue turns with speech act labels, ie with the communicative intention of the speaker, such as statement, request for information, agreement, opinion expression, or general answer. The task is justified by the large number of applications that could benefit from automatic speech act annotation of natural language interactions such as tools for the intelligent information access, that is by relying on natural dialogues. We received two runs from two teams, one from academia and the other one from industry. In spite of the inherent complexity of the tasks, both systems largely outperformed the baseline.Italiano.

We present a qualitative analysis of the lexicon of Dialogue Acts: we explore the relationship between the communicative goal of an utterance and its affective content as well as the salience of specific word classes for each speech act.

These approaches are hardly applicable in bespoke software development, or in contexts in which one needs to gather information from specific users. In such cases, companies need to resort to face-to-face interviews to get feedback on their products. In this paper, we propose to utilize biometric data, in terms of physiological and voice features, to complement interviews with information about the engagement of the user on the discussed product-relevant topics. We evaluate our approach by interviewing users while gathering their physiological data (i.e., biofeedback) using an Empatica E4 wristband, and capturing their voice through the default audio-recorder of a common laptop. Our results show that we can predict users' engagement by training supervised machine learning algorithms on biometric data, and that voice features alone can be sufficiently effective. The performance of the prediction algorithms is maximised when pre-processing the training data with the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). The results of our work suggest that biofeedback and voice analysis can be used to facilitate prioritization of requirements oriented to product improvement, and to steer the interview based on users' engagement.
