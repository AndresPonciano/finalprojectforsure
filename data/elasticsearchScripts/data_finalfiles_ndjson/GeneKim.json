{"title": "A type-coherent, expressive representation as an initial step to language understanding\n", "abstract": " A growing interest in tasks involving language understanding by the NLP community has led to the need for effective semantic parsing and inference. Modern NLP systems use semantic representations that do not quite fulfill the nuanced needs for language understanding: adequately modeling language semantics, enabling general inferences, and being accurately recoverable. This document describes underspecified logical forms (ULF) for Episodic Logic (EL), which is an initial form for a semantic representation that balances these needs. ULFs fully resolve the semantic type structure while leaving issues such as quantifier scope, word sense, and anaphora unresolved; they provide a starting point for further resolution into EL, and enable certain structural inferences without further resolution. This document also presents preliminary results of creating a hand-annotated corpus of ULFs for the purpose of training a precise ULF parser, showing a three-person pairwise interannotator agreement of 0.88 on confident annotations. We hypothesize that a divide-and-conquer approach to semantic parsing starting with derivation of ULFs will lead to semantic analyses that do justice to subtle aspects of linguistic meaning, and will enable construction of more accurate semantic parsers.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["1932"]}

Fabric pressure sensors, as a part of e-textiles, have also received much interest from many researchers all over the world. However, most of the pressure sensors are made of electronic fibers and composed of many layers, including an intermediate layer for sensing the pressure. This paper proposes the model of a single layer pressure sensor with electrodes and conductive fibers intertwined. The plan dimensions of the fabricated sensors are 14 x 14 mm, and the thickness is 0.4 mm. The whole area of the sensor is the pressure-sensitive point. As expected, results demonstrate an electrical resistance change from 283 \u03a9 at the unload pressure to 158 \u03a9 at the load pressure. Besides, sensors have a fast response time (50 ms) and small hysteresis (5.5%). The hysteresis will increase according to the pressure and loading distance, but the change of sensor loading distance is very small. Moreover, the single-layer pressure sensors also show high durability under many working cycles (20,000 cycles) or washing times (50 times). The single-layer pressure sensor is very thin and more flexible than the multi-layer pressure sensor. The structure of this sensor is also expected to bring great benefits to wearable technology in the future. View Full-Text", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1932"]}

The semantic restrictions placed by ULF semantic types enables us to ensure that the inferred structures are semantically coherent while the nearness to syntax enables accurate mapping to English.

{"title": "High-fidelity lexical axiom construction from verb glosses\n", "abstract": " This paper presents a rule-based approach to constructing lexical axioms from Word-Net verb entries in an expressive semantic representation, Episodic Logic (EL). EL differs from other representations in being syntactically close to natural language and covering phenomena such as generalized quantification, modification, and intensionality while still allowing highly effective inference. The presented approach uses a novel preprocessing technique to improve parsing precision of coordinators and incorporates frames, hand-tagged word senses, and examples from WordNet to achieve highly consistent semantic interpretations. EL allows the full content of glosses to be incorporated into the formal lexical axioms, without sacrificing interpretive accuracy, or verb-to-verb inference accuracy on a standard test set.Evaluation of semantic parser performance is based on EL-match, introduced here as a generalization of the smatch metric for semantic structure accuracy. On gloss parses, the approach achieves an EL-match F1 score of 0.83, and a wholeaxiom F1 score of 0.45; verb entailment identification based on extracted axioms is competitive with the state-of-the-art.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1932"]}

For, in the whole DNA sequence, it is known that people have different DNAs only at SNP locations, and moreover, the total SNPs are less than 5 millions, finding an association between SNP variations and certain disease or trait is believed to be one of the essential steps not only for genetic researches but for drug design and discovery.

{"title": "DevOps distilled, Part 1: The three underlying principles\n", "abstract": " I've been studying high-performing IT organizations since 1999. After benchmarking over 1500 high-performing IT organizations, I found that they were 5 to 7 times more productive than their non-high-performing peers. This journey has taken me into the heart of the DevOps movement, which is undoubtedly one of the most exciting developments in the past 30 years in how IT organizations do their work.DevOps typically refers to the emerging professional movement that advocates a collaborative working relationship between development and IT operations. DevOps results in the fast flow of planned work (for example, high deploy rates) while simultaneously increasing the reliability, stability, resilience, and security of the production environment. Development and IT operations typically represent the value stream between the business (where requirements are defined) and the customer (where value is delivered).", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1932"]}

{"title": "Towards Natural Language Story Understanding with Rich Logical Schemas\n", "abstract": " Generating \u201ccommonsense\u2019\u2019knowledge for intelligent understanding and reasoning is a difficult, long-standing problem, whose scale challenges the capacity of any approach driven primarily by human input. Furthermore, approaches based on mining statistically repetitive patterns fail to produce the rich representations humans acquire, and fall far short of human efficiency in inducing knowledge from text. The idea of our approach to this problem is to provide a learning system with a \u201chead start\u201d consisting of a semantic parser, some basic ontological knowledge, and most importantly, a small set of very general schemas about the kinds of patterns of events (often purposive, causal, or socially conventional) that even a one-or two-year-old could reasonably be presumed to possess. We match these initial schemas to simple children\u2019s stories, obtaining concrete instances, and combining and abstracting these into new candidate schemas. Both the initial and generated schemas are specified using a rich, expressive logical form. While modern approaches to schema reasoning often only use slot-and-filler structures, this logical form allows us to specify complex relations and constraints over the slots. Though formal, the representations are language-like, and as such readily relatable to NL text. The agents, objects, and other roles in the schemas are represented by typed variables, and the event variables can be related through partial temporal ordering and causal relations. To match natural language stories with existing schemas, we first parse the stories into an underspecified variant of the logical form used by the schemas, which is suitable for\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1932"]}
