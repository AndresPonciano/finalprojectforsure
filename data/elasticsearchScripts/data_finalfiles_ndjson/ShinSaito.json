The intereferences caused by urinary components are not similar, as evidenced by the different absorption spectra exhibited by urea and uric acid when mixed with p-DAB. Alterations in the concentrations of p-DAB and chloramine T used did not eliminate the interferences observed. Recently, Dreux and Leymarie (7) described a procedure for total urinary hydroxyproline which involved addition of NaHS03. With NaHS03, at the concentration described, 6.0 gm/lO ml, the color of the p-DAB and also the color of the chromogen formed with p-DAB disappeared; lower concentrations of NaHSOs were tried and, when they no longer decreased color formation, gave responses similar to those with water.

To the best our knowledge, no large-scale datasets are available for ADMOS, although large-scale datasets have contributed to recent advancements in acoustic signal processing.

To build a large-scale dataset for ADMOS, we collected anomalous operating sounds of miniature machines (toys) by deliberately damaging them. The released dataset consists of three sub-datasets for machine-condition inspection, fault diagnosis of machines with geometrically fixed tasks, and fault diagnosis of machines with moving tasks. Each sub-dataset includes over 180 hours of normal machine-operating sounds and over 4,000 samples of anomalous sounds collected with four microphones at a 48-kHz sampling rate.

The goal of the unsupervised-ADS is to detect unknown anomalous sounds without training data of anomalous sounds.

To decrease the false positive rate (FPR), the AE is trained to minimize the reconstruction error of normal sounds, and the anomaly score is calculated as the reconstruction error of the observed sound. Unfortunately, since this training procedure does not take into account the anomaly score for anomalous sounds, the true positive rate (TPR) does not necessarily increase.

The age of the patients ranged from 7 months to 17 years with a median of 8 years. Ten of the 71 referred children were removed from the collection procedure because of failure to induce clinical remission (nine) or deteriorating chemotherapy-induced liver failure (one). A total of 215 aphereses were performed on a CS 3000 cell separator in 61 patients, including 18 children aged 4 years or less. The methylcellulose progenitor assay was used as an index of stem cell collection. A minimum of greater than or equal to 3 x 10 (5) colony-forming units-granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM)/kg body weight were collected in 31 of 71 children (44%) with a mean of 3.1 (range, 1-5) aphereses, and greater than or equal to 1 x 10 (5) CFU-GM/kg in 46 children (65%). The incidence of serious morbidity was low. When apheresis or chemotherapy was repeated, the progenitor yields decreased rapidly. By multivariate analysis, the age of the patients was the only significant predictor of CFU-GM yield (p= 0.009). In our experience with 12 children with acute leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, regimens containing high-dose cytarabine (2.0 g/m2 x 10) were effective for mobilization.

MRI demonstrated multiple central nervous system lesions in the suprasellar region, right temporal convexity, left frontal convexity, left cerebello-pontine angle and C5 level of the spinal cord. Preoperative neuro-imaging studies suggested multiple meningioma. Subtotal removal of the suprasellar lesion was performed, followed by gamma knife radiosurgery to the residual lesion and the other intracranial lesions. All intracranial lesions disappeared following gamma knife radiotherapy.

This process involves a variety of guard cell expressed ion channels and their complex regulation network. Inward K+ channels mainly function in stomatal opening. On the other hand, guard cell anion channels play a crucial role in the closing of stomata, which is vital in terms of preventing water loss and bacterial entrance. Massive progress has been made on the research of these anion channels in the last decade. In this review, we focus on the function and regulation of Arabidopsis guard cell anion channels. Starting from SLAC1, a main contributor of stomatal closure, members of SLAHs (SLAC1 homologues), AtNRTs (Nitrate transporters), AtALMTs (Aluminum-activated malate transporters), ABC transporters, AtCLCs (Chloride channels), DTXs (Detoxification efflux carriers), SULTRs (Sulfate transporters), and their regulator components are reviewed.

{"title": "Calcium-regulated phosphorylation systems controlling uptake and balance of plant nutrients\n", "abstract": " Essential elements taken up from the soil and distributed throughout the whole plant play diverse roles in different tissues. Cations and anions contribute to maintenance of intracellular osmolarity and the formation of membrane potential, while nitrate, ammonium and sulfate are incorporated into amino acids and other organic compounds. In contrast to these ion species, calcium concentrations are usually kept low in the cytosol and calcium displays unique behavior as a cytosolic signaling molecule. Various environmental stresses stimulate increases in the cytosolic calcium concentration, leading to activation of calcium-regulated protein kinases and downstream signaling pathways. In this review, we summarize the stress responsive regulation of nutrient uptake and balancing by two types of calcium-regulated phosphorylation systems: CPK and CBL-CIPK. CPK is a family of protein kinases activated by calcium. CBL is a group of calcium sensor proteins that interact with CIPK kinases, which phosphorylate their downstream targets. In Arabidopsis, quite a few ion transport systems are regulated by CPKs or CBL-CIPK complexes, including channels / transporters that mediate transport of potassium (KAT1, KAT2, GORK, AKT1, AKT2, HAK5, SPIK), sodium (SOS1), ammonium (AMT1;1, AMT1;2), nitrate and chloride (SLAC1, SLAH2, SLAH3, NRT1.1, NRT2.4, NRT2.5) and proton (AHA2, V-ATPase).

Endocrinological examination revealed hyperthyroidism with elevated TSH, GH and somatomedin C. Magnetic resonance images demonstrated a tumor in the sella turcica which extended into the left cavernous sinus, furthermore, indicated aneurysm-like flow void at the ventral part of the left internal carotid artery. The aneurysm was confirmed by conventional angiography. Neck clipping of the aneurysm was performed through pterional approach as the first operation. One month later, at the second operation, the pituitary adenoma except for cavernous sinus portion was resected via the transsphenoidal approach. Immunohistological examination revealed positive for TSH and GH.

The AE is trained to minimize the sample mean of the anomaly score of normal sounds in a mini-batch. One problem with this approach is that the anomaly score of rare-normal sounds becomes higher than that of frequent-normal sounds, because the sample mean is strongly affected by frequent- normal samples, resulting in preferentially decreasing the anomaly score of frequent-normal samples. To decrease anomaly scores for both frequent- and rare-normal sounds, we propose batch uniformization, a training method for unsupervised-ADS for minimizing a weighted average of the anomaly score on each sample in a mini-batch. We used the reciprocal of the probabilistic density of each sample as the weight, more intuitively, a large weight is given for rare-normal sounds.

{"title": "Engineering of a potent recombinant lectin-toxin fusion protein to eliminate human pluripotent stem cells\n", "abstract": " The use of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) such as human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) in regenerative medicine is hindered by their tumorigenic potential. Previously, we developed a recombinant lectin-toxin fusion protein of the hPSC-specific lectin rBC2LCN, which has a 23 kDa catalytic domain (domain III) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (rBC2LCN-PE23). This fusion protein could selectively eliminate hPSCs following its addition to the cell culture medium. Here we conjugated rBC2LCN lectin with a 38 kDa domain of exotoxin A containing domains Ib and II in addition to domain III (PE38). The developed rBC2LCN-PE38 fusion protein could eliminate 50% of 201B7 hPSCs at a concentration of 0.003 \u03bcg/mL (24 h incubation), representing an approximately 556-fold higher activity than rBC2LCN-PE23. Little or no effect on human fibroblasts, human mesenchymal stem cells, and hiPSC-derived hepatocytes was observed at concentrations lower than 1 \u03bcg/mL. Finally, we demonstrate that rBC2LCN-PE38 selectively eliminates hiPSCs from a mixed culture of hiPSCs and hiPSC-derived hepatocytes. Since rBC2LCN-PE38 can be prepared from soluble fractions of E. coli culture at a yield of 9 mg/L, rBC2LCN-PE38 represents a practical reagent to remove human pluripotent stem cells residing in cultured cells destined for transplantation.

OBJECTIVE: We identified 17 patients from 12 Japanese families with mutations in XIAP. The Glu349del mutation was observed in 3 patients, each from a different family. Interestingly, these patients exhibited dysgammaglobulinemia but not hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. We conducted an immunological study of patients carrying Glu349del and other mutations to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms of dysgammaglobulinemia in patients with mutations in the XIAP gene. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed an immunological study of 2 patients carrying the Glu349del mutation and 8 patients with other mutations. RESULTS: Flow cytometry showed that the percentage of memory B cells in patients with a mutation in XIAP was lower than that observed in the healthy controls. The patients with the Glu349del mutation had a lower percentage of memory B cells than those with other mutations. Ig production was reduced in patients with the Glu349del mutation. Increased susceptibility to apoptosis was observed in the patients with other mutations. Susceptibility to apoptosis was normal in patients with Glu349del.

A structural equation model with maximum likelihood estimation was performed to test the hypothesized path model. The fit indices indicated that the path model provided an acceptable fit. The results revealed that the influence of fashion magazine reading on the drive for thinness is mediated via thin-ideal internalization. Thus, heavier readers of fashion magazines were more likely to exhibit a greater drive for thinness via internalization of the thin ideal. The results were generally consistent with findings from previous studies conducted in other countries, confirming the cross-cultural importance of the process of thin-ideal internalization in the study of the drive for thinness among young women.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1815"]}

A comparison is undertaken with the UK airport industry, as some parallels can be drawn with this country around the 1990s when it went through a period of aviation liberalisation and privatisation of its airports. The findings suggest that private sector involvement in Japan has the potential to be successful, arguably as in the UK, and may help overcome certain problems facing Japanese airports, especially those associated with the funding system and lack of integrated airport management models. Financial problems at the airports, however, and especially the huge debt at Kansai, are likely to make it challenging to attract the private sector investors that are needed.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1815"]}

Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an intrinsic antiinflammatory peptide in immune diseases, originally identified as cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor. We examined the effect of hydrocortisone sodium succinate (HSS) on the production of IL-10 by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PBMCs from healthy volunteers and cancer-burden patients were preincubated separately with or without HSS for 1 h, then stimulated with 5 microg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Production of IL-10 by human PBMCs was detected with LPS stimulation and its production was higher in cancer-burden patients than in normal volunteers, although this was not statistically significant. HSS suppressed production of IL-10 by LPS-stimulated PBMCs in a dose-dependent manner both in normal volunteers and in cancer-burden patients.

At the low ramping rate below 10\u00b0C/sec, high leakage current above 1 nA was observed , which was caused by the extension of dislocations to the surface. On the other hand, by increasing the ramping rate above 50\u00b0C/sec, dislocations were formed around the Rp, but they did not extended to the surface and as a result, low leakage current was obtained.

Al intermetallic compound layer on a carbon steel surface, an atmospheric-controlled induction heating fine particle peening (AIH-FPP) treatment was performed at 1000 C in argon atmosphere. The shot particles were prepared by a mechanical milling method. Titanium and aluminum particles at molar ratios of one to three were mechanically milled by a planetary ball mill for 6 h. The treated surface was analyzed using a scanning electron microscope, an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer and X-ray diffraction. The reciprocating dry wear tests were performed under the following conditions; an opposing material of alumina balls of 3 mm in diameter, a load of 2.0 N, a sliding speed of 600 mm/min and a sliding distance of 224 m. The results showed that a Ti-Al intermetallic compound layer consisting mainly of TiAl3 formed on the surface of carbon steel by AIH-FPP treatment. This was because the shot particles were transferred to the substrate and the aluminum and titanium in the particles reacted neither excessively nor insufficiently. The AIH-FPP treated surface showed a higher wear resistance than that of the un-treated surface. This was because the wear mode of carbon steel changed from abrasive wear to adhesive wear owing to the formation of the Ti-Al intermetallic compound layer on the surface.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1815"]}

The treated surface was analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX), and an X-ray diffraction (XRD). Oxidation tests were carried out at 900 C for 100 hours. Results showed that the Ni-Al intermetallic compound layer with a thickness of 200 mm was formed in the case of the specimen treated by the aluminum rich shot particles; the ratio of Ni to Al was 1 to 4 (mol). This was because (i) melted aluminum particles decreased the melting point of nickel particles and the steel substrate, and (ii) partially melted area promoted a combustion synthesis reaction between nickel and aluminum, resulting in forming the Ni-Al intermetallic compound layer. The AIH-FPP treated surface showed a higher oxidation resistance than that of the un-treated specimen.

{"title": "All-in-One Tube Method for Quantitative Gene Expression Analysis in Oligo-dT30 Immobilized PCR Tube Coated with MPC Polymer\n", "abstract": " Reverse transcription (RT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been widely used to assess the expression of specific genes in cells and tissues. RT-PCR involves several steps including mRNA preparation, complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis by reverse transcription, and finally cDNA amplification by PCR. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) in combination with reverse transcription (RT-Q-PCR), one of the most useful technologies for detecting transcriptional mRNA from cells, tissues and whole blood, is widely used by many basic research and medical institutions. However, in many cases, total RNA or mRNA must first be purified from a sample suspended in lysis buffer. The reliability of these measurements depends on the accuracy of each step, including preparation and recovery of total RNA, reverse transcription of mRNA into cDNA, and quantitative specific amplification of all target genes. As the optimizing of each of these steps is important, the number of tube-to-tube transfers should be minimized in order to avoid loss of templates and decrease the risk of contamination. 1 Contamination can occur due to environmental RNases or material carried over from sample to sample, as well as previously generated amplicons present on laboratory equipment. What is desirable is the sequential performance of several steps in an all-in-one tube, especially when starting with a small number of target mRNA molecules, such as a few virus particles. 2\u20135 An important limiting factor for the routine application of expression analyses is related to the method for preparing total RNA or mRNA from large numbers of samples\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1815"]}

{"title": "Two-stage calving prediction system: Exploiting state-based information relevant to calving signs in japanese black beef cows\n", "abstract": " A two-stage calving sign detection system is proposed to effectively use state information on the calving behavior of Japanese black beef cows (eg standing or sitting, tail raising). Automatic calving sign detection from cameras can help livestock farmers prevent fatal accidents to calves during calving. The following requirements were identified for such camera-based detection systems: 1) ability to work with a small volume of data (because calving events are not very frequent), 2) robustness to changing environments, and 3) ability to explain the reasons for the prediction results. However, these requirements are not realistic for end-to-end approaches such as the predictions using a single deep neural network (DNN). This study presents a two-stage calving prediction system, in which calving-relevant information obtained using a DNN-based feature extractor is used as the input for another DNN-based calving sign detector. The first-stage DNN extracts discriminative features of typical pre-calving behaviour in cows, such as increased lying time and tail raising. The former DNN is expected to achieve accurate feature extraction and to enable training of the latter DNN using small-scale data. Furthermore, the states observable from the video frames, which are outputs of the former DNN, can make use of the crowdsourcing for sustainable growth; moreover, these states can also provide the basis for the accurate prediction of calving. Experimental comparisons conducted using video scenes of five cows during the normal and pre-calving states demonstrated that the proposed system achieved a calving precision rate of 81% and a calving recall rate of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1815"]}

In our previous study, we used a low-density parity-check (LDPC) block code scheme and proposed a decoding method that uses the channel response of a dual polarized MIMO transmission to further improve the bit error ratio (BER) performance [3]. LDPC block codes are robust forward error correction (FEC) codes and are Shannon-limit-approaching over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Despite this feature, there is still room for improving the BER performance. In this paper, we propose spatially coupled (SC-) LDPC codes to further improve the BER performance.

The verification checks timed-functional constraints as behavioral specification with the system's execution traces. Most of embedded/real-time system models consist of discrete behaviors of system controllers and continuous behaviors of mechanical/electronical systems. Therefore, the verification of discrete system behaviors using a static analysis technology like a model checking is inadequate for the verification of system overall behaviors, so that dynamic verification technologies are needed for developing embedded/real-time systems. Our verification method is effective for check satisfiability of non-functional requirements in early phase of development, e. g. performance requirements.

This study was carried out at ZF-2 Tropical Forestry Experimental Station of the National Institute for Research in the Amazon (INPA). Inventories of woody plants were conducted on three size classes: canopy trees (diarneter at breast height (dbh) L 10 cm), sub-canopy trees (dbh< 10 cm, height> 1.5 m) and seedlings (height< 1.5 m). A total of 393 tree species were recorded; this diversity is much higher than in any other neo-tropical rainforests. In the canopy, the following botanical families are dominant: Sapotaceae, Lauraceae and three Leguminosae (Mimosaceae, Fabaceae and Caesalpiniaceae), with individual-rich families being Lecythidaceae and Sapotaceae. Individual-rich families differed between two topographically different areas (\" Plateau\" and depression called\" Baixio\"). The Plateau had higher individual-richness of Lecythidaceae and Burseraceae, whereas the Baixio hed higher individual-richness of Euphorbiaceae and Myristicaceae. Individual-rich families in the sub-canopy and seedling classes were different from those in the canopy. In the sub-canopy, Rubiaceae and Dichapetalaceae in the Plateau and Monimiaceae and Violaceae in the Baixio were the richest families although they showed low individualrichness in the canopy. Violaceae in the Plateau and Elaeocarpaceae in the Baixio showed high individual-richness among the seedlings.

Significance of 20 minute resting blood pressure measurement comparing to 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure\u00a0\u2026\n", "abstract": " Determination of the blood pressure (BP) level in patients with mild hypertension (MHT) is quite difficult, since ulcerations of BP are tremendously exaggerated in the doctor's office. It has been well known that casual BP is less reliable to estimate LVH than BPs obtained at home or work-site. Although 24 hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) has been widely accepted to overcome this problems, it is still controversial whether this method is applicable to all hypertensive subjects with special regards to its cost and effect. Therefore, our study has dealt mainly with the development of more convenient and less expensive method to get reasonable BPs. Twenty two nonmedicated patients with MHT were selected for the study. After taking casual BP in the office, the resting 20 minute BP measurements at every 2 minute interval were performed with Dynamap 950. Ten BP values thus obtained were divided into two categorical phases; early and late. The mean systolic and diastolic pressures (Ps & Pd) in the early phase were significantly higher than those in the late phase. Beside mean Ps and Pd obtained from 24 hour ABPM, 4 categorical phases based on the time of a day were defined; morning (from awaking to noon), afternoon (from noon to 6 pm), evening (from 6 pm to bed time) and night (during sleeping). Mutual correlation coefficients of these categorical BPs were calculated and compared to identify reasonably high significant correlations. The results revealed the highest BP at the office and the lowest one during sleeping. The office BPs closely resembled to the ones during afternoon period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1815"]}

Calving prediction is key for preventing fatal accidents such as stillbirth and dystocia. Such a prediction has been performed using contact sensors to capture a cow\u2019s typical movements before calving. However, directly attaching sensors to a cow\u2019s body is not desirable from the viewpoint of animal welfare, economic load, and safety for livestock farmers. This paper presents a camera-based, noncontact calving prediction system that captures typical precalving movements such as rotations, turns and step-backs. The information on the frequency of such behaviours and that on the frequency of changes in the behaviours are extracted every few minutes using deep neural networks and used as inputs to a calving predictor based on support vector machines. Experimental comparisons conducted using the videos of four Japanese black beef cows of normal and precalving statuses demonstrated that the system developed with five cows\u2019 videos achieved a precision rate of 97% and a recall rate of 82% for a cow that was active before calving.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1815"]}

Among 612 BCF data recently released by National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (NITE), the values for the chemicals with a molecular weight of less than 600 and the 1-octanol/water partition coefficient (log P ) of less than six were extracted and analyzed. By applying theoretically derived model equation, a good relationship between these BCF and each Fujita's  i:  o was established. Statistical analyses and model validations revealed that the estimations of our approach were very excellent.

{"title": "Non-precharged bit-line sensing scheme for high-speed low-power DRAMs\n", "abstract": " Various proposals have been made and implemented for improving the bandwidth of the DRAM Input/Output interface. However, random access speed, which has limited DRAM total performance, has not been improved enough. Some proposals have been made to improve it, such as over-driving the power supply voltage for sense amplifiers, and amplifying the signal on bit-lines. These schemes, however, have suffered from increased power dissipation. This paper proposes a Non-Precharged Bit-line Sensing (NPBS) scheme in which data access is performed without precharging bit-lines. This realizes both an improvement of random access speed and a reduction of power dissipation. Also, we propose a power reduction scheme for the memory system named Initial Same Data Write (ISDW). In combination with the NPBS, the power is effectively reduced when part of a memory system is not used.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1815"]}

Therefore, the presentation of neuroblastoma is miscellaneous and depends on the local involvement of structures by the primary tumor as well as the effects of metastasis. This tumor is usually detected as an abdominal mass because the most common site of primary neuroblastoma is the abdomen, including the adrenal gland [1]. It also manifests as Horner\u2019s syndrome due to involvement of the stellate ganglion in the neck,\u201craccoon eyes\u201d resulting from metastasis to the orbits, hepatomegaly with subcutaneous skin nodules characteristic of stage 4S, or generalized symptoms such as weight loss resulting from disseminated disease [1\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1815"]}

However, radical perineal prostatectomy has some advantages with regard to operative complications. Here I evaluate 200 cases for which the perineal approach was used in the past 12 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2000 to 2012, radical perineal prostatectomies were performed for 200 patients and their operative complications were evaluated. The mean age of the patients was 68.5 years, with a PSA of 9.4 ng/ml, and Gleason score of 6.9. Their clinical stages were T1 in 168 cases (84.0%), T2 in 26 (13.0%) and T3 in 6 (3.0%). RESULTS: Mean operative time was 85 minutes, and estimated blood loss was 220.0 ml. The median time for urethral catheter indwelling was 7 days, and the admission term was 14 days. Operations were performed safely in patients with a BMI of more than 30 kg/m2. Lymphadenectomies from the same incision were performed in 20 cases and there were no lymph node metastases. Rectal injuries occurred in 7 cases (3.5%) with 100 cases of Blet's approach so I changed to Young's approach. With Young's approach I have not experienced any rectal injuries. Wound infection occurred in 4 cases (2.0%), hematoma in 2 (1.0%), anastomotic stricture in 1 (0.5%), inguinal hernia in 1 (0.5%), and transient lower extremity neurapraxia in 1 (0.5%). Postperineal pain after operation was tolerated using a donut cushion, though some pain relievers were needed in 20 cases (10.0%).

{"title": "Subsurface geology at the Lake Mikata and Nakayama lowlands, Fukui Prefecture, central Japan. Implications on the late pleistocene activity for the Mikata fault zone\n", "abstract": " The Lake Mikata and Nakayama lowlands are situated along the central coast of Wakasa Bay, at the center of the Japan Sea side of Honshu Island, and fringed by the Mikata fault zone at the east side. The 1662 Kanbun Great Earthquake (estimated magnitude of 7.2 to 7.6) occurred there with vertical crustal movements up to 3 to 4 meters. Submerged topography with thick alluvial deposits in the lowlands might have been caused by Late Quaternary crustal movements of the Mikata fault zone. We analyzed the subsurface geology of the lowlands using many drilling cores recently obtained for scientific purpose such as the 60-m long MK09 core and highway construction (represented by NEXCO core). The main results are summarized below. (1) Subsurface geology beneath the eastern basin and eastern coast of Lake Mikata is clarified by detailed investigations of many drilling cores up to 100 m deep including the NEXCO core. Many radiocarbon ({sup 14}C) dating and tephrochronological correlations have elucidated the standard chronostratigraphy during the Late Quaternary in this area. At least 100-m thick sediments have deposited continuously for about 130 kyr, recording climatic and seismic events etc. during the last glacial period. (2) The MK09 core is composed of a repeated coarsening-upward sequence with rapid facies changes at unit boundaries. We infer that these units reflect the rapid rise of a relative level of a paleo-lake and subsequent progradation of alluvial fans. The mean interval of individual units is estimated to be about 7.7 kyr from the sedimentary age of each unit, and is considered to be an upper limit of the recurrence\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1815"]}

Significant wave height was more than 10m and rapid landward migration of the sand spit of the Tenryu river mouth was observed. Based on X-band radar image analysis, spatial and temporal changes of overtopping waves and corresponding sediment flux across the sand spit were revealed. Spatial concentration of the sediment flux can be explained by the nonlinear relationship between wave height of overtopping waves and corresponding sediment fluxes. A sediment flux model was developed based on the relationship. Maximum flux was estimated by the model to be 51 m3/m/hour. It happened when high waves and high tide were observed simultaneously.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1815"]}

The user inputs the contours of the shape to paint. The system first estimates automatically the optimal trajectory of the brush, and then renders the shape into Oriental ink painting style by direct brush texture mapping. We formulate the problem of optimal brush trajectory estimation as the minimization of an energy function. This energy function depends on the attributes of motion inertia of a brush, such as the variations in rotation, size, and angular velocity of the brush along a trajectory. Experiments on complex shapes show that our algorithm is able to generate smooth and natural looking oriental brush strokes.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1815"]}

It is applied to polyphonic music signal to extract fundamental frequencies, to produce a pianoroll-like display, and to convert the saound into MIDI data. In contrast with cepstrum which is the inverse Fourier transform of log-scaled power spectrum with linear frequency, specmurt is defined as the inverse Fourier transform of linear power spectrum with log-scaled frequency. If all tones in a polyphonic sound have a common harmonic pattern, it can be regarded as a sum of frequency-stretched common harmonic structure. In the log-frequency domain, it is formulated as the convolution of distribution density of fundamental frequencies of multiple tones and the common harmonic structure. The fundamental frequency distribution can be found by deconvolution, ie, by division in the specmurt domain.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1815"]}
{"title": "Press Coverage and Awareness of Gender-equality Issues in Japan\n", "abstract": " It is often argued that Japan is still a more male-dominated society in many respects than other industrial countries, like the US, although the situation has gradually improved in recent years. Various policies have been implemented to achieve a gender-equal society since the International Women's Year in 1975,'with some success. As numerous data indicate, however, equality of the sexes has not been achieved. The Gender Equality Bureau of the Cabinet Office defines a gender-equal society as\" a society in which both men and women, as equal members, have the opportunity to participate in all kinds of social activities at will, equally enjoy political, economical and cultural benefits, and share responsibilities\"(http://www. gender. go. jp/sorciaLe. html). In this sense, inequality between women and men still exists in many domains. In the home, a division of labor based on gender still prevails. The combination of the husband as the economic provider and the wife as housekeeper is still found in more than one third of all Japanese households, although the proportion is decreasing. When both the husband and wife do housework, the husband spends only 26 minutes a day, while the wife works for 3 hours and 18 minutes (Inoue & Ehara, 2001).In the labor market, the percentage of female workers has been around 40% for the past decade. According to the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare, however, in the year 2000, nearly half of the female workers were part-time (54% were full-time), while about 88% of male workers were full-time.

In the test, the colliery gas naturally flowing from the seated shafts of closed Akabira Mine was used for combustion. On-site tests were conducted to examine the possibility to sequestrate CO{sub 2} onto coal seams by injecting directly exhaust gas from combustion into the old mine and to reuse the substituted CH{sub 4}. Results show that the higher rate of sequestration to coal can be obtained when lower concentration of CO{sub 2} is injected. This indicates a possibility that CO{sub 2} can be efficiently adsorbed to coal beds because the CO{sub 2} concentration of the gas emitted from a power generator would not be 100% in commercialization of a CO{sub 2}-cycle power generation system at a closed coal mine. Comparison of a mixed gas of 30% CO{sub 2}, and air with a mixed gas of 30% CO{sub 2} and N{sub 2} shows that there is hardly any difference in terms of CH{sub 4}, substitution rate and CO{sub 2} sequestration rate. Therefore, it can be considered that the difference of air and N{sub 2} will not have any effect. The experiment setup using crushed coal samples cannot represent the actual situation of residual coal seams at the closed mine. The CO{sub 2} concentration of exhaust gas from a power generator will also be lower than those of the mixed gases used in the experiments.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1815"]}

Fifteen patients received MESNA (group A) and 25 did not (group B), and all received concomitant hyperhydration (3,000 ml/m2/day). No renal dysfunction or toxicity attributed to the use of MESNA was observed in either group of patients. Transient hemorrhagic cystitis developed in one of the 15 group A (6.7%) and 3 of 25 (12.0%) group B patients but there was no statistical significance.

In a minimum follow-up of 3 mo, there were 14 cases with VZV; 12 patients were treated with intravenous acyclovir and 2 patients received additional intravenous VZV hyperimmune immunoglobulin preparations. History of previous varicella-zoster at some time before PBSCT was the only significant risk factor for the development of VZV. Furthermore, a significant association between VZV and higher disease-free survival rate after PBSCT was proved. Development of minor and reversible VZV is rather common event after high-dose chemotherapy without TBI and PBSCT. VZV appears to be one of the factors which reflects basic physiologic mechanism preventing relapse of leukemias or NHL after PBSCT.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1815"]}

{"title": "New Rational in Approaches for Structure\u2212 Activity Relationships and Drug Design\n", "abstract": " Drug development has been achieved by repeated efforts of chemical syntheses and evaluations, improving the pharmacological activity of a lead compound by sys-tematic modification of the structures. As the difficulties in synthesizing com-pounds have decreased by technical advances in organic chemistry, efficient design of bioactive molecules has become increasingly important. Although starting from an appropriate lead compound is most important for success, we cannot at present choose it as we would like. Most of the lead compounds developed so far have not been designed rationally, rather they have been discovered by screening natural and synthetic compounds with in vivo or in vitro assays. It has been desirable for a long time to establish a principle for designing lead compounds logically, without relying on chance, and trial and error. In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in fields related to biological macromolecules. There is now a lot of knowledge on drug receptors that has brought a lot of wide possibilites for rational drug design. This knowledge can be used for analysing structure-activity relationships (SARs) and for designing new structures with improved activities. But even when the 3-D structure of the receptor is known in detail, great effort is still required to obtain new lead compounds because a general principle for lead generation has not yet been established. Computers and computer graphics have become important tools in rational drug design. They can make up for human ability in manipulating and quantitizing 3-D structures, properties and interactions of molecules.

Out of 1,200 hysterosalpingographies, 188 (15.7%) congenital uterine anomalies were detected and the degree of each uterine cavity deformity was evaluated by the X/M ratio. Metroplasty was performed on 71 women with no other causes of spontaneous abortion, and more than 84% of the post-operative pregnancy were successfully maintained. One hundred and four (n= 104, 5.5%) out of 949 couples with a high incidence of reproductive failure had either a chromosomal abnormality or normal variants in the wife and/or husband. Twelve cases (n= 12, 8.1%) had a positive analysis for anticardiolipin antibody among 148 women examined. Immunotherapy utilizing the husband's lymphocytes was indicated for four hundred and seventy three (n= 473) other couples with no other abnormalities likely to induce spontaneous abortions. This treatment brought approximately 80% of pregnancies to successful termination and 199 deliveries were recorded with this immunotherapy. The present study suggests that the causes of early pregnancy failure are complex, but that most of the causes of repetitive wastage are curable after exact diagnosis and appropriate treatment.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1815"]}

In normal subjects, the plasma GHRH concentration was increased from the basal value of 9.8+/-1.4 pg/ml (mean+/-SE) to 34.8+/-3.1 pg/ml at 30 approximately 90 min after oral administration of 500 mg L-dopa, followed by a rise of GH release (plasma GH level from less than 1 ng/ml to 21.7+/-4.7 ng/ml) in most cases, indicating that L-dopa stimulates GH secretion via hypothalamic GHRH. On L-dopa administration, no apparent increases in both plasma GHRH and GH concentrations were observed in patients with hypothalamic hypopituitarism, whereas GHRH administration induced almost normal GH response. In patients with acromegaly, the plasma levels of GHRH remained stationary after the L-dopa administration and did not correlate with plasma GH levels. In subjects with simple obesity, the responses of plasma GHRH (peak 13.2+/-1.2 pg/ml) and GH (peak 4.3+/-1.7 ng/ml) to L-dopa were significantly lower than those in normal subjects (p less than 0.01). In patients with primary hypothyroidism, peak levels of plasma GHRH (12.6+/-1.3 pg/ml) and GH (2.4+/-0.6 ng/ml) were significantly lower than those in normal subjects (p less than 0.01). In patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), the responses of GHRH and GH were divided into 2 groups; in the responder the peak values of GHRH and GH were 19.4+/-8.6 pg/ml and 12.2+/-1.4 ng/ml\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1815"]}

{"title": "Characterization of immune complexes in normal pregnancies\n", "abstract": " There are many reports on the immune complexes in normal pregnancies. Nevertheless, even the presence of immune complexes in normal pregnancies have not been clarified, and the immune complexes have not been clearly characterized. So, in this report, I try to make clear whether immune complexes are present in normal pregnancies or not, and then to analyze the immune complexes in normal pregnancies. The results are as follows: The immune complex (IC) levels measured by the C1q binding test rose in first trimester, and dropped to the normal range in the second and third trimesters. The IgG-IC levels increased in the first trimester and decreased to the normal range in the second and third trimesters, but the IgM-IC levels were not changed during normal pregnancies in the solid phase anti C3 radioimmunoassay. The ICs in normal pregnancies were analyzed using gel filtration. IgG-ICs were detected in the first trimester and the third trimester of normal pregnancies, and the molecular weights were about 290,000. IgG-ICs were separated from another immunoglobulin class IC using a DEAE-affigel blue column. ICs in normal pregnancies were mainly IgG-IC and there were only a few IgM-ICs in normal pregnancies. IgG-ICs were present in normal pregnancies, but neither the classical pathway nor the alternative pathway of the complement system was found to be activated by the two-dimensional electroimmunodiffusion method using anti C3 and C1s. So, IgG-IC in normal pregnancies did not seem to be pathological.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1815"]}

{"title": "Impact of tritium Discharged from a Research Reactor on Concentrations in Environmental Water Samples\n", "abstract": " The distribution of environmental tritium concentrations in several samples taken near the Kyoto University Research Reactor (KURR) was studied. The KURR Institute (KURRI) supports three major sources of tritium: a D 2 0 (heavy water) facility and a Cold Neutron Source (CNS) facility in the KURR containment, and a tritium target fabricated in an accelerator in the critical assembly building. This report focuses on estimating the rate of release of tritium from these sources into the environment, and grasping the relation between the rate and the concentrations in samples of water such as precipitation, air moisture and surface water taken near the release point. The concentrations of tritiated water (HTO) in the stack exhaust condensate were in the range 0.8-3 kBq dm\" 3 though those in air in the buildings that support the HTO sources ranged from 5 Bq dm\" 3 to 2 kBq dm\" 3. The HTO concentrations in the air decreased by ca. 1/500 within 300m of the KURR stack, which is five times the current global level about 5 km off-site.

As for media exposure, political opinion leaders tended to watch news and information programs on television and to read newspapers for a longer time. However, no significant difference was observed in terms of the amount of the Internet use among the three categories. Responses to the question regarding the medium from which respondents usually obtained information about politics (multiple choice) indicated that television news was the most chosen political information source for all three categories (opinion leaders 82.6%, opinion receivers 85.2%, and non-discussants 68.0%). Newspapers were the second most chosen information source, and news sites on the Internet ranked third (Table 1). The study also indicated that political opinion leaders were more likely than non-leaders to rely on the Internet to obtain information about politics. For example, 13.9% of the opinion leaders chose websites of political parties or politicians as media for information about politics, while the corresponding figures for the non-leaders were much smaller (4.6% of the opinion receivers and 2.0% of the non-discussants; \u03c72= 24.24, p<. 001). Similarly, 12.5% of the opinion leaders said that they used large-scale bulletin boards to acquire political information, but only 6.6% of the opinion receivers and 3.2% of the non-discussants chose this medium (\u03c72= 12.58, p<. 01).Less than 10% of the respondents used\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1815"]}
