{"title": "SuanMing: Explainable Prediction of Performance Degradations in Microservice Applications\n", "abstract": " Application performance management (APM) tools are useful to observe the performance properties of an application during production. However, APM is normally purely reactive, that is, it can only report about current or past performance degradation. Although some approaches capable of predictive application monitoring have been proposed, they can only report a predicted degradation but cannot explain its root-cause, making it hard to prevent the expected degradation.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["742"]}
