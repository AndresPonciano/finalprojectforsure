We therefore argue that modeling languages, in particular SysML, need to be semantically extended to adequately model the problem space. We demonstrate with a specific example that simply flagging model elements as requirements is not effective to model the problem space. In fact, we show that such an approach produces a deficient definition of the problem space, since it inherently discards solutions that could otherwise be potentially acceptable to solve the problem that is being addressed.

However, many real-world decision-making problems require a broader range of problem-solving strategies, including information seeking, extrapolation of a decision\u2019s consequences, and compromise between parties with competing objectives. Accordingly, this paper describes a simulation game activity designed to offer industrial engineering seniors experience in solving realistic decision-making problems. The simulation game involved students working in teams that role-played as different types of companies in a global smartphone market, where teams needed to negotiate with one another to establish profitable contracts within the game\u2019s ruleset. In accordance with our learning objectives, we qualitatively examined how students sought information, adapted to changing conditions, and made decisions informed by constraints. Particularly, we sought to identify learning frameworks that fit the data well and would help us improve the design and assessment of the activity in later iterations. We found that the learning frameworks of metacognition and discrepancy resolution combined to explain most student activity relative to our learning objectives, and these frameworks suggest several points of improvement for the design and assessment of the simulation game.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1413"]}
{"title": "Integrating design and verification decisions in value-driven design to increase system's expected value\n", "abstract": " Design and verification are conceived in current practice and research as two sequential decisions or optimization efforts. In the first one, a design is optimized (or chosen) by maximizing the expected value to a set of stakeholders, which is a function of its characteristics, and the preferences of the stakeholders. In the second one, a verification strategy is optimized (or chosen) for the selected design by maximizing its own expected value, which is a function of the development uncertainty it reduces, the cost and time it requires, its effects on the system\u2019s characteristics, and the risk preferences of the stakeholders. This paper asserts that because verification activities modify the uncertainty associated to the characteristics of a system and consume its development resources, they actually influence the expected value of the system. Consequently, this paper proposes that design and verification decisions should be taken concurrently instead of sequentially in order to increase the expected value a system; pushing thus further the notion that verification should inform the design of a system with respect to embedding elements that enable and ease verification. Contributing to the scientific foundations of systems engineering, the paper mathematically proves that optimizing a verification strategy for a pre-optimized, baseline design can yield suboptimal results, in terms of system expected value, when compared against that obtained by concurrently optimizing design and verification. Using value-driven design as an underlying framework, the implications of this analytical finding are then showcased by a comparative analysis in which a notional system\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1413"]}

Through verification, engineers gain confidence in the correct functionality of the system before it is deployed into operation. Traditionally, verification strategies are fixed at the beginning of the system's development and verification activities are executed as the development progresses. Such an approach appears to give inferior results as the selection of the verification activities does not leverage information gained through the system's development process. In contrast, a set-based design approach to verification, where verification activities are dynamically selected as the system's development progresses, has been shown to provide superior results. However, its application under realistic engineering scenarios remains unproven due to the large size of the verification tradespace. In this work, we propose a parallel tempering approach (PTA) to efficiently explore the verification tradespace. First, we formulate exploration of the verification tradespace as a tree search problem.

Yet, requirement gaps are common in the development of space systems. If lucky, those gaps are identified (and costly corrected) before the space system is deployed. Otherwise, those gaps reduce the success of the space mission as the system becomes operational. Unfortunately, the completeness of a set of requirements cannot be demonstrated; rather, completeness is a pursuit. Hence, the level of comprehensiveness of a set of requirements that can be attained is heavily driven by the engineer or team put to the task of defining the problem space. In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept of a virtual systems\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1413"]}
{"title": "Efficient population of the verification tradespace using Bayesian inference\n", "abstract": " This article presents a process to efficiently elicit belief models of verification strategies in the context of applying tradespace exploration to the design of verification strategies. The need for efficiency is at the core of tradespace exploration, where a large region of the solution space needs to be explored before anchoring to a specific solution or solution set. In conceptual design and systems architecture, solutions are modeled by leveraging independent models that are connected by an overarching model. In designing verification strategies, however, verification activities cannot be modeled independently of the overall strategy in which they are used. As a result, probabilities associated with the confidence generated by each verification activity, need to be elicited for each candidate verification strategy individually. This requires, in principle, to generate a specific model for each solution in the solution space, which\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1413"]}
{"title": "Automatic Generation of Contractual Requirements From MBSE Artifacts\n", "abstract": " This paper is intended to disseminate initial outcomes of the NPS Research Acquisition Program Automatic Generation of Contractual Requirements from MBSE Artifacts project. The research addresses the automatic generation of contractual requirements in textual form from models in a Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) environment, enabling the transition from document-centric systems engineering to MBSE in acquisition programs. Textual requirements form the backbone of contracting in acquisition programs. Requirements define the problem boundaries within which contractors try to find acceptable solutions (design systems). At the same time, requirements are the criteria by which a customer measures the extent to which their contract has been fulfilled by the contractor. However, latent problems exist in acquisition programs stemming from poor practices in requirements engineering. Research suggests that transitioning to model-based requirements can be effective in coping with such challenges. We presented in prior work a framework to construct true model-based requirements within the context of the Systems Modeling Language (SysML). This research addresses the main question of whether contractual requirements in textual form can be automatically generated from those requirement models without loss of information or intent. We present in this paper an initial template of requirements and a process to support this goal.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1413"]}
