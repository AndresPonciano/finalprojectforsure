Departing from the use of the Non-Functional Requirements Framework we propose a process, based on Personal Construct Theory, to perform early analysis of antagonistic design issues.

As a consequence, stakeholders are demanding more flexible and complex software to be built. To handle this complexity, conceptual models have to describe aspects beyond entities and activities. Recent research has pointed out that dealing with goals in order to capture intentions associated with complex situations is a major aspect to handle this new reality [14]. Non-Functional Requirements are a particular class of these goals that has to be dealt with since the early stages of software development. Therefore, expressing these NFRs in use cases and scenarios models is a must. In this work we show a strategy to drive elicited NFR towards use cases and scenarios that reflect the functional requirements of the software.

{"title": "Nfrfinder: a knowledge based strategy for mining non-functional requirements\n", "abstract": " A challenge in requirements elicitation is to identify quality requirements, ie non-functional requirements (hereafter, NFR). In general, stakeholders need NFRs, but these requirements are not always explicit, they can be part of the tacit knowledge. The usual strategy adopted by requirements engineers to elicit NFRs is to act proactively by asking stakeholders their interests in qualities based on lists or catalogs. NFRFinder is a semi-automated process strategy for mining keywords. The strategy uses the keywords to find possible NFRs in unstructured texts, eg the meeting minutes that occur during an elicitation task. The strategy relies on catalogs, according to the NFR Framework, as a supporting knowledge base. However, to gain more confidence on the NFRFinder, we have applied it to a set of structured texts. We report on the recall and precision of NFRFinder using a gold standard built from different actors, for\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1459"]}

{"title": "Perspectives on Software Requirements\n", "abstract": " Requirements engineering is a field of knowledge concerned with the systematic process of eliciting, analyzing and modeling requirements. Requirements engineering is usually understood in relation to software system requirements, most of its principles and some of its techniques can be adapted to other problems dealing with complex sets of requirements. The engineering vision indicates that this should be a practical and well-defined process where trade-offs have to be considered to obtain the best results. Mature software development needs mature requirements engineering. This was true ten years ago when requirements engineering became an important component of the software development process. It remains true today when the pressure to deliver code on time and on budget is increasing, and the demand for higher quality software also increases. Perspectives On Software Requirements presents perspectives on several current approaches to software requirements. Each chapter addresses a specific problem where the authors summarize their experiences and results to produce well-fit and traceable requirements. Chapters highlight familiar issues with recent results and experiences, which are accompanied by chapters describing well-tuned new methods for specific domains. Perspectives On Software Requirements is designed for a professional audience, composed of researchers and practitioners in industry.

After the first publication of ERi* c, in March/2008, the method has received several changes in order to mitigate the complexity of tasks and artifacts. ERi* c follows the i-star Framework and NFR Framework ideas and consequently deals with actors, goals, softgoals, tasks and resources. Although the most laborious parts of the method have been facilitated by three tools (LEL, AGFL and iStar Diagnoses, as well as OME, used in modelling), we realized that students in an undergraduate software engineering course needed an incentive in the introduction of the new concepts in order to improve their understanding of what intentionality means in the context of requirements for a software project. It was necessary to find a way to keep students motivated and at the same time to tame the new concepts and consequently help their understanding. In this context, we explore the idea of using a game based learning strategy (GBL) as the motivational factor.

In this article, we explore several applications to goal elicitation using a psychological theory: the Personal Construct Theory (PCT). This theory, stated by Kelly in 1955, can be used to elicit goals and their relationships.

In this work, ultrasonic pulse propagation in a steel-rubber-rubber bonded composite structure is investigated by means of computer simulation and pulse echo experimental evaluation. Ultrasonic pulse propagation is modelled using a 2D time domain finite-difference software. For the experimental measurements, two test samples were fabricated by bonding a thin layer of steel and two thin layers of rubber, including debonded areas at marked regions of each interface. Several ultrasonic traces were acquired by contact pulse-echo testing, using a 5 MHz wideband transducer, from the external steel surface. The large acoustic impedance mismatch existing between steel and rubber layers makes that only a very small part of the ultrasonic energy is transmitted through the first (steel-rubber)interface. The high attenuation in rubber materials and the possible overlapping of multiple echoes are additional characteristics of the complex ultrasonic pulse propagation in this flat structure. Some differences in time and frequency domains, between the received signals from normal bonded areas and completely debonded areas are discussed, looking for defect detection at the first (steel-rubber) and second (rubber-rubber) interfaces.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1459"]}

Our article proposes and analyzes a multi-paradigm approach to the problem of Design Recovery. Design Recovery is the first step in turning old code into a resuable product. Our aproach is being used in a special kind of old code, the Draco Prototype, a system that implements the concept of reusable components to the point of achieving reusability of Analysis, Design and Code. In recovering the Draco design, we have used Inspections, JSD, and Prototyping.

A problem that aggravates this situation involves the fact that web accessibility requirements are often addressed when the application is fully developed. Such delayed processing often results in significant rework, increasing costs with new recoding analyzes, which may be totally outside the scope and budget of the project. As we believe that the need for accessibility may vary according to the users and their context, in this article, we approach a strategy to promote web accessibility in legacy systems through the use of software awareness. In this process of reengineering, we deal with the interaction of web accessibility with another nonfunctional requirement: Software Awareness.

One of the possible strategies is to perform a manual inspection of similar projects to quickly gain leverage of domain concepts underlying the projects. However, this task is time-consuming and limited to the projects at hand. To ensure comprehensive elicitation using more widely available systems, we propose to use GitHub projects as information sources. To handle the large amount of data and facilitate access to suitable sources, we propose the creation of project profiles with useful attributes for requirements engineering, and thereby achieve a meaningful recommendation of projects. In this paper, we describe the GitHub assets to be mined, its implementation and the assessment of our approach by using a corpus of readmes related to Real Estate projects.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1459"]}

For that reason, transparency emerges as an important concern that aims to enhance this relationship by improving student awareness about the process and the contents of learning.

Once the modularization is well made, it is possible to develop each module independently, the adaption is facilitated and the system can be more easily understood.

Methods for sequential applications are inadequate to validate the reliability of concurrent applications and they are expensive and time consuming. So, it is desired that test cases can be automatically generated from requirements descriptions. This paper proposes an automated approach to generate test cases for concurrent applications from requirements descriptions. The Scenario language is the representation used for these descriptions. Scenario describes specific situations of the application through a sequence of episodes, episodes execute tasks and some tasks can be executed concurrently; these descriptions reference relevant words or phrases (shared resources), the lexicon of an application. In this process, for each scenario a directed graph is derived, and this graph is represented as an UML activity diagram. Because of multiple interactions among concurrent tasks, test scenario explosion becomes a major problem. This explosion is controlled adopting the interaction sequences and exclusive paths strategies.

Two are the main factors that make the pure rule-based approach to be dropped: the need for flexible control and the need for interconnectivity with external agents. A mix between rule-based and procedural notations is then commonly adopted as an alternative. By introducing a procedural approach to transformers, issues concerning the problems of design organization and maintainability of procedural programs start to apply to software transformers. Based on our experience with the Draco-PUC machine, our current research work concentrates on how to build architecture-based infrastructure for the design of software transformers.

This approach is based on the idea that reuse in a high level of abstraction is possible, if a domain is written for a class of problems. This is the premise of the Draco paradigm, a reuse based strategy for software construction. We also demonstrate the use of these languages, by writing a reverse engineering tool that was able to derive a specification from a system built by others and of which we had no previous knowledge.

{"title": "Mapping Textual Scenarios to Analyzable Petri-Net Models\n", "abstract": " With the growing use of user-oriented perspectives at requirements engineering, transforming requirements models into executable models is considered to be significant. One of the key elements in this perspective is the notion of scenarios; scenarios are used to describe specific behaviors of the application through a flow of events based on user-perspective. Since scenarios are often stated in natural languages, they have the advantage to be easy to adopt, but the requirements can then hardly be processed for further purposes like analysis or test generation; partly because interactions among scenarios are rarely represented explicitly. In this work, we propose a transformation method that takes textual description of scenarios as input and generates an equivalent Petri-Net model as output. The resulting Petri-Net model can be further processed and analyzed using Petri-Net tools to verify model properties, to identify concurrency problems and to optimize the input and output models.

Organizational modeling can integrate elements from different areas in order to enable deeper analysis of the interaction of modeled concepts aiming, for example, to favor organizational alignment.

{"title": "Implementing GPI, a language for Organizational Alignment\n", "abstract": " Organizational alignment aims to align strategic, tactical and operational decision levels in a given organization. The traditional operational view, focused on processes, produces gaps between strategic and operational layers. As such, many tools and techniques were developed giving more focus on one of the layers failing to promote their integration. In our current research, we are trying to identify ways to better represent organizational alignment, for an improved organizational analysis. Following in this direction, we integrated a process and a goal modeling notations (BPMN and i*) and inserted metric oriented elements, generating the GPI (Goal, Process and Indicators) language. Then a tool was created by reusing the Oryx architecture. This paper briefly present the GPI language, details its implementation in the Oryx editor and reports on ongoing research on alignment based on this infrastructure.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1459"]}

{"title": "Aspect-Oriented Goal Modeling and Composition with AOV-Graph\n", "abstract": " As software complexity increases, so does the difficulty of manipulating its models. More complex models make it more difficult to define the impact of changes, to modify the models, or to reuse model parts in other projects. Part of the problem is that concerns are strongly interconnected. Traditional modularization minimizes this coupling. However, mostly, it considers only one dimension in software artifacts (for instance classes or functions). Therefore, the concerns in other dimensions are scattered and tangled, i.e., crosscutting. This chapter reports on the application of goals and aspect-oriented concepts in requirements modeling. Firstly, AOV-graph and its mechanisms to separation, composition, and visualization of crosscutting concerns are presented and after that, we discuss AOV-graph in the context of the Crisis Management case study.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1459"]}

In this chapter, we propose a step further to reason about the dynamic goal models while the separated aspectual requirements are also dynamic.

To demonstrate, we use the Crisis Management System case study to indicate the application of these rules.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1459"]}

It is my conclusion, after years of exposure to the term \u201csystem analysis\u201d, that it has mislead lots of young people how wishes to understand the process of software construction, in special the initial steps of the process. My main point is that you can only analyze something that you know. However, educators in the areas of information systems and software engineering always focused the \u201csystem analysis\u201d as a modeling discipline, where specifications were written and formalization was sought at the very early stages of conceptions of a system. Based on this bias on modeling, analysis was a way of enforcing syntax rules of a given modeling language, which provide ways of applying verification protocols. As such, not enough emphasis was directed to the goal of really understanding the concepts involved and the needs of the clients.

{"title": "Scenario-based software process\n", "abstract": " Scenarios are becoming ubiquitous artefacts in software development. Many researchers view scenarios as the product of the collaboration among developers and users during the requirements definition stage. We believe scenarios should be used in a wider scope, covering the whole development process. In this light, scenarios would be produced at different stages and, like other artefacts, would be in constant evolution. In order to support the scenario evolutionary process and aid the migration between stages, springs the need for a scenario-based software process. Recent research evidenced that the process dimension of scenarios is seldom considered in the literature. In this paper we propose a scenario-based process framework to support the evolution of scenarios. The framework relies on a set of scenario operations/relationships described previously and incorporates configuration management\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1459"]}
