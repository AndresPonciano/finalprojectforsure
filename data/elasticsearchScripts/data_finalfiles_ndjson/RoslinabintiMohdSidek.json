This is due to the modern lifestyles which require short food preparing times without neglecting the food nutritious. In supporting this requirement, the manipulation of vending machine is identified as a tool to promote modern and healthy living style, besides to simplify the cooking process. This paper describes the effort on designing conceptual model for a proposed steaming food vending machine simulator. Conceptual modelling is the most crucial part in developing simulation model; since in this part, the developer need to identify the variables; recognize the desired simulation flows and transform the deliverables into visualized form which can be understood by all parties related to the project. In this study, the process of three main states (user selection state, freezer state and steaming state) has been modelled using process approach, which\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["1256"]}

There are many replication techniques exist in distributed systems environment include Read-One-Write-All (ROWA), Branch Replication Scheme (BRS), Hierarchical Replication Scheme (HRS) and our previous Binary Vote Assignment Data Grid (BVADG) techniques. All these techniques deploy different approaches of data placement in distributed environment. This paper presents the comparison of the replication storage between all these techniques.

{"title": "A tree based strategy for test data generation and cost calculation for uniform and non-uniform parametric values\n", "abstract": " Software testing is a very important phase of software development to ensure that the developed system is reliable. Due to huge number of possible combinations involved in testing and the limitation in the time and resources, it is usually too expensive and sometimes impossible to test systems exhaustively. To reduce the number of test cases to an acceptable level, combinatorial software interaction testing has been suggested and used by many researchers in the software testing field. It is also reported in literature that pairwise (2-way) combinatorial interaction testing can detect most of the software faults. In this paper we propose a new strategy for test data generation, a Tree Based Test Case Generation and Cost Calculation strategy (TBGCC) that supports uniform and non-uniform values, for input parameters (i.e. parameters with same and different number of values).

{"title": "Data Replication Using Read-One-Write-All Monitoring Synchronization Transaction System in Distributed Environment 1\n", "abstract": " Nowadays, the demand of transmitted information over networks increase rapidly and the demand for steady bandwidth seems to be out of control. Particularly organizations need to provide updated data to users that might be geographically remote and handling a vast amount of requested data distributed in multiple sites. Problem statement: Replication in distributed environment has become increasingly popular due to its high degree of availability, fault tolerance and enhance the performance of a system. These advantages of replication are important because it enables organizations to provide users with access to current data anytime or anywhere even if the users are geographically remote. However, this way of data organization also introduces low data consistency among replicas when changes are made during transactions. The need to have a system to monitor this data replication arises. Approach: Read-One-Write-All Monitoring Synchronization Transaction System (ROWA-MSTS) has been developed to solve this problem by using Rapid Application Development (RAD). Results: ROWA-MSTS helped to monitor the replicated data distribution over multiple sites while maintaining the data consistency. Conclusion: Results showed that ROWA-MSTS solved the distributed concurrency transactions and guarantees the data consistency in distributed systems.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1256"]}
{"title": "Tree based test case generation and cost calculation strategy for uniform parametric pairwise testing\n", "abstract": " Problem statement: Although it is very important to test any system extensively it is usually too expensive to do so owing to the cost and the resources that are involved in it. Software testing is a very important phase of software development to ensure that the developed system is reliable. Some systematic approach for testing is essential to test any system and make it acceptable. Combinatorial software interaction testing is one which tests all possible software interactions. This interaction could be at various levels such as two way interaction (pairwise) or three or four or five or six way interactions. Combinatorial interaction testing has been used in several fields. It is reported in literature that pairwise combinatorial interaction testing have identified most of the software faults. Approach: In this study we proposed a new strategy for test suite generation, a tree generation strategy for pairwise combinatorial software testing, with parameters of equal values. The algorithm considers one parameter at a time systematically to generate the tree until all the parameters are considered. This strategy uses a cost calculation technique iteratively for each of the leaf nodes to generate the test suite until all the combinations are covered. Results: The experimental data showed that we achieved about 88%(or more in some cases) of reduction in the number of test cases needed for a complete pairwise combinatorial software interaction testing. Conclusion: Thus, the strategy proposed has achieved a significant reduction in minimizing the number of test cases that is generated.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1256"]}
