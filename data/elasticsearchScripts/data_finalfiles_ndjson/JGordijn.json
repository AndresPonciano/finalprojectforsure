{"title": "Designing and evaluating e-business models\n", "abstract": " Business models are usually represented by a mixture of informal textual, verbal, and ad-hoc graphical representations. However, these representations typically limit a clear understanding of the e-business issues that confront the stakeholders, and often perpetuate the existing gap between business executives and the IT developers who must create the e-business information systems. This article presents a conceptual modeling approach to e-business\u2014called e3-value\u2014that is designed to help define how economic value is created and exchanged within a network of actors. Doing e-business well requires the formulation of an e-business model that will serve as the first step in requirements analysis for e-business information systems. The industry currently lacks adequate methods for formulating these kinds of requirements. Methods from the IT systems analysis domain generally have a strong technology bias and typically do not reflect business considerations very well. Meanwhile, approaches from the business sciences often lack the rigor needed for information systems development. A tighter integration of business and IT modeling would most certainly benefit the industry, because the integration of business and IT systems is already a distinct feature of e-business. This article shows some ways to achieve this kind of modeling integration. Our e3-value method is based on an economic valueoriented ontology that specifies what an e-business model is made of. In particular, it entails defining, deriving, and analyzing multi-enterprise relationships, e-business scenarios, and operations requirements in both qualitative and quantitative ways\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1123\n", "authors": ["1464"]}

This positioning allows for stronger concepts and techniques for theoretical, empirical and practical validation that in our view are now needed in the field. A prerequisite for this is an emphasis on ontology as a (domain) content oriented concept, rather than as primarily a computer representation notion. We propose that taking domain theories and the associated substantive or content reference of ontologies really seriously as first-class citizens, will actually increase the contribution of ontology\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "29\n", "authors": ["1464"]}

Examples include well-known services such as Internet access or content provisioning services. Typically, to satisfy a consumer need, a bundle of elementary services is required. In such a bundle, each elementary service can be offered by a different supplier. A key problem is then how to actually find service-bundles that satisfy consumer needs as close as possible. Because IT-service bundles can be automatically provisioned online immediately after ordering, finding a service bundle satisfying a need should preferably also happen automatically. To this end, we propose the e 3 service ontology, which offers constructs from service marketing, but in a computational way, such that automated reasoning support can be developed to match consumer needs with IT\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "26\n", "authors": ["1464"]}

{"title": "Service ontology\n", "abstract": " A service ontology is required, as we argued in the D3 deliverable of OBELIX, to support the composition of goods and services into a compound end-product or end-service. Such a composition is currently not supported by existing classification tools, which concentrate on physical goods, rather than on services. To that end, we have developed a service ontology. As the term \u201cservice\u201d stems from the economic and business sciences, that was also our starting point. Research about traditional services (services that are not offered via Internet) in those sciences is very mature; it is characterized by a broad consensus. Research about e-services (services of which at least one important part\u2013eg, buying, delivery etc\u2013is realized via Internet) is still at its early stages; it relies on the traditional service research, and searches for the differences between e-services and traditional services. The traditional service research serves as a basis for our service ontology, since we consider the term \u201cservice\u201d in its business context, rather than its IT-context; in the IT world the terms \u201ceservices\u201d and \u201cweb-services\u201d mostly refer to technologies, rather than business activities with elements as value, costs and benefits.An ontology is a well-structured model. Existing service literature, on the other hand, lacks this characteristic. Whereas economists use well-structured models for many analysis tasks, the related theory is formulated in natural language, just like humans would require. Our service ontology, however, has to be machine-readable. We consequently needed to structure the knowledge available in the service literature, so that it can be made machinereadable.

These systems differ from traditional business systems in that they almost constitute the business rather than that they merely support the business of an organization. As a consequence, business and technology issues are intertwined in such a way that it is not sufficient anymore to consider them in isolation. For this reason, we argue that an integrated approach to ecommerce system development is required with which we can assess the impact of a business model on the information system and vice versa. In our approach, which we call e3-VALUE, an e-commerce system is considered from three architectural areas: business value, business process, and software architecture area. These three architectural areas cater for the needs of the various stakeholders involved in the development process at such an abstraction level that qualitative assessments can be made without getting buried by details. A scenario-based technique, represented by Use Case Maps (UCM), is used to relate the different architectural levels. The e3-VALUE approach is illuminated by means of an elaborated case study. Although it is too early to draw definite conclusions from this and other case studies that we have conducted, we did learn some important lessons. The first important lesson is that the case studies suggest that e-commerce systems can indeed be assessed qualitatively at a high level of abstraction as provided by the three architectural areas.

Reducing the process of defining complex services into a configuration task (as studied in knowledge engineering) implies that it can be supported by information technology, to be used either by service personnel or by customers via the Internet.

To design and analyze controls, we developed the economic value-based methodology e                   3-control, which so far has been applied mainly in commercial environments, which are regulated by contractual arrangements. In this paper, we use e                   3                   control in a highly regulated environment, which contains public-private partnerships, namely the healthcare sector in The Netherlands.

The purpose of the work reported in this paper is to create a better understanding of business models by identifying basic notions used in such models. It does so by constructing a common ontology based on three established business model ontologies: e3-value, REA, and BMO. By means of a careful analysis of these ontologies a conceptual schema is created that defines the common concepts.

This analysis forms a part of the early requirements determination phase that particularly seeks to clarify the business requirements underlying information systems support. To this end, we propose an ontology-based approach called e3value to represent and evaluate business models for networked enterprises from a value-creation perspective. In addition, the e3value approach contains a stepwise design process, a set of evaluation methods, and a software tool that supports the business requirements modeling, analysis, and determination process.

For example, the Bitcoin, as one of the most well-known blockchain platforms, shows that it is possible to transfer money without the need of any (intermediate) bank at all. More generally, it allows for the decentralization of roles. In this paper, we focus on permissionless blockchains, which are systems that allow participation without upfront approval on other parties, as opposed to permissioned blockchains. Permissionless blockchain systems support direct business transactions between peers, so without any intermediate and centralized entity very well. However, the organization of the governance of such systems is less obvious. We argue that, in order to arrive at a really decentralized eco-system where power is fairly distributed, the governance should be decentralized; in other words, it should not be in the hand of one controlling entity. In this paper, we analyse, in a model-based way, for three well-known blockchain systems (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tezos) the governance processes. Based on this analysis, we draft an improved governance process for permissionless blockchains.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1464"]}

It would be advantageous to the customer if a service bundle more closely fulfilled the customer's individual requirements, by selecting the most appropriate elementary services included in the bundle. Also, by obtaining the bundle from a consortium of suppliers, rather than just one single supplier, the elementary services of each supplier with the best cost/benefit ratio can be selected.

Because IT-service bundles can be automatically provisioned online immediately after ordering, finding a service bundle satisfying a need should preferably also happen automatically.

Furthermore we utilize e3forces to (1) analyze if the business strategy of an organization is consistent with its strategic position in the constellation and (2) analyze the impact of deploying IT on forces in the environment of actors in a constellation.

Consequently, IT-service provisioning requires at least two enterprises, a seller and a buyer.

In this paper, we contribute an ontologically well-founded methodology called e3service for creating multi-supplier IT-service bundles that satisfy customer IT-needs. Such IT-needs, actually being high level problem statements that often require multiple IT-services to cover (hence the term bundle), are often too ill-defined to find specific IT-services for, thus requiring a systematic approach to finding these solutions. The main idea behind e3service is to conceptualize established ideas from service marketing literature, with the ultimate aim to generate a bundle of IT-services semi-automatically starting from a vague customer need. This paper focuses itself on a systematic analysis of a customer need, or: how to gradually arrive from a vague problem statement to specific IT-services covering this problem statement.

{"title": "5 eBusiness Value Modelling Using the e3value Ontology\n", "abstract": " A first step in developing eBusiness ideas is to understand such an idea thoroughly. In the recent past, industry has clearly demonstrated that such an understanding lacks or at least is insufficient, resulting in failures and sometimes even bankruptcies. In this chapter we present an approach to design an eBusiness model, called the e3value approach. This approach is ontologically founded in business science, marketing and axiology, but exploits rigorous conceptual modelling as a way of working known from computer science. The aim is that an e3value eBusiness model contributes to a better and shared understanding of the idea at stake, specifically with the respect to its profit drivers. If the model is attributed with various assumptions, such as economic valuation of objects produced, distributed, and consumed, we can derive profitability sheets using the business model. These can be used to assess whether the idea seems to be profitable for all actors involved in the idea. We illustrate the e3value approach by a project we carried out for an Internet Service Provider.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1464"]}
{"title": "Designing Control Mechanisms for Networked Enterprises: The Internet Radio Case Study\n", "abstract": " In a network of organisations the design of appropriate control mechanisms is important to prevent and detect opportunistic behaviour of the members of the network. In most cases, control mechanisms can already be seen in the business value model, because most controls add new exchanges of economic value between enterprises. However, controls encompass also operational aspects, not covered by business value models, but which are important for the understanding and operation of controls. We developed the e3-value+ methodology for designing inter-organisational control mechanisms, based on analysing value aspects of network organisations. We illustrate it with the case for the distribution of music tracks via Internet radio, where we apply the methodology to design a control to monitor whether Internet radio stations and Right Societies cleared the right amount of tracks. We present the control mechanism not only from a business value model perspective, but also from an operational perspective, thus showing that the control can indeed be implemented.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1464"]}
{"title": "Requirements Engineering for Value Webs\n", "abstract": " Value webs are cooperating, networked enterprises and end-consumers that create, distribute, and consume things of economic value. The task of creating, designing, and analyzing such webs is a prototypical example of a multi-disciplinary task. Business-oriented stakeholders are involved because the way an enterprise creates economic value is discussed. But also representatives responsible for business processes (many innovative value webs require changes in processes) and inter-organizational information systems (enabling value webs from a technical point of view) play a key role, as well as end-consumers. To facilitate exploration and analysis of such value webs, we propose an approach called e3value that utilizes terminology from business sciences, marketing, and axiology but is founded on methodology seen in requirements engineering such as semi-formal, lightweight graphical conceptual\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1464"]}
{"title": "Towards a modelling tool for designing control mechanisms in network organisations\n", "abstract": " Contracts and organizational controls to monitor contract compliance are important tools to enhance trust in a fair business transaction in network organisations and electronic commerce in general. In this paper, we propose a design methodology for such contracts and supporting controls, utilizing inter-organisational value models. We argue that a framework for designing control mechanisms should include three steps: design of an inter-organizational value model, analysis of possible violations of contractual obligations underlying this value model, and design of control mechanisms to detect or prevent such violations. It is shown how the e3-value methodology, which was developed to design business value models, can be extended to model obligations of parties. We use concepts and ideas from deontic logic (the logic of obligations and permissions) to develop an extension of e3-value called e3-value+.

{"title": "E-Business ontology\n", "abstract": " Over the past few years, many innovative e-commerce ideas have been considered. Such ideas reveal new value propositions, which are enabled by new technological possibilities, such as the widespread use of the Internet and technologies on top of it.During 1998-1999, the e-commerce hype reached its top. Recently, it became clear that many e-commerce ideas are not successful [34]. Many enterprises doing e-commerce have not been able to create profit with their e-commerce ideas. Some of these companies who relied entirely on future e-commerce profits have gone bankrupt.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1464"]}
{"title": "Requirements for Electronic Commerce Applications are created rather than elicited\n", "abstract": " Electronic commerce applications are a challenging new class of information systerns. Due to the everincreasing technical possibilities, new, yet undiscovered ways of doing business are possible. Therefore, requirements for e-commerce systerns can hardly be elicited but instead need to be created because elicitation requires a dormant view ofusers on requirements. Also, E-commerce systerns are, in contrast to other information systerns, an intrinsic part of the product or service a companyoffers to others. Therefore, developing the business model, which represents the offering, and defining the requirements for a supporting e-commerce system, is not a sequential process and, neither can it be done in a decoupled way. Current requirements engineering methodology does not support requirements creation nor deals with information system requirements as an intrinsic part of developing business models. We outline a structured approach to e-commerce requirements creation called e3-VALUE. This approach identifies three views to be developed:(l) the e-business model view,(2) the e-business process view and (3), the esoftware architecture view. We discuss the e-business model view in more detail and discuss a more formal way to represent business models. In our interpretation of'business model', the notion ofvalue is a central theme. We illustrate our e3-VALUEby presenting an experience report.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1464"]}
