{"title": "Towards an industrial use of FLUCTUAT on safety-critical avionics software\n", "abstract": " Most modern safety-critical control programs, such as those embedded in fly-by-wire control systems, perform a lot of floating-point computations. The well-known pitfalls of IEEE 754 arithmetic make stability and accuracy analyses a requirement for this type of software. This need is traditionally addressed through a combination of testing and sophisticated intellectual analyses, but such a process is both costly and error-prone. FLUCTUAT is a static analyzer developed by CEA-LIST for studying the propagation of rounding errors in C programs. After a long time research collaboration with CEA-LIST on this tool, Airbus is now willing to use FLUCTUAT industrially, in order to automate part of the accuracy analyses of some control programs.

In this context, almost every test is potentially unstable, that is, for a given input, the finite precision and real numbers paths may differ. Still, state-of-the-art error analyses rely on the stable test hypothesis, yielding unsound error bounds when the conditional block is not robust to uncertainties.

This gets even more complex in the case of e.g. PID controllers, which interact in closed loop with an external environment, since their input signals are in part the consequence of their own computation, similarly for the imprecision errors.

These new domains extend a former domain [3],[5], based for each variable on the abstraction of the floating-point value by an interval, and of the error by a sum of intervals decomposing the provenance of the total error along the control points (or groups of points) in the source code.The idea of this former domain is to provide some information on the source of errors in the program. The origin of the main losses of precision is most of the time very localized, so identifying the operations responsible for these main losses, while bounding the total error, can be very useful. But it does not allow to improve the accuracy of the total error on one variable, compared to the much less costly floating-point plus total error version-it can prove even worse some times.

{"title": "A topological method for finding invariant sets of continuous systems\n", "abstract": " A usual way to find positive invariant sets of ordinary differential equations is to restrict the search to predefined finitely generated shapes, such as linear templates, or ellipsoids as in classical quadratic Lyapunov function based approaches. One then looks for generators or parameters for which the corresponding shape has the property that the flow of the ODE goes inwards on its border. But for non-linear systems, where the structure of invariant sets may be very complicated, such simple predefined shapes are generally not well suited. The present work proposes a more general approach based on a topological property, namely Wa\u017cewski\u2019s property. Even for complicated non-linear dynamics, it is possible to successfully restrict the search for isolating blocks of simple shapes, that are bound to contain non-empty invariant sets. This approach generalizes the Lyapunov-like approaches, by allowing for\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1769"]}
{"title": "Automatic analysis of imprecision errors in software\n", "abstract": " Machines only compute with finite-precision arithmetic, using for instance IEEE 754 floatingpoint number, an approximation of the mathematical real number field. Also, data that programs process are not always known with precision. There are hopefully a number of means to deal with this: a careful mathematical design of the algorithmics involved, the use of alternative arithmetics, the study of the effect on the algorithm of this imprecision, and of uncertainties of its inputs and parameters. For the last point, different methods have been designed, among which interval and stochastic methods. Our approach is slightly different [4]. We start with a source code written in C, assertions describing the range of inputs, their imprecision errors, and possibly the range of the gradient of their values, and we automatically compute, ie by a tool, an over-approximation of the range of all variables known at the end of the code, and of their imprecision errors. The latter have two sources: the propagation of the initial imprecision errors, and the errors due to the IEEE 754 semantics of floating-point computations. This is based on abstract interpretation [3], which ensures the correctness of the approach. We only describe in this abstract some of the basic ideas of the underlying mathematical model computing these over-approximations, the full model will be developped in the final version of the paper. Our mathematical model describing the propagation of errors for sets of executions of a code is based on ideas from affine arithmetic [2]. Affine arithmetic is an improvement of interval arithmetic allowing to take into account linear correlations.

{"title": "Neural Networks with Physics-Informed Architectures and Constraints for Dynamical Systems Modeling\n", "abstract": " Effective inclusion of physics-based knowledge into deep neural network models of dynamical systems can greatly improve data efficiency and generalization. Such a-priori knowledge might arise from physical principles (e.g., conservation laws) or from the system's design (e.g., the Jacobian matrix of a robot), even if large portions of the system dynamics remain unknown. We develop a framework to learn dynamics models from trajectory data while incorporating a-priori system knowledge as inductive bias. More specifically, the proposed framework uses physics-based side information to inform the structure of the neural network itself, and to place constraints on the values of the outputs and the internal states of the model. It represents the system's vector field as a composition of known and unknown functions, the latter of which are parametrized by neural networks. The physics-informed constraints are enforced via the augmented Lagrangian method during the model's training. We experimentally demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach on a variety of dynamical systems -- including a benchmark suite of robotics environments featuring large state spaces, non-linear dynamics, external forces, contact forces, and control inputs. By exploiting a-priori system knowledge during training, the proposed approach learns to predict the system dynamics two orders of magnitude more accurately than a baseline approach that does not include prior knowledge, given the same training dataset.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1769"]}
{"title": "A few lessons learned in reinforcement learning for quadcopter attitude control\n", "abstract": " In the context of developing safe air transportation, our work is focused on understanding how Reinforcement Learning methods can improve the state of the art in traditional control, in nominal as well as non-nominal cases. The end goal is to train provably safe controllers, by improving both training and verification methods. In this paper, we explore this path for controlling the attitude of a quadcopter: we discuss theoretical as well as practical aspects of training neural nets for controlling a crazyflie 2.0 drone. In particular we describe thoroughly the choices in training algorithms, neural net architecture, hyperparameters, observation space etc. We also discuss the robustness of the obtained controllers, both to partial loss of power for one rotor and to wind gusts. Finally, we measure the performance of the approach by using a robust form of a signal temporal logic to quantitatively evaluate the vehicle's behavior.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1769"]}
