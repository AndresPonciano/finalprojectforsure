As some of the gaps widened in the 1990s, there were some setbacks in the progress the nation made toward racial and ethnic equity. This article offers a look below the surface at Black-White and Hispanic-White achievement gap trends over the past 30 years. The literature review and data analysis identify the key factors that seem to have contributed to bifurcated patterns in achievement gaps. The conventional measures of socioeconomic and family conditions, youth culture and student behavior, and schooling conditions and practices might account for some of the achievement gap trends for a limited time period or for a particular racial and ethnic group. However, they do not fully capture the variations.

Combining data from state policy surveys, F-33, SASS, and NAEP, the article shows that during the 1990s, the states did not address racial and socioeconomic disparities in school resources and failed to narrow the achievement gaps among racial and socioeconomic groups. The distributions of school expenditures, class size, qualified teachers, and mathematics achievement remained largely unchanged in strong accountability states. Although the accountability policy of the 1990s neither produced adverse effects nor brought about significant setbacks in equity, this article suggests that racial and socioeconomic equity were not at the center of accountability reforms and that performance-driven accountability policies alone cannot move us forward toward equity.", "num_citations": "361\n", "authors": ["1045"]}

The results show that while rural and nonrural students had comparable levels of math achievement in 1992, by 1996 rural students overall had begun to outperform their nonrural counterparts. However, the achievement gaps varied considerablyfrom state to state, with rural students performing significantly better in some states and significantly poorer in others.

The results have important implications for comprehensive school reform efforts as we attempt to improve education for all our students, particularly those in our rural schools.Rural student achievement provides one important barometer for monitoring national progress in public education.

Findings indicate that rural schools outperformed nonrural schools in math achievement and that the competitive edge of rural schools arose from school effects beyond the influences of school composition and individual student characteristics. Rural schools tended to have a better organizational context (teacher training, safe/orderly climate, collective support) conducive to higher performance, but suffered from poor instructional conditions (in terms of classroom resources, advanced courses, and progressive instruction), which balanced out achievement gains. Rural schools should capitalize on existing organizational and contextual strengths and also focus more effort on improving curricular and instructional weaknesses. Given that many rural students are poor and attend schools whose instructional resources and course offerings are limited, the level of their academic performance relative to their nonrural counterparts is encouraging.

{"title": "Can Reducing School Segregation Close the Achievement Gap?\n", "abstract": " One of the often debated arguments regarding desegregated schools has been how racially diverse schools affect student achievement (see Hawley, in this volume). There has been much less attention paid to how segregation within schools might also affect student achievement (see Mickelson, 2005). At a time when school resegregation threatens to reduce the number of racially diverse schools, demonstrating the academic benefits\u2014as well as other benefits\u2014that accrue to students in racially heterogeneous schools and classrooms is a likely prerequisite to devising policies to stem this resegregating trend. Thus, at a time when many educational policies are focused on trying to narrow the racial achievement gap, it is worth analyzing the relationship between school and classroom racial composition and the achievement gap.Racial desegregation and equalization efforts since Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka (1954) can be grouped into three general categories (W. E Tate, Ladson-Billings, & Grant, 1996; Weiler, 1998). The first efforts were to eliminate physical segregation of Blacks and Whites between schools; these have seen some success, particularly in the South, where school systems were required to eliminate the vestiges of prior legal segregation. However, there have been recent setbacks in that progress, along with increasing resegregation (Boger & G. Orfield, 2005; Frankenberg, C. Lee, & G. Orfield, 2003; G. Orfield & Yun, 1999).

{"title": "Evaluating the effectiveness of instructional resource allocation and use: IRT and HLM analysis of NAEP teacher survey and student assessment data\n", "abstract": " A large body of research, conducted over three decades following the Coleman report (1966), has failed to find a systematic relationship between school resources and student achievement (Hanushek, 1997). The so-called\" education production function\" studies, relied on readily measurable indicators of school resources (ie, per pupil expenditures, teacher salary, library resources) but failed to account fully for key aspects of schooling processes that affect student outcomes. On the other hand, another branch of research, ie, the so-called\" effective schools\" studies, found that desirable instructional practices (ie, clear goals and high expectations, opportunity to learn, monitoring student progress) enhance student achievement (Lee, Bryk, & Smith, 1993; Purkey & Smith, 1983). These case-studies sought to identify elusive aspects of effective school context and process but failed to provide generalizable information on required resources as a sufficient base for policy making (Monk, 1992). Needs for filling the knowledge gap concerning educational production function become more pressing as more state policymakers consider and adopt outcome-based school funding. While concerns in school finance reform shifted from equity to adequacy (Clune, 1994; Ladd, Chalk, & Hansen, 1999), it is not clear how states will accomplish this new goal. This necessitates an empirical search for what is an\" adequate\" level of instructional resources and practices.

TIMSS findings show similarities and differences in the processes and outcomes of schooling between the United States and East Asian countries, particularly Japan. This report reviews the initial findings from the TIMSS eighth-grade report, with a special focus on the United States and Japan, and discusses missing or incomplete links in international education studies. The initial findings highlight similarities between students' learning experiences at home and critical differences between those at school. These patterns imply that Japanese and US students do not differ in out-of-school learning experiences, but there are differences neglected in TIMSS highlights, such as private tutoring. On the other hand, TIMSS researchers found substantial differences in the content and process of instruction at school and differences in instructional organization. While initial TIMSS findings show that the United States is still far from achieving the national goal of being first in the world in mathematics and science, these aggregate national patterns ignore the enormous local variation in the US It is not clear whether federated countries like the United States are really comparable to other countries.

{"title": "Throwing development by children in grades K-8: A multi-cohort longitudinal study\n", "abstract": " It has long been evident that child development is subject to the pull of both biological and environmental forces. However recent secular trends in biological maturation have lowered the age of onset of the adolescent growth spurt to 9 for girls and 11 for boys. This critical biological trend alongside recent civil rights initiatives (eg, Title IX) and the exponential growth in youth sports suggests a need to re-examine sources of variability in development of key fundamental movement skills. The purpose of this study was to examine developmental changes associated with mature throwing by children in grades k-8. Specifically, the study addressed the following research questions: 1) what are the characteristics of individual differences in throwing over time? And 2) are differences in developmental growth trajectories of mature throwing systematically related to age, sex, and/or sports participation? In keeping with the spirit of Schaie's General Developmental Model, we employed a sequential design that included cross-sectional, longitudinal, and time-lag components. This design allowed us to examine the influence of age, sex, and sport participation while reducing cohort effects. Following a pilot study to examine inter-rater reliability, we tested children on mature throwing using the Ohio State University Scale of Intra Gross Motor Assessment (OSU SIGMA). Specifically we tested four cohorts of boys and girls grades k-8 (N= 1,045) over nine years (1992= k-8, 1994= 2-8, 1996= 4-8, 1998= 6-8; in'00 we again tested the original kindergarten cohort.

{"title": "Using National and State Assessments To Inform the Performance of Education Systems.\n", "abstract": " 1. Research ObjectivesGiven statewide systemic reform efforts for academic excellence and equity, we need to know what information is available on the performance of state education systems. While the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and individual state student assessments have been used to inform us of state-level performance, problems exist. On one hand, states are having difficulty in realigning their student assessment systems and tracking student achievement (CPRE, 1995). Moreover, most states use their statewide assessments for several purposes, some of which are incompatible (Bond, Braskamp, & Roeber, 1996). On the other hand, the NAEP state assessments provide highly comparable information on student achievement across the states, but they are not specifically aligned with the policies and standards of any given state. Thus, we need to examine whether and how the current NAEP and states' own student assessments can be used to inform us of systemwide academic performance. We also need to examine if the national and state assessments produce consistent results on the proficiency levels of students and their academic growth.In light of these concerns, I conducted a systematic analysis of currently available systemwide student assessments, that is, the NAEP and states' own assessments, and addressed the issue of the quality of data available for assessing and understanding the performance of states. The objective of this study is to identify and fill the gaps between currently available data and more desirable data in light of statewide systemic school reforms.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1045"]}
{"title": "Effects of testing\n", "abstract": " This entry focuses on testing designed to measure and monitor students\u2019 academic achievement in school settings. Although there are controversies about whether testing enhances student learning and achievement, it is critical to understand not only the effectiveness of testing, but also how, when, and why it works. To answer this, a consideration of testing attributes and conditions such as teacher-developed formative assessments versus standardized summative assessments must be examined. While an evaluation of testing effects call for scientifically based evidence, derived from experimental and correlational studies, it is also necessary to understand both the social and educational context of testing in which the research has been embedded. The origin of public testing dates as far back as the 2nd century bce when civil service exams were used during the Han dynasty of China (206 bce\u2013220 ce) to select elite government officials. Over time, modern external examinations have grown as instruments of control over educational systems in many countries (Eckstein & Noah, 1993); the history of educational testing and assessment reveals underlying assumptions and beliefs about human learning and teaching (Madaus & O\u2019Dwyer, 1999; Shepard, 1991). While teacher-made tests, assignments, or observations remain a dominant form of classroom assessment, standardized testing with reliance on short multiple-choice questions has facilitated objective, reliable, and efficient evaluation on a large scale.It is critical to differentiate between formative and summative assessments due to their different testing functions, effects, and causal\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1045"]}

{"title": "Multilevel Linkages of State Education Reform to Instructional Practices.\n", "abstract": " Content-driven systemic school reform emerged in recent years as a major policy alternative in the United States. Major reforms include the establishment of state curriculum frameworks, the development of student assessments, and the adoption of new textbooks tied to the curriculum frameworks. Because successful implementation of content-driven reform depends on the linkages between state-level policymaking and school-level policy implementation, the central question is how state policies have changed the ways in which classroom activitieg are organized and managed by teachers. This paper presents findings of a study that investigated the multilevel linkages of state education reform to instructional practices in mathematics. Four stages of empirical analyses were conducted with a combination of the following survey data: the 1992 Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) state survey, the 1990 and 1992 National Assessment of Educational Progress Trial State Assessment (NAEP TSA) eighth-grade school survey, and the 1990-91 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) public school administrator survey. The data suggest that current state curriculum frameworks need to be aligned with instructional materials as well as with student assessments. The. findings also imply that policy implementation is a dynamic organizational process of interactions between policy characteristics and the institutional setting in a multilayered school system. Thus, systemic school reform needs to formulate desired connections between organizational levels in normative, structural, and functional arenas.

This paper (1) examines ways to cope with the challenges of considering measures of school systems from multiple sources and combining multiple measures of student achievement data using state and local data from Maine;(2) examines ways to tackle the challenges of considering multiple levels of influences on student achievement and attributing achievement results to school effects using NAEP data from Maine and Kentucky; and (3) discusses the usefulness and limitations of multi-level and multi-measure approaches to the evaluation of systemic school reform. Results suggest that it is not necessary to weight each measure before forming an achievement composite to classify student performance. This is particularly true when measures are highly intercorrelated. Results also point to the possible hazards of classifying student achievement based on a single measure. Three different models of estimating school effects were tested, and reasons for their use are discussed. The estimation of school effects requires that\" school effects\" be defined so that an explicit model of these effects can be formulated.

Yet many analysts worry that various policies and programs, including the federal No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), tend to\u2015level\u2016 student achievement by focusing on the lowest-achieving students and ignoring\u2014or, worse, driving resources away from\u2014our strongest students (p. 1). 1", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1045"]}
{"title": "SAT Wars: The Case for Test-Optional College Admissions ed. by Joseph A. Soares\n", "abstract": " Admissions, edited by Joseph Soares, compiles 12 separate chapters to collectively make a case against the use of traditional standardized tests such as the Scholastic Aptitude Tests for college admissions and to build support for test-optional policies and alternative testing models. SAT Wars can be useful for both researchers and administrators in higher education with interests in fairness and diversity issues in undergraduate admissions testing. This book makes clear that, despite mounting evidence that the SAT is a poor predictor of college success, it remains a major social, cultural, and political force in the world of US higher education. Overall, SAT Wars delivers a much-needed critical examination of the (a) purpose and history of the SAT,(b) alternative forms of testing and findings of the SAT\u2019s insignificant correlation with college success, and (c) effects of existing test-optional policies on several different\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1045"]}
{"title": "Time-Indexed Effect Size Metric for K-12 Reading and Math Education Evaluation.\n", "abstract": " Through a synthesis of test publisher norms and national longitudinal datasets, this study provides new national norms of academic growth in K-12 reading and math that can be used to reinterpret conventional effect sizes in time units. We propose d\u0384, a time-indexed effect size metric to estimate how long it would take for an \u201cuntreated\u201d control group to reach the treatment group outcome in terms familiar to educators\u2014years/months of schooling. It serves as a supplement to conventional effect size metrics such as Cohen\u2019s d by taking into account different amounts of time needed for learning at different age or grade levels. Through applications to Project STAR small class effects and NAEP racial achievement gaps, we demonstrate how to interpret and use d\u0384. It is expected to provide a more developmentally appropriate context for interpreting the size of an effect, a step toward bridging the gap between educational research and practice.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1045"]}

The original idea of school vouchers was proposed in 1955 by Milton Friedman as a solution to the public schools\u2019 perceived monopolistic control over schooling. 1 Debates over such vouchers often engage the question of whether private schools are more effective in educating students, a question which is the subject of two reports recently issued by think tanks.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1045"]}
{"title": "Bringing Together Reading and Writing for the Purpose of Enhancing Reading Comprehension\n", "abstract": " This symposium summarizes the progress and findings of the first year of the Writing Intensive Reading Comprehension (WIRC) study funded by the Institute of Education Sciences, US Department of Education 1. It reports on progress made during Year I toward achieving the study\u2019s two major goals:(1) A new integrated reading-writing curriculum entitled Writing Intensive Reading Comprehension for enhancing reading comprehension and writing performance by teaching reading and writing simultaneously and interactively, and (2) A set of empirical data which speaks to the effectiveness of WIRC compared to the teaching of reading comprehension and writing separately. In the first paper I will discuss the theoretical underpinnings for integrating reading and writing in the WIRC study. In the second paper Tim Madigan will describe thinksheets, the curriculum component at the heart of the WIRC intervention, and he\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1045"]}

{"title": "How Adequate Are Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) Measures? Regression Artifacts and School AYP.\n", "abstract": " This study explored the extent to which current adequate yearly progress (AYP) indices reflect real change or a statistical artifact. The objective, in more specific terms, was to investigate regression artifacts in evaluating schools' academic progress and explore methods to overcome their effects in developing AYP measures. Schools in Kentucky and Maine were studied, using eighth-grade achievement data from the two states' student assessments, the Kentucky Instructional Results Information System and the Maine Educational Assessment. Three different types of school achievement gain estimates were computed:(1) the 1-year gain measure;(2) a 2-year gain measure; and (3) a 3-year gain measure. Time-reversed analyses were conducted to determine whether gain score really was a regression artifact. Findings for both states show that higher performing schools tend to gain less while lower performing schools gain more. This illustrates the well-known regression to the mean status phenomenon. Results also reveal regression to the mean growth phenomenon. Schools that gained more in the past tend to gain relatively less. The first force tends to make higher and lower performing schools appear convergent in their status, and the latter force may make more and less improving schools appear convergent in their growth. These two forces as statistical artifacts may confound AYP measures and need to be addressed.(Contains 4 figures, 11 tables, and 9 references.)", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1045"]}
{"title": "Assessing the Effectiveness of Instructional Resource Allocation and Use.\n", "abstract": " This paper reports on a 1992 study of mathematics-assessment data by measuring key instructional resources and practices and by investigating the ways in which the resources and practices affect student learning in a multilayered, complex school system. The study examined research methods that assess the effectiveness of instructional resource allocation. The results encourage the possibility of applying objective measurement and multilevel analysis methods to survey and test data for assessing the effectiveness of instructional resource allocation and use. Findings show that the availability of both human and physical resources is positively associated with the level of desired instructional practices across states. Generally, the effect of human resources is greater than the effect of physical resources. Furthermore, the level of desired instructional practices is positively related to the level of academic achievement across states, although the relationship between instructional resources and practices varied from state to state. Setting desired levels of standards of instructional resources and practices may be tailored to individual states' unique status of resource allocation and use. States that are more effective in using physical resources than in using human resources should set standards for physical resources at higher levels than for human resources.(Contains 17 references.)(RJM)", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1045"]}
{"title": "State and Local Policy Choices and Fiscal Effort for Education: Exploratory Analysis of the Distributive Effects of State Education Reform.\n", "abstract": " Given state activism in education reform during the 1980s, a major concern in the development of education policy is whether reform states have increased their financial support for education in order to achieve desired objectives. This paper describes findings of a study that explored the distributive nature of state and local policy choices in education through comparative analyses of their long-term fiscal effort for three distinctive public services--welfare, highways, and police. The study built upon the unitary model of taxation and expenditure policies. The findings imply that policy shifts may have led to changes in educational expenditure patterns. Providing the general structures of state-level distributive effects, multilevel analyses suggest that the first wave of state reform affected not only fiscal effort for education but also distributive tendencies in education expenditures. While state reform appeared to increase the level of resources allocated to public education versus other social services, the distributive effects of state education reform tend to vary among states with different racial compositions. Redistributive tendencies in education expenditures tend to be accompanied by a low level of fiscal effort for education. In addition, developmental versus redistributive tendencies in education expenditures tend to be highly conflicting.
