{"title": "Stochastic Activity Networks: Structure, Behavior, and Application.\n", "abstract": " Stochastic activity networks (SANs), a generalization of stochastic Petri nets, permit the representation of concurrency, timeliness, fault tolerance, and degradable performance in a single model. Two important subclasses of SANs are those whose state behavior may be characterized as a semi-Markov process and those whose state behavior may be characterized as a Markov process. Conditions under which stochastic activity networks exhibit these two properties are investigated through the introduction of a higher-level model, a stochastic activity system (SAS), which allows for systematic formulation and investigation of SAN behavior. The use of stochastic activity systems permits the authors to state conditions under which Markov and semi-Markov behavior is exhibited and specify the nature of this behavior in terms of the SAS realized by SAN. Application of these models to the construction of performability models is also addressed.", "num_citations": "351\n", "authors": ["1807"]}

{"title": "Modeling and verification of reactive systems using Rebeca\n", "abstract": " Actor-based modeling has been successfully applied to the representation of concurrent and distributed systems. Besides having an appropriate and efficient way for modeling these systems, one needs a formal verification approach for ensuring their correctness. In this paper, we develop an actor-based model for describing such systems, use temporal logic to specify properties of the model, and apply different abstraction and verification methods for verifying that the model meets its specification. We use a compositional verification approach for verifying safety properties of these models. For that we introduce a notion of component, based on an user-defined decomposition of the model. Components are more abstract than the model itself, and so we can reduce the state space of the model which makes it more amenable to model checking techniques. We prove that our abstraction technique preserves a set of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "193\n", "authors": ["1807"]}

{"title": "Investigating intrusion detection systems in MANET and comparing IDSs for detecting misbehaving nodes\n", "abstract": " As mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) have different characteristics from wired networks and even from standard wireless networks, there are new challenges related to security issues that need to be addressed. Due to its unique features such as open nature, lack of infrastructure and central management, node mobility and change of dynamic topology, prevention methods from attacks on them are not enough. Therefore intrusion detection is one of the possible ways in recognizing a possible attack before the system could be penetrated. All in all, techniques for intrusion detection in old wireless networks are not suitable for MANET. In this paper, we classify the architecture for Intrusion detection systems that have so far been introduced for MANETs, and then existing intrusion detection techniques in MANET presented and compared. We then indicate important future research directions.", "num_citations": "74\n", "authors": ["1807"]}

Although structured approaches are particularly useful for data gathering applications, they incur high maintenance overhead in dynamic scenarios for event-based applications. Moreover, a WSN should be capable of timely fulfilling its mission without losing important information in event-critical applications. In this paper, we focus on designing a structure-free Real-time data AGgregation protocol, RAG, using two mechanisms for temporal and spatial convergence of packets \u2013 Judiciously Waiting policy and Real-time Data-aware Anycasting policy.

{"title": "Reducing the data transmission in wireless sensor networks using the principal component analysis\n", "abstract": " Aggregation services play an important role in the domain of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) because they significantly reduce the number of required data transmissions, and improve energy efficiency on those networks. In most of the existing aggregation methods that have been developed based on the mathematical models or functions, the user of the WSN has not access to the original observations. In this paper, we propose an algorithm which let the base station access the observations by introducing a distributed method for computing the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The proposed algorithm is based on transmission workload of the intermediate nodes. By using PCA, we aggregate the incoming packets of an intermediate node into one packet and as a result, an intermediate node merely sends a packet instead of relaying all the incoming packets.

{"title": "A method for performance analysis of earliest-deadline-first scheduling policy\n", "abstract": " This paper introduces an analytical method to approximate the fraction of jobs missing their deadlines in a soft real-time system when the earliest-deadline-first (EDF) scheduling policy is used. In the system, jobs either all have deadlines until the beginning of service (DBS) and are non-preemptive, or have deadlines until the end of service (DES) and are preemptive. In the former case, the system is represented by an M/M/m/EDF+G model, i.e., a multi-sever queue with Poisson arrival, exponential service, and generally distributed relative deadlines. In the latter case, it is represented by an M/M/1/EDF+G model, i.e., a single-server queue with the same specifications as before. EDF is known to be optimal in both of the above cases. The optimality property of EDF scheduling policy is used for the estimation of a key parameter, namely the loss rate when there are n jobs in the system.

This is a novel result that has not been seen before. Using this result, we show how the probability measure induced by the offered sojourn time is computed, and consequently how the probability of missing deadline and the probability of blocking of a customer are obtained.

{"title": "A novel approach for avoiding wormhole attacks in VANET\n", "abstract": " Different attacks on routing protocols in ad hoc networks occur that one of the most dangerous types is called wormhole attack. This attack happens with the assistance of at least two or more malicious nodes. In this attack nodes create a private tunnel which if a packet comes to one of them, it will be guided to other pair of these malicious nodes by this tunnel and that node broadcasts it into network. This action provides a short connection in the network that is controlled by these malicious nodes. Hence they control all Packets that come to them and threaten the security of data within packets or delete them. Totally, what a wormhole does is an incorrect understanding of network topology. This attack severely disrupts the network operation, especially in networks that use on demand routing protocols such as AODV or DSR.

In our algebra we model the essential modeling concepts of ad hoc networks, i.e. local broadcast, connectivity of nodes and connectivity changes. Connectivity and connectivity changes are modeled implicitly in the semantics, which results in a more compact state space. Our connectivity model supports unidirectional links. A key feature of our algebra is eliminating connectivity information from the specification of a network, and transferring its complexity to the semantics. We give a formal operational semantics for our process algebra, and define equivalence relations on protocols and networks. We show how our algebra can be applied to prove correctness of an adhoc routing protocol.", "num_citations": "60\n", "authors": ["1807"]}
{"title": "A Bayesian game approach for preventing DoS attacks in wireless sensor networks\n", "abstract": " Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are new technologies, foreseen to be used increasingly in the near future, and security is an important issue for them. However because of the nodes resource limitations, other schemes proposed for securing general ad hoc networks, are not appropriate for WSNs. Usually some nodes act maliciously and they are able to do different kinds of DoS attacks. In order to make the network more secure, malicious nodes should be isolated from the network. In this paper, we model the interaction of nodes in WSN and intrusion detection system (IDS) as a Bayesian game formulation and use this idea to make a secure routing protocol. By this approach nodes are motivated to act normally and gain reputation, and IDS can perform better by using the history of the game. As this game approaches to Nash equilibrium, it leads to a defense strategy for the network.", "num_citations": "58\n", "authors": ["1807"]}

We prove that the latency of FAST under the protocol interference model is upper-bounded by 12R + \u0394 - 2, where R is the network radius and \u0394 is the maximum node degree in the communication graph of the original network.
