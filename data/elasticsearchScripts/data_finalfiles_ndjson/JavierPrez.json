{"title": "Enabling STD-NMR fragment screening using stabilized native GPCR: A case study of adenosine receptor\n", "abstract": " Structural studies of integral membrane proteins have been limited by the intrinsic conformational flexibility and the need to stabilize the proteins in solution. Stabilization by mutagenesis was very successful for structural biology of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). However, it requires heavy protein engineering and may introduce structural deviations. Here we describe the use of specific calixarenes-based detergents for native GPCR stabilization. Wild type, full length human adenosine A 2A receptor was used to exemplify the approach. We could stabilize native, glycosylated, non-aggregated and homogenous A 2A R that maintained its ligand binding capacity. The benefit of the preparation for fragment screening, using the Saturation-Transfer Difference nuclear magnetic resonance (STD-NMR) experiment is reported.

It was found that trehalose increases the main phase transition temperature of the MLVs, but has no influence on the main phase transition temperature of the ULVs.

The widespread use of this technology has been limited, largely due to the labor intensive protein production, the quality of proteins expressed in different systems, and the shelf life of these arrays. The novel method Nucleic Acid Programmable Protein Array (NAPPA) overcomes these limitations by synthesizing the proteins in situ. NAPPA entails spotting plasmid DNA encoding the relevant proteins, which are then simultaneously transcribed and translated by a cell free system. NAPPA assays are based on fluorescence detection, which need a protein labeled, often in-situ or by fluorescent tag, and can\u2019t give real time information or kinetics. An attractive alternative to traditional fluorescence-based microarrays detection methods is the technique of surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi). SPRi brings a significant advantage in the analysis of biological samples where labeling multiple biomarker with fluorophores or nanoparticles is not practical. A new surface chemistry is developed to carry out an in-situ and cell free synthesis of an SPR compatible protein array. The DNA which encodes the P53-GST-(e-coil) fusion protein is arrayed on the gold sensor surface and through the expression with cell lysate extract the corresponding protein array is obtained. Both the expression process and the posterior characterization are implemented on the flow cell covering the sensor chip.

Sustained protein release was observed at pH 6.8 and 7.4. The integrity of the protein released was unaffected. The hydrogels were not cytotoxic. Chitosan nanoparticles were prepared by two routes. In the first one nanoparticles were obtained by the interpolyelectrolyte reaction between chitosan acetate and the sodium salt of PAA and alginic acid. It was found that the appropriate conditions for nanoparticle formation depend on the nature of the reacting polyelectrolytes. The CHI-PAA nanoparticles loaded with 5-fluorouracil released the drug with a pH dependent kinetics.
