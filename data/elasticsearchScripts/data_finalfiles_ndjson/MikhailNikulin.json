{"title": "Analysis of variance for functional data\n", "abstract": " Functional data analysis has been a popular statistical research topic for the past three decades. Functional data are often obtained by observing a number of subjects over time, space, or other continua densely. They are frequently collected from various research areas, including audiology, biology, children\u2019s growth studies, ergonomics, environmentology, meteorology, and women\u2019s health studies among others in the form of curves, surfaces, or other complex objects. Statistical inference for functional data generally refers to estimation and hypothesis testing about functional data. There are at least two monographs available in the literature that are devoted to estimation and classification of functional data. This book mainly focuses on hypothesis testing problems about functional data, with topics including reconstruction of functional observations, functional ANOVA, functional linear models with functional\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "206\n", "authors": ["1037"]}

{"title": "Semiparametric models in accelerated life testing\n", "abstract": " The considered models are used in reliability theory analysing results of accelerated life testing. Really, many manufactured devices have a long life when used under normal conditions. Therefore much time is required to get sufficiently large data for reliability estimation. To avoid this, items can be tested under higher stress conditions. In this case all processes resulting in failures of items elapse more quickly. As a result, failures which in normal conditions would occur only after a long testing, can be observed and the size of data can be enlarged. Such reliability testing is called accelerated life testing. Using information about failures under higher stress conditions, inference about item reliability under normal stress must be made. The solution of this problem requires construction of a model relating the distribution of failure time on stress. In survival analysis the considered models are most used when the dependence of lifetime of individuals on concomitant variables is analysed. A number of such models was proposed by engineers who considered physics of failure formation process of certain products or by statistitians (see Andersen & others (1993), Aranda-Ordaz (1983), Cox & Oakes (1984), Dabrowska & Doksum (1988), Droesbeke & others (1989), Elandt-Johnson & Johnson (1980), Gertsbakh & Kordonskiy (1969), Hill & others (1990), Kalbfleisch & Prentice (1980), Kartashov (1979), Lawless (1982), Lee (1992), Lin & Ying (1994), Meeker & Escobar (1993), Miner (1945), Moreau & others (1985), Nelson (1980, 1990), Sedyakin (1966)).", "num_citations": "50\n", "authors": ["1037"]}

Introduction in Accelerated Life testing The failure time data are used for product reliability estimation. Failures of highly reliable units are rare and other information should be used than traditional censored failure time data. One way of obtaining this complementary reliability information is to apply the methods of the so-called accelerated life-testing (ALT) for improvements in reliability life testing, to obtain wished reliability results for the products more quickly then under normal operating conditions, given in terms of step-stresses. Step-stress ALT gives an interesting approach to study the possibility to take into account the cumulative effect of the applied stresses on aging, fatigue and degradation of testing items, systems, etc... The idea to use the step-stresses in ALT was proposed at first by Miner [17], Pieruschka [25], Sedyakin [26], Singpurwalla [30]. Later this idea was actively developed in publications of many statisticians, see, for example,[18],[28],[14],[27],[21-23],[32],[29],[31],[19],[1-12],[24], etc..., where one can find a list of references on applications and estimation in ALT.

{"title": "Accelerated life and degradation models in reliability and safety: an engineering perspective\n", "abstract": " We consider here the accelerated models describing dependence of the lifetime distribution on the time-varying explanatory variables. Such models are used in reliability and survival analysis to study the reliability of bio-technical systems in dynamic environments. We shall discuss the problems of statistical modeling and of choice of design in accelerated life testing to obtain the statistical estimators of the main reliability characteristics.1. Introduction in accelerated life testing The failure time data are used for product reliability estimation. Failures of highly reliable units are rare and other information should be used than traditional censored failure time data. One way of obtaining this complementary reliability information is to apply the methods of the so-called accelerated life-testing (ALT). The ALT has been recognized as a necessary activity to ensure the reliability of electronic products used in military, aerospace, automotive and mobil (cellular, laptop computers) applications, from which one can see that accelerated testing of electronic products offers great potential for improvements in reliability life testing, to obtain wished reliability results for the products more quickly then under normal operating conditions, given in terms of covariates (stresses), which could be time-varying. It is interesting to study the possibility to take into account the cumulative effect of the applied stresses on aging, fatigue and degradation of testing items, systems, etc... The problem becomes to model effects of covariates on the hazard rate under operating conditions, see, Lehmann (2004). ALT methods can be either qualitative or quantitative.

In particular, the discreteness of computing devices and physical constraints force us to restrict ourselves to finite sets of number values. If a theoretical model (statistical procedure) uses sets of higher power (for example, infinite sets) then any implementation is necrssary connected with approximations and therefore with computational errors.Let-(X,,...>) be a sample, and statistics under investigation, Q= a set of basic vector-functions corresponding to a given computer device (G may consist of arithmetical functions some standard functions like sqrt, sin etc.).

{"title": "Inverse Gaussian family and its applications in reliability. Study by simlulation\n", "abstract": " The inverse Gaussian distribution (IGD) is named so because it satisfies the relationship with normal distribution. The IGD was introduced first by Schrodinger in 1915 [Seshadri 1993], and its found to have many applications in a various fields such biology, economics, cardiology, demography, linguistic, etc. See for examples [Seshadri 1993],[Seshadri 1999],[Chhikara and Folks, 1989],[Voinov and Nikulin 1993],[Lawless 2003] for more details. The IGD is very competitor of Weibull, generalized Weibull and de lognormal distribution.

{"title": "A remark on the converse of Laplace's theorem\n", "abstract": " 1. At the beginning of the 1940's SN Bernshtein established that in the case of the binomial distribution the a posteriori distribution of the probability of positive outcome as the number of experiments increases without bound is practically independent of the a priori distribution. Bernshtein proved this fact under the assumption that the binomial distribution satisfies the hypotheses of the central limit theorem (in the present case, the hypotheses of Laplace's theorem). In this situation it was shown that the a posteriori distribution function of the probability of a positive outcome can be approximated by the normal approximation to the binomial distribution. Bernshtein called this theorem the converse of Laplace's theorem [1]. These facts were later included in an appendix to Bernshtein's famous textbook Theory of Probability, where in addition it was proved that when a consistent estimate exists for the random shift\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1037"]}

For example, if B-0, we have the family of normal distribucions. If B= 1, we obtain the family of Poisson distribucions, and for B= 2 wc oblain the family of gamma distribucion. As was shown by Hougaard (1986). Bar-Lev and Enis (1986), for Be (0.1) no NEF-PVF's exists, but for any BE (1.2) we obtain a NEF-PVF's of compound Poisson distributions generated by a gamma disoribucions. When B> 2, we obtain the subclass of NEF-PVF distributions generated by stable discribution on R'. which are unimodal and absolutely continuous with respect 10 Lebesguc measure on R'. We consider here namely this subclass of all NEF's on the positive numbers. As it is well known a stable distribution on R'has a stable index", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1037"]}
