{"title": "An improved data fusion method based on weighted belief entropy considering the negation of basic probability assignment\n", "abstract": " Uncertainty in data fusion applications has received great attention. Due to the effectiveness and flexibility in handling uncertainty, Dempster\u2013Shafer evidence theory is widely used in numerous fields of data fusion. However, Dempster\u2013Shafer evidence theory cannot be used directly for conflicting sensor data fusion since counterintuitive results may be attained. In order to handle this issue, a new method for data fusion based on weighted belief entropy and the negation of basic probability assignment (BPA) is proposed. First, the negation of BPA is applied to represent the information in a novel view. Then, by measuring the uncertainty of the evidence, the weighted belief entropy is adopted to indicate the relative importance of evidence. Finally, the ultimate weight of each body of evidence is applied to adjust the mass function before fusing by the Dempster combination rule. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated in accordance with an experiment on artificial data and an application on fault diagnosis.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["2111"]}
{"title": "Improved Base Belief Function-Based Conflict Data Fusion Approach Considering Belief Entropy in the Evidence Theory\n", "abstract": " Due to the nature of the Dempster combination rule, it may produce results contrary to intuition. Therefore, an improved method for conflict evidence fusion is proposed. In this paper, the belief entropy in D\u2013S theory is used to measure the uncertainty in each evidence. First, the initial belief degree is constructed by using an improved base belief function. Then, the information volume of each evidence group is obtained through calculating the belief entropy which can modify the belief degree to get the final evidence that is more reasonable. Using the Dempster combination rule can get the final result after evidence modification, which is helpful to solve the conflict data fusion problems. The rationality and validity of the proposed method are verified by numerical examples and applications of the proposed method in a classification data set.

{"title": "Peculiar: Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection Based on Crucial Data Flow Graph and Pre-training Techniques\n", "abstract": " Smart contracts with natural economic attributes have been widely and rapidly developed in various fields. However, the bugs and vulnerabilities in smart contracts have brought huge economic losses, which has strengthened people\u2019s attention to the security issues of smart contracts. The immutability of smart contracts makes people more willing to conduct security checks before deploying smart contracts. Nonetheless, existing smart contract vulnerability detection techniques are far away from enough: static analysis approaches rely heavily on manually crafted heuristics which is difficult to reuse across different types of vulnerabilities while deep learning based approaches also have unique limitations. In this study, we propose a novel approach, Peculiar, which uses Pre-training technique for detection of smart contract vulnerabilities based on crucial data flow graph. Compared against the traditional data flow graph which is already utilized in existing approach, crucial data flow graph is less complex and does not bring an unnecessarily deep hierarchy, which makes the model easy to focus on the critical features. Moreover, we also involve pre-training technique in our model due to the dramatic improvements it has achieved on a variety of NLP tasks. Our empirical results show that Peculiar can achieve 91.80% precision and 92.40% recall in detecting reentrancy vulnerability, one of the most severe and common smart contract vulnerabilities, on 40,932 smart contract files, which is significantly better than the state-of-the-art methods (eg, Smartcheck achieves 79.37% precision and 70.50% recall). Meanwhile, another experiment shows that\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2111"]}
{"title": "Deep Learning Based Valid Bug Reports Determination and Explanation\n", "abstract": " Bug reports are widely used by developers to fix bugs. Due to the lack of experience, reporters may submit numerous invalid bug reports. Manually determining valid bug reports is a laborious task. Automatically identifying valid bug reports can save time and effort for bug analysis. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach to determine and explain valid bug reports using only textual information i.e., summaries and descriptions of bug reports. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is applied to capture their contextual and semantic features. Moreover, by analyzing the spatial structure of CNN, we backtrack the trained CNN model to get phrases that can explain valid bug reports determination. After inspecting the phrases manually, we summarize some valid bug report patterns. We evaluate our approach on five large-scale open-source projects containing a total of 540491 bug reports.

{"title": "Incomplete Information Management Using an Improved Belief Entropy in Dempster-Shafer Evidence Theory\n", "abstract": " Quantifying uncertainty is a hot topic for uncertain information processing in the framework of evidence theory, but there is limited research on belief entropy in the open world assumption. In this paper, an uncertainty measurement method that is based on Deng entropy, named Open Deng entropy (ODE), is proposed. In the open world assumption, the frame of discernment (FOD) may be incomplete, and ODE can reasonably and effectively quantify uncertain incomplete information. On the basis of Deng entropy, the ODE adopts the mass value of the empty set, the cardinality of FOD, and the natural constant e to construct a new uncertainty factor for modeling the uncertainty in the FOD. Numerical example shows that, in the closed world assumption, ODE can be degenerated to Deng entropy. An ODE-based information fusion method for sensor data fusion is proposed in uncertain environments. By applying it to the sensor data fusion experiment, the rationality and effectiveness of ODE and its application in uncertain information fusion are verified.
