{"title": "A biterm topic model for short texts\n", "abstract": " Uncovering the topics within short texts, such as tweets and instant messages, has become an important task for many content analysis applications. However, directly applying conventional topic models (eg LDA and PLSA) on such short texts may not work well. The fundamental reason lies in that conventional topic models implicitly capture the document-level word co-occurrence patterns to reveal topics, and thus suffer from the severe data sparsity in short documents. In this paper, we propose a novel way for modeling topics in short texts, referred as biterm topic model (BTM). Specifically, in BTM we learn the topics by directly modeling the generation of word co-occurrence patterns (ie biterms) in the whole corpus. The major advantages of BTM are that 1) BTM explicitly models the word co-occurrence patterns to enhance the topic learning; and 2) BTM uses the aggregated patterns in the whole corpus for learning\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "900\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

Inspired by the success of convolutional neural network in image recognition, where neurons can capture many complicated patterns based on the extracted elementary visual patterns such as oriented edges and corners, we propose to model text matching as the problem of image recognition. Firstly, a matching matrix whose entries represent the similarities between words is constructed and viewed as an image. Then a convolutional neural network is utilized to capture rich matching patterns in a layer-by-layer way.

To offer a robust method, we propose a novel supervised model, called PALE, which employs network embedding with awareness of observed anchor links as supervised information to capture the major and specific structural regularities and further learns a stable cross-network mapping for predicting anchor links.

Most existing methods on this problem utilize a heuristic predefined ranking function, where limited features can be incorporated and extensive tuning is required for different settings. In this paper, we address search result diversification as a learning problem, and introduce a novel relational learning-to-rank approach to formulate the task. However, the definitions of ranking function and loss function for the diversification problem are challenging. In our work, we firstly show that diverse ranking is in general a sequential selection process from both empirical and theoretical aspects. On this basis, we define ranking function as the combination of relevance score and diversity score between the current document and those previously selected, and loss function as the likelihood loss of ground\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "94\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Locally adaptive translation for knowledge graph embedding\n", "abstract": " Knowledge graph embedding aims to represent entities and relations in a large-scale knowledge graph as elements in a continuous vector space. Existing methods, eg, TransE and TransH, learn embedding representation by defining a global margin-based loss function over the data. However, the optimal loss function is determined during experiments whose parameters are examined among a closed set of candidates. Moreover, embeddings over two knowledge graphs with different entities and relations share the same set of candidate loss functions, ignoring the locality of both graphs. This leads to the limited performance of embedding related applications. In this paper, we propose a locally adaptive translation method for knowledge graph embedding, called TransA, to find the optimal loss function by adaptively determining its margin over different knowledge graphs. Experiments on two benchmark data sets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, as compared to the-state-of-the-art ones.", "num_citations": "91\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

The probabilities of role emission and transition are acquired after machine learning on a role-labeled data set, which is transformed from a hand-corrected corpus after word segmentation and POS tagging are performed. Given an original string, role Viterbi tagging is employed on tokens segmented in the initial process. Then named entities are identified and classified through maximum matching on the best role sequence. In addition, named entity recognition using role model is incorporated along with the unified class-based bigram model for word segmentation. Thus, named entity candidates can be further selected in the final process of Chinese lexical analysis.

POI recommendation distinguishes itself from traditional item recommendation, eg, movie recommendation, via geographical influence among POIs. Existing methods model the geographical influence between two POIs as the probability or propensity that the two POIs are co-visited by the same user given their physical distance. These methods assume that geographical influence between POIs is determined by their physical distance, failing to capture the asymmetry of geographical influence and the high variation of geographical influence across POIs. In this paper, we exploit POI-specific geographical influence to improve POI recommendation. We model the geographical influence between two POIs using three factors: the geo-influence of POI, the geosusceptibility of POI, and their physical distance. Geo-influence captures POI\u2019s capacity at exerting geographical influence to other POIs, and geosusceptibility reflects POI\u2019s propensity of being geographically influenced by other POIs.

Therefore we formally propose an adaptive multiclass SVM model which transfers an initial common sentiment classifier to a topic-adaptive one. To tackle the tweet sparsity, non-text features are explored besides the conventional text features, which are intuitively split into two views.

In this paper, using the population-scale dataset from the largest Chinese microblogging website, we conduct a comprehensive study on the cumulative effect in information diffusion. We base our study on the diffusion network of message, where nodes are the involved users and links characterize forwarding relationship among them. We find that multiple exposures to the same message indeed increase the possibility of forwarding it. However, additional exposures cannot further improve the chance of forwarding when the number of exposures crosses its peak at two. This finding questions the cumulative effect hypothesis in information diffusion.

We conducted extensive experiments to study the impact of different pooling sizes, interaction functions and kernel sizes on the retrieval performance.

Therefore, an ideal model should be able to detect these relevant contexts and produce a suitable response accordingly. However, the widely used hierarchical recurrent encoderdecoder models just treat all the contexts indiscriminately, which may hurt the following response generation process. Some researchers try to use the cosine similarity or the traditional attention mechanism to find the relevant contexts, but they suffer from either insufficient relevance assumption or position bias problem. In this paper, we propose a new model, named ReCoSa, to tackle this problem. Firstly, a word level LSTM encoder is conducted to obtain the initial representation of each context. Then, the self-attention mechanism is utilized to update both the context and masked response representation. Finally, the attention weights between each context and response representations are computed and used in the further decoding process. Experimental results on both Chinese customer services dataset and English Ubuntu dialogue dataset show that ReCoSa significantly outperforms baseline models, in terms of both metric-based and human evaluations.

{"title": "Stochastic game net and applications in security analysis for enterprise network\n", "abstract": " Stochastic game theoretic framework has been used in many fields of networks with interactive behaviors. However, further use of this framework is limited due to the following reasons. Firstly, it is difficult to build comprehensive and rigorous models for complex network structures by the state-based game model. Secondly, solving and extending the dynamic behaviors of participators of the network are nearly impossible, because of the complexity of state transitions. Last but not least, general game model is not able to describe and analyze specific events and behaviors in some kinds of networks, like enterprise networks. In this paper, we propose a new modeling paradigm (stochastic game net, or SGN) for stochastic games representation with Petri nets. Based on our graphical tool, stochastic game problems can be described clearly, and the model can be solved and extended easily.

{"title": "Graph convolutional networks using heat kernel for semi-supervised learning\n", "abstract": " Graph convolutional networks gain remarkable success in semi-supervised learning on graph structured data. The key to graph-based semisupervised learning is capturing the smoothness of labels or features over nodes exerted by graph structure. Previous methods, spectral methods and spatial methods, devote to defining graph convolution as a weighted average over neighboring nodes, and then learn graph convolution kernels to leverage the smoothness to improve the performance of graph-based semi-supervised learning. One open challenge is how to determine appropriate neighborhood that reflects relevant information of smoothness manifested in graph structure. In this paper, we propose GraphHeat, leveraging heat kernel to enhance low-frequency filters and enforce smoothness in the signal variation on the graph. GraphHeat leverages the local structure of target node under heat diffusion to determine its neighboring nodes flexibly, without the constraint of order suffered by previous methods.

We then classify the nodes of trading network into three roles according to their connectivity pattern. Strong Granger causality is found between stock price and trading relationship indices, ie, the fraction of trading relationship among nodes with different roles.

{"title": "Reinforcing Coherence for Sequence to Sequence Model in Dialogue Generation.\n", "abstract": " Sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq) approach has gained great attention in the field of single-turn dialogue generation. However, one serious problem is that most existing Seq2Seq based models tend to generate common responses lacking specific meanings. Our analysis show that the underlying reason is that Seq2Seq is equivalent to optimizing Kullback\u2013Leibler (KL) divergence, thus does not penalize the case whose generated probability is high while the true probability is low. However, the true probability is unknown, which poses challenges for tackling this problem. Inspired by the fact that the coherence (ie similarity) between post and response is consistent with human evaluation, we hypothesize that the true probability of a response is proportional to the coherence degree. The coherence scores are then used as the reward function in a reinforcement learning framework to penalize the case whose generated probability is high while the true probability is low. Three different types of coherence models, including an unlearned similarity function, a pretrained semantic matching function, and an end-to-end dual learning architecture, are proposed in this paper. Experimental results on both Chinese Weibo dataset and English Subtitle dataset show that the proposed models produce more specific and meaningful responses, yielding better performances against Seq2Seq models in terms of both metric-based and human evaluations.", "num_citations": "43\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Modeling document novelty with neural tensor network for search result diversification\n", "abstract": " Search result diversification has attracted considerable attention as a means to tackle the ambiguous or multi-faceted information needs of users. One of the key problems in search result diversification is novelty, that is, how to measure the novelty of a candidate document with respect to other documents. In the heuristic approaches, the predefined document similarity functions are directly utilized for defining the novelty. In the learning approaches, the novelty is characterized based on a set of handcrafted features. Both the similarity functions and the features are difficult to manually design in real world due to the complexity of modeling the document novelty. In this paper, we propose to model the novelty of a document with a neural tensor network. Instead of manually defining the similarity functions or features, the new method automatically learns a nonlinear novelty function based on the preliminary representation\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "42\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

For event detection, syntactic relation representations based on dependency tree can better capture the interrelations between candidate trigger words and related entities than sentence representations. But, existing studies only use first-order syntactic relations (ie, the arcs) in dependency trees to identify trigger words. For this reason, this paper proposes a new method for event detection, which uses a dependency tree based graph convolution network with aggregative attention to explicitly model and aggregate multi-order syntactic representations in sentences.

Previous methods mainly leverage demographics, temporal and structural patterns of early adopters for popularity prediction. However, most existing methods are less effective to precisely capture the cascading effect in information diffusion, in which early adopters try to activate potential users along the underlying network. In this paper, we consider the problem of network-aware popularity prediction, leveraging both early adopters and social networks for popularity prediction. We propose to capture the cascading effect explicitly, modeling the activation state of a target user given the activation state and influence of his/her neighbors.

Properties of document networks are not only affected by topological connectivity between nodes, but are also strongly influenced by the semantic relation between the content of the nodes. We observed that document networks have a large number of triangles and a high value clustering coefficient. Also there is a strong correlation between the probability of formation of a triangle and the content similarity among the three nodes involved. We propose the degree-similarity product (DSP) model, which well reproduces these properties. The model achieves this by using a preferential attachment mechanism that favours the linkage between nodes that are both popular and similar.

Previous works mainly adopt a pair-wise manner, modeling the propagation probability between pairs of users using n 2 independent parameters for n users. Consequently, these models suffer from severe overfitting problem, especially for pairs of users without direct interactions, limiting their prediction accuracy. Here we propose to model the cascade dynamics by learning two low-dimensional user-specific vectors from observed cascades, capturing their influence and susceptibility respectively. This model requires much less parameters and thus could combat overfitting problem. Moreover, this model could naturally model context-dependent factors like cumulative effect in information propagation. Extensive experiments on synthetic dataset and a large-scale microblogging dataset demonstrate that this model outperforms the existing pair-wise models at predicting cascade dynamics, cascade size, and\" who will be retweeted.\"", "num_citations": "35\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "BeatGAN: Anomalous Rhythm Detection using Adversarially Generated Time Series.\n", "abstract": " Given a large-scale rhythmic time series containing mostly normal data segments (or \u2018beats\u2019), can we learn how to detect anomalous beats in an effective yet efficient way? For example, how can we detect anomalous beats from electrocardiogram (ECG) readings? Existing approaches either require excessively high amounts of labeled and balanced data for classification, or rely on less regularized reconstructions, resulting in lower accuracy in anomaly detection. Therefore, we propose BeatGAN, an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm for time series data. BeatGAN outputs explainable results to pinpoint the anomalous time ticks of an input beat, by comparing them to adversarially generated beats. Its robustness is guaranteed by its regularization of reconstruction error using an adversarial generation approach, as well as data augmentation using time series warping. Experiments show that BeatGAN accurately and efficiently detects anomalous beats in ECG time series, and routes doctors\u2019 attention to anomalous time ticks, achieving accuracy of nearly 0.95 AUC, and very fast inference (2.6 ms per beat). In addition, we show that BeatGAN accurately detects unusual motions from multivariate motion-capture time series data, illustrating its generality.", "num_citations": "34\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

Specifically, our approach leverages a manifold ranking process over the sentence manifold to find topic relevant and salient sentences.

Here we investigate whether the location of the largest jump coincides with the percolation threshold for a range of processes, such as Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyipercolation, percolation via edge competition and via growth by overtaking. We find that the largest jump asymptotically occurs at the percolation transition for Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyiand other processes exhibiting global continuity, including models exhibiting an \u201cexplosive\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "31\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

The large tweet stream stops people reading the whole classified list to understand the insights. We employ the co-training framework in the proposed algorithm. Features are split into text view features and non-text view features. Two Random Forest (RF) classifiers are trained with the common labeled data on the two views of features separately. Then for each specific event, they collaboratively and periodically train together to boost the classification performance. At last, we propose a\" river\" graph to visualize the intensity and evolvement of sentiment on an event, which demonstrates the intensity by both color gradient and opinion labels, and the ups and downs of confronting opinions by the river flow.

In this paper, we propose a novel neural network to complete this task. The model consists of an embedding layer, a hidden layer and an output layer. Firstly, the distributed representations of the user and the items bought before are obtained and used to form a feature vector by the embedding layer. Then the hidden layer transforms the feature vector to another space by a non-linear operator. Finally, the softmax operator is adopted to output the probabilities of next items.

In this paper, we present LiveBT, a new protocol which supports video-on- demand streaming service and is totally compatible to the current BitTorrent protocol. LiveBT enables users to play hot movies shared in the BT systems smoothly just after 2-3 minutes of buffering time.

{"title": "Inside out: Two jointly predictive models for word representations and phrase representations\n", "abstract": " Distributional hypothesis lies in the root of most existing word representation models by inferring word meaning from its external contexts. However, distributional models cannot handle rare and morphologically complex words very well and fail to identify some fine-grained linguistic regularity as they are ignoring the word forms. On the contrary, morphology points out that words are built from some basic units, ie, morphemes. Therefore, the meaning and function of such rare words can be inferred from the words sharing the same morphemes, and many syntactic relations can be directly identified based on the word forms. However, the limitation of morphology is that it cannot infer the relationship between two words that do not share any morphemes. Considering the advantages and limitations of both approaches, we propose two novel models to build better word representations by modeling both external contexts and internal morphemes in a jointly predictive way, called BEING and SEING. These two models can also be extended to learn phrase representations according to the distributed morphology theory. We evaluate the proposed models on similarity tasks and analogy tasks. The results demonstrate that the proposed models can outperform state-of-the-art models significantly on both word and phrase representation learning.", "num_citations": "26\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

Recently, some works have viewed this problem as a reading comprehension (RC) task, and directly applied successful RC models to it. However, the performances of such models are not so good as that in the RC task. In our opinion, the perspective of RC ignores three characteristics in OpenQA task: 1) many paragraphs without the answer span are included in the data collection; 2) multiple answer spans may exist within one given paragraph; 3) the end position of an answer span is dependent with the start position. In this paper, we first propose a new probabilistic formulation of OpenQA, based on a three-level hierarchical structure, ie, the question level, the paragraph level and the answer span level. Then a Hierarchical Answer Spans Model (HASQA) is designed to capture each probability. HAS-QA has the ability to tackle the above three problems, and experiments on public OpenQA datasets show that it significantly outperforms traditional RC baselines and recent OpenQA baselines.", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

We specifically analyze the core techniques and methods for constructing open Web knowledge bases, fusing multi-sourced knowledge, and updating the knowledge bases. Furthermore, we summarize the research status and main issues of open Web knowledge base based information search, data mining, and system applications from different aspects, including user intension understanding, query extension, semantic Q&A, clue mining, relationship referencing, and prediction of relationships and attributes. Finally, we look into the development trends and main challenges of open Web knowledge bases.", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Personal privacy protection in the era of big data\n", "abstract": " With the development of information technology, emerging services based on Web2. 0 technologies such as blog, microblog, social networks, and the Internet of things produce various types of data at an unprecedented rate, while cloud computing provides a basic storage infrastructure for big data. All of these lead to the arrival of the big data era. Big data contains great value. Data become the most valuable wealth of the enterprise, but big data also brings grand challenges. Personal privacy protection is one of the major challenges of big data. People on the Internet leave many data footprint with cumulativity and relevance. Personal privacy information can be found by gathering data footprint in together. Malicious people use this information for fraud. It brings many trouble or economic loss to personal life. Therefore, the issue of personal privacy has caused extensive concern of the industry and academia. However, there is little work on the protection of personal privacy at present. Firstly, the basic concepts of big data privacy protection are introduced, and the challenges and research on personal privacy concern are discussed. Secondly, the related technology of privacy protection is described from the data layer, application layer and data display layer. Thirdly, several important aspects of the personal privacy laws and industry standards are probed in the era of big data. Finally, the further research direction of personal privacy protection is put forward.", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

{"title": "Stochastic rank aggregation\n", "abstract": " This paper addresses the problem of rank aggregation, which aims to find a consensus ranking among multiple ranking inputs. Traditional rank aggregation methods are deterministic, and can be categorized into explicit and implicit methods depending on whether rank information is explicitly or implicitly utilized. Surprisingly, experimental results on real data sets show that explicit rank aggregation methods would not work as well as implicit methods, although rank information is critical for the task. Our analysis indicates that the major reason might be the unreliable rank information from incomplete ranking inputs. To solve this problem, we propose to incorporate uncertainty into rank aggregation and tackle the problem in both unsupervised and supervised scenario. We call this novel framework {stochastic rank aggregation} (St.Agg for short). Specifically, we introduce a prior distribution on ranks, and transform the ranking functions or objectives in traditional explicit methods to their expectations over this distribution. Our experiments on benchmark data sets show that the proposed St.Agg outperforms the baselines in both unsupervised and supervised scenarios.", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Statistical consistency of ranking methods in a rank-differentiable probability space\n", "abstract": " This paper is concerned with the statistical consistency of ranking methods. Recently, it was proven that many commonly used pairwise ranking methods are inconsistent with the weighted pairwise disagreement loss (WPDL), which can be viewed as the true loss of ranking, even in a low-noise setting. This result is interesting but also surprising, given that the pairwise ranking methods have been shown very effective in practice. In this paper, we argue that the aforementioned result might not be conclusive, depending on what kind of assumptions are used. We give a new assumption that the labels of objects to rank lie in a rank-differentiable probability space (RDPS), and prove that the pairwise ranking methods become consistent with WPDL under this assumption. What is especially inspiring is that RDPS is actually not stronger than but similar to the low-noise setting. Our studies provide theoretical justifications of some empirical findings on pairwise ranking methods that are unexplained before, which bridge the gap between theory and applications.", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

However, SCL model treats each feature as well as each instance by an equivalent-weight strategy. To address the two issues effectively, we proposed a weighted SCL model (W-SCL), which weights the features as well as the instances. More specifically, W-SCL assigns a smaller weight to high-frequency domain-specific (HFDS) features and assigns a larger weight to instances with the same label as the involved pivot feature. The experimental results indicate that proposed W-SCL model could overcome the adverse influence of HFDS features, and leverage knowledge from labels of instances and pivot features.", "num_citations": "23\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Experiments in TREC 2004 Novelty Track at CAS-ICT.\n", "abstract": " The main task in Novelty Track is to retrieve relevant sentences and remove duplicates from a document set given a TREC topic. This track took place for the first time in TREC 2002 and it is refined to four tasks in TREC 2003. Besides 25 relevant documents, irrelevant ones are given in this year of Novelty track. In other words, a given document is either relevant or irrelevant to the topic. There are 1808 documents in 50 TREC topics. Average 11.18 documents are noise for each topic. In topic N75, the number of noise is 45. Once we mistook an irrelevant document as relevance, all results in the document are wrong. Except the document retrieval, more limited information could be applied in the last three tasks than ever. Among the first 5 given documents, average 3.14 documents are relevant and average 2.76 are new. Especially, 9 topics have no relevant sentence in the first 5 ones. In TREC2004, ICT divided Novelty track into four sequential stages. It includes: customized language parsing on original dataset, document retrieval, sentence relevance and novelty detection. The architecture in novelty is given in Figure 1. In the first preprocessing stage, we applied sentence segmenter, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, morphological analysis, stop word remover and query analyzer on topics and documents. As for query analysis, we categorized words in topics into description words and query words. Title, description and narrative parts are all merged into query with different weights.

The conflict (ie, several pedestrians intend to move to the same site) is solved by introducing probabilities as in floor field models. The fundamental diagram (FD) is investigated and it is found that when the drift strength D\u2272 0.5, the FD is a concave curve. With the further increase in drift strength, a turning point appears on FD. The empirical findings show that both concave FD and FD with a turning point exist. Thus, the model might be able to reproduce both by tuning drift strength. It is also shown that in the special case D= 1, two congested branches exist in the FD. We have carried out mean-field analysis of the FD and the mean-field results are in approximate agreement with simulations when the drift strength D is small.

Meanwhile, dynamic memory network (DMN) has demonstrated promising capability in capturing contextual information and has been applied successfully to various tasks. In light of the multi-hop mechanism of the DMN to model the context, we propose the trigger detection dynamic memory network (TD-DMN) to tackle the event detection problem.

Money laundering refers to criminals using the bank's services to move massive amounts of illegal money to untraceable destination accounts, in order to inject their illegal money into the legitimate financial system. Existing graph fraud detection approaches focus on dense subgraph detection, without considering the fact that money laundering involves high-volume flows of funds through chains of bank accounts, thereby decreasing their detection accuracy. Instead, we propose to model the transactions using a multipartite graph, and detect the complete flow of money from source to destination using a scalable algorithm, FlowScope. Theoretical analysis shows that FlowScope provides guarantees in terms of the amount of money that fraudsters can transfer without being detected. FlowScope outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in accurately detecting the accounts involved in money laundering, in both injected and real-world data settings.", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Relative influence maximization in competitive social networks\n", "abstract": " Method. Given that f (IP| IN) is non-negative, monotone and submodular, we propose a greedy algorithm called GreedyRIM that achieves (1\u2212 1/e) approximation ratio. Referring to [4], we determine diffusion subgraph Gi in advance. For the selection of ith-node, we scan the subgraph with CIC to obtain the influence of positive and negative nodes eventually by adding each node into the set IP. To get an accurate approximation of the influence, we generate subgraphs for sufficient large R times and use the average over these R subgraphs as the final result. Finally, we add one node v into the selected set IP such that v together with IP maximizes f (IP| IN). The time complexity of GreedyRIM is O (Rm+ kRnm1), where n is the number of nodes, m is the number of edges and m1 is the maximum number of edges in each subgraphs. So this timeconsuming algorithm is not suitable for large-scale social networks. An efficient solution is to utilize heuristics [5]. Two widely-used heuristics are random and degree based centrality. Random heuristic is the simplest, but is not solid. High-degree heuristic performs better than other heuristics, such as \u201cDistance centrality\u201d. However, highdegree heuristic together with its improvement, eg, SingleDiscount, is from the perspective of network topology, neglecting the practical situation that opposite opinions spread.In this article, we propose a Distance-Sensitive heuristic centrality, referred to DS.

By analyzing the trading networks of stocks, we find that the trading networks of manipulated stocks exhibit significantly higher degree-strength correlation than the trading networks of non-manipulated stocks and the randomized trading networks. We further propose a method to detect anomalous traders of manipulated stocks based on statistical significance analysis of degree-strength correlation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is effective at distinguishing the manipulated stocks from non-manipulated ones. Our method outperforms the traditional weight-threshold method at identifying the anomalous traders in manipulated stocks. More importantly, our method is difficult to be fooled by colluded traders.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Selecting optimal training data for learning to rank\n", "abstract": " This paper is concerned with the quality of training data in learning to rank for information retrieval. While many data selection techniques have been proposed to improve the quality of training data for classification, the study on the same issue for ranking appears to be insufficient. As pointed out in this paper, it is inappropriate to extend technologies for classification to ranking, and the development of novel technologies is sorely needed. In this paper, we study the development of such technologies. To begin with, we propose the concept of \u201cpairwise preference consistency\u201d (PPC) to describe the quality of a training data collection from the ranking point of view. PPC takes into consideration the ordinal relationship between documents as well as the hierarchical structure on queries and documents, which are both unique properties of ranking.

{"title": "A deep investigation of deep IR models\n", "abstract": " The effective of information retrieval (IR) systems have become more important than ever. Deep IR models have gained increasing attention for its ability to automatically learning features from raw text; thus, many deep IR models have been proposed recently. However, the learning process of these deep IR models resemble a black box. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the difference between automatically learned features by deep IR models and hand-crafted features used in traditional learning to rank approaches. Furthermore, it is valuable to investigate the differences between these deep IR models. This paper aims to conduct a deep investigation on deep IR models. Specifically, we conduct an extensive empirical study on two different datasets, including Robust and LETOR4.0. We first compared the automatically learned features and hand-crafted features on the respects of query term coverage, document length, embeddings and robustness. It reveals a number of disadvantages compared with hand-crafted features. Therefore, we establish guidelines for improving existing deep IR models. Furthermore, we compare two different categories of deep IR models, i.e. representation-focused models and interaction-focused models. It is shown that two types of deep IR models focus on different categories of words, including topic-related words and query-related words.", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Context-adaptive matrix factorization for multi-context recommendation\n", "abstract": " Data sparsity is a long-standing challenge for recommender systems based on collaborative filtering. A promising solution for this problem is multi-context recommendation, ie, leveraging users' explicit or implicit feedback from multiple contexts. In multi-context recommendation, various types of interactions between entities (users and items) are combined to alleviate data sparsity of a single context in a collective manner. Two issues are crucial for multi-context recommendation:(1) How to differentiate context-specific factors from entity-intrinsic factors shared across contexts?(2) How to capture the salient phenomenon that some entities are insensitive to contexts while others are remarkably context-dependent? Previous methods either do not consider context-specific factors, or assume that a context imposes equal influence on different entities, limiting their capability of combating data sparsity problem by taking full\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Position-Aware ListMLE: A Sequential Learning Process for Ranking.\n", "abstract": " ListMLE is a state-of-the-art listwise learning-torank algorithm, which has been shown to work very well in application. It defines the probability distribution based on Plackett-Luce Model in a top-down style to take into account the position information. However, both empirical contradiction and theoretical results indicate that ListM-LE cannot well capture the position importance, which is a key factor in ranking. To amend the problem, this paper proposes a new listwise ranking method, called position-aware ListMLE (p-ListMLE for short). It views the ranking problem as a sequential learning process, with each step learning a subset of parameters which maximize the corresponding stepwise probability distribution. To solve this sequential multi-objective optimization problem, we propose to use linear scalarization strategy to transform it into a single-objective optimization problem, which is efficient for computation. Our theoretical study shows that p-ListMLE is better than ListM-LE in statistical consistency with respect to typical ranking evaluation measure NDCG. Furthermore, our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the performance of ListMLE and outperform state-of-the-art listwise learningto-rank algorithms as well.", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

These static methods, in which nodes are immunized at once, may have poor performance in the certain situation due to the dynamics of diffusion. To tackle this problem, we introduce a new dynamic immunization problem of immunizing nodes during the process of the diffusion in this paper.

However, existing models either work in population level---all messages are assumed to follow similar popularity dynamics, lacking flexibility to capture the intrinsic complexity of popularity dynamics, or work in individual level---the popularity dynamics of messages are independent of each other, failing to leverage other messages to improve prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a divide and conquer framework for popularity prediction. We first divide messages into groups, anticipating each group of messages follow similar popularity dynamics, and then, we train a group-specific model for the messages of each group.

However, most of the existing models are designed to work well in a language with rich resources. Directly applying those models on poor-quality corpora often leads to poor results.

Despite the fact that the temporal effect of attractiveness is widely studied, temporal laws underlying individual interactions remain unclear, causing inaccurate prediction of information propagation on evolving social networks.

It is even more desired and challenging to learn a sparse representation in practice for large scale text modeling. However, traditional probabilistic topic models (PTM) lack a mechanism to directly control the posterior sparsity of the inferred representations; While the emerged non-probabilistic models (NPM) can explicitly control sparsity using sparse constraint like l_1 norm, they convey different limitations in latent representations. To address the existing problems, we propose a novel non-probabilistic topic model for discovering sparse latent representations of large text corpora, referred as group sparse topical coding (GSTC).

{"title": "A hierarchical search result clustering method\n", "abstract": " Search result clustering can help users quickly browse through the documents returned by search engine. Traditional clustering techniques are inadequate since they can not generate clusters with highly readable names. In order to improve the performance of the search result clustering and help user to quickly locate the relevant document, a label-based clustering method is used to make the search result clustering. A multi-feature integrated model is developed to extract base-cluster labels, which combines the DF, query log and query context features together. Using the extracted labels, some basic clusters are built. In order to setup a hierarchical clustering structure, a basic cluster relation graph is built based on these basic clusters. A hierarchical cluster structure is generated from the basic cluster relation graph using the graph based cluster algorithm (GBCA). To evaluate the search result clustering method, a test-bed is set up. P@ N and F-Measure are introduced to evaluate the extracted labels and the document distribution in clusters. The experiment shows that the integrated label-extraction model is very effective. The more feature is used, the higher P@ N can be gained. Compared with the STC and Snaket clustering method, GBCA outperforms the STC and Snaket in cluster label extraction and F-Measure.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

However, pre-training objectives tailored for ad-hoc retrieval have not been well explored. In this paper, we propose Pre-training with Representative wOrds Prediction (PROP) for ad-hoc retrieval.

Based on this idea, we construct the representative words prediction (ROP) task for pre-training.

{"title": "Multi page search with reinforcement learning to rank\n", "abstract": " Web search engines are typically designed to involve multiple pages of search results, and the search users engaging in exploratory search with ad hoc queries are likely to access more than one result pages. The ranking of web pages for such queries should consider additional information other than the original query, eg, the user clicks on previous result pages. Existing methods that utilize this kind of information usually involve relevance feedback, which uses the feedback information to explore the user's intent. However, due to the limitation of the feedback mechanism, it is difficult to apply existing relevance feedback techniques to state-of-the-art learning to rank models. In this paper, we propose a novel learning to rank model for multi page search in which the user's feedback can be naturally utilized for improving the ranking of next result page.

{"title": "Tailored sequence to sequence models to different conversation scenarios\n", "abstract": " Sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq) models have been widely used for response generation in the area of conversation. However, the requirements for different conversation scenarios are distinct. For example, customer service requires the generated responses to be specific and accurate, while chatbot prefers diverse responses so as to attract different users. The current Seq2Seq model fails to meet these diverse requirements, by using a general average likelihood as the optimization criteria. As a result, it usually generates safe and commonplace responses, such as \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019. In this paper, we propose two tailored optimization criteria for Seq2Seq to different conversation scenarios, ie, the maximum generated likelihood for specific-requirement scenario, and the conditional value-at-risk for diverse-requirement scenario. Experimental results on the Ubuntu dialogue corpus (Ubuntu service scenario) and Chinese Weibo dataset (social chatbot scenario) show that our proposed models not only satisfies diverse requirements for different scenarios, but also yields better performances against traditional Seq2Seq models in terms of both metric-based and human evaluations.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Modeling the correlations of relations for knowledge graph embedding\n", "abstract": " Abstract Knowledge graph embedding, which maps the entities and relations into low-dimensional vector spaces, has demonstrated its effectiveness in many tasks such as link prediction and relation extraction. Typical methods include TransE, TransH, and TransR. All these methods map different relations into the vector space separately and the intrinsic correlations of these relations are ignored. It is obvious that there exist some correlations among relations because different relations may connect to a common entity. For example, the triples (Steve Jobs, PlaceOfBrith, California) and (Apple Inc., Location, California) share the same entity California as their tail entity. We analyze the embedded relation matrices learned by TransE/TransH/TransR, and find that the correlations of relations do exist and they are showed as low-rank structure over the embedded relation matrix. It is natural to ask whether we can leverage these correlations to learn better embeddings for the entities and relations in a knowledge graph. In this paper, we propose to learn the embedded relation matrix by decomposing it as a product of two low-dimensional matrices, for characterizing the low-rank structure. The proposed method, called TransCoRe (Translation-Based Method via Modeling the Correlations of Relations), learns the embeddings of entities and relations with translation-based framework. Experimental results based on the benchmark datasets of WordNet and Freebase demonstrate that our method outperforms the typical baselines on link prediction and triple classification tasks.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

Naturally, word embedding techniques are used to learn continuous word representations for constructing sentence matrix as input to CNN. As for sentiment analysis of customer reviews, we argue that it is problematic to learn a single representation for a word while ignoring sentiment information and the discussed aspects. In this poster, we propose a novel word embedding model to learn sentimental word embedding given specific aspects by modeling both sentiment and syntactic context under the specific aspects. We apply our method as input to CNN for sentiment analysis in multiple domains. Experiments show that the CNN based on the proposed model can consistently achieve superior performance compared to CNN based on traditional word embedding method.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

This phenomenon motivates the need of truth discovery, which aims to automatically find the true claim among multiple conflicting claims. Existing truth discovery methods are mainly based on iterative updates, optimization or probabilistic models. Although these methods have shown their own effectiveness, they have a common limitation. These methods do not model relationships between each pair of source and target such that they do not well capture the underlying interactions in the data. In this paper, we propose a new model for truth discovery, learning the representations of sources and claims automatically from the interactions between sources and targets.

Different from traditional time series forecast, STLF is a more challenging task, because of the complex demand of active and reactive power from numerous categories of electrical loads and the effects of environment. Therefore, we propose NeuCast, a seasonal neural forecasting method, which dynamically models various loads as co-evolving time series in a hidden space, as well as extra weather conditions, in a neural network structure. NeuCast captures seasonality and patterns of the time series by integrating factor modeling and hidden state recognition. NeuCast can also detect anomalies and forecast under different temperature assumptions. Extensive experiments on 134 real-word datasets show the improvements of NeuCast over the stateof-the-art methods.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

Graph-ranking methods are often employed to account for the collective diffusion process of scientific credit among researchers or their publications. One key issue, however, is still up in the air: what is the appropriate level for scientific credit diffusion, researcher level or paper level? In this paper, we tackle this problem via an anatomy of the credit diffusion mechanism underlying both researcher level and paper level graph-ranking methods. We find that researcher level and paper level credit diffusions are actually two aggregations of a fine-grained authorship level credit diffusion. We further find that researcher level graph-ranking methods may cause misallocation of scientific credit, but paper level graph-ranking methods do not.

It simultaneously considers the certainty of the clustering model and the continuity with the last clustering model in the clustering process. An iterative optimization algorithm is proposed to solve an optimal solution of the objective function with some constraints.

To reduce the dimension, a number of approaches based on rough-set theory have been proposed.

To deal with the first issue, we make some extensions to discernibility matrix so that it can work with continuous features. To cut down running time, we employ centroids rather than examples to construct discernibility matrix, which reduce the time complexity from O (T 2 W) to O (K 2 W) where T denotes the size of training examples, K denotes the number of training classes and W denotes the size of vocabulary.

In addition, we attempted to detect novelty by computing semantic distance between sentences using WordNet.For the Web track, we improved the basic SMART system, and the Lnu-Ltu weighting method was introduced into the system. The improved system has been proved to be effective in last year\u2019s task.

{"title": "What we vote for? Answer selection from user expertise view in community question answering\n", "abstract": " Answer selection is an important problem in community question answering (CQA), as it enables the distilling of reliable information and knowledge. Most existing approaches tackle this problem as a text matching task. However, they ignore the influence of the community in voting the best answers. Answer quality is highly correlated with semantic relevance and user expertise in CQA. In this paper, we formalize the answer selection problem from the user expertise view, considering both the semantic relevance in question-answer pair and user expertise in question-user pair. We design a novel matching function, explicitly modeling the influence of user expertise in community acceptance. Moreover, we introduce latent user vectors into the representation learning of answer, capturing the implicit topic interests in learned user vectors.

Existing studies either focus on modeling the process of information diffusion, e.g., independent cascade model and linear threshold model, or investigate information diffusion in networks with certain structural characteristics such as scale-free networks and small world networks. However, there are still several phenomena that have not been captured by existing information diffusion models. One of the prominent phenomena is the reemergence of information diffusion, i.e., a piece of information reemerges after the completion of its initial diffusion process. In this paper, we propose an optimized information diffusion model by introducing a new informed state into traditional susceptible\u2013infected\u2013removed model.

{"title": "Marked temporal dynamics modeling based on recurrent neural network\n", "abstract": " We are now witnessing the increasing availability of event stream data, i.e., a sequence of events with each event typically being denoted by the time it occurs and its mark information (e.g., event type). A fundamental problem is to model and predict such kind of marked temporal dynamics, i.e., when the next event will take place and what its mark will be. Existing methods either predict only the mark or the time of the next event, or predict both of them, yet separately. Indeed, in marked temporal dynamics, the time and the mark of the next event are highly dependent on each other, requiring a method that could simultaneously predict both of them. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose to model marked temporal dynamics by using a mark-specific intensity function to explicitly capture the dependency between the mark and the time of the next event.

{"title": "Market confidence predicts stock price: Beyond supply and demand\n", "abstract": " Stock price prediction is an important and challenging problem in stock market analysis. Existing prediction methods either exploit autocorrelation of stock price and its correlation with the supply and demand of stock, or explore predictive indictors exogenous to stock market. In this paper, using transaction record of stocks with identifier of traders, we introduce an index to characterize market confidence, i.e., the ratio of the number of traders who is active in two successive trading days to the number of active traders in a certain trading day. Strong Granger causality is found between the index of market confidence and stock price. We further predict stock price by incorporating the index of market confidence into a neural network based on time series of stock price. Experimental results on 50 stocks in two Chinese Stock Exchanges demonstrate that the accuracy of stock price prediction is significantly improved by the inclusion of the market confidence index. This study sheds light on using cross-day trading behavior to characterize market confidence and to predict stock price.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Make it possible: multilingual sentiment analysis without much prior knowledge\n", "abstract": " Sentiment analysis is a hard problem, while multilingual sentiment analysis is even harder due to the different expression styles in different languages. Although many methods for multilingual sentiment analysis have been developed in the open literature, most of them suffer from two major problems. The first is their excessive dependence on external tools or resources (e.g., Machine translation systems or bilingual dictionaries), which may not be readily obtained, especially for minority languages, The second is conflictive sentiments, i.e., The sentiment polarity of some parts of a text is inconsistent with its overall sentiment polarity. It is observed that in a product or service review there usually exist a few sentences which play a more important role in determining its sentiment polarity, as compared to others. Therefore, differentiating key sentences from trivial ones may be helpful to improve sentiment analysis\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

Finding bursty topics from microblogs is an important task to understand the current events which attract a large number of Internet users. However, the existing methods suitable for news articles aren't adopted directly for microblogs, because microblogs have unique characteristics compared with formal texts, including diversity, dynamic and noise. In this paper, a new detection method for microblog bursty topic is proposed based on momentum model. The meaningful strings are extracted from micorblog posts in the special time window as the microblog dynamic features. The dynamic characteristics of these features are modeled by the principle of momentum. The velocity, accelerated velocity and momentum of the features are defined by the dynamic frequencies at different dimensions. The bursty features are detected with the combination of momentum, variation trend and second order change rate. By merging the detected bursty features with mutual information, the bursty topics are obtained. The experiments are conducted on a real Sina microblog data set containing around 526 thousand posts of 1000 users, and results show that the proposed method improves the precision and recall remarkably compared with the conventional methods. The proposed method could be well applied in online bursty topic detection for microblog information.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Listwise approach for rank aggregation in crowdsourcing\n", "abstract": " Inferring a gold-standard ranking over a set of objects, such as documents or images, is a key task to build test collections for various applications like Web search and recommender systems. Crowdsourcing services provide an efficient and inexpensive way to collect judgments via labeling by sets of annotators. We thus study the problem of finding a consensus ranking from crowdsourced judgments. In contrast to conventional rank aggregation methods which minimize the distance between predicted ranking and input judgments from either pointwise or pairwise perspective, we argue that it is critical to consider the distance in a listwise way to emphasize the position importance in ranking. Therefore, we introduce a new listwise approach in this paper, where ranking measure based objective functions are utilized for optimization. In addition, we also incorporate the annotator quality into our model since the reliability\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "An improvement of the fast uncovering community algorithm\n", "abstract": " Community detection methods have been used in computer, sociology, physics, biology, and brain information science areas. Many methods are based on the optimization of modularity. The algorithm proposed by Blondel et al.(Blondel VD, Guillaume JL, Lambiotte R and Lefebvre E 2008 J. Stat. Mech. 10 10008) is one of the most widely used methods because of its good performance, especially in the big data era. In this paper we make some improvements to this algorithm in correctness and performance. By tests we see that different node orders bring different performances and different community structures. We find some node swings in different communities that influence the performance. So we design some strategies on the sweeping order of node to reduce the computing cost made by repetition swing.

The Tweets2011 corpus is used again and last year s results can be used as first officially labeled data for any participants to train their models. In this year s track, the former task has60 new queries given and the latter is first proposed. In the Real-time Adhoc task, we use indri retrieval toolkit to construct our retrieval system and propose a strategy of pseudo relevance feedback to expand original query, then we retrieved original tweets and their indri s scores as an important feature. Besides, we calculate lots of other features of these tweets, such abouturl, hashtag, entropy, tfidf, bm25, language model and proximity. At last, we use two learning-to-rank methods, specifically RankSVM and ListNet, to combine all those featuresto sort them, returning the final ranked tweets to a specified query. In the Real-time Filtering task, we assuming this task is similar with the topic tracking in Twitter Stream, we build up two filtering models based on language model and Vector Space Model respectively. Each model is initialized by the start query and its relevant tweets. For each new coming tweet, the model will decide whether it is under the topic. If it is, we update the model to keep up with the development of the topic. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the preprocessing of Tweets2011 corpus.

Masquerade detection is now one of the major concerns of system security research. This paper proposes a novel method to distinguish legitimate users from masqueraders based on shell commands and multiple behavior pattern mining. In the method, behavioral patterns of legitimate users are characterized by shell command sequences of different lengths, and hierarchical sequence supports are employed to construct the normal behavior profiles of legitimate users, which improve the precision and adaptability of user profiling. In the detection stage, a model based on multiple sequence pattern parallel mining and multiple threshold joint decision is used to determine whether the monitored user\u2019s behavior is normal or anomalous\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

The dual form solution of a linear Ranking SVM model can be written as a linear combination of the preference pairs, i.e., w = \u03a3 (i,j)  \u03b1 ij  x i -x j ), where \u03b1 ij  denotes the Lagrange parameters associated with each preference pair (i,j). It is observed that there exist obvious interactions among the document pairs because two preference pairs could share a same document as their items, e.g., preference pairs (d 1 ,d 2 ) and (d 1 ,d 3 ) share the document d 1 . Thus it is natural to ask if there also exist interactions over the model parameters \u03b1 ij , which may be leveraged to construct better ranking models. This paper aims to answer the question.

In such a case, a text document can be viewed as a bag-of-word-embeddings (BoWE), and the remaining question is how to obtain a fixed-length vector representation of the document for efficient document process. Beyond those heuristic aggregation methods, recent work has shown that one can leverage the Fisher kernel (FK) framework to generate document representations based on BoWE in a principled way. In this work, words are embedded into a Euclidean space by latent semantic indexing (LSI), and a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is employed as the generative model for nonlinear FK-based aggregation.

Recently, reinforcement learning has been successfully applied to multi-hop relation reasoning (i.e., path reasoning). And, a kind of practical path reasoning, in the form of query answering (e.g., (entity, relation, ?)), has been proposed and attracted much attention. However, existing methods for such type of path reasoning focus on relation selection and underestimate the importance of entity selection during the reasoning process.

{"title": "Learning Concise Representations of Users' Influences through Online Behaviors.\n", "abstract": " Whereas it is well known that social network users influence each other, a fundamental problem in influence maximization, opinion formation and viral marketing is that users\u2019 influences are difficult to quantify. Previous work has directly defined an independent model parameter to capture the interpersonal influence between each pair of users. However, such models do not consider how influences depend on each other if they originate from the same user or if they act on the same user. To do so, these models need a parameter for each pair of users, which results in high-dimensional models becoming easily trapped into the overfitting problem. Given these problems, another way of defining the parameters is needed to consider the dependencies. Thus we propose a model that defines parameters for every user with a latent influence vector and a susceptibility vector. Such low-dimensional and distributed representations naturally cause the interpersonal influences involving the same user to be coupled with each other, thus reducing the model\u2019s complexity. Additionally, the model can easily consider the sentimental polarities of users\u2019 messages and how sentiment affects users\u2019 influences. In this study, we conduct extensive experiments on real Microblog data, showing that our model with distributed representations achieves better accuracy than the state-of-the-art and pair-wise models, and that learning influences on sentiments benefit performance.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Modelling heterogeneous information spreading abilities of social network ties\n", "abstract": " Information spreading is often analyzed comparatively on small-world and random networks. Topological differences between small-world networks and random networks are believed to be main reasons that lead to various different spreading behaviours on these two types of networks.

In this study, we analyze the impacts of the heterogeneity on information spreading over small-world networks and random networks. Through simulations on both artificial and realistic networks, we find that the strong heterogeneity leads to lower efficiency of spreading over small-world networks. The heterogeneity not only slows down the spreading pace, but also lengthens the life span of the information spread over small-world networks.

However, the ultimate goal of query recommendation is to assist users to reformulate queries so that they can accomplish their search task successfully and quickly.

The motivation of our work comes from an interesting observation that a same ranking algorithm may show very different sensitivities to label noise over different data sets. We thus investigate the underlying reason for this observation based on three typical kinds of learning to rank algorithms (i.e. pointwise, pairwise and listwise methods) and three public data sets (i.e. OHSUMED, TD2003 and MSLR-WEB10K) with different properties.

{"title": "Sentiment classification analysis based on extraction of sentiment key sentence\n", "abstract": " A key problem of sentiment analysis is to determine the polarity of a review is positive (thumbs up) or negative (thumbs down). Unlike topic-based text classification, where a high accuracy can be achieved, the sentiment classification is a hard and complicated task. One of the main challenges for document-level sentiment classification is that not every part of the document is equally informative for inferring the polarity of the whole document. Thus, making a distinction between key sentences and trivial sentences will be helpful to improve the sentiment classification performance. We divide a document into key sentences and detailed sentences. Key sentence is usually brief but discriminative while detailed sentences are diverse and ambiguous. For key sentence extraction, our approach takes three attributes into account: sentiment attribute, position attribute and special words attribute. To make use of the discrepancy and complementarity of key sentences and detailed sentences, we incorporate key sentences and detailed sentences in supervised and semi-supervised learning. In supervised sentiment classification, a classifier combination approach is adopted because the original document is divided into two different and complementary parts; in semi-supervised sentiment classification, a co-training algorithm is proposed to incorporate unlabeled data for sentiment classification. Experimental results across eight domains show that our approach performs better than the baseline method and the key sentence extraction is effective.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

Greater lookahead usually brings better performance. However, in the simulation of computer networks, lookahead is usually determined by the minimal delay of the border links between any two subnets that simulated by different sequential logical processes (LPs), which is too small to get good performance. Traditionally, the lookahead exploitation usually only reflects the parallelism among LPs, which possibly wastes the potential parallelism inside each LP, especially, in the case that each LP simulates thousands of entities. Here we present a simple method called micro-synchronization to exploit the parallelism inside each LP. Different from the previous work, such as lookahead accumulation and local time warp, we keep the traditional usage of lookahead among LPs unchanged, and however, we impose the relaxed sequential event scheduling\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

{"title": "Event coreference resolution with their paraphrases and argument-aware embeddings\n", "abstract": " Event coreference resolution aims to classify all event mentions that refer to the same real-world event into the same group, which is necessary to information aggregation and many downstream applications. To resolve event coreference, existing methods usually calculate the similarities between event mentions and between specific kinds of event arguments. However, they fail to accurately identify paraphrase relations between events and may suffer from error propagation while extracting event components (ie, event mentions and their arguments). Therefore, we propose a new model based on Event-specific Paraphrases and Argument-aware Semantic Embeddings, thus called EPASE, for event coreference resolution. EPASE recognizes deep paraphrase relations in an event-specific context of sentences and can cover event paraphrases of more situations, bringing about a better generalization. Additionally, the embeddings of argument roles are encoded into event embedding without relying on a fixed number and type of arguments, which results in the better scalability of EPASE. Experiments on both within-and cross-document event coreference demonstrate its consistent and significant superiority compared to existing methods.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Label-Consistency based Graph Neural Networks for Semi-supervised Node Classification\n", "abstract": " Graph neural networks (GNNs) achieve remarkable success in graph-based semi-supervised node classification, leveraging the information from neighboring nodes to improve the representation learning of target node. The success of GNNs at node classification depends on the assumption that connected nodes tend to have the same label. However, such an assumption does not always work, limiting the performance of GNNs at node classification. In this paper, we propose label-consistency based graph neural network (LC-GNN), leveraging node pairs unconnected but with the same labels to enlarge the receptive field of nodes in GNNs. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the proposed LC-GNN outperforms traditional GNNs in graph-based semi-supervised node classification. We further show the superiority of LC-GNN in sparse scenarios with only a handful of labeled nodes.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Learning binary hash codes for fast anchor link retrieval across networks\n", "abstract": " Users are usually involved in multiple social networks, without explicit anchor links that reveal the correspondence among different accounts of the same user across networks. Anchor link prediction aims to identify the hidden anchor links, which is a fundamental problem for user profiling, information cascading, and cross-domain recommendation. Although existing methods perform well in the accuracy of anchor link prediction, the pairwise search manners on inferring anchor links suffer from big challenge when being deployed in practical systems. To combat the challenges, in this paper we propose a novel embedding and matching architecture to directly learn binary hash code for each node. Hash codes offer us an efficient index to filter out the candidate node pairs for anchor link prediction.

{"title": "Question headline generation for news articles\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we introduce and tackle the Question Headline Generation (QHG) task. The motivation comes from the investigation of a real-world news portal where we find that news articles with question headlines often receive much higher click-through ratio than those with non-question headlines. The QHG task can be viewed as a specific form of the Question Generation (QG) task, with the emphasis on creating a natural question from a given news article by taking the entire article as the answer. A good QHG model thus should be able to generate a question by summarizing the essential topics of an article. Based on this idea, we propose a novel dual-attention sequence-to-sequence model (DASeq2Seq) for the QHG task. Unlike traditional sequence-to-sequence models which only employ the attention mechanism in the decoding phase for better generation, our DASeq2Seq further introduces a self-attention\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

To address this problem, we propose a two-stage algorithm for domain adaptation. At the first transition stage, we share the information between the source domain and the target domain to get some most confidently labeled documents in the target domain, and at the second transmission stage, we exploit them to label the target-domain data via following the intrinsic structure revealed by the target domain.

Taking account of this limitation, in this paper, we propose an iterative reinforcement learning approach for cross-domain sentiment classification by simultaneously utilizing documents and words from both source domain and target domain. Our new method can make full use of the reinforcement between documents and words by fusing four kinds of relationships between documents and words.

The topic model, referred as RCTM (Regularized Correlated Topic Model), is an extension of the conventional CTM (Correlated Topic Model). RCTM learns a topic model by leveraging weak supervision from existing annotated data rather than in an unsupervised fashion, and thus it can effectively address the problem in topic modeling while the topics are predefined.

We further propose a neural network model, NeuInfer, for knowledge inference on n-ary facts. Besides handling the common task to infer an unknown element in a whole fact, NeuInfer can cope with a new type of task, flexible knowledge inference.

We investigate the clique of trading network, and find the number and weight of clique are greater in manipulated stocks than that in non-manipulated stocks. We further propose a method to detect colluded traders based on weight of cliques. Results demonstrate that our method is effective at distinguishing the manipulated stocks and the colluded traders.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

{"title": "Ease the process of machine learning with dataflow\n", "abstract": " Machine learning algorithms have become the key components in many big data applications. However, the full potential of machine learning is still far from been realized because using machine learning algorithms is hard, especially on distributed platforms such as Hadoop and Spark. The key barriers come from not only the implementation of the algorithms themselves, but also the processing for applying them to real applications which often involve multiple steps and different algorithms. In this demo we present a general-purpose dataflow-based system for easing the process of applying machine learning algorithms to real world tasks. In the system, a learning task is formulated as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in which each node represents an operation (eg, a machine learning algorithm), and each edge represents the flow of the data from one node to its descendants.

{"title": "Semantic regularities in document representations\n", "abstract": " Recent work exhibited that distributed word representations are good at capturing linguistic regularities in language. This allows vector-oriented reasoning based on simple linear algebra between words. Since many different methods have been proposed for learning document representations, it is natural to ask whether there is also linear structure in these learned representations to allow similar reasoning at document level. To answer this question, we design a new document analogy task for testing the semantic regularities in document representations, and conduct empirical evaluations over several state-of-the-art document representation models. The results reveal that neural embedding based document representations work better on this analogy task than conventional methods, and we provide some preliminary explanations over these observations.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

In this article, we present a heuristic algorithm to solve obstacle-avoiding octilinear Steiner minimal tree (OAOSMT) construction problem. We first construct an obstacle-free Euclidean minimal spanning tree (OFEMST). Then two lookup tables about OFEMST's edge are generated, which can provide fast information inquiry for subsequent steps. Next, an obstacle-avoiding strategy is proposed to convert OFEMST into an obstacle-avoiding octilinear Steiner tree (OAOST). Finally, we design an excellent refinement technique, which can further reduce the wirelengh. Experiments show that both wirelengh and runtime of our algorithm are the best compared to the previous algorithms.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Detecting overlapping communities in massive networks\n", "abstract": " Community detection is an essential work for network analysis. However, few methods could be used as off-the-shelf tools to detect communities in real-world networks for two main reasons: Real networks often contain millions of nodes or even hundreds of millions of nodes while most methods cannot handle networks at this scale. One node often belongs to multiple communities, posing another big challenge. In this paper, we circumvent the tricky problem of detecting overlapping communities using a two-stage framework, balancing efficiency and accuracy. Given a network, we first focus on efficiently finding its coarse-grained communities. Starting from them, we next obtain overlapping communities by optimizing a principled objective function. In this divide-and-conquer way, the framework achieves a much better performance than detecting overlapping communities from scratch.

Numerical simulations are performed on the two examples with different parameter settings, and the results indicates that SEG can be used as a metaphor for investigating the evolution of social networks in some scenarios.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

Privacy leak behavior has thus become an important research issue of cyber security. However, existing approaches can only qualitatively analyze privacy leak behavior of software applications. No quantitative approach, to the best of our knowledge, has been developed in the open literature. To fill this gap, in this paper we propose for the first time four quantitative metrics, namely, possibility, severity, crypticity, and manipulability, for privacy leak behavior analysis based on Privacy Petri Net (PPN). In order to compare the privacy leak behavior among different software, we further propose a comprehensive metric, namely, overall leak degree, based on these four metrics. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using real-world software applications. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach can quantitatively analyze the privacy leak behaviors of various software types and reveal their characteristics from different aspects.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "A noise-tolerant graphical model for ranking\n", "abstract": " This paper studies how to learn accurate ranking functions from noisy training data for information retrieval. Most previous work on learning to rank assumes that the relevance labels in the training data are reliable. In reality, however, the labels usually contain noise due to the difficulties of relevance judgments and several other reasons. To tackle the problem, in this paper we propose a novel approach to learning to rank, based on a probabilistic graphical model. Considering that the observed label might be noisy, we introduce a new variable to indicate the true label of each instance. We then use a graphical model to capture the joint distribution of the true labels and observed labels given features of documents. The graphical model distinguishes the true labels from observed labels, and is specially designed for ranking in information retrieval. Therefore, it helps to learn a more accurate model from noisy training\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

One branch of the RL approaches to ranking formalize the process of ranking with Markov decision process~(MDP) and determine the model parameters with policy gradient. Though preliminary success has been shown, these approaches are still far from achieving their full potentials. Existing policy gradient methods directly utilize the absolute performance scores (returns) of the sampled document lists in its gradient estimations, which may cause two limitations: 1) fail to reflect the relative goodness of documents within the same query, which usually is close to the nature of IR ranking; 2) generate high variance gradient estimations, resulting in slow learning speed and low ranking accuracy.

In the \u03b1NLI task, two observations are given and the most plausible hypothesis is asked to pick out from the candidates. Existing methods simply formulate it as a classification problem, thus a cross-entropy log-loss objective is used during training. However, discriminating true from false does not measure the plausibility of a hypothesis, for all the hypotheses have a chance to happen, only the probabilities are different. To fill this gap, we switch to a ranking perspective that sorts the hypotheses in order of their plausibilities. With this new perspective, a novel L2R2 approach is proposed under the learning-to-rank framework. Firstly, training samples are reorganized into a ranking form, where two observations and their hypotheses are treated as the query and a set of candidate documents\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

In this paper, we present a novel data augmentation method for neural machine translation. Different from previous augmentation methods that randomly drop, swap or replace words with other words in a sentence, we softly augment a randomly chosen word in a sentence by its contextual mixture of multiple related words. More accurately, we replace the one-hot representation of a word by a distribution (provided by a language model) over the vocabulary, i.e., replacing the embedding of this word by a weighted combination of multiple semantically similar words. Since the weights of those words depend on the contextual information of the word to be replaced, the newly generated sentences capture much richer information than previous augmentation methods. Experimental results on both small scale and large scale machine translation datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over strong baselines.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

The motivation of our work comes from an interesting observation that a same ranking algorithm may show very different sensitivities to label noise over different data sets. We thus investigate the underlying reason for this observation based on two typical kinds of learning to rank algorithms (ie~ pairwise and listwise methods) and three different public data sets (ie~ OHSUMED, TD2003 and MSLR-WEB10K).

{"title": "Exploring the query-flow graph with a mixture model for query recommendation\n", "abstract": " Query recommendation has been recognized as an important tool that helps users in their information seeking activities. Many existing approaches leveraged the rich Web query logs to generate query recommendations. Recently, the query-flow graph, an aggregated representation of session information in query logs, has shown its utility in query recommendation. However, there are two major problems in directly using query-flow graph for recommendation. On one hand, due to the sparsity of the graph, one may not well handle the recommendation for many dangling queries in the graph. On the other hand, without addressing the ambiguous intents in such an aggregated graph, one may generate recommendations either with multiple intents mixed together which are difficult to consume, or dominated by certain intent which cannot satisfy different user needs. In this paper, we propose to explore the queryflow graph with a mixture model for better query recommendation. Specifically, we propose a novel mixture model that describes the generation of the query-flow graph. With this model, we can identify the hidden intents of queries from the graph. We then apply an intent-biased random walk over the graph for query recommendation. In this way, we can well resolve the above two problems. Some primary experiments on real query logs show the effectiveness of our approaches as compared with baseline methods.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

Retrieving blogger\u2019s opinion on lead story and hot topic is very important for applications such as market survey, network public opinion discovery and warning. The goal of blog opinion retrieval is to retrieve the blog post that not only relate to given query but also has comment on the query. The paper introduces probabilistic inference model into blog opinion retrieval, and presents an algorithm based on probabilistic inference model. The model combines topical scoring and sentiment scoring to a uniform probabilistic inference theory model, could effectively reveal the topical facets between blog post and query and the strength of sentiments about the given query and then combine the resulting topical score and sentiment score to constitute final score. Experiment result shows that the algorithm could effectively model the topical facets and sentiments, and could also identify the opinions about given query.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

{"title": "SDGNN: Learning Node Representation for Signed Directed Networks\n", "abstract": " Network embedding is aimed at mapping nodes in a network into low-dimensional vector representations. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received widespread attention and lead to state-of-the-art performance in learning node representations. However, most GNNs only work in unsigned networks, where only positive links exist. It is not trivial to transfer these models to signed directed networks, which are widely observed in the real world yet less studied. In this paper, we first review two fundamental sociological theories (i.e., status theory and balance theory) and conduct empirical studies on real-world datasets to analyze the social mechanism in signed directed networks. Guided by related sociological theories, we propose a novel Signed Directed Graph Neural Networks model named SDGNN to learn node embeddings for signed directed networks. The proposed model simultaneously reconstructs link signs, link directions, and signed directed triangles. We validate our model's effectiveness on five real-world datasets, which are commonly used as the benchmark for signed network embedding. Experiments demonstrate the proposed model outperforms existing models, including feature-based methods, network embedding methods, and several GNN methods.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

Recently, the query-flow graph has shown its utility in query recommendation. However, there are two major problems in directly using query-flow graph for recommendation.

On the other hand, without addressing the ambiguous intents in such an aggregated graph, one may generate recommendations either with multiple intents mixed together or dominated by certain intent. In this paper, we propose a novel mixture model that describes the generation of the query-flow graph. With this model, we can identify the hidden intents of queries from the graph.

As is well known, the entities on the web are embedded not only in the natural language text, but also in the tables and lists. Given a query, both the candidate entities and relevant tableslists are extracted from web documents. Then the candidate entities extracted from unstructured text are ranked based on a probabilistic model. But the result contains a lot of noise. If some candidate entities are in a relevant tablelist, they are more relevant to the given query. And Vice versa, if a tablelist contains several candidate entities, it is also more relevant to the query.

{"title": "Recommending diverse and relevant queries with a manifold ranking based approach\n", "abstract": " Query recommendation has been considered as an effective way to help search users in their information seeking activities. Traditional approaches mainly focused on recommending alternative queries with close search intent to the original query. However, to only take the relevance into account may generate redundant recommendations which provide almost the same information for users. Therefore, it is important to provide diverse as well as relevant query recommendations. In this way, we are able to cover multiple potential search intents of users and attract more clicks over recommendations. Besides, previous query recommendation approaches mostly relied on measuring the relevance or similarity between queries in the Euclidean space. However, there is no convincing evidence that the query space is Euclidean. Therefore, it is more natural and reasonable to assume that the query space is a manifold. In this paper, we aim to recommend diverse and relevant queries based on the intrinsic query manifold. We propose a unified model, named manifold ranking with stop points, for query recommendation. Specifically, by introducing stop points into query manifold, our approach can iteratively rank queries for recommendation by simultaneously considering both diversity and relevance between queries in an unified way.

In particular, for real-time generation tasks, different devices require generators of different sizes due to varying computing power. In this paper, we introduce slimmable GANs (SlimGANs), which can flexibly switch the width of the generator to accommodate various quality-efficiency trade-offs at runtime. Specifically, we leverage multiple discriminators that share partial parameters to train the slimmable generator. To facilitate the \\textit{consistency} between generators of different widths, we present a stepwise inplace distillation technique that encourages narrow generators to learn from wide ones. As for class-conditional generation, we propose a sliceable conditional batch normalization that incorporates the label information into different widths. Our methods are validated, both quantitatively and qualitatively, by extensive experiments and a detailed ablation study.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

Yet, existing methods either partially leverage such context information or combine different types of contexts using a global weighting scheme, failing to capture the phenomenon that the importance of each context is also context-dependent rather than the same for all recommendation.

{"title": "Anomaly detection in Bitcoin market via price return analysis\n", "abstract": " The Bitcoin market becomes the focus of the economic market since its birth, and it has attracted wide attention from both academia and industry. Due to the absence of regulations in the Bitcoin market, it may be easier to bring some kinds of illegal behaviors. Thus, it raises an interesting question: Is there abnormity or illegal behavior in Bitcoin platforms? To answer this question, we investigate the abnormity in five leading Bitcoin platforms. By analyzing the financial index, i.e. the normalized logarithmic price return, we find that the properties of price return in bitFlyer are completely different from others. To find the possible reasons, we find that the abnormal ask price and bid price appear simultaneously in bitFlyer, which may be potentially linked to either price manipulation or money laundering. It verifies our conjecture that there may be abnormity or price manipulation in Bitcoin platforms. Furthermore, our findings in price return could also provide an innovative and effective method to detect the abnormity in Bitcoin platforms.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Modeling information diffusion with the external environment in social networks\n", "abstract": " This paper addresses the problem of modeling the information diffusion in social networks. We are motivated by the phenomenon that individuals can receive information from the external environment, which possibly causes the transition of individuals\u2019 states. Most of existing models are based on the assumption that information spread through social interactions between individuals in the interior network, but few attention is paid to the change of states due to the information obtaining from the external environment. This paper proposes an External Environment Involved Information Diffusion Model (EEIIDM) by integrating the effect of the external environment. Mechanisms of state transition are utilized to describe the information diffusion. Theoretical analyses of the model are carried out in both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks, demonstrating that all individuals are informed at the equilibrium when the external environment is introduced. Furthermore, simulation results show that the external environment makes the diffusion process less sensitive to the initial spreader.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

{"title": "Rumor detection in social media based on a hierarchical attention network\n", "abstract": " For rumor detection in social media, the majority of feature-representation-based studies capture textual features or global users features according to a partitioned sequence of microblogs. However, these studies ignore the time-series information across the microblogs in one time interval. Moreover, the latent textual information and the local users information, which have been proven effective according to the traditional machine learning methods, are overlooked in capturing the time intervals features, resulting in low performance. Therefore, we propose a rumor detection method in social media based on a hierarchical attention network. First, microblogs are partitioned into several time intervals. Then, the variation of information across the microblogs changing over time is learned using a bidirectional gated recurrent unit neural network with an attention mechanism. After that, the variation of features across the microblogs is combined with hand-crafted features to incorporate latent textual information and local users information into the time intervals features. Finally, we capture features variation across the time intervals by using the bidirectional gated recurrent unit neural network, with the attention mechanism, and classify microblog events. Experimental results over two public datasets, Sina Weibo and Twitter, show that the proposed method outperforms (in terms of the accuracy) state-of-the-art methods by 1.5% and 1.4% over the two datasets, respectively, and it is effective for rumor detection.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

However, there are many particular structures, and can be employed to promote the performance of link prediction. One typical structure in knowledge graphs is hierarchical structure, which existing\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Locally smoothed neural networks\n", "abstract": " Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and the locally connected layer are limited in capturing the importance and relations of different local receptive fields, which are often crucial for tasks such as face verification, visual question answering, and word sequence prediction. To tackle the issue, we propose a novel locally smoothed neural network (LSNN) in this paper. The main idea is to represent the weight matrix of the locally connected layer as the product of the kernel and the smoother, where the kernel is shared over different local receptive fields, and the smoother is for determining the importance and relations of different local receptive fields. Specifically, a multi-variate Gaussian function is utilized to generate the smoother, for modeling the location relations among different local receptive fields. Furthermore, the content information can also be leveraged by setting the mean and precision of the Gaussian function according to the content. Experiments on some variant of MNIST clearly show our advantages over CNN and locally connected layer.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Detect online review spammers based on comprehensive trustiness propagation model\n", "abstract": " Review spammers detection is an important task in social media sentiment analysis. Previous works employ reviewer behaviors such as text similarities, duplications and rating patterns to indentify suspicious spammers. However, there are still other kinds of abnormal spamming activities which could not be detected by the available techniques. This paper proposes a review spammer detection approach combining both TrustRank and Anti-TrustRank propagation algorithm to identify review spammers. Firstly, a twolayer heterogeneous review relation graph is constructed to capture the relationships among reviewers and products. Secondly, a TrustRank based propagation model and an Anti-TrustRank based propagation model are established to calculate the reviewers\u2019 trustiness value and the reviewers\u2019 anti-trustiness value respectively.

{"title": "Learning to predict links by integrating structure and interaction information in microblogs\n", "abstract": " Link prediction in microblogs by using unsupervised methods has been studied extensively in recent years, which aims to find an appropriate similarity measure between users in the network. However, the measures used by existing work lack a simple way to incorporate the structure of the network and the interactions between users. This leads to the gap between the predictive result and the ground truth value. For example, the F1-measure created by the best method is around 0.2. In this work, we firstly discover the gap and prove its existence. To narrow this gap, we define the retweeting similarity to measure the interactions between users in Twitter, and propose a structural-interaction based matrix factorization model for following-link prediction. Experiments based on the real-world Twitter data show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

{"title": "Cross-language opinion lexicon extraction using mutual-reinforcement label propagation\n", "abstract": " There is a growing interest in automatically building opinion lexicon from sources such as product reviews. Most of these methods depend on abundant external resources such as WordNet, which limits the applicability of these methods. Unsupervised or semi-supervised learning provides an optional solution to multilingual opinion lexicon extraction. However, the datasets are imbalanced in different languages. For some languages, the high-quality corpora are scarce or hard to obtain, which limits the research progress. To solve the above problems, we explore a mutual-reinforcement label propagation framework. First, for each language, a label propagation algorithm is applied to a word relation graph, and then a bilingual dictionary is used as a bridge to transfer information between two languages. A key advantage of this model is its ability to make two languages learn from each other and boost each other. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms baseline significantly.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

A popular approach to top-k ranking problem is based on probabilistic models, such as Luce model and Mallows model. However, whether the sequential generative process described in these models is a suitable way for top-k ranking remains a question. According to the riffled independence factorization proposed in recent literature, which is a natural structural assumption on top-k ranking, we propose a new generative process of top-k ranking data. Our approach decomposes distributions over the top-k ranking into two layers: the first layer describes the relative ordering between the top k objects and the rest nk objects, and the second layer describes the full ordering on the top k objects.

The framework is to decompose one multi-class problem into multiple binary problems and then learn the individual binary classification problems by centroid classifier. However, this kind of decomposition incurs considerable bias for centroid classifier, which results in noticeable degradation of performance for centroid classifier. In order to address this issue, we use Model-Refinement strategy to adjust this so-called bias. The basic idea is to take advantage of misclassified examples in the training data to iteratively refine and adjust the centroids of text data.

This approach builds inverted index to reflect changes in the collection it describes, supporting efficient document insertions and deletions. A fast on-line index construction method based on dynamic balancing tree is proposed. This method takes a merge-based approach and aims to keep a good performance during indexing and query processing by always merging indices with similar sizes. This is achieved by using a tree in which each node corresponds to one sub-index. The placing of sub-indexes in the tree depends on the sizes of the sub-indexes, so that each merging takes place among similarly sized sub-indexes. The method is suited very well not only for growing text collections, but also for dynamic text collections, and is a uniform framework for merge-based index maintenance strategies. It is more general, faster and scales better than previous methods, and can be adapted to suit different balances of insertion and querying operations. Using experiments on large scale Web data, the efficiency, flexibility and scalability of this method are demonstrated in practice, showing that on-line index construction for growing text collections can be performed efficiently and almost as fast as for static text collections.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

{"title": "B-PROP: Bootstrapped Pre-training with Representative Words Prediction for Ad-hoc Retrieval\n", "abstract": " Pre-training and fine-tuning have achieved remarkable success in many downstream natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Recently, pre-training methods tailored for information retrieval (IR) have also been explored, and the latest success is the PROP method which has reached new SOTA on a variety of ad-hoc retrieval benchmarks. The basic idea of PROP is to construct the \\textit{representative words prediction} (ROP) task for pre-training inspired by the query likelihood model. Despite its exciting performance, the effectiveness of PROP might be bounded by the classical unigram language model adopted in the ROP task construction process. To tackle this problem, we propose a bootstrapped pre-training method (namely B-PROP) based on BERT for ad-hoc retrieval. The key idea is to use the powerful contextual language model BERT to replace the classical unigram language model for the ROP task construction, and re-train BERT itself towards the tailored objective for IR. Specifically, we introduce a novel contrastive method, inspired by the divergence-from-randomness idea, to leverage BERT's self-attention mechanism to sample representative words from the document. By further fine-tuning on downstream ad-hoc retrieval tasks, our method achieves significant improvements over baselines without pre-training or with other pre-training methods, and further pushes forward the SOTA on a variety of ad-hoc retrieval tasks.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Semantic Models for the First-stage Retrieval: A Comprehensive Review\n", "abstract": " Multi-stage ranking pipelines have been a practical solution in modern search systems, where the first-stage retrieval is to return a subset of candidate documents, and the latter stages attempt to re-rank those candidates. Unlike the re-ranking stages going through quick technique shifts during the past decades, the first-stage retrieval has long been dominated by classical term-based models. Unfortunately, these models suffer from the vocabulary mismatch problem, which may block the re-ranking stages from relevant documents at the very beginning. Therefore, it has been a long-term desire to build semantic models for the first-stage retrieval that can achieve high recall efficiently. Recently, we have witnessed an explosive growth of research interests on the first-stage semantic retrieval models. We believe it is the right time to survey the current status, learn from existing methods, and gain some insights for future development. In this paper, we describe the current landscape of semantic retrieval models from three major paradigms, paying special attention to recent neural-based methods. We review the benchmark datasets, optimization methods and evaluation metrics, and summarize the state-of-the-art models.

{"title": "Transformation Driven Visual Reasoning\n", "abstract": " This paper defines a new visual reasoning paradigm by introducing an important factor, ie transformation. The motivation comes from the fact that most existing visual reasoning tasks, such as CLEVR in VQA, are solely defined to test how well the machine understands the concepts and relations within static settings, like one image. We argue that this kind of state driven visual reasoning approach has limitations in reflecting whether the machine has the ability to infer the dynamics between different states, which has been shown as important as state-level reasoning for human cognition in Piaget's theory. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel transformation driven visual reasoning task. Given both the initial and final states, the target is to infer the corresponding single-step or multi-step transformation, represented as a triplet (object, attribute, value) or a sequence of triplets, respectively. Following this definition, a new dataset namely TRANCE is constructed on the basis of CLEVR, including three levels of settings, ie Basic (single-step transformation), Event (multi-step transformation), and View (multi-step transformation with variant views). Experimental results show that the state-of-the-art visual reasoning models perform well on Basic, but are still far from human-level intelligence on Event and View. We believe the proposed new paradigm will boost the development of machine visual reasoning. More advanced methods and real data need to be investigated in this direction.

{"title": "Adversarial immunization for improving certifiable robustness on graphs\n", "abstract": " Despite achieving strong performance in the semi-supervised node classification task, graph neural networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, similar to other deep learning models. Existing research works either focus on developing robust GNN models or attack detection methods against attacks on graphs. However, little research attention is paid to the potential and practice of immunization to adversarial attacks on graphs. In this paper, we formulate the problem of graph adversarial immunization as a bilevel optimization problem, i.e., vaccinating an affordable fraction of node pairs, connected or unconnected, to improve the certifiable robustness of the graph against any admissible adversarial attack. We further propose an efficient algorithm, called AdvImmune, which optimizes meta-gradient in a discrete way to circumvent the computationally expensive combinatorial optimization when solving the adversarial immunization problem. Experiments are conducted on two citation networks and one social network. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed AdvImmune immunization method remarkably improves the fraction of robust nodes by 12%, 42%, 65%, with an affordable immune budget of only 5% edges.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

However, such models do not consider how influences depend on each other if influences are sent from the same user or if influences are received by the same user. Therefore, we propose a model that defines parameters for every user with a latent influence vector and a susceptibility vector, opposite to define influences on user pairs.

To accelerate the training process, researchers proposed to use the asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (A-SGD) method in model learning.

Moreover, A-SGD often converges to a high loss value and results in lower model accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm called Trend-Smooth which can be adapted to the asynchronous parallel environment to overcome the above problems.

However, most existing methods detect dense blocks in a static graph or a snapshot of dynamic graphs, which need to inefficiently rerun the algorithms for a streaming graph. Moreover, some works on streaming graphs are either consuming much time on updating algorithm for every incoming edge, or spotting the whole snapshot of a graph instead of the attacking sub-block. Therefore, we propose a row-augmented matrix with sliding window to model a streaming graph, and design the AugSV D algorithm for computation-and memory-efficient singular decomposition. EigenP ulse is then proposed to spot the density surges in streaming graphs based on the singular spectrum. We theoretically analyze the robustness of our method.

{"title": "SparkCRF: a parallel implementation of CRFs algorithm with spark\n", "abstract": " Condition random fields has been successfully applied to various applications in text analysis, such as sequence labeling, Chinese words segmentation, named entity recognition, and relation extraction in nature language processing. The traditional CRFs tools in single-node computer meet many challenges when dealing with large-scale texts. For one thing, the personal computer experiences the performance bottleneck; For another, the server fails to tackle the analysis efficiently. And upgrading hardware of the server to promote the capability of computing is not always feasible due to the cost constrains. To tackle these problems, in light of the idea of \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d, we design and implement SparkCRF, which is a kind of distributed CRFs running on cluster environment based on Apache Spark. We perform three experiments using NLPCC2015 and the 2nd International Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff datasets, to evaluate SparkCRF from the aspects of performance, scalability and accuracy. Results show that: 1) compared with CRF++, SparkCRF runs almost 4 times faster on our cluster in sequence labeling task; 2) it has good scalability by adjusting the number of working cores; 3) furthermore, SparkCRF has comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art CRF tools, such as CRF++ in the task of text analysis.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Extracting attribute values for named entities based on global feature\n", "abstract": " Attribute-value extraction is an important and challenging task in information extraction, which aims to automatically discover the values of attributes of named entities. In this paper, we focus on extracting these values from Chinese unstructured text. In order to make models easy to compute, current major methods of attribute-value extraction use only local feature. As a result, it may not make full use of global information related to attribute values. We propose a novel approach based on global feature to enhance the performance of attribute-value extraction. Two types of global feature are defined to capture the extra information beyond local feature, which are boundary distribution feature and value-name dependency feature. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to acquire attribute values utilizing global feature. Then a new perceptron algorithm is proposed that can use all types of global feature. The proposed algorithm can learn the parameters of local feature and global feature simultaneously. Experiments are carried out on different kinds of attributes of some entity categories. Experimental results show that both precision and recall of our proposed approach are significantly higher than CRF model and averaged perceptron with only local feature. The proposed approach has a good generalization capability on open-domain.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

Therefore, a new constrained nonnegative tensor factorization method combining user\u2019s opinion and the topical relevance was proposed. The method represented user\u2019s comment relations as 3-order tensor, factorized the comments tensor constrained by Laplacian topical matrix, and then measures user influence according to the latent factors resulting from the tensor factorization. Thus, the new method not only was capable to effectively calculate the strength of user social influence on given topic, but also kept the polarity allocation of social influence.

{"title": "Modelling priority queuing systems with varying service capacity\n", "abstract": " Many studies have been conducted to investigate the performance of priority queuing (PQ) systems with constant service capacity. However, due to the time-varying nature of wireless channels in wireless communication networks, the service capacity of queuing systemsmay vary over time. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the performance of PQ systems in the presence of varying service capacity. In addition, self-similar traffic has been discovered to be a ubiquitous phenomenon in various communication networks, which poses great challenges to performance modelling of scheduling systems due to its fractal-like nature. Therefore, this paper develops a flow-decomposition based approach to performance modelling of PQ systems subject to self-similar traffic and varying service capacity. It specifically proposes an analytical model to investigate queue length distributions of individual traffic flows. The\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Static greedy: solving the apparent scalability-accuracy dilemma in influence maximization\n", "abstract": " Influence maximization, defined as the problem of finding a set of seed nodes maximizing the spread of influence, is crucial to viral marketing on social networks. For practical viral marketing on large-scale social networks, it is required that influence maximization algorithms have both guaranteed accuracy and high scalability. However, existing algorithms suffer an apparent scalability-accuracy dilemma: Greedy algorithm and its improvements have guaranteed accuracy but are not scalable, while the accuracy of scalable heuristic algorithms is unstable and not guaranteed. In this paper, we focus on resolving this scalability-accuracy dilemma. We first find that the submodularity is unguaranteed in existing implementations of greedy algorithm, caused by the independence among Monte Carlo simulations conducted in different iterations of greedy algorithm. A large number of Monte Carlo simulations are thus required in existing greedy algorithms to alleviate the impact of unguaranteed submodularity. Motivated by this critical finding, we propose a static greedy algorithm to strictly guarantee the submodularity property, by reusing the results of Monte Carlo simulations during the whole process of greedy algorithm. As a result, the proposed algorithm achieves the same accuracy with the state-of-the-art greedy algorithms, while the number of Monte Carlo simulations needed is dramatically reduced by two orders of magnitude. Moreover, we give a dynamic update strategy to further improve the static greedy algorithm, by applying which our algorithm becomes comparable to the most scalable heuristic algorithm.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

{"title": "Effective and efficient? Bilingual sentiment lexicon extraction using collocation alignment\n", "abstract": " Bilingual sentiment lexicon is fundamental resource for cross-language sentiment analysis but its compilation remains a major bottleneck in computational linguistics. Traditional word alignment algorithm faces with the status of large alignment space, which may introduce redundant computations as well as alignment errors. In this paper, we use collocation alignment to extract bilingual sentiment lexicon overcoming the drawbacks of word alignment. The idea of collocation alignment is inspired by the strong cohesion between feature words and opinion words in sentiment corpus. Experimental results show that our approach not only decreases the computing time dramatically but also improves the precision of extracted bilingual word pairs due to the smaller alignment space.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

{"title": "Identify Sentiment-Objects from Chinese Sentences Based on Skip Chain Conditional Random Fields Model\n", "abstract": " Sentiment-objects Extraction aims to identify the targets of opinion described in sentiment sentence. Previous research fails to deal with the long-distance dependencies in Chinese sentences such as opinion targets repeated and echo of the different part of sentence. In this paper, we describe a probabilistic approach that incorporates the long-distance dependencies to identify opinion targets. The skip-chain Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) is used to model the long distance dependencies between sentiment sentences such as the repeated word and similar expression. Experiments show that our method outperforms linear-chain CRFs based method, and it is effective to identify opinion targets from Chinese sentences.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Social network analysis on kad and its application\n", "abstract": " In recent years, peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing applications (e.g., eMule) have dominated the Internet. eMule deploys its distributed network (i.e., KAD) based on Kademlia, a robust distributed hash table (DHT) protocol, to facilitate the delivery of content. In this paper, we conduct a series of analyses on the social network of KAD which is formed based on the information of how peers share files in KAD. Our analyses reveal many interesting characteristics of KAD. We further discuss the uses and misuses of these characteristics. Especially, we propose a novel approach to improve the routing performance of KAD based on the characteristic of its community structure.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Decayed DivRank for Guided Summarization.\n", "abstract": " Guided summarization is essentially an aspect-based multi-document summarization, where aspects can be taken as specified queries in summarization. We proposed a novel ranking algorithm, Decayed DivRank (DDRank) for guided summarization tasks of TAC2011. DDRank can address relevance, importance, diversity, and novelty simultaneously through a decayed vertex-reinforced random walk process in sentence ranking. With sentence ranked by DDRank, top-ranked sentences are supposed to be able to present aspect-related, important, diverse, and novel information contained in documents. Hence, we can select the top-ranked sentences as summary candidates directly. Aspects are approximately obtained by pLSA, and are adopted to generate sentence prior for DDRank in our approach.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Cross\ue011 Domain Opinion Analysis Based on Random\ue011 Walk Model\n", "abstract": " Nowadays, more and more people express their opinions on products, books, movies, etc. at review sites, forums, discussion groups, blogs and so on. Determining the opinion of a given document from Web (that is, opinion analysis) has drawn much attention. To guarantee the accuracy of opinion analysis, many methods for opinion analysis require abundant labeled data. But the labeled data in different domains are very imbalanced. So in recent years, some studies have been conducted to deal with cross-domain opinion analysis problems. However, most of the attempts rely on only the labeled documents or the labeled sentiment words, so this kind of methods fail to uncover the full knowledge between the documents and the sentiment words. This paper proposes an approach for cross-domain opinion analysis based on random-walk model by simultaneously utilizing documents and words from both source domain and target domain. The approach can make full use of the mutual reinforcement between documents and words by fusing four kinds of relationships between documents and words, that is, the relationships between documents, the relationships between words, the relationships between words and documents, and the relationships between documents and words. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm could improve the performance of cross-domain opinion analysis dramatically. The average accuracy of the proposed approach is about 15% higher than traditional classifiers, and about 7% higher than the state-of-the-art method.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

{"title": "Modeling users' information goal transitions and satisfaction judgment: Understanding the full search process\n", "abstract": " To improve web search effectiveness and help personalized search applications, it is important to understand users' search process, especially the underlying information goal transitions and satisfaction judgment on result pages. Unlike previous work modeling the two types of hidden information separately, the paper proposes to simultaneously model them based on users' full search process, including both queries and clicks. Thus, a full model can be built up and the dependences between them can be leveraged. Specially, we employ a hierarchical conditional random field (HCRF) for learning and prediction, with fruitful search activity features proposed and leveraged. Experimental results show that our approach reaches a high overall precision(87%) and significantly outperforms the baseline methods.

{"title": "Masquerade Detection Based on Shell Commands and Multiple Behavior Pattern Mining [J]\n", "abstract": " Masquerade attacks are attempts by unauthorized users to gain access to confidential data or greater access privileges, while pretending to be legitimate users. Masquerade detection is now one of the major concerns of system security research. This paper proposes a novel method to distinguish legitimate users from masqueraders based on shell commands and multiple behavior pattern mining. In the method, behavioral patterns of legitimate users are characterized by shell command sequences of different lengths, and hierarchical sequence supports are employed to construct the normal behavior profiles of legitimate users, which improve the precision and adaptability of user profiling. In the detection stage, a model based on multiple sequence pattern parallel mining and multiple threshold joint decision is used to determine whether the monitored user's behavior is normal or anomalous. The model gives attention to both detection accuracy and computational efficiency, and is especially applicable for on-line detection. This study empirically demonstrated the promising performance of the method, and it has succeeded in getting application in practical host-based intrusion detection systems.[Fund]: \u56fd\u5bb6 \u201c\u516b\u516d\u4e09\u201d \u9ad8\u6280\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u5c55\u8ba1\u5212\u9879\u76ee\u57fa\u91d1 (2006AA01Z452);; \u56fd\u5bb6 242 \u4fe1\u606f\u5b89\u5168\u8ba1\u5212\u9879\u76ee\u57fa\u91d1 (2005C39);; \u56fd\u5bb6 \u201c\u4e5d\u4e03\u4e09\u201d \u91cd\u70b9\u57fa\u7840\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u5c55\u89c4\u5212\u9879\u76ee\u57fa\u91d1 (2004CB318109) \u8d44\u52a9~~", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

For a target node, ANAE first aggregates the attribute information from its attributed local subgraph, obtaining its low-dimensional representation. Next, ANAE diffuses the representation of the target node to nodes in its local subgraph to reconstruct their attributes. Such an encoder-decoder framework allows the learned representations to better preserve the context information manifested in both network structure and node attributes, thus having high capacity to learn good node representations for attributed network.

However, most studies focus on predicting NE several hours before the NE event occurs (e.g., right after childbirth), which does not provide sufficient time to institute effective interventions. A prior study leveraged regularized logistic regression models along with electronic health records (EHRs) to predict NE before childbirth.

{"title": "Coupled Graph Neural Networks for Predicting the Popularity of Online Content\n", "abstract": " Predicting the popularity of online content in social network is an important problem for the practice of information dissemination, advertising, and recommendation. Previous methods mainly leverage demographics, temporal and structural patterns of early adopters for popularity prediction. These methods ignore the interaction between early adopters and potential adopters or the interactions among potential adopters over social networks. Consequently, they fail to capture the cascading effect triggered by early adopters in social networks, and thus have limited predictive power. In this paper, we consider the problem of network-aware popularity prediction, leveraging both early adopters and social networks among users for popularity prediction. We propose a novel method, namely Coupled-GNNs, which use two coupled graph neural networks to capture the cascading effect in information diffusion. One graph neural network models the interpersonal influence, gated by the adoption state of users. The other graph neural network models the adoption state of users via interpersonal influence from their neighbors. Through such an iterative aggregation of the neighborhood, the proposed method naturally captures the cascading effect of information diffusion in social networks.

{"title": "Fast Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search via k-Diverse Nearest Neighbor Graph\n", "abstract": " Approximate nearest neighbor search is a fundamental problem and has been studied for a few decades. Recently graph-based indexing methods have demonstrated their great efficiency, whose main idea is to construct neighborhood graph offline and perform a greedy search starting from some sampled points of the graph online. Most existing graph-based methods focus on either the precise k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) graph which has good exploitation ability, or the diverse graph which has good exploration ability. In this paper, we propose the k-diverse nearest neighbor (k-DNN) graph, which balances the precision and diversity of the graph, leading to good exploitation and exploration abilities simultaneously. We introduce an efficient indexing algorithm for the construction of the k-DNN graph inspired by a well-known diverse ranking algorithm in information retrieval (IR). Experimental results show that our method can outperform both state-of-the-art precise graph and diverse graph methods.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Evolutionary analysis on information sharing behavior in social networks based on social evolutionary game\n", "abstract": " In order to understand the evolutionary mechanisms on social networks, we investigate the evolution of information sharing behavior on directed and dynamic social networks using social evolutionary games, in which agents aim to improve their short-term utility and long-term reputation by imitating the most successful strategy from their partners and adjusting their partnerships, respectively. The public goods game is used as a metaphor for the interactions of agents on social networks. The results of numerical simulations reveal the effects of the frequency of partner adjusting, reputation pursuit and group effects on the evolution of social networks. Finally, an application of social evolutionary games on SinaWeibo is conducted, which may help us understand the mechanism behind the evolution of social networks.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

{"title": "Tsk-shell: An algorithm for finding topic-sensitive influential spreaders\n", "abstract": " Discovering influential spreaders is a valuable task in social networks, especially for the popularity prediction and analysis of online contents on microblogs, such as Twitter and Weibo. The k-shell decomposition (k-core), which identifies influential spreaders located in the core of a network, attracts more attention due to its simpleness and effectiveness compared with various related methods, such as indegree, betweenness centrality and PageRank. However, k-shell method only considers the factor of the network position of nodes and ignores the impacts of the content itself in information diffusion. The content itself plays an important role in the process of diffusion. For example, ones just retweet their interested tweets in microblogs. The spread ability of users depends not only on topology structures but also on the published contents, and therefore a unified model considering the two aspects simultaneously is proposed to model users' influence. Specifically, the topics hidden in user generated contents (UGC) are exploited to model the users' propagation probability and a topic-sensitive k-shell (tsk-shell) decomposition algorithm is proposed. Experimental studies on a real Twitter dataset show that the tsk-shell outperforms traditional k-shell by 40% on average in the task of finding top k influential users, which proves the effectiveness of the tsk-shell algorithm.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

{"title": "Modeling Parameter Interactions in Ranking SVM\n", "abstract": " Ranking SVM, which formalizes the problem of learning a ranking model as that of learning a binary SVM on preference pairs of documents, is a state-of-the-art ranking model in information retrieval. The dual form solution of Ranking SVM model can be written as a linear combination of the preference pairs, ie, w=\u2211(i, j) \u03b1 ij (x i-x j), where \u03b1ij denotes the Lagrange parameters associated with each pair (i, j). It is obvious that there exist significant interactions over the document pairs because two preference pairs could share a same document as their items. Thus it is natural to ask if there also exist interactions over the model parameters \u03b1 ij, which we may leverage to propose better ranking model. This paper aims to answer the question. Firstly, we found that there exists a low-rank structure over the Ranking SVM model parameters \u03b1 ij, which indicates that the interactions do exist. Then, based on the discovery, we\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

{"title": "A survey on cloud accountability\n", "abstract": " Recent advances in cloud computing technology now allow users to access data wherever they are. However, with these advances come some costs: cloud data is often stored and manipulated by remote machines that users have no access to. Moreover, cloud service providers often claim that their data is safe and secure, but users rarely have ways to make sure. Based on recent academic and industrial research, this paper surveys various approaches cloud service companies can make to ensure proper accountability. The paper focuses on issues such as cloud accountability framework, data confidentiality, and user privacy. More importantly, we also put forth some efficiency advice.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Structure inference and prediction in the co-evolution of social networks\n", "abstract": " The co-evolution theory of relationship structure and interaction structure is an important issue in social networks. From this theory we can understand the change of relationship structure, evolution of interaction topology and the mutual influence between them, furthermore it can help us predict public sentiment and then control the network development. Because there are numerous interactions that could be observed and some real and latent relationships always cannot be gotten, inferring hidden relationship structure and predicting future relationships or actions become hot topics, which are also one way to uncover the principle of co-evolution. We summarize the research work of structure inference and prediction on social networks in this paper. We firstly give the definitions of co-evolution, structure inference and prediction, and analyze the relationship between them.

{"title": "A unified framework for cross-domain sentiment classification\n", "abstract": " Sentiment classification of documents aims to determine the opinion (eg, negative or positive) of a given document. Existing studies have shown that, usually, supervised classification approaches perform well in sentiment classification. However, in most cases, the existing labeled data and the unlabeled data don\u2019t belong to the same domain. And the performance of sentiment classification decreases sharply when transferred from one domain to another domain. This causes cross-domain sentiment classification, which is a very significant problem and getting more and more attention. A unified framework is proposed, which integrates several stages for cross-domain sentiment classification. Firstly, we utilize the accurate labels of source-domain documents to get the initial labels of target-domain documents. Then, we build the target domain as a weighted network, and choose some target-domain documents whose opinions are determined more accurately as \u201csource components\u201d and \u201csink components\u201d. Further, we apply heat conduction process to the weighted network to improve the performance of cross-domain sentiment classification of target-domain data, with the help of \u201csource components\u201d and \u201csink components\u201d. An experiment is conducted using data from three different domains, and we transfer between two of them. The experiment results indicate that the proposed framework could improve the performance of cross-domain sentiment classification dramatically.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

In tweets, users can share interesting messages to their friends by retweeting (RT), push some tweets to specific users using@ mention, and indicate the topics of their tweets using# hashtags. The short-text characteristic and social attributes such as RT,@ mention and# hashtags, make traditional problems, like search, rank, and recommendation etc, quite different in microblogging settings.Microblog track was first introduced in 2011, and ICTNET group have participated in this track three times [2, 7]. In this year\u2019s track, only the realtime ad-hoc search task, which was also proposed in 2011 and 2012, was open for submission. This task requires to retrieve all the tweets that are relevant to query Q and before time T. Unlike the past two years, in which participants had to collect the corpus themselves, microblog track was first provided as a service this year, and participants could access the corpus through official APIs, which made it possible for the organizers to increase the size of corpus from 16M tweets to 260M tweets, which were collected via the Twitter streaming API over a two-month period.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Long tail query recommendation based on query intent\n", "abstract": " Query recommendation is an important tool for improving searching efficiency. Traditional recommendation methods were mainly care about the frequent queries, but cannot provide good recommendations for long tail queries due to the information sparsity. Without consideration of query intents, traditional methods generated the recommendations for long tail queries, which can be greatly influenced by noise words in queries. A novel probabilistic mixture model of term-query graph was proposed in this paper, which can clearly identify query intents of users. Otherwise, a new method of assembling query intents into recommendation was introduced in the paper, which can prevent the influence from noise words by merging the recommendations of word in newcoming query according to query intents naturally. The result of experiments show the relevance of long tail query recommendation can be greatly improved by taking account of query intent.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

It is critically important for celebrity recommendation to understand which factors and how these factors affect the probability that the recommended celebrities will be accepted. In this paper, taking the Tecent Weibo as a case, we try to empirically tackle the untold story behind the celebrity recommendation in micro-blogging network. We studied the three potential factors, namely the popularity of the recommended celebrities, the structural similarity and the topical similarity between the recommend celebrity and the target user. As shown by experimental results, the popularity of the celebrity and the structural similarity well reflect whether the recommended celebrity is accepted by the target user, whereas the topical similarity is not a good indicator as\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

Existing approaches allow users to add or delete only one query keyword at each step, which cannot meet the demands for semantic-rich navigation operations. Moreover, the lack of efficient algorithms for generating dynamic categories makes faceted navigation non-scalable to large datasets. This paper proposes a hierarchical concept lattice for modeling the relationship between different navigation states. Then, a series of navigation operations are proposed to support more flexible transitions between navigation states and hence achieve more effective knowledge discovery. To guarantee real-time response, this paper also devises an efficient algorithm L-Miner for mining and indexing the hierarchical concept lattice.

{"title": "Detecting near duplicate messages in twitter\n", "abstract": " Microblog is a very new concept of web 2.0. The most important microblog system in use is Twitter, with more than 160 million users all over the world. For now, Twitter is one of the most influential voices of the globe, its users including celebrities, well-known politicians and first-order companies. The length of the messages in Twitter is short, and the contents of the messages are very likely to be informal in syntax or grammar. Moreover, Twitter does not strictly define the syntax of retweet, which causes the existence of a great number of near duplicate messages. These near duplicate messages can be a waste of storage resources, and can greatly reduce the user experience of Twitter. In this paper, the syntax of retweet messages is analyzed, and a method is presented to remove the retweet symbols of messages using the analyzed results. In addition, two text distance calculating methods character statistics and shortest editing distance are proposed to cluster the Twitter messages into groups of near duplicate messages. We also analyze the log-in method and characteristics of twitter's messages. Through a series of experiments, we prove that our methods are efficient, extensible and easy to implement, and can be used to discover and filter the near duplicate messages in microblogs.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

{"title": "Research on cross-domain opinion analysis\n", "abstract": " This paper focuses on the opinion analysis of documents, ie to determine the overall opinion (eg, negative or positive) of a given document. Existing studies have shown that, the supervised classification approaches usually perform well in this task. However, in most cases, the performance decreases sharply when the model is transferred from the labeled data domain to a different target domain without labeled data. This raises the issue of cross-domain opinion analysis. In this paper, we propose an iterative algorithm which integrated the opinion orientations of the documents into the graph-ranking algorithm for cross-domain opinion analysis. We apply the graph-ranking algorithm using the accurate labels of old-domain documents as well as the\" pseudo\" labels of new-domain documents. Over the results of the iterative algorithm, we try to further improve the performance by choosing the test documents whose opinions have been determined more accurately as\" seeds\", and applying the EM algorithm again for cross-domain opinion analysis.

{"title": "Towards Consumer Loan Fraud Detection: Graph Neural Networks with Role-Constrained Conditional Random Field\n", "abstract": " Consumer loans, ie, loans to finance consumers to buy certain types of expenditures, is increasingly popular in ecommerce platform. Different from traditional loans with mortgage, online consumer loans only take personal credit as collateral for loans. Consequently, loan fraud detection is particularly critical for lenders to avoid economic loss. Previous methods mainly leverage applicant\u2019s attributes and historical behavior for loan fraud detection. Although these methods gain success at detecting potential charge-offs, yet they perform worse when multiple persons with various roles (eg, sellers, intermediaries) collude to apply fraudulent loan. To combat this challenge, we consider the problem of loan fraud detection via exploiting roles of users and multi-type social relationships among users. We propose a novel Graph neural network with a Role-constrained Conditional random field, namely GRC, to learn the representation of applicants and detect loan fraud based on the learned representation. The proposed model characterizes the multiple types of relationships via self-attention mechanism and employs conditional random field to constrain users with the same role to have similar representation. We validate the proposed model through experiments in large-scale auto-loan scenario. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves stateof-the-art results in loan fraud detection on Alipay, one online credit payment service serving more than 450 million users in China.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning Based on Evolutional Representation Learning\n", "abstract": " Knowledge Graph (KG) reasoning that predicts missing facts for incomplete KGs has been widely explored. However, reasoning over Temporal KG (TKG) that predicts facts in the future is still far from resolved. The key to predict future facts is to thoroughly understand the historical facts. A TKG is actually a sequence of KGs corresponding to different timestamps, where all concurrent facts in each KG exhibit structural dependencies and temporally adjacent facts carry informative sequential patterns. To capture these properties effectively and efficiently, we propose a novel Recurrent Evolution network based on Graph Convolution Network (GCN), called RE-GCN, which learns the evolutional representations of entities and relations at each timestamp by modeling the KG sequence recurrently. Specifically, for the evolution unit, a relation-aware GCN is leveraged to capture the structural dependencies within the KG at each timestamp. In order to capture the sequential patterns of all facts in parallel, the historical KG sequence is modeled auto-regressively by the gate recurrent components. Moreover, the static properties of entities such as entity types, are also incorporated via a static graph constraint component to obtain better entity representations. Fact prediction at future timestamps can then be realized based on the evolutional entity and relation representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the RE-GCN model obtains substantial performance and efficiency improvement for the temporal reasoning tasks on six benchmark datasets. Especially, it achieves up to 11.46\\% improvement in MRR for entity prediction with up to 82 times speedup\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

To tackle such a challenge, in this work, we introduce the Continual Domain Adaptation (CDA) task for MRC. So far as we know, this is the first study on the continual learning perspective of MRC.

{"title": "Dual-factor Generation Model for Conversation\n", "abstract": " The conversation task is usually formulated as a conditional generation problem, i.e., to generate a natural and meaningful response given the input utterance. Generally speaking, this formulation is apparently based on an oversimplified assumption that the response is solely dependent on the input utterance. It ignores the subjective factor of the responder, e.g., his/her emotion or knowledge state, which is a major factor that affects the response in practice. Without explicitly differentiating such subjective factor behind the response, existing generation models can only learn the general shape of conversations, leading to the blandness problem of the response. Moreover, there is no intervention mechanism within the existing generation process, since the response is fully decided by the input utterance.

{"title": "Online detection of anomaly behaviors based on multidimensional trajectories\n", "abstract": " In the surveillance domain, timely detection of anomaly behaviors is very important and is a great challenge to human operators due to information overload, fatigue and inattention. Many anomaly detection algorithms based on trajectories have been proposed for this problem. However, these algorithms generally have problems such as complex parameter setting, unfaithful statistical model, not well-calibrated false alarm rate, poor ability of online learning and sequential anomaly detection, etc. The theory of conformal prediction was introduced to solve these problems by constructing the sequential Hausdorff nearest neighbor conformal anomaly detector. Yet, it only considers position information of the targets and is not sensitive to velocity and course anomaly behaviors.

{"title": "An Adaptive Framework for Conversational Question Answering\n", "abstract": " In Conversational Question Answering (CoQA), humans propose a series of questions to satisfy their information needs. Based on our preliminary analysis, there are two major types of questions, namely verification questions and knowledgeseeking questions. The first one is to verify some existing facts, while the latter is to obtain new knowledge about some specific object. These two types of questions differ significantly in their answering ways. However, existing methods usually treat them uniformly, which may easily be biased by the dominant type of questions and obtain inferior overall performance. In this work, we propose an adaptive framework to handle these two types of questions in different ways based on their own characteristics.

{"title": "Differentiated distribution recovery for neural text generation\n", "abstract": " Neural language models based on recurrent neural networks (RNNLM) have significantly improved the performance for text generation, yet the quality of generated text represented by Turing Test pass rate is still far from satisfying. Some researchers propose to use adversarial training or reinforcement learning to promote the quality, however, such methods usually introduce great challenges in the training and parameter tuning processes. Through our analysis, we find the problem of RNNLM comes from the usage of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) as the objective function, which requires the generated distribution to precisely recover the true distribution. Such requirement favors high generation diversity which restricted the generation quality. This is not suitable when the overall quality is low, since high generation diversity usually indicates lot of errors rather than diverse good samples. In this paper, we propose to achieve differentiated distribution recovery, DDR for short. The key idea is to make the optimal generation probability proportional to the \u03b2-th power of the true probability, where \u03b2> 1. In this way, the generation quality can be greatly improved by sacrificing diversity from noises and rare patterns. Experiments on synthetic data and two public text datasets show that our DDR method achieves more flexible quality-diversity trade-off and higher Turing Test pass rate, as compared with baseline methods including RNNLM, SeqGAN and LeakGAN.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

One reason for the instability of off-policy learning is a discrepancy between the target () and behavior (b) policy distributions.

RIS has parameter  which controls smoothness. To cope with instability, we present the first relative importance sampling-off-policy actor-critic (RIS-Off-PAC) model-free algorithms in RL. In our method, the network yields a target policy (the actor), a value function (the critic) assessing the current policy () using samples drawn from behavior policy. We use action value generated from the behavior policy in reward function to train our algorithm rather than from the target policy. We also use deep neural networks to train both actor and critic.

However, few methods could be used as off-the-shelf tools to detect communities in real world networks for two reasons. On the one hand, most existing methods for community detection cannot handle massive networks that contain millions or even hundreds of millions of nodes. On the other hand, communities in real world networks are generally highly overlapped, requiring that community detection method could capture the mixed community membership. In this paper, we aim to offer an off-the-shelf method to detect overlapping communities in massive real world networks. For this purpose, we take the widely-used Poisson model for overlapping community detection as starting point and design two speedup strategies to achieve high efficiency. Extensive tests on synthetic and large scale real networks demonstrate that the proposed strategies speedup the community detection method based on Poisson model by 1 to 2 orders of magnitudes, while achieving comparable accuracy at community detection.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

{"title": "Learning Cost-Effective Social Embedding for Cascade Prediction\n", "abstract": " Given a message, cascade prediction aims to predict the individuals who will potentially retweet it. Most existing methods either exploit demographical, structural, and temporal features for prediction, or explicitly rely on particular information diffusion models. Recently, researchers attempt to design fully data-driven methods for cascade prediction (i.e., without requiring human-defined features or information diffusion models), directly leveraging historical cascades to learn interpersonal proximity and then making prediction based on the learned proximity. One widely-used method to represent interpersonal proximity is social embedding, i.e., each individual is embedded into a low-dimensional latent metric space. One challenging problem is to design cost-effective method to learn social embedding from cascades. In this paper, we propose a position-aware asymmetric embedding method to effectively learn\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

{"title": "Link inference in large scale evolutionable knowledge network\n", "abstract": " In the era of network big data, the spatiotemporal information of knowledge is richly stored in knowledge networks, such as the building time of links, the lifetime of vertices, etc. Traditional knowledge network representation models are mostly blind to either the spatial or the temporal information of vertices and links in the network. It has been verified in the literature that considering the spatial or the temporal information of vertices and links can promote the performance of link inference in knowledge networks. In this paper, we propose an evolutionable knowledge network model, ie, a heterogeneous knowledge network, in which vertices and edges are anchored in both time and space dimensions. Then based on the model, we further study the link inference problem on evolutionable knowledge networks. Specifically, we firstly define the link extendable patterns to characterize the link formation process, and then propose a knapsack constrained link inference method to turn the link inference problem into a combinatorial optimization problem with the knapsack-like constrains. The dynamic programming technique is used to solve the optimization problem in pseudo-polynomial time complexity. Experiments on real data sets suggest the better effectiveness and scalability of our proposed method over large-scale networks than the state-of-the-art methods.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

{"title": "Name Disambiguation by Collective Classification\n", "abstract": " Disambiguating person names in a set of documents (e.g.\u00a0research papers or Web pages) is a critical problem in many knowledge management applications. The phenomenon of ambiguity will deteriorate the quality of service, such as the scholar searching and expert finding. Despite years of research, this problem remains largely unsolved, where the unknown number of persons with the same name and the information scarcity in documents pose many difficulties and challenges. In this paper, we formalize name disambiguation as a collective classification problem and solve it using a simple yet effective iterative classification algorithm, referred as ICAND (i.e.\u00a0Iterative Classification Algorithm for Name Disambiguation). Experimental results on researcher dataset show that the proposed approach can significantly outperform several baseline methods.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

The approach contains two steps. The first step consists in an unsupervised technique which captures high frequency attributes from online encyclopedias. The second step discovers uncommon attributes with low frequency. Lastly, an integrated framework is proposed to obtain attributes and their synonymous attributes simultaneously. Experimental results show that the proposed approach boosts the coverage of extracted attributes without losing the precision.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Ranking tweets with local and global consistency using rich features\n", "abstract": " Ranking tweets is more challenging in Microblog search because of content sparseness and lack of context. Traditional ranking methods essentially using Euclidean distance are limited to local structure. Manifold structure helps to rank with local and global consistency. However such structure is empirically built on content similarity in an unsupervised way, suffering from sparseness while being adopted in tweet ranking. In this paper, we explore rich features to alleviate content sparseness problem, where time locality feature is proposed to consider context dependency. We then propose a supervised learning model that aggregates rich features to construct manifold structure. A learning algorithm is then designed for solving the model by minimizing the loss of labeled queries. At last we conduct a series of experiments to demonstrate the performance on 109 labeled queries from TREC Microblogging\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Local linear matrix factorization for document modeling\n", "abstract": " Mining low dimensional semantic representations of document is a key problem in many document analysis and information retrieval tasks. Previous studies show better representation mining results by incorporating geometric relationships among documents. However, existing methods model the geometric relationships between a document and its neighbors as independent pairwise relationship; while the pairwise relationship relies on some heuristic similarity/dissimilarity measures and predefined threshold. To address these problems, we propose a Local Linear Matrix Factorization (LLMF), for low dimensional representation learning.

For constructing a management system to satisfy a specific management requirement, a redevelopment solution based on existing management system is usually more practicable than developing the system from scratch. However, the difficulty and workload of redevelopment are also very high. As the architecture-based runtime model is causally connected with the corresponding running system automatically, constructing an integrated Cloud management system based on the architecture-based runtime models of Cloud resources can benefit from the model-specific natures, and thus reduce the development workload.

High delay and low delivery ratio are its major challenges because of the absence of a complete end-to-end path between source nodes to destination nodes. Although some protocols have been proposed, they usually ignore the action diversity, communication time and duration. In this paper we present a temporal-awareness dynamic routing protocol using order MPR (Multi Point Relays) methods for wireless multi-hop mobile networks. Ordered MPR is the minimum set of nodes that could connect one node\u2019s 2-hop neighbors, in which nodes are ordered by temporal information. Each node has its order MPR and it could update it adaptively with some adaptive rules. When transferring data, the node selects nodes with higher evaluation value from its MPR to relay. Because of the dynamic topology and to avoid the local decision ineffectiveness, we make the node also select one node from non MPR randomly at the same time. Experiments show that our method can not only reduce the average end-to-end delay but also improve the delivery ratio.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

Reactive routing reduces control overhead as it finds routes on demand. On the other hand, it also prolongs data packet delivery delay compared to proactive routing protocols. To leverage this problem, route cache techniques are employed to balance control overhead and data packet delivery delay. In this paper, we propose a reactive location-based predictive caching scheme. The essence of this caching scheme lies in the neat integration of reactive location-based link availability prediction and time-based entry removal mechanism. The integration guarantees that the valid cached routes are never removed while stale routes are removed with the minimum cost of network resources.

However, the security model in wired networks is not suited for WSNs because of their energy constraints. In this paper, a traffic prediction model based on gene expression programming (GEP-ADS) is proposed, to predict the time series of normal traffic. Then we present a lightweight anomaly detection scheme (ADS) in WSNs. In the ADS, no more cooperation between sensor nodes is required, which dramatically decrease the energy consumption. Another key advantage of our approach is that GEP-ADS could solve the problem that the traditional time series methods can't make an accurate prediction without the pre-knowledge. In order to evaluate our ADS, we have simulated several routing attacks, and fully discussed the parameter setting influence on our ADS.

MCP-1 expression was determined by real time RT-PCR. ROS production was measured by DCFDA fluorescence. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity was examined by lucigenin chemiluminescence. p47phox and p67phox translocation was assayed by Western blot. Twenty-four male mice were randomly divided into three groups: the control, the AngIIinfusion [AngII 400 ng/(kg. min)], and the apocynin treatment. AngII was infused by subcutaneously osmotic minipump for 14 days. Urinary albumin and 8-isoprostane excretion were measured by ELISA. In cultured human mesangial cells, AngII induced the MCP-1 expression in a dose-dependent manner with 3.56 fold increase as compared with the control. AngII increased intracellular ROS production as early as 3 min with the peak at 60 min and was in a time and dose-dependent. Incubation with different dosages of AngII (1 nmol/L, 10 nmol/L, and 100 nmol/L AngII) for 60 min, ROS production increased at 1.82, 2.92, and 4.08 folds respectively. AngII-induced ROS generation was sensitive to diphenyleneiodonium sulfate (DPI, 10 micromol/L) and apocynin (500 micromol/L), two structurally distinct NADPH oxidase inhibitors.

Most template detection methods utilize content repetition as a hint to detect template blocks that lots of Web pages are required as input. So they usually process Web pages in batches that a newly crawled page can not be processed until enough pages are collected. This consumes large storage consumption to cache Web pages and results in a huge delay in data refreshing. In this paper, we present an incremental framework to detect templates in which a page is processed as soon as it has been crawled. Under this framework, we donpsilat need to cache any Web page.

METHODS: For 883 hepatitis B patients with positive HBsAg, HBV-DNA was measured by COBAS AMPLICOR HBV MONITOR reagent and COBAS AMPLICOR quantitative PCR instrument. Microparticle enzyme immunoassay analysis (MEIA) was then carried out with fully automatic enzyme immunoassay analysis instrument made by Abbott Axsym from the US to measure HBeAg and anti-HBe. Correlation was analysed by SPSS. RESULTS:(1) Positive correlation between 690 HBV-DNA positive and HBeAg positive with r= 0. 505 (P< 0.01) was found with mean values as: HBV-DNA: 7.12 x 10 (12) copies/ml; HBeAg: 218.31 S/CO. HBV-DNA: 10 (4) copies/ml, HBeAg: 104 S/CO; HBV-DNA: 10 (5)-10 (8) copies/ml, HBeAg: 112 S/CO; HBV-DNA: 10 (9)-10 (15) copies/ml, HBeAg: 252 S/CO.(2) No correlation was found between 193 HBV-DNA and anti-HBe+ with r=-0.052 (P= 0.477> 0.05) with Mean: HBV-DNA: 8.0 x 10 (10) copies/ml anti-HBe: 0.18 S/CO. CONCLUSION: HBV-DNA and HBeAg appeared to have had linear correlation, showing that HBeAg> 100 S/CO, HBV-DNA> 10 (4) copies/ml and hepatitis B virus were reproduced. However, HBV-DNA did not show linear correlation with anti-HBe as HBeAg negative and anti-HBe positive, the level of hepatitis B viral replication decrease slightly. But the virus load is still high.

We have applied IBMTC to the E-mail traffic data captured at one of the largest commercial Internet service providers in China, and the experimental result indicates that the new scheme is more effective and can further improve the performance of filter", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

Theoretically, we prove that the debiasing performance can be damaged by inaccurate uncertainty estimations of the bias-only model. Empirically, we show that existing bias-only models fall short in producing accurate uncertainty estimations. Motivated by these findings, we propose to conduct calibration on the bias-only model, thus achieving a three-stage ensemble-based debiasing framework, including bias modeling, model calibrating, and debiasing.

{"title": "Pre-training of Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks for Popularity Prediction\n", "abstract": " Predicting the popularity of online content is a fundamental problem in various application areas. One practical challenge for popularity prediction takes roots in the different settings of popularity prediction tasks in different situations, e.g., the varying lengths of the observation time window or prediction horizon. In other words, a good model for popularity prediction is desired to handle various tasks with different settings. However, the conventional paradigm for popularity prediction is training a separate prediction model for each prediction task, and thus the obtained model for one task is difficult to be generalized to other tasks, causing a great waste of training time and computational resources. To solve this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel pre-training framework for popularity prediction, aiming to pre-train a general deep representation model by learning intrinsic knowledge about popularity dynamics from the readily available diffusion cascades. We design a novel pretext task for pre-training, i.e., temporal context prediction for two randomly sampled time slices of popularity dynamics, impelling the deep prediction model to effectively capture the characteristics of popularity dynamics. Taking the state-of-the-art deep model, i.e., temporal convolutional neural network, as an instantiation of our proposed framework, experimental results conducted on both Sina Weibo and Twitter datasets demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed pre-training framework for multiple popularity prediction tasks.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Are Neural Ranking Models Robust?\n", "abstract": " Recently, we have witnessed the bloom of neural ranking models in the information retrieval (IR) field. So far, much effort has been devoted to developing effective neural ranking models that can generalize well on new data. There has been less attention paid to the robustness perspective. Unlike the effectiveness which is about the average performance of a system under normal purpose, robustness cares more about the system performance in the worst case or under malicious operations instead. When a new technique enters into the real-world application, it is critical to know not only how it works in average, but also how would it behave in abnormal situations. So we raise the question in this work: Are neural ranking models robust? To answer this question, firstly, we need to clarify what we refer to when we talk about the robustness of ranking models in IR. We show that robustness is actually a multi-dimensional concept and there are three ways to define it in IR: 1) The performance variance under the independent and identically distributed (I.I.D.) setting; 2) The out-of-distribution (OOD) generalizability; and 3) The defensive ability against adversarial operations. The latter two definitions can be further specified into two different perspectives respectively, leading to 5 robustness tasks in total. Based on this taxonomy, we build corresponding benchmark datasets, design empirical experiments, and systematically analyze the robustness of several representative neural ranking models against traditional probabilistic ranking models and learning-to-rank (LTR) models. The empirical results show that there is no simple answer to our question. While\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

Among them, auxiliary classifier generative adversarial networks (AC-GAN) have been widely used, but suffer from the issue of low intra-class diversity on generated samples. In this paper, we point out that the fundamental reason is that the classifier of AC-GAN is generator-agnostic, and thus cannot provide informative guidance to the generator to approximate the target joint distribution, leading to a minimization of conditional entropy that decreases the intra-class diversity. Based on this finding, we propose novel cGANs with auxiliary discriminative classifier (ADC-GAN) to address the issue of AC-GAN. Specifically, the auxiliary discriminative classifier becomes generator-aware by distinguishing between the real and fake data while recognizing their labels.

{"title": "Self-supervised GANs with Label Augmentation\n", "abstract": " Recently, transformation-based self-supervised learning has been applied to generative adversarial networks (GANs) to mitigate the catastrophic forgetting problem of discriminator by learning stable representations. However, the separate self-supervised tasks in existing self-supervised GANs cause an inconsistent goal with generative modeling due to the learning of the generator from their generator distribution-agnostic classifiers. To address this issue, we propose a novel self-supervised GANs framework with label augmentation, i.e., augmenting the GAN labels (real or fake) with the self-supervised pseudo-labels. In particular, the discriminator and the self-supervised classifier are unified to learn a single task that predicts the augmented label such that the discriminator/classifier is aware of the generator distribution, while the generator tries to confuse the discriminator/classifier by optimizing the discrepancy between the transformed real and generated distributions. Theoretically, we prove that the generator, at the equilibrium point, converges to replicate the data distribution. Empirically, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms competitive baselines on both generative modeling and representation learning across benchmark datasets.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

Reasoning on TKGs that predicts potential facts (events) in the future brings great challenges to existing models. When facing a prediction task, human beings usually search useful historical information (i.e., clues) in their memories and then reason for future meticulously. Inspired by this mechanism, we propose CluSTeR to predict future facts in a two-stage manner, Clue Searching and Temporal Reasoning, accordingly. Specifically, at the clue searching stage, CluSTeR learns a beam search policy via reinforcement learning (RL) to induce multiple clues from historical facts. At the temporal reasoning stage, it adopts a graph convolution network based sequence method to deduce answers from clues. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate the substantial advantages of CluSTeR compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the clues found by CluSTeR further provide interpretability for the results.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

{"title": "AugSplicing: Synchronized Behavior Detection in Streaming Tensors\n", "abstract": " How can we track synchronized behavior in a stream of timestamped tuples, such as mobile devices installing and uninstalling applications in the lockstep, to boost their ranks in the app store? We model such tuples as entries in a streaming tensor, which augments attribute sizes in its modes over time. Synchronized behavior tends to form dense blocks (ie subtensors) in such a tensor, signaling anomalous behavior, or interesting communities. However, existing dense block detection methods are either based on a static tensor, or lack an efficient algorithm in a streaming setting. Therefore, we propose a fast streaming algorithm, AUGSPLICING, which can detect the top dense blocks by incrementally splicing the previous detection with the incoming ones in new tuples, avoiding re-runs over all the history data at every tracking time step. AUGSPLICING is based on a splicing condition that guides the algorithm (Section 4). Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method is (1) effective to detect fraudulent behavior in installing data of real-world apps and find a synchronized group of students with interesting features in campus Wi-Fi data;(2) robust with splicing theory for dense block detection;(3) streaming and faster than the existing streaming algorithm, with closely comparable accuracy.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

Most existing models, such as stochastic volatility models, focus mainly on price changes, neglecting the complex trading dynamics. Recently, there are increasing studies on order books, thanks to the availability of large-scale trading datasets, aiming to understand the underlying mechanisms governing the market dynamics. In this paper, we collect order-book datasets of Bitcoin platforms across three countries over millions of users and billions of daily turnovers. We find a 1+1D field theory, govern by a set of KPZ-like stochastic equations, predicts precisely the order book dynamics observed in empirical data. Despite the microscopic difference of markets, we argue the proposed effective field theory captures the correct universality class of market dynamics. We also show that the model agrees with the existing stochastic volatility models at the long-wavelength limit.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

{"title": "Structure Learning for Headline Generation\n", "abstract": " Headline generation is an important problem in natural language processing, which aims to describe a document by a compact and informative headline. Some recent successes on this task have been achieved by advanced graph-based neural models, which marry the representational power of deep neural networks with the structural modeling ability of the relational sentence graphs. The advantages of graph-based neural models over traditional Seq2Seq models lie in that they can encode long-distance relationship between sentences beyond the surface linear structure. However, since documents are typically weakly-structured data, modern graph-based neural models usually rely on manually designed rules or some heuristics to construct the sentence graph a prior. This may largely limit the power and increase the cost of the graph-based methods. In this paper, therefore, we propose to incorporate structure learning into the graph-based neural models for headline generation. That is, we want to automatically learn the sentence graph using a data-driven way, so that we can unveil the document structure flexibly without prior heuristics or rules. To achieve this goal, we employ a deep & wide network to encode rich relational information between sentences for the sentence graph learning. For the deep component, we leverage neural matching models, either representation-focused or interaction-focused model, to learn semantic similarity between sentences. For the wide component, we encode a variety of discourse relations between sentences.

In this paper we propose to tackle the challenge with Markov Decision Process in which the main content identification is formalized as sequential decision making and each action corresponds to selecting a sentence. Policy gradient is used to learn the model parameters. Experimental results based on MSMARCO showed that the proposed model, called MC-MDP, can select high quality main contents and significantly improved the performances of answer span prediction.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

As a consequence, the data are often incomplete. This is a challenge for learning effective predictive models, which only compounds in complexity in multivariate time series.

{"title": "Parameter Estimation with the Ordered \u21132 Regularization via an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers\n", "abstract": " Regularization is a popular technique in machine learning for model estimation and for avoiding overfitting. Prior studies have found that modern ordered regularization can be more effective in handling highly correlated, high-dimensional data than traditional regularization. The reason stems from the fact that the ordered regularization can reject irrelevant variables and yield an accurate estimation of the parameters. How to scale up the ordered regularization problems when facing large-scale training data remains an unanswered question. This paper explores the problem of parameter estimation with the ordered \u2113 2-regularization via Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), called ADMM-O \u2113 2. The advantages of ADMM-O \u2113 2 include (i) scaling up the ordered \u2113 2 to a large-scale dataset,(ii) predicting parameters correctly by excluding irrelevant variables automatically, and (iii) having a fast convergence rate. Experimental results on both synthetic data and real data indicate that ADMM-O \u2113 2 can perform better than or comparable to several state-of-the-art baselines.

{"title": "Generative Paragraph Vector\n", "abstract": " The recently introduced Paragraph Vector (PV) is an efficient method for learning high-quality distributed representations for texts. However, from the probabilistic view, PV is not a complete model since it only models the generation of words but not texts, leading to two major limitations. Firstly, without a text-level model, PV assumes the independence between texts and thus cannot leverage the corpus-wide information to help text representation learning. Secondly, without the generation model of texts, the inference of text representations outside of the training set becomes difficult. Although PV makes itself as an optimization problem so that one can obtain representations for new texts anyway, it loses the sound probabilistic interpretability in that way.

Recently, neural representations have shown great success in capturing semantic relatedness, leading to new possibilities to alleviate the vocabulary mismatch problem in IR. However, most existing efforts in this direction have been devoted to the re-ranking stage. That is to leverage neural representations to help re-rank a set of candidate documents, which are typically obtained from an initial retrieval stage based on some symbolic index and search scheme (e.g., BM25 over the inverted index). This naturally raises a question: if the relevant documents have not been found in the initial retrieval stage due to vocabulary mismatch, there would be no chance to re-rank them to the top positions later. Therefore, in this paper, we study the problem how to employ neural representations to improve the recall of relevant documents in the initial retrieval stage. Specifically, to meet the efficiency requirement of the initial stage, we introduce a neural index for the neural representations of documents, and propose two hybrid search schemes based on both neural and symbolic indices, namely the parallel search scheme and the sequential search scheme. Our experiments show that both hybrid index and search schemes can improve the recall of the initial retrieval stage with small overhead.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Reducing variance in gradient bandit algorithm using antithetic variates method\n", "abstract": " Policy gradient, which makes use of Monte Carlo method to get an unbiased estimation of the parameter gradients, has been widely used in reinforcement learning. One key issue in policy gradient is reducing the variance of the estimation. From the viewpoint of statistics, policy gradient with baseline, a successful variance reduction method for policy gradient, directly applies the control variates method, a traditional variance reduction technique used in Monte Carlo, to policy gradient. One problem with control variates method is that the quality of estimation heavily depends on the choice of the control variates. To address the issue and inspired by the antithetic variates method for variance reduction, we propose to combine the antithetic variates method with traditional policy gradient for the multi-armed bandit problem. Furthermore, we achieve a new policy gradient algorithm called Antithetic-Arm Bandit (AAB). In\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Spherical paragraph model\n", "abstract": " Representing texts as fixed-length vectors is central to many language processing tasks. Most traditional methods build text representations based on the simple Bag-of-Words (BoW) representation, which loses the rich semantic relations between words. Recent advances in natural language processing have shown that semantically meaningful representations of words can be efficiently acquired by distributed models, making it possible to build text representations based on a better foundation called the Bag-of-Word-Embedding (BoWE) representation. However, existing text representation methods using BoWE often lack sound probabilistic foundations or cannot well capture the semantic relatedness encoded in word vectors. To address these problems, we introduce the Spherical Paragraph Model (SPM), a probabilistic generative model based on BoWE, for text representation.

{"title": "A Composite Structure Based Method for Knowledge Base Taxonomy Matching\n", "abstract": " Taxonomy matching, ie, an operation of taxonomy merging across different knowledge bases, which aims to align common elements between taxonomies, has been extensively studied in recent years due to its wide applications in knowledge base population and proliferation. However, with the continuous development of network big data, taxonomies are becoming larger and more complex, and covering different domains. Therefore, to pose an effective and general matching strategy covering cross-domain or large-scale taxonomies is still a considerable challenge. In this paper, we presents a composite structure based matching method, named BiMWM, which exploits the composite structure information of class in taxonomy, including not only the micro-structure but also the macro-structure. BiMWM models the taxonomy matching problem as an optimization problem on a bipartite graph. It works in two stages: it firstly creates a weighted bipartite graph to model the candidate matched classes pairs between two taxonomies, then performs a maximum weight matching algorithm to generate an optimal matching for two taxonomies in a global manner. BiMWM runs in polynomial time to generate an optimal matching for two taxonomies. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods, and performs good adaptability in different domains and scales of taxonomies.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "ICTNET at TREC 2017 Real-Time Summarization Track.\n", "abstract": " Nowadays Twitter represents a successful social application and own billions of users, and there is a growing trend for recommending high quality message to users due to the business need. The Real-Time Summarization (RTS) track explores techniques for constructing real-time update summaries from social media streams in response to users' information needs. Our task then can be reduced to a recommendation system, actually it is a recommendation system based on data stream which has continuous and enormous message data of various types. As indicated by the name of the track, the main goal of this track is to solve the problem of making the recommendation real-time, relative and novel, which is exactly the demands of scenario A. For scenario B, posting the mail digest is like a compromise to scenario A, in this scenario, we only need to post a batch of tweets to users through email at the end of the day, which means there is no real-time limitation of scenario A, and this problem then can be reduced to traditional ad-hoc search problem. In this paper we mainly focus on scenario A and then conduct the solution of scenario B based on scenario A. Substantially, Scenario A can be interpreted as following problem: given user profiles (also known as topics) which is the abstraction of a certain crowd of people\u2019s interests, by monitoring the twitter steam data, we need to make real-time (as soon as the tweet is posted), relative and novel tweet recommendation to the corresponding profile once detected.

{"title": "Learning Sentimental Influences from Users' Behaviors\n", "abstract": " Modeling interpersonal influence on different sentimental polarities is a fundamental problem in opinion formation and viral marketing. There has not been seen an effective solution for learning sentimental influences from users' behaviors yet. Previous related works on information propagation directly define interpersonal influence between each pair of users as a parameter, which is independent from each others, even if the influences come from or affect the same user. And influences are learned from user's propagation behaviors, namely temporal cascades, while sentiments are not associated with them. Thus we propose to model the interpersonal influence by latent influence and susceptibility matrices defined on individual users and sentiment polarities. Such low-dimensional and distributed representations naturally make the interpersonal influences related to the same user coupled with each other, and in turn, reduce the model complexity. Sentiments act on different rows of parameter matrices, depicting their effects in modeling cascades. With the iterative optimization algorithm of projected stochastic gradient descent over shuffled mini-batches and Adadelta update rule, negative cases are repeatedly sampled with the distribution of infection frequencies users, for reducing computation cost and optimization imbalance. Experiments are conducted on Microblog dataset. The results show that our model achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art and pair-wise models. Besides, analyzing the distribution of learned users' sentimental influences and susceptibilities results some interesting discoveries.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Big data and smart computing: methodology and practice\n", "abstract": " 1 BackgroundThe field of Big Data is particularly challenging in practical aspects of data collection, data analysis and data storage and has massive consequential implications for the future. The scope and scale of Big Data frequently necessitate the processing power attributed to High Performance Computing (HPC) and the scalability of Cloud Computing for processing and storage. Source topics for Big Data are continually expanding and include diverse topic areas of finance, medical, particle physics and social interaction and everything in between. Effective Big Data analysis encompasses the need to minimise data sets by identifying, analysing and storing only significant data; recognising and separating the relevant and irrelevant data provide many research opportunities in itself. The outcomes of Big Data analysis may explain past events and trends, suggest controls that are necessary for the present or\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

{"title": "The impact of heterogeneous spreading abilities of network ties on information spreading\n", "abstract": " Understanding the dynamics of information spreading over social networks has been of great interest for a long time. It has been convincingly demonstrated that the topology of a network can significantly affect information spreading over it. Information spreading is often compared on small-world networks and random networks. In this paper, we find that the heterogeneity of spreading abilities of network ties can lead to completely different spreading results over small-world and random networks. In more detail, the more heterogeneous the spreading abilities of network ties, the lower the efficiency of information spreading over small-world networks. Moreover, such heterogeneity not only slows down the spreading pace, but also lengthens the life span of the information spread over small-world networks. On the contrary, if the spreading abilities of network ties are similar or equal, small-world networks are much\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Improve Network Clustering via Diversified Ranking\n", "abstract": " Clustering is one fundamental task in network analysis. A\u00a0widely-used clustering method is k-means clustering, where clustering is iteratively refined by minimizing the distance between each data point and its cluster center. For k-means clustering, one key issue is initialization, which heavily affects its accuracy and computational cost. This issue is particularly critical when applying k-means clustering to graph data where nodes are not embedded in a metric space. In this paper, we propose to use diversified ranking method to initialize k-means clustering, i.e., finding a set of seed nodes. In diversified ranking, seed nodes are figured out by considering their centrality and diversity in a unified manner. With seed nodes as starting points, k-means clustering is used to cluster nodes into groups. We apply the proposed method to detect communities in synthetic network and real-world network.

{"title": "Multirecord Webpage Extraction Based on DOM Tree Hierarchical Feature\n", "abstract": " The existing multirecord webpage extraction methods usually make overall longitudinal analyses of the document object model (DOM) tree. The computional structural similarity is always low, and therefore record regions can not be identified correctly. Different from the previous work, a method named data record extraction based on DOM tree hierarchical feature (DEBHF) is proposed to make transverse analyses of the DOM tree by distinguishing different roles of nodes at different levels. Thus, the problem of searching similar sub-trees is converted into the problem of searching similar sub-blocks in data blocks. Finally, the two-way search for non-overlapped and repeated sub-blocks is adopted to segment the record regions. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can deal with webpages which can not be obtained by the existing methods and the extraction results of different data sources demonstrate its effectiveness.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

{"title": "Exploration of Weighted Proximity Measure in Information Retrieval\n", "abstract": " A key problem of information retrieval is to provide information takers with relevant, accurate and even complete information. Lots of traditional information retrieval models are based on the bag-of-words assumption, without considering the implied associations among the query terms. Although term proximity has been widely used for boosting the performance of the classical information retrieval models, most of those efforts do not fully consider the different importance between the query terms. For queries in modern information retrieval, the query terms are not only dependent of each other, but also different in importance. Thus, computing the term proximity with taking into account the different importance of terms will be helpful to improve the retrieval performance. In order to achieve this, a weighted term proximity measure method is introduced, which distinguishes the significance of the query terms based on the collections to be searched. Weighted proximity BM25 model (WP-BM25) that integrating this method into the Okapi BM25 model is proposed to rank the retrieved documents. A large number of experiments are conducted on three standard TREC collections which are FR88-89, WT2G and WT10G. The results show that the weighted proximity BM25 model can significantly improve the retrieval performance, and it has good robustness.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

{"title": "Ranking tweets by labeled and collaboratively selected pairs with transitive closure\n", "abstract": " Tweets ranking is important for information acquisition in Microblog. Due to the content sparsity and lackof labeled data, it is better to employ semi-supervisedlearning methods to utilize the unlabeled data. However, most of previous semi-supervised learning methods donot consider the pair conflict problem, which means thatthe new selected unlabeled data may conflict with the labeled and previously selected data. It will hurt the learning performance a lot, if the training data contains manyconflict pairs. In this paper, we propose a new collaborative semi-supervised SVM ranking model (CSR-TC) with consideration of the order conflict. The unlabeleddata is selected based on a dynamically maintained transitive closure graph to avoid pair conflict. We also investigate the two views of features, intrinsic and contentrelevant features, for the proposed model. Extensive experiments are conducted on TREC Microblogging corpus. The results demonstrate that our proposed methodachieves significant improvement, compared to severalstate-of-the-art models.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

Conventional wisdom believes that it is better to train for the loss function on which will be used for evaluation. But we often observe different results in reality. For example, directly optimizing averaged precision achieves higher performance than directly optimizing precision@3 when the ranking results are evaluated in terms of precision@3. This motivates us to combine multiple metrics in the process of optimizing IR metrics. For simplicity we study learning with two metrics. Since we usually conduct the learning process in a restricted hypothesis space, e.g., linear hypothesis space, it is usually difficult to maximize both metrics at the same time. To tackle this problem, we propose a relaxed approach in this paper. Specifically, we incorporate one metric within the constraint while maximizing the other\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
{"title": "Multi-select faceted navigation based on minimum description length principle\n", "abstract": " Faceted navigation can effectively reduce user efforts of reaching targeted resources in databases, by suggesting dynamic facet values for iterative query refinement. A key issue is minimizing the navigation cost in a user query session. Conventional navigation scheme assumes that at each step, users select only one suggested value to figure out resources containing it. To make faceted navigation more flexible and effective, this paper introduces a multi-select scheme where multiple suggested values can be selected at one step, and a selected value can be used to either retain or exclude the resources containing it. Previous algorithms for cost-driven value suggestion can hardly work well under our navigation scheme. Therefore, we propose to optimize the navigation cost using the Minimum Description Length principle, which can well balance the number of navigation steps and the number of suggested values per step under our new scheme. An emperical study demonstrates that our approach is more cost-saving and efficient than state-of-the-art approaches.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1180"]}

{"title": "Exploring Hybrid Dynamic and Static Techniques for Software Verification\n", "abstract": " With the growing importance of software on which human lives increasingly depend, the correctness requirement of the underlying software becomes especially critical. However, the increasing complexities and sizes of modern software systems pose special challenges on the effectiveness as well as efficiency of software verification. Two major obstacles include the quality of test generation in terms of error detection in software testing and the state space explosion problem in software formal verification (model checking).  In this dissertation, we investigate several hybrid techniques that explore dynamic (with program execution), static (without program execution) as well as the synergies of multiple approaches in software verification from the perspectives of testing and model checking. For software testing, a new simulation-based internal variable range coverage metric is proposed with the goal of enhancing the error detection capability of the generated test data when applied as the target metric. For software model checking, we utilize various dynamic analysis methods, such as data mining, swarm intelligence (ant colony optimization), to extract useful high-level information from program execution data. Despite being incomplete, dynamic program execution can still help to uncover important program structure features and variable correlations. The extracted knowledge, such as invariants in different forms, promising control flows, etc., is then used to facilitate code-level program abstraction (under-approximation/over-approximation), and/or state space partition, which in turn improve the performance of property verification.

A majority of topological properties are content-related, and among them the clustering features are sensitive to contents of Web documents. In this paper, we first observe the impacts of content similarity on web links by introducing a metric called Linkage Probability. Then we investigate how contents influence the formation mechanism of the most basic cluster, triangle, with a metric named Triangularization Probability. Experimental results indicate that content similarity has a positive function in the process of cluster formation in theWeb.

{"title": "First-aid mechanism for peer-to-peer streaming\n", "abstract": " A fundamental challenge in P2P streaming system is how to provide high quality of services (QoS), such as short startup time, low seeking latency and high playback continuity. This paper presents First-Aid mechanism, a reciprocal data-request scheme in which first-aid users have high priority to get data while they must provide service to normal users suspended by them. Experiments show that our scheme performs better than traditional methods. We have also implemented a scalable P2P system called Cool-Fish [1] which supports live-streaming, VoD and file sharing services. The running results also prove the validity of our design.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1180"]}
