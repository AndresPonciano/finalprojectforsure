{"title": "Leveraging web 2.0 communities in professional organisations\n", "abstract": " Professional organisations are beginning to see the potential offered by Web 2.0 techniques and social networks to improve communication and collaboration with user communities. This leads to a need to consider how the closer interaction with communities influences the knowledge management in organisations, and how organisational interaction will affect the communities. There is high potential for deriving mutual benefits through the influence of social networks in form of Web 2.0 communities to the decision making taking place within organisations. However there are also potential hazards and challenges which arise from this new collaboration with respect to privacy, trust and reputation of individuals and organisations. In this paper, we describe the nature of professional organisations that leverage Web 2.0 communities for decision making and process execution. We present the opportunities and challenges that are involved and demonstrate them in the domain of emergency response, which entails the involvement of masses of users in the activities of the emergency response organisations.", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["2219"]}
{"title": "SFparser: A tool for selectively parsing SourceForge\n", "abstract": " As Free / Libre Open Source Software community continually grows, so does the free / open source code available for reuse. By design, open source code forges store several kinds of data for the projects they host. Depending to the nature of the user (Small and Medium Enterprises, Freelancers, Researchers, Practitioners, Professors, etc.) the scope to the information concerning an open source project may vary. In this work we propose a tool that parses projects hosted to Source Forge and stores the collected information to a database.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2219"]}
