An abstraction function that maps configurations and transitions of the EFSM specification to corresponding abstract states and transitions of the abstraction FSM is proposed. Properties of the abstraction are established along with a discussion on a proper selection of the sets of predicates and parameterized inputs used while deriving an FSM abstraction. If no distinguishing sequence is found for the current FSM abstraction then a refined abstraction is constructed by extending the sets of predicates and parameterized inputs.

{"title": "Local planning semantics: A semantics for distributed real-time systems\n", "abstract": " Design, implementation and verification of distributed real-time systems are acknowledged to be very hard tasks. Such systems are prone to different kinds of delay, such as execution time of actions or communication delays implied by distributed platforms. The latter increase considerably the complexity of coordinating the parallel activities of running components. Scheduling such systems must cope with those delays by proposing execution strategies ensuring global consistency while satisfying the imposed timing constraints. In this paper, we investigate a formal model for such systems as compositions of timed automata subject to multiparty interactions, and propose a semantics aiming to overcome the communication delays problem through anticipating the execution of interactions. To be effective in a distributed context, scheduling an interaction should rely on (as much as possible) local information only, namely the state of its participating components. However, as shown in this paper these information is not always sufficient and does not guarantee a safe execution of the system as it may introduce deadlocks. Moreover, delays may also affect the satisfaction of timing constraints, which also corresponds to deadlocks in the former model. Thus, we also explore methods for analyzing such deadlock situations and for computing deadlock-free scheduling strategies when possible.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1887"]}

In this paper we propose two algorithms for job scheduling in mixed critical systems: mixed criticality earliest deadline first (MCEDF) and mixed critical priority improvement (MCPI). MCEDF is a single processor algorithm that theoretically dominates state-of-the-art fixed-priority algorithm own criticality based priority (OCBP), while having a better computational complexity.

{"title": "Design Flow for the Rapid Development of Distributed Sensor Network Applications\n", "abstract": " The exponential increase in the demands for the deployment of large-scale sensor networks, makes necessary the efficient development of functional applications. Nevertheless, the existence of scarce resources and the derived application complexity, impose significant issues and require high design expertise. Consequently, the probability of discovering design errors once the application is implemented is considerably high. To address these constraints there is a need for the availability of early-stage validation, performance evaluation and rapid prototyping techniques at design time. In this paper we present a novel approach for the co-design of mixed software/hardware applications for distributed sensor network systems. This approach uses BIP, a formal framework facilitating modeling, analysis and implementation of embedded real-time, heterogeneous, component-based systems.

{"title": "System-Level Modeling, Analysis and Code Generation: Object Recognition Case Study\n", "abstract": " One of the most important challenges in complex embedded systems design is developing methods and tools for modeling and analyzing the behavior of application software running on multi-processor platforms. We propose a tool-supported flow for systematic and compositional construction of mixed software/hardware system models. These models are intended to represent, in an operational way, the set of timed executions of parallel application software statically mapped on a multi-processor platform. As such, system models will be used for performance analysis using simulation-based techniques as well as for code generation on specific platforms. The construction of the system model proceeds in two steps. In the first step, an abstract system model is obtained by composition and specific transformations of (1) the (untimed) model of the application software, (2) the model of the platform and (3) the mapping between them. In the second step, the abstract system model is refined into concrete system model, by including specific timing constraints for execution of the application software, according to chosen mapping on the platform. We illustrate the system model construction method and its use for performance analysis and code generation on an object recognition application provided by Hellenic Airspace Industry. This case study is build upon the HMAX models algorithm [RP99] and is looking at significant speedup factors.

{"title": "Verification of an afdx infrastructure using simulations and probabilities. volume 6418 of LNCS\n", "abstract": " Until recently, there was not a strong need for networking inside aircrafts. Indeed, the communications were mainly cabled and handled by Ethernet protocols. The evolution of avionics embedded systems and the number of integrated functions in civilian aircrafts has changed the situation. Indeed, those functionalities implies a huge increase in the quantity of data exchanged and thus in the number of connections between functions. Among the available mechanisms provided to handle this new complexity, one find Avionics Full Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX), a protocol that allows to simulate a point-to-point network between a source and one or more destinations. The core idea in AFDX is the one of Virtual Links (VL) that are used to simulate point-to-point communication between devices. One of the main challenge is to show that the total delivery time for packets on VL is bounded by some predefined value. This is a difficult problem that also requires to provide a formal, but quite evolutive, model of the AFDX network. In this paper, we propose to use a component-based design methodology to describe the behavior of the model.

{"title": "Concurrency-Preserving and Sound Monitoring of Multi-Threaded Component-Based Systems\n", "abstract": " This paper addresses the monitoring of logic-independent linear-time user-provided properties in multi-threaded component-based systems. We consider intrinsically independent components that can be executed concurrently with a centralized coordination for multiparty interactions. In this context, the problem that arises is that a global state of the system is not available to the monitor. A naive solution to this problem would be to plug in a monitor which would force the system to synchronize in order to obtain the sequence of global states at runtime. Such a solution would defeat the whole purpose of having concurrent components. Instead, we reconstruct on-the-fly the global states by accumulating the partial states traversed by the system at runtime. We define transformations of components that preserve their semantics and concurrency and, at the same time, allow to monitor global-state properties. Moreover, we present RVMT-BIP, a prototype tool implementing the transformations for monitoring multi-threaded systems described in the BIP (Behavior, Interaction, Priority) framework, an expressive framework for the formal construction of heterogeneous systems.

{"title": "Issues on Memory Managemenet for Component-based Systems\n", "abstract": " Memory management has become an extremely important factor for designing and implementing performant and energy efficient embedded applications. There are multiple reasons closely related to the execution platform. For instance, the memory organization and memory model enforced by the platform influence directly the execution time for any basic memory operation [1]. In addition, the amount of available memory may also directly enable/limit the concurrency allowed by particular applications eg, pipeline or data-flow applications requiring buffering of intermediate results [2]. Finally, a considerable impact is due to the programming and memory model used at the application level. The memory model together with the programming primitives used to coordinate concurrent execution (eg, locks, atomic sections, transactions, etc.) will heavily influence the compilation and deployment of the application onto the platform [3],[?],[?]. In particular, the placement of data into memory, the insertion of additional memory copy operations, if needed, etc are usually decided at compile time. In this paper, we investigate these issues for the BIP\u2013Behaviour, Interaction, Priority\u2013component framework for modeling, analysis and implementation of heterogeneous realtime systems [4].
