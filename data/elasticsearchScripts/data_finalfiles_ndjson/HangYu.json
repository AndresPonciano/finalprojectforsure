{"title": "Query recommendation based on improved query flow graph*\n", "abstract": " Search engines contain many user search behaviours. Based on the idea of group wisdom, analysis of the search log in a search engine to recommend a query has attracted significant attention from researchers. Mining valid information from a search log has shown good utility for constructing a query flow graph for query recommendation. In a query flow graph, nodes representing queries are connected if they have the same search intention. In the process of query recommendation, user intention is associated both with current queries and with the clicked URL. The URL can serve as important information to locate user search intentions. However, a query flow graph only considers query information in the search log to determine the relation between the queries. Accordingly, a novel method based on the improved query flow graph is proposed, which expands the query flow graph by adding the clicked URL\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1103"]}
{"title": "Research on extract the schema of query interfaces\n", "abstract": " As the main approach to obtain the Deep Web data is to fill query interface provided by the pages, and then obtain them by submitting a query request to the Deep Web server, so an important step to access the Deep Web resources is to analyse the query request of Deep Web server effectively. However, the query interface is designed under different schemas and uses different language, thus it makes the extraction work of high-precision query interface schema changeable. To improve accuracy of schema extraction and to achieve interpretation of the query interfaces at semantic level, this paper proposes a new definition of query interface schema, and designs a kind of schema extraction method which based on query interface visual information and page information. The experiment adopts TEL-8 data sets of UIUC, and the experimental results show that the method of this paper has reached over 90% accuracy\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1103"]}
