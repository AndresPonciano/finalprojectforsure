Web services' capabilities are constantly expanding from simple message passing toward the construction of full-fledged applications such as those envisaged by the UK's Pennine Group in their Software as a Service (SaaS) framework. These new, service-oriented approaches appear to many to solve the significant issue of software inflexibility that arises during maintenance and evolution. While they address sonic aspects of the problem, however, understanding the software still poses some difficulty. This shift toward service orientation compels us to consider its implications for software understanding, which is potentially the primary cost in software engineering.

Pieces of music are typically rearrangeable on-the-fly and involve a high degree of variation from ensemble to ensemble, and even between rehearsal and performance. Computer systems aiming to participate in such ensembles must therefore cope with a dynamic high-level structure in addition to the more traditional problems of beat-tracking, score-following, and machine improvisation. There are many approaches to integrating the components required to implement dynamic human-computer music performance systems. This paper presents a reference architecture designed to allow the typical sub-components (e.g. beat-tracking, tempo prediction, improvisation) to be integrated in a consistent way, allowing them to be combined and/or compared systematically.

When applied to a corpus of Bach chorales and the Essen folk song collection, we show that, depending on various parameters, the probabilistic grammars sometimes but not always out-perform the simple Markov models. On looking for evidence of overfitting of complex models to small datasets, we find that even the smallest dataset is sufficient to support the richest parameterisation of the probabilistic grammars.

In ethnomusicology there has been a recent growing interest in computational methods and their application to audio data collections (G\u00f3mez et al., 2013),(Canazza et al., 2010), and in the degree to which such methods may reveal insights into musical practice which may not be evident from the participantobservation paradigms that have otherwise characterised the discipline. For technological and legal reasons research in this area was previously limited to small datasets, but this is changing in part due to the contribution of research projects such as CompMusic 1 and cultural preservation projects such as Europeana Sounds 2. The authors of this paper collaborate in the UK AHRC-funded project Digital Music Lab-Analysing Big Music Data (DML) 3 to develop methods and technologies to support the use of Big Data in musicology (Weyde et al., 2014). As part of the project, we have developed software/hardware infrastructure for exploring and analysing large-scale audio collections, aiming to assist research in systematic and empirical (ethno) musicology. A major partner of the DML project is The British Library (BL), which holds several million audio recordings in its Sound Archive, spanning oral history interviews, environmental & nature sounds, as well as over 3 million recordings from classical, popular, world and traditional music (of which approximately 10% are digitized).

In spite of decades of work, it is surprising that there is not more technology for, and a better understanding of the computer as music performer. We review the development of techniques for live music performance and outline our efforts to establish a new direction, Human-Computer Music Performance (HCMP), as a framework for a variety of coordinated studies. Our work in this area spans performance analysis, synchronization techniques, and interactive performance systems. Our goal is to enable musicians to ncorporate computers into performances easily and effectively through a better understanding of requirements, new techniques, and practical, performance-worthy implementations. We conclude with directions for future work.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["567"]}
{"title": "Service-oriented software in the humanities: A software engineering perspective\n", "abstract": " Software Engineering, as a sub-discipline of the broader field of computer science, is concerned with the production, use, and maintenance of large, complex software systems. On first inspection, the set of managerial and technical activities involved in software engineering appears to be somewhat orthogonal to core research activity in the humanities, being concerned more with the production of research-enabling software systems than the research itself. However, as the scale of software used in digital humanities has increased, it is becoming clear that there are ways in which software engineering can inform, inspire, and aid in the management of the larger-scale software systems now being constructed in these disciplines. In particular, the development of service technology to aid in the production of flexible software systems for business now offers opportunities, not only for collaborative data sharing, but also\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["567"]}
{"title": "Managing supply chains of software as a service through agent negotiations\n", "abstract": " This paper introduces a new mediation mechanism into agent negotiations. The negotiation mechanism takes a supply-chain perspective to the construction of software services, attempting to co-optimize individual negotiations between services providers and service consumers along the chain. Parties negotiate acceptable ranges of values for either independent or multi-linked issues. This enables mediator agents to collect negotiation information throughout a supply chain and formulate it as sets of optimization objectives and constraints. Two examples are presented to demonstrate how the model operates.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["567"]}

Initial analysis of timing data from performances of Chopin\u2019s Etude Op. 10, No. 3 suggests that repetitions in timing patterns occur in several contexts: with motivic material identifiable in the score, with the same structural positions, in parts played very quickly, and not directly coinciding with any of the above. The paper explores the relation between these contexts and the roles of such repetitions in different performances of the same piece.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["567"]}
{"title": "Digital music lab: A framework for analysing big music data\n", "abstract": " In the transition from traditional to digital musicology, large scale music data are increasingly becoming available which require research methods that work on the collection level and at scale. In the Digital Music Lab (DML) project, a software system has been developed that provides large-scale analysis of music audio with an interactive interface. The DML system includes distributed processing of audio and other music data, remote analysis of copyright-restricted data, logical inference on the extracted information and metadata, and visual web-based interfaces for exploring and querying music collections. A system prototype has been set up in collaboration with the British Library and I Like Music Ltd, which has been used to analyse a diverse corpus of over 250,000 music recordings. In this paper we describe the system requirements, architecture, components, and data sources, explaining their interaction. Use\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["567"]}
{"title": "Getting the shapes\" right\" at the expense of creativity? How musicians' and non-musicians' visualizations of sound differ\n", "abstract": " BackgroundMusical training has an impact on the development and enhancement of a number of perceptual, cognitive, sensory-motor and social skills. Whereas some of these skills may be context-or instrument-specific, others are likely to be more generalizable. The focus of this paper is on two particularly well-developed characteristics of musicians: processing of auditory-visual information and sensory-motor integration. The former has been investigated from many different angles (Schutz, 2008), for instance cross-modal correspondences (Walker, 1987) and music cognition (Tan & Kelly, 2004), while the latter is often associated with structural and functional brain imaging studies (Zatorre, Chen, & Penhune, 2007) and especially instrument-specific motor skills (eg Jabusch, Alpers, Kopiez, Vauth, & Altenm\u00fcller, 2009). Although behavioural studies investigating generalizable sensory-motor skills in musicians are still sparse, they promise to provide a broader picture of sensory-motor integration (Spilka, Steele, & Penhune, 2010).", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["567"]}
{"title": "A Framework to Evaluate the Adoption Potential of Interactive Performance Systems for Popular Music\n", "abstract": " Popular music plays a central role in the lives of millions of people. It motivates beginners, engages experienced musicians, and plays both functional (e.g. churches) and non-functional (e.g. music festivals) roles in many contexts. Forming and maintaining a popular music ensemble can be challenging, particularly for part-time musicians who face other demands on their time. Where an ensemble has a functional role, performing music of consistent style and quality becomes imperative yet the demands of everyday life mean that it is not always possible to have a full complement of musicians. Interactive music technology has the potential to substitute for absent musicians to give a consistent musical output. However, the technology to achieve this (for popular music) is not yet mature, or in a suitable form for adoption and use by musicians who are not experienced with interactive music systems, or who are unprepared to work in experimental music or with experimental systems (a particular concern for functional ensembles). This paper proposes a framework of issues to be considered when developing interactive music technologies for popular music ensemble performance. It explores aspects that are complementary to technological concerns, focusing on adoption and practice to guide future technological developments.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["567"]}

Early research is already suggesting that it can and indeed a new field, spatial humanities, is increasingly being recognised. This paper will explore one example of this approach focusing on how we can use GIS techniques to integrate historical texts and modern'born-digital'photographs to gain a better understanding of landscape appreciation in the Lake District.

{"title": "Musical motives in performance: A study of absolute timing patterns\n", "abstract": " Musical motives are short melodic, rhythmic and/or harmonic patterns repeated either exactly or in varied form. They have long been recognised as important elements of musical structure. Less well-explored is how musical motives are manifested in performance, and how they are perceived in that context. Expressive motives originating in performance\u2014which we term \u201cperformance motives\u201d\u2014are also of considerable interest, but they have received scant theoretical attention despite their potential significance in music performance and perception. Performance motives may go some way to addressing questions of listener preference for particular performers' interpretation of the same work over others.

{"title": "The digital music lab: A big data infrastructure for digital musicology\n", "abstract": " In music research, many tools and techniques for the analysis of individual pieces exist, while far fewer are available on the collection level. Such methods and tools are increasingly necessary as more data is being made available, and the Digital Music Library helps fill that gap. Based on parallel server-side processing with Music Information Retrieval techniques, Semantic Web knowledge representation, and specifically designed interactive visualisations, an infrastructure has been developed, which allows webbased processing, querying, visualisation, and musicological analysis of large music collections. By analysing large, user-defined collections, we enable the investigation of questions such as whether or not a geographical bias for orchestral tuning pitch exists or the examination of trends in musical key and tempo. We particularly support comparisons between multiple music collections.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["567"]}

{"title": "The AffectMove 2021 Challenge-Affect Recognition from Naturalistic Movement Data\n", "abstract": " We ran the first Affective Movement Recognition (AffectMove) challenge that brings together datasets of affective bodily behaviour across different real-life applications to foster work in this area. Research on automatic detection of naturalistic affective body expressions is still lagging behind detection based on other modalities whereas movement behaviour modelling is a very interesting and very relevant research problem for the affective computing community. The AffectMove challenge aimed to take advantage of existing body movement datasets to address key research problems of automatic recognition of naturalistic and complex affective behaviour from this type of data. Participating teams competed to solve at least one of three tasks based on datasets of different sensors types and reallife problems: multimodal EmoPain dataset for chronic pain physical rehabilitation context, weDraw-1 Movement dataset for maths problem solving settings, and multimodal Unige-Maastricht Dance dataset. To foster work across datasets, we also challenged participants to take advantage of the data across datasets to improve performances and also test the generalization of their approach across different applications.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["567"]}

{"title": "Form-Aware, Real-Time Adaptive Music Generation for Interactive Experiences\n", "abstract": " Many experiences offered to the public through interactive theatre, theme parks, video games, and virtual environments use music to complement the participants\u2019 activity. There is a range of approaches to this, from straightforward playback of \u2018stings\u2019, to looped phrases, to on-the-fly note generation. Within the latter, traditional genres and forms are often not represented, with the music instead being typically loose in form and structure. We present work in progress on a new method for realtime music generation that can preserve traditional musical genres whilst being reactive in form to the activities of participants. The results of simulating participant trajectories and the effect this has on the music generation algorithms are presented, showing that the approach can successfully handle variable length forms whilst remaining substantially within the given musical style.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["567"]}
{"title": "Exploring probabilistic grammars of symbolic music using PRISM\n", "abstract": " In this paper we describe how we used the logic-based probabilistic programming language PRISM to conduct a systematic comparison of several probabilistic models of symbolic music, including 0th and 1st order Markov models over pitches and intervals, and a probabilistic grammar with two parameterisations. Using PRISM allows us to take advantage of variational Bayesian methods for assessing the goodness of fit of the models. When applied to a corpus of Bach chorales and the Essen folk song collection, we found that, depending on various parameters, the probabilistic grammars sometimes but not always out-perform the simple Markov models. Examining how the models perform on smaller subsets of pieces, we find that the simpler Markov models do out-perform the best grammar-based model at the small end of the scale.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["567"]}
{"title": "Support for Learning Synthesiser Programming\n", "abstract": " When learning an instrument, students often like to emulate the sound and style of their favourite performers. The learning process takes many years of study and practice. In the case of synthesisers the vast parameter space involved can be daunting and unintuitive to the novice making it hard to define their desired sound and difficult to understand how it was achieved. Previous research has produced methods for automatically determining an appropriate parameter set to produce a desired sound but this can still require many parameters and does not explain or demonstrate the effect of particular parameters on the resulting sound. As a first step to solving this problem, this paper presents a new approach to searching the synthesiser parameter space to find a sound, reformulating it as a multi-objective optimisation problem (MOOP) where two competing objectives (closeness of perceived sonic match and number of parameters) are considered. As a proofof-concept a pareto-optimal search algorithm (NSGA-II) is applied to CSound patches of varying complexity to generate a pareto front of non-dominating (ie\u201d equally good\u201d) solutions. The results offer insight into the extent to which the size and nature of parameter sets can be reduced whilst still retaining an acceptable degree of perceived sonic match between target and candidate sound.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["567"]}

{"title": "FACT: An Assessment Framework for Model-Based Program Comprehension Tools\n", "abstract": " Model-based program comprehension tools are those that use some model of a domain to assist in analysing software, and represent a large proportion of support environments for software maintainers. Such tools have widely differing characteristics that affect their suitability for software maintenance tasks. Existing evaluations of these tools take many forms, often addressing only a small part of the information needed by a maintainer to decide which tool or type of tool to apply. Consequently, comparison can be difficult. Existing approaches can be broadly divided into those that address the nature of the tool (in terms of technical characteristics and ability), and those that address the application of the tool (eg the psychological support provided).We present a new framework, applicable to model-based program comprehension tools, that allows a maintainer to analyse systematically the properties of their tool and determine its suitability for a given task. We explain the ten areas the framework covers, explaining why each is important, and demonstrating its application to the Hypothesis-Based Concept Assignment System (HB-CAS). In addition to its application by software maintainers, we anticipate the framework being useful to other researchers as a basis for evaluating and comparing their work with others.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["567"]}
