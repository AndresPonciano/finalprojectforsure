{"title": "An Evidence-Based Framework for Supporting the Engineering of IoT Software Systems\n", "abstract": " Internet of Things represents a promising paradigm for the development of systems that have been largely explored in the academy and industry. One of the recognized features of IoT is its large multidisciplinarity by the integration of different devices and technologies. However, the studies presented in literature have sought to explore particular issues not addressing the IoT multidisciplinary as a whole. We argue that to better support the development of these systems, it is essential to have a more holistic view of their engineering. To that end, we propose to de-velop a framework to provide guidance for engineering IoT software systems considering its characteristics and multidisciplinarity. The research follows a (1) Conceptual Phase with a set of studies conducted to present the proposed technology foundations; (2) Development Phase that aims to operationalize and (3) Evaluation Phase that aims its assessment\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1305"]}
{"title": "Towards a Strategy for Supporting the Engineering of Contemporary Software Systems\n", "abstract": " Contemporary software systems, such as the Internet of Things, Industry 4.0 and Intelligent Cities, present challenges for their engineering, since they question our traditional form of software development. They represent a promising paradigm for the integration of communication devices and technologies. It is leading to a shift from the classical monolithic view of development where stakeholders receive a software product at the end, to materialized software systems through physical objects interconnected by networks and with embedded smartness to support activities. Therefore, it is necessary to revisit our way of developing software systems and begin to consider the particularities required by these new types of applications. This thesis aims to investigate the particularities of these new types of applications to support the definition of a framework to support decision-making in the engineering of this kind of applications and systems. To this end, we use IoT systems as surrogate for CSS, since they present the contemporaneity and multidisciplinarity that we aim to investigate.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1305"]}
{"title": "A Preliminary Study of IoT Multidisciplinary View in the Industry\n", "abstract": " This short article presents a study conducted with professionals to extract their perception of the multidisciplinarity involved with the Internet of Things projects. Preliminary results show that all proposed facets (that represent the multidisciplinarity) were identified as pertinent, being Things, Connectivity, Behavior, and Interactivity pointed out as the most pertinent ones. Moreover, it was suggested to define Data separately from the Behavior facet.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1305"]}
{"title": "Technical Report: Rapid Reviews on Engineering of Internet of Things Software Systems\n", "abstract": " We conducted a set of Rapid Reviews to characterize Internet of Things facets. We formatted a generic meta-protocol that was instantiated for each of the six facets presented (Connectivity, Things, Behavior, Smartness, Interactivity, and Environment)and considering the issue of Security, one of the most important and frequent challenges in the context of IoT. The meta-protocol is detailed and the results of each review are presented.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1305"]}
{"title": "Towards a strategy for supporting the engineering of IoT software systems\n", "abstract": " The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a promising paradigm for the integration of communication devices and technologies leading to a shift from the classical view of development. Their engineering presents challenges since it enables different system interaction and connectivity among things. Therefore, it is necessary to revisit our way of engineering software systems and begin to consider the particularities required by these new types of software systems. The goal of our research is to build evidence-based software technologies to support multidisciplinary decision-making in engineering IoT applications.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1305"]}
{"title": "MetricRA: Learning Software Metrics through Augmented Reality\n", "abstract": " Augmented reality creates a bridge between virtual and real world, providing stimulating resources for different purposes. This technology enables new teaching possibilities since it can bring more abstract concepts into reality and put the knowledge related to several areas, such as Software Engineering, into practice. MetricRA is a tool developed to help Software Engineering students to understand Cohesion and Coupling metrics. The solution was implemented with Augmented Reality technology, where the user can control a class diagram to observe the metrics transformation. This article describes MetricRA tool and presents a study conducted to evaluate its ability to contribute to the understanding of the concepts proposed.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1305"]}
