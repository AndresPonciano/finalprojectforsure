Such a relationship, if identified, can be utilized to select effective testing techniques that take the characteristics of the program under test into account. Our empirical study was conducted on three industrial real-time systems that contain a number of natural faults reported for the past three years. The faults found in these three systems are classified into three types: object-oriented faults, object management faults and traditional faults. The object-oriented design metrics suite proposed by Chidamber and Kemerer (1994) is validated using these faults. Moreover, we propose a set of new metrics that can serve as an indicator of how strongly object-oriented a program is, so that the decision to adopt object oriented testing techniques can be made, to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "396\n", "authors": ["1065"]}

The all-bindings criterion takes inheritance and polymorphism features into account to ensure that every binding of every object is exercised under some test. The all-du-pairs criterion is applied to monitor the behavior of every object during its lifetime by keeping track of where the object is defined (d) and where such a definition is referenced or used (u).

In this paper, we present an automatic test case generation for testing the interactions between the applications and the databases. The aim is to generate a test suite that can fulfill the requirement of a set of test adequacy criteria that cover def-use associations of database interactions and the boundary points. We present a tool that supports automatic generation of test cases and a case study conducted to demonstrate the validity of the technique and the tool.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1065"]}
{"title": "A wrinkled membrane model for cloth draping with multigrid acceleration\n", "abstract": " Fabric is modeled as a particular type of membrane formed from two orthogonal families of yarns. In contrast to usual membrane theory, the fabric is regarded to possess a certain compressive rigidity which is much weaker than its tensile rigidity. An energy density function is defined corresponding to the material model. The finite element formulation is based on the total Lagrangian approach. Four node quadrilateral elements are adopted. An accelerated multigrid technique using the conjugate gradient method as basic iterative method is employed to minimize energy to reach the final equilibrium position. Two examples of fabric draping are analyzed using the proposed model. The influence of the material parameters on the draping behavior is discussed.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1065"]}

{"title": "Dataflow analysis and testing of software components.\n", "abstract": " Software components have been dramatically adopted in building large-scale complex software systems. Since the components are often assembled by using a plug-and-play approach, they must be thoroughly tested prior to the deployment. In this paper, we present a set of dataflow coverage criteria for guiding test case generation as well as an efficient algorithm for computing def-use associations. The coverage criteria include six levels of def-use associations that need to be exercised to explore plausible faults introduced by the data manipulations. Moreover, we address the callback and re-entrance features of components, which may introduce additional def-use pairs that cannot be identified by using traditional dataflow analysis approaches. Our dataflow analysis is based on the components\u2019 common composition structure and the nature of execution flows. The algorithm makes use of a Def-Use Binding Graph to compute def-use associations, which eliminates the need of def-use propagation; thus its space requirement can be reduced from quadratic to linear proportional to the component size. A component that is adequately tested by using these dataflow coverage criteria can be reliably deployed in various execution contexts. Furthermore, the test cases and scripts can be reused in integration, thereby making testing more effective.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1065"]}

By taking into account the three constraints, we first present the signal space for the pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) sequences in the maximum flickering time period (MFTP). Then, to minimize the error probability of the VLC systems, we seek to find the PAM sequences providing the largest minimum Euclidean distance. Since the objective function is nonconvex and nondifferentiable, it is difficult to solve the original optimization problem directly. Thus, two methods corresponding to the joint design and greedy algorithm, are proposed to design the PAM sequences in VLC.

{"title": "Competition mechanism of lightning upward leaders issued from UHVDC transmission lines [J]\n", "abstract": " Research on the lightning shielding failure characteristics of UHVDC transmission lines is important for adequate transmission line protection and safe operation of a power grid. Focusing the competition characteristics of upward leaders in the lightning attachment process, this work provides technical reference for efficient evaluations of lightning shielding failures and reliable lightning protection designs of UHVDC transmission lines. The charge simulation method is employed to calculate electric field distributions. Based on the calculation and some data obtained by recent long-gap discharge and lightning observations, the effect of several upward leaders starting from UHVDC transmission lines on lightning attachment processes is studied by numerical simulation. The results show that the upward leader inception is delayed, the propagation velocity is smaller, and the propagation direction of the upward leader is changed with interaction among all upward leaders, which influences the selection of lightning striking point. Therefore, in order to improve the accuracy of calculating the lightning shielding failure rate of UHVDC transmission lines, the interaction characteristics of upward leaders should be taken into account. In addition, an analysis of the influence of operating voltage and the protection angle of UHVDC transmission lines based on competition mechanism of upward leaders is made. It is found that the existence of operating voltage mainly affects the ability of the conductor and the overhead ground wire at the same side to incept upward leaders, while the protection angle mainly affects the position of the\" starting points\" of upward\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1065"]}

{"title": "Specification-driven Structural testing of multi-tier web applications\n", "abstract": " Large scale, multi-tier web applications are inherently dynamic, complex, and heterogeneous. Testing such emerging applications is challenging yet critical. First, because of inter-tier interactions, a fault in one tier may propagate to the others; while each tier is often implemented and maintained by a designated team, detailed cross-tier information may not be available to the other teams. Second, dynamic pages, generated by backend software at runtime, have been largely used to fulfill interactive service requests. Exhaustively testing all the dynamic pages is neither practical nor feasible. Effective testing of multi-tier web applications requires a coherent model to capture the dependence relationships caused by the cross tier interactions and to provide some mechanisms for exploring dynamic pages. Existing models for structural testing of web applications have not been able to address these challenges; thus prevalent testing approaches employed by industry are mostly based on black box testing, whose effectiveness is often restrained by lack of complete specifications. Both black and white box approaches have their limitations and they can complement each other only if there exists an effective means to bridge the gap between the two. In this paper, we present a test model that synthesizes specifications and an inter-connection dependence model to guide the structural testing driven by specifications. We model the specifications by structuralizing use cases/scenarios and construct an interconnection model to capture inter-tier dependence relationships which are then rendered by using DOM-like summary Web GUI Trees.

{"title": "Fair Packet Scheduling for Downlink Multiuser OFDM Systems with Channel and Queue Information\n", "abstract": " In this paper, an channel and queue aware fair (CQAF) packet scheduling scheme is proposed for the downlink packet transmission in multiuser orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. By making use of the information on the channel conditions and the queue lengths, the proposed CQAF packet scheduling scheme efficiently allocates the subcarriers, transmission power and modulation level to users under the constraints of total transmission power, the number of subcarriers, bit-error-rate (BER) requirement and generalized processor sharing (GPS)-based fairness requirement. The numerical results show that the proposed CQAF packet scheduling scheme can reduce the transmission delay and queue length significantly while maximizing system throughput and maintaining fairness among users.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1065"]}

{"title": "Measuring 0 0 Design Metrics from UML\n", "abstract": " Design metrics are useful means for improving the quality of software. A number of object-oriented metrics have been suggested as being helpful for resource allocation in software development. These metrics are particularly useful for identifying fault-prone classes and for predicting required maintenance efforts, productivity, and rework efforts. To obtain the design metrics of the software under development, most existing approaches measure the metrics by parsing the source code of the software. Such approaches can only be performed in a late phase of software development, thus limiting the usefulness of the de-sign metrics in resource allocation. In this paper, we present a methodology that compiles UML specifications to obtain design information and to compute the design metrics at an early stage of software devel-opment. The current version of our tool uses diagrams produced by the Rational Rose tool and computes 00 metrics that have been suggested as being good indicators for identifying faults related to Object-Oriented features. Our technique advances the state of the metrics measuring process; thus it is expected to strongly promote the use of de-sign metrics and significantly increase their impact on improving software quality.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1065"]}
{"title": "Cold-stress stimulates pregnancy-induced hypertension syndrome in pregnant rats\n", "abstract": " Objective To determine whether cold-stress stimulation could lead to pregnancy-induced hypertension syndrome (PIH) in rats. Methods Female adult Wistar female rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: non-pregnant control group (NN), non-pregnant cold-stress group (NC), pregnant control group (PN) and pregnant cold-stress group (PC). The rats were kept in (4\u00b12)\u2103 for 4 h (cold-stress groups) every day or remained in 25\u2103(control groups) from the 1 st day to 19 th day of pregnancy. The blood pressure, urine protein, body weight, haematocrit (HCT), weight of placenta, length and weight of fetus were all measured. The histological change of the placenta and kidneys were also observed. Results After cold-stress stimulation for 2 weeks, the blood pressure, urine protein in NC and PC group increased significantly compared with that in control group, while the weight of placenta and fetus, the length of fetus in PC decreased significantly than that in PN. Obvious ischemic and anoxic histological changes in kidneys and all layers of placenta were found in PC group. Conclusion Repeated cold-stress stimulation can induce PIH in rats, thus provide a new non-invasive method to establish an animal model of PIH.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1065"]}

{"title": "Site gains and its estimation method of a lightning location system\n", "abstract": " We discuss a new concept in lightning location system (LLS). Specitically,it is anoptimum method of lightning signal strength and a parameterization method of the site gaincurve estimation in LLS. Site gain correction curves for all DFs for 1989 were found byusing the data observed in an LLS of three direction finders (DFs) in Beijing region. Theresult shows that the curves, as a function of measured bearing, only include the one- andtwo-cycle sinusoidal components. It also indicates that the larger the site errors which DFhas, the larger the amplitude of the site gain curve. In this LLS, the ranges of site gainare 0.9--1.2, 0.85--1.05, 0.9--1.1 for DF1, DF2 and DF3 respectively. For discussion, we suggested a model for site gains due to dipole radiation. This modelcan be used to reasonably explain the characteristics of structure of site gain curves.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1065"]}
