These models differ in their underlying structure prescribing different possible paths to maturity in agile software development, neglecting the fact that agile teams struggle to follow prescribed processes and practices. Our objective, therefore, was to empirically investigate how agile teams evolve to maturity, as a means to conceive a theory for agile software development evolvement that considers agile teams nature. The complex adaptive systems theory was used as a lens for analysis and four case studies were conducted to collect qualitative and quantitative data. As a result, we propose the Progressive Outcomes framework to describe the agile software development maturing process.

However, an increasing number of teams have been implementing agile software development methods that focus on people rather than processes. What, then, is maturity for these agile teams that focus less on detailed, defined processes? This is the question we sought to answer in this study. To this end, we asked agile practitioners about their perception of the maturity level of a number of practices and how they defined maturity in agile software development.

This electronic market is based on a Distributed Multi-Agent System we are developing to help airline companies in solving unexpected operations recovery problems and matching them with potential solutions. The proposed electronic market uses ontology services that we have developed for other domains, allowing an airline company to access resources of other airline companies, such as aircrafts and crew members. The potential solutions obtained through the electronic market interactions will compete with the solutions found by the airline company own system.

The use of ontologies for representing domain knowledge and for supporting reasoning is becoming wide-spread in many areas, including intelligent assistance. In this paper we present how ontologies can be used to support intelligent assistance in a multi-agent system context. We show how ontologies may be spread over the multi-agent system architecture, highlighting their role controlling user interaction and service description. We present in detail an ontology-based conversational interface for personal assistants, showing how to design an ontology for semantic interpretation and how the interpretation process uses it for semantic analysis.

Titles were developed linking 17 terms of the focus axis, which were evaluated by expert nurses in five Brazilian cities. Titles whose use concordance was above 0.80 were included in the ontology. In total, 89 titles for ND/NO were supported in the literature, and 19 were not supported; 37 were assessed as eligible for use in healthcare practice and were included in the ontology. The construction of ND/NO titles based on the ICNP\u00ae and using a formal representation of knowledge is a task that requires deepening concepts used for nursing and adequate classification revisions.

In the VE life cycle identification of needs, for example, it is necessary to describe the needed product or service in a way that it can be understood by all the participants. The easier way of solving this problem is to use either a common ontology or a shared one which may be understood by all the enterprise delegate agents participating in the process. However, each agent may have one of the existing different ontologies and a shared ontology will not be universal. Thus, the enterprises will not waste time converting all the content of their ontology if the new one is not considered a universal one.

{"title": "Deriving Domain Functional Requirements from Conceptual Model Represented in OntoUML.\n", "abstract": " A conceptual model is an artifact that helps to understand a domain and therefore, may contribute with the elicitation of related functional requirements. However, the expressiveness of this model depends on the expressiveness of the language used. Considering that OntoUML is a language that proposes elements that allow more semantics, it is possible to build models with better expressiveness which are more complete than, for instance, models represented in UML language. For evaluating the possibility of deriving domain functional requirements (DFR) from models represented in OntoUML, a heuristic was proposed. This heuristic was obtained by reading and interpreting nine conceptual models represented in OntoUML. Once the heuristic was obtained, it was applied in a systematized manner to six models. According to the results obtained, using a conceptual model represented in OntoUML as a source to derive DFR is possible. In addition to the identification of the DFR, the heuristic can identify possible faults in the model design, or even the incompleteness of the model.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1152"]}
{"title": "Unit of Organizational Learning Ontology based on LOM Standard and IMS Learning Design.\n", "abstract": " Organizational learning helps companies to improve their processes through the reuse of experiences. An area that may contribute to promote organizational learning is social learning. Collaborative tools, such as social networks and wikis, enable collaborative work and are important facilitators of social learning processes. However, collaboration is just one of the several needed components for learning. It is important that all acquired knowledge is organized to be reused faster, more easily and efficiently. For this, we propose using learning objects and units of learning to organize the content inserted in collaborative tools. In this context, there are some learning objects and units of learning metadata to describe relevant learning objects and units of learning characteristics, but since this metadata is proposed to describe educational units of learning and learning objects, it does not take into account organizational characteristics, important for knowledge-intensive organizations. Moreover, metadata is formally modeled through XML-Schema language, which lacks expressiveness. Thus, trying to solve these limitations, and integrate concepts from different models, this paper presents an ontology for organizational units of learning based on IEEE LOM standard, the IMS LD and IMS CP, to be used specifically by software development companies.
