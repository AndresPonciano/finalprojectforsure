{"title": "The MAFT architecture for distributed fault tolerance\n", "abstract": " A description is given of the multicomputer architecture for fault tolerance (MAFT), a distributed system designed to provide extremely reliable computation in real-time control systems. MAFT is based on the physical and functional partitioning of executive functions from applications functions. The implementation of the executive functions in a special-purpose hardware processor allows the fault-tolerance functions to be transparent to the application programs and minimizes overhead. Byzantine agreement and approximate agreement algorithms are used for critical system parameters. MAFT supports the use of multiversion hardware and software to tolerate built-in or generic faults. Graceful degradation and restoration of the application workload is permitted in response to the exclusion and readmission of nodes, respectively.< >", "num_citations": "310\n", "authors": ["535"]}

{"title": "Technique for detecting and predicting air filter condition\n", "abstract": " A method and system for detecting and predicting air filter condition for an air handling system operates by determining a system resistance to air flow. The system resistance is utilized to determine a detection statistic indicative of current filter condition and to predict remaining life of the air filter. The system resistance is determined using models that approximate the expected operation of the air handling system. The approximation is then compared to actual values to obtain a difference. Once the difference between the approximated value exceeds a threshold value, an alarm is initiated that is indicative of system resistance. The remaining air filter life is then determined by using historically gathered data, or by using a known degradation rate of the air filter. Once the remaining life of the air filter is estimated, replacement can be scheduled that would coincide with other maintenance.", "num_citations": "212\n", "authors": ["535"]}

{"title": "Spatial-temporal structural and dynamics features for Video Fire Detection\n", "abstract": " We present a new Video Fire Detection (VFD) system for surveillance applications in fire and security industries. The system consists of three modules: pixel-level processing to identify potential fire blobs, blob-based spatial-temporal feature extraction, and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The proposed novel spatial-temporal features include a spatial-temporal structural feature and a spatial-temporal contour dynamics feature. The spatial-temporal structural features are extracted from an accumulated motion mask (AMM) and an accumulated intensity template (AIT), capturing the concentric ring structure of fire intensity. The spatial-temporal dynamics features are based on the Fourier descriptor of contours in space and time, capturing the dynamic properties of fire. These global blob-based features are more robust and effective in rejecting false alarms and nuisance sources than pixel-wise features. In\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["535"]}

{"title": "Electrical capacitance tomography: A compressive sensing approach\n", "abstract": " We present a new image reconstruction method for Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT). ECT image reconstruction is generally ill-posed because the number of measurements is small whereas the image dimensions are large. Here, Compressive Sensing is used to provide better reconstruction from the small number of measurements. Given the sparsity of the signal (image), the idea is to apply an efficient and stable algorithm through L1 regularization to recover the sparse signal with sufficient measurements that have cardinality comparable to the sparsity of the signal. In this paper, we present Total Variation (TV) regularization for ECT image reconstruction, and apply an efficient Split-Bregman Iteration (SBI) approach to solve the problem. We propose a joint metric of positive re-construction rate (PRR) and false reconstruction rate (FRR) to evaluate image reconstruction performance.

As described in Liu et al. [8]'s work, face hallucination uses two models: a global parametric model which synthesizes global face shapes from eigenfaces, and a local parametric model which enhances the local high frequency details. We follow a similar process to develop a robust face hallucination algorithm. Firstly, we obtain eigenfaces from a number of low resolution face images extracted from a video sequence using a face tracking algorithm. Then we compute the difference between the interpolated low-resolution face and the mean face, and use this difference face as the query to retrieve approximate sparse eigenfaces representation.
