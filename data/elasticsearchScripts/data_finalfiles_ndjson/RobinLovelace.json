{"title": "The Propensity to Cycle Tool: An open source online system for sustainable transport planning\n", "abstract": " Getting people cycling is an increasingly common objective in transport planning institutions worldwide. A growing evidence base indicates that high quality infrastructure can boost local cycling rates. Yet for infrastructure and other cycling measures to be effective, it is important to intervene in the right places, such as along 'desire lines' of high latent demand. This creates the need for tools and methods to help answer the question 'where to build?'. Following a brief review of the policy and research context related to this question, this paper describes the design, features and potential applications of such a tool. The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) is an online, interactive planning support system that was initially developed to explore and map cycling potential across England (see www.pct.bike). Based on origin-destination data it models cycling levels at area, desire line, route and route network levels, for current\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "105\n", "authors": ["914"]}

This book will interest people from many backgrounds, especially Geographic Information Systems (GIS) users interested in applying their domain-specific knowledge in a powerful open source language for data science, and R users interested in extending their skills to handle spatial data. The book is divided into three parts:(I) Foundations, aimed at getting you up-to-speed with geographic data in R,(II) extensions, which covers advanced techniques, and (III) applications to real-world problems. The chapters cover progressively more advanced topics, with early chapters providing strong foundations on which the later chapters build. Part I describes the nature of spatial datasets in R and methods for manipulating them. It also covers geographic data import/export and transforming coordinate reference systems. Part II represents methods that build on these foundations. It covers advanced map making (including web mapping),\" bridges\" to GIS, sharing reproducible code, and how to do cross-validation in the presence of spatial autocorrelation. Part III applies the knowledge gained to tackle real-world problems, including representing and modeling transport systems, finding optimal locations for stores or services\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "79\n", "authors": ["914"]}

However, the likely energy implications of such a modal shift have remained relatively unexplored. In this paper we generate scenarios for increasing the cycling rate in Sheffield between 2010 and 2020. This is done through the novel application of a simple model, borrowed from population ecology. The analysis suggests that pro-cycling interventions result in energy savings through reduced consumption of fuel and cars, and energy costs through increased demand for food. The cumulative impact is a net reduction in primary energy consumption, the magnitude of which depends on a number of variables which are subject to uncertainty. Based on the evidence presented and analysed in this paper, we conclude that transport policy has a number of important energy implications\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "48\n", "authors": ["914"]}

Primary amongst these for urban modelling has been its use in static spatial microsimulation to generate small area microdata \u2014 individual level data allocated to administrative zones. The technique is mature, widely used and relatively straight-forward. Although IPF is well described mathematically, accessible examples of the algorithm written in modern programming languages are rare. Therefore, there is a tendency for researchers to \u2018start from scratch\u2019, resulting in a variety of ad hoc implementations and little evidence about the relative merits of different approaches. These knowledge gaps mean that answers to certain methodological questions must be guessed: How can \u2018empty cells\u2019 be identified and how do they influence model fit? Can IPF be made more computationally efficient? This paper tackles these questions and more using a systematic methodology with publicly available code and data.

Like most people I am learning as I go along and this book greatly helped place the technical work in its wider context. The data revolution is undeniably driven by technology, meaning the discussion of ethics, for example, often takes a back seat, especially in the so-called field of'data science'which is overwhelmingly male dominated and technocentric.For the impatient reader: The Data Revolution does a great job of raising the wider issues associated with the dramatic and still accelerating'datarisation'of life. As the book points out,'small data'is not going to disappear and to some extent Big Data is just an extension of smaller datasets. However, as a disclaimer, this review is primarily undertaken in relation to its treatment of Big Data. It does not intend to provide a synopsis of each chapter. Why? The book has already been rightly well reviewed in general terms. Big Data is probably the fastest moving branch of the revolution with major implications for Regional Science.

{"title": "The energy costs of commuting: A spatial microsimulation approach\n", "abstract": " Commuting is a daily ritual for a large proportion of the world's population. It is important materially, consuming large amounts of time, money and natural resources. As with many routine activities travel to work is often taken for granted but its energy consumption is of particular interest due to its heavy reliance on fossil fuels and the inflexibility of the demand for commuting. This understudied area of knowledge, the energy costs of travel to work, forms the basis of the thesis. There is much research into commuting and transport energy use as separate fields, but they have rarely been combined in the same analysis, let alone at high levels of geographical resolution. The well-established field of spatial microsimulation offers tools for investigating commuting patterns in detail at local and individual levels, with major potential benefits for transport planning. For the first time this method is deployed to investigate variability in commuter energy use both between and within small administrative zones. The maps of commuter energy use presented in this thesis illustrate this variability at national, regional and local levels. Supporting previous research, the results suggest that a range of geographical factors influence energy use for travel. This has important policy implications: when high transport energy use in commuting is due to lack of jobs in the vicinity, for example, modal shift (e.g.~from cars to bicycles) on its own has a limited potential to reduce energy costs. Such insights are quantified using existing aggregate data.

{"title": "Crowd sourced vs centralized data for transport planning: a case study of bicycle path data in the UK\n", "abstract": " This paper seeks to test the hypothesis that distributed, user-contributed 'crowd sourced' GIS data will eventually supercede the traditional centralised geographic data model. The empirical basis used to explore this question is a couple of national-level datasets on a specific topic: bicycle paths in the UK. Representing the crowd-sourced data model, Open Street Map data was downloaded as a subset of Planet.osm. Representing the centralised model, we used the Ordnance Survey's (OS) Urban Paths data product, which provides a national dataset of dedicated bicycle and walk ways across the UK. To assess the quality of each dataset, an array of tests was used. These ranged from narrow tests of accuracy against aerial photography for contiguous stretches of the route, to more subjective tests of usability and practical utility. Overall it was found that the crowd-sourced data model outperformed the OS approach. However, it must be noted that this is a very niche area with a strong user community. If the crowd-sourced data model is to triumph in more mainstream areas it needs to ensure much greater community 'buy-in', for example through compulsory engagement with Open Street Map for educational and citizenship purposes at school", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["914"]}

{"title": "Road lighting density and brightness linked with increased cycling rates after-dark\n", "abstract": " Cycling has a range of benefits as is recognised by national and international policies aiming to increase cycling rates. Darkness acts as a barrier to people cycling, with fewer people cycling after-dark when seasonal and time-of-day factors are accounted for. This paper explores whether road lighting can reduce the negative impact of darkness on cycling rates. Changes in cycling rates between daylight and after-dark were quantified for 48 locations in Birmingham, United Kingdom, by calculating an odds ratio. These odds ratios were compared against two measures of road lighting at each location: 1) Density of road lighting lanterns; 2) Relative brightness as estimated from night-time aerial images. Locations with no road lighting showed a significantly greater reduction in cycling after-dark compared with locations that had some lighting. A nonlinear relationship was found between relative brightness at a location at night and the reduction in cyclists after-dark. Small initial increases in brightness resulted in large reductions in the difference between cyclist numbers in daylight and after-dark, but this effect reached a plateau as brightness increased. These results suggest only a minimal amount of lighting can promote cycling after-dark, making it an attractive mode of transport year-round.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["914"]}

Instead of relying on limited official data on the magnitude of flows from different attractions we used volunteered geographic information\u2019 (VGI) to calibrate the model. The method represents the potential of VGI for applications beyond descriptive statistics and visuals and highlights potential uses of georeferenced social media data for geographic models.

We successfully calibrated the distance decay parameter of the model and conclude that social media data have great potential for aiding models of spatial behavior. However, we also caution that there are dangers associated with the use of social media data. Researchers should weigh up the wider costs and benefits of harnessing such \u2018big data\u2019 before blindly harnessing this low quality, high volume resource.

{"title": "Modelling commuter patterns: A spatial microsimulation approach for combining regional and micro level data\n", "abstract": " Transport to work is a universal phenomenon, but is uneven over space. The distribution of mode and distance statistics vary depending on a range of factors. The scale of analysis (from individual to local and regional levels), the location of the study area (e.g. urban or rural settlements), and the socio-economic characteristics of the target population all influence commuter patterns. This heterogeneity is problematic for decision makers tasked with encouraging more sustainable and less costly commuter patterns based on transport to work statistics. Existing studies on commuting fail to consider the multiple levels at which transport systems operate, and leave important questions unanswered. For example, should policies target individuals, local areas, or regions, and at what level should they operate for maximum benefit? This paper outlines this research problem, and then describes an approach for tackling it based on a case study of Yorkshire and the Humber, an economically peripheral region of the UK. Our spatial microsimulation model uses iterative proportional fitting (IPF) to simulate the characteristics of individual commuters, in terms of socio-economic class, age, sex, and income, while geographically aggregated commuter statistics are constrained by Census data. This represents a novel application of spatial microsimulation, to model commuter behaviour. The approach has the potential to allow 'what if' scenarios to be undertaken, and opens up the possibility of dynamic microsimulation to policy makers. This latter possibility is attractive because it allows scenario-based projections of the future for the evaluation of policy assumptions\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["914"]}

It proposes to reduce emissions without curbing the use of fossil fuels and, as a result, has been advocated by energy corporations, governments and international institutions. Much academic research also favours the idea. Criticism is often isolated and purely technical. However, surveys indicate that the public is either ambivalent towards CCS or has reservations about its use. The public is right to be cautious: CCS is expensive, high risk, and may actually increase emissions due to greater demand for coal. These technical drawbacks alone suggest that the government\u2019s commitment to CCS does not add up. Cheaper and more reliable options exist, yet these rarely enter the debate. To overcome this, the concept of an \u2018energy hierarchy\u2019 can be used to highlight the full range of options for meeting climate change and energy security commitments.

This paper demonstrates a new approach to support the prioritization of cycling infrastructure and cycling network design, accounting for cyclist preferences and the growing emphasis on 'filtered permeability' and 'Low Traffic Neighborhood' interventions internationally. The approach combines distance decay, route calculation, and network analysis methods to examine where future cycling demand is most likely to arise, how such demand could be accommodated within existing street networks, and how to ensure a fair distribution of investment. Although each of these methods has been applied to cycling infrastructure prioritization in previous research, this is the first time that they have been combined, creating an integrated road segment prioritization approach. The approach, which can be applied to other cities, as shown in the Appendix, is demonstrated in a case study of Manchester, resulting in cycling networks that balance directness against the need for safe and stress-free routes under different investment scenarios.
