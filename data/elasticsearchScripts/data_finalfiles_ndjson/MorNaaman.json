{"title": "HT06, tagging paper, taxonomy, Flickr, academic article, to read\n", "abstract": " In recent years, tagging systems have become increasingly popular. These systems enable users to add keywords (ie,\" tags\") to Internet resources (eg, web pages, images, videos) without relying on a controlled vocabulary. Tagging systems have the potential to improve search, spam detection, reputation systems, and personal organization while introducing new modalities of social communication and opportunities for data mining. This potential is largely due to the social structure that underlies many of the current systems. Despite the rapid expansion of applications that support tagging of resources, tagging systems are still not well studied or understood.

Users have mostly avoided annotating media such as photos--both in desktop and mobile environments--despite the many potential uses for annotations, including recall and retrieval. We investigate the incentives for annotation in Flickr, a popular web-based photo-sharing system, and ZoneTag, a cameraphone photo capture and annotation tool that uploads images to Flickr. In Flickr, annotation (as textual tags) serves both personal and social purposes, increasing incentives for tagging and resulting in a relatively high number of annotations. ZoneTag, in turn, makes it easier to tag cameraphone photos that are uploaded to Flickr by allowing annotation and suggesting relevant tags immediately after capture.", "num_citations": "1224\n", "authors": ["1184"]}

Our second browser uses a novel interface that is based on a vertical, zoomable timeline. This timeline browser does not require users to organize their photos, but instead, relies solely on system-generated structure. Our system creates a hierarchical structure of the user's photos by applying time-based clustering to identify subsets of photos that are likely to be related. In a user experiment, we compared users' searching and browsing performance across these browsers, using each user's own photo collection.

We extend previous literature on user contribution by studying the factors that are associated with users' photo sharing in an online community, drawing on motivation theories as well as on analysis of basic structural properties. Our results indicate that photo sharing declines in respect to the users' tenure in the community. We also show that users with higher commitment to the community and greater\" structural embeddedness\" tend to share more content. We demonstrate that the motivation of self-development is negatively related to photo sharing, and that tenure in the community moderates the effect of self-development on photo sharing.

Prior work has addressed the event identification task under two different scenarios, namely, when the events are known ahead of time, as is sometimes the case for planned events, and when the events are unknown, as is the case for spontaneous, unplanned events. In this article, we discuss both the unknown-and known-event identification scenarios, and attempt to characterize the key factors in the identification process, including the nature of social media content as well as the behavior and characteristics of event content over time. Furthermore, we propose enhancements to our earlier techniques that consider these factors and improve the state-of-the-art unknown-event identification strategies.

{"title": "What happens in happn: The warranting powers of location history in online dating\n", "abstract": " Many location-based dating applications allow users to search for potential matches who are physically proximate. A recent mobile dating application, happn, adds a temporal dimension to location-based dating, showing users the number of times that they crossed path with each other, as well as the location of the most recent overlap. We conducted qualitative interviews with 15 happn users to understand how people make sense of crossed paths, and assess the meanings they assign to these location overlaps. Building on Uncertainty Reduction Theory, we show the various outcomes of the crossed paths and how they play a role in uncertainty reduction. In particular, the warranting power of the device-driven location data was accepted as valuable, and generated little concern about misrepresentation. Moreover, people assigned significant meaning to the minimal cues available from the overlap data. In addition\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "26\n", "authors": ["1184"]}

To better understand this role we developed CityBeat, a system that implements what we call \u201ceditorial algorithms\u201d to find possible news events. This fully functional system collects real time geo-tagged information from social media, finds key stories, makes an editorial decision whether these events are of interest and eventually visualizes these stories on a big screen display. The system was designed in collaboration with journalists and tested at four New York City newsrooms. Our results show that while journalists were receptive to the idea of machine-generated news stories, the actual results of the system confirmed current concerns among journalists and researchers about the dangers of outsourcing news finding tasks to machines. This paper therefore exemplifies how news sourcing systems based on social media may favor specific type of news events, do not report results quickly enough, and cater to a biased population and interests.", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["1184"]}

{"title": "Location and the web (LocWeb 2008)\n", "abstract": " The World Wide Web has become the world's largest networked information resource, but references to geographical locations remain unstructured and typically implicit in nature. This lack of explicit spatial knowledge within the Web makes it difficult to service user needs for location-specific information. At present, spatial knowledge is hidden in many small information fragments such as addresses on Web pages, annotated photos with GPS co-ordinates, geographic mapping applications, and geotags in user-generated content. Several emerging formats that primarily or secondarily include location metadata, like GeoRSS, KML, and microformats, aim to improve this state of affairs. However, the question remains how to extract, index, mine, find, view, mashup, and exploit Web content using its location semantics.

Content contribution from members is critical to the viability of these online communities. It is therefore important to understand what drives users to share content with others in such settings. We extend previous literature on user contribution by studying the factors that are associated with users\u2019 photo sharing in an online community, drawing on motivation theories as well as on analysis of basic structural properties. Our results indicate that photo sharing declines in respect to the users\u2019 tenure in the community. We also show that users with higher commitment to the community and greater \u201cstructural embeddedness\u201d tend to share more content. We demonstrate that the motivation of self-development is negatively related to photo sharing, and that tenure in the community moderates the effect of self-development on photo sharing. Directions for future research, as well as implications for theory and practice are discussed.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1184"]}

AI-MC is increasingly involved in human communication and has the potential to impact core aspects of human communication, such as language production, interpersonal perception and task performance. Through a between-subjects experimental design we examine how these processes are influenced when integrating AI-generated language in the form of suggested text responses (Google's smart replies) into a text-based referential communication task. Our study replicates and extends the impacts of a positivity bias in AI-generated language and introduces the adjacency pair framework into the study of AI-MC.

{"title": "Artificial intelligence in communication impacts language and social relationships\n", "abstract": " Artificial intelligence (AI) is now widely used to facilitate social interaction, but its impact on social relationships and communication is not well understood. We study the social consequences of one of the most pervasive AI applications: algorithmic response suggestions (\"smart replies\"). Two randomized experiments (n = 1036) provide evidence that a commercially-deployed AI changes how people interact with and perceive one another in pro-social and anti-social ways. We find that using algorithmic responses increases communication efficiency, use of positive emotional language, and positive evaluations by communication partners. However, consistent with common assumptions about the negative implications of AI, people are evaluated more negatively if they are suspected to be using algorithmic responses. Thus, even though AI can increase communication efficiency and improve interpersonal perceptions, it risks changing users' language production and continues to be viewed negatively.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1184"]}

Although social technologies could play a key role in realizing this potential, significant barriers have emerged to the adoption of IRE services, including concerns related to trust, reciprocity, and coordination. To explore these issues, we designed and iterated on a concept called ShareBox, a system that enables IRE through a smart lockbox. We developed ShareBox as a technology probe following a set of design guidelines including: creating a physical-virtual system, enabling asynchronous and anonymous exchange, allowing for low-entry-barrier interactions, and emphasizing affordability and flexibility.

{"title": "Gender and social sharing of emotions in large-scale social awareness streams\n", "abstract": " Social network sites (SNS) such as Twitter and Facebook have become increasingly popular throughout recent years. More and more people turn to these platforms to actively communicate with the members of their online social networks. In fact, results from a recent survey reveal that two out of three adults in the US are members of SNS (Smith & Rainie, 2010).The central feature of today\u2019s popular SNS is \u201csocial awareness streams\u201d(SAS)(Naaman, Boase, & Lai, 2010), streams of short and primarily textual content, posted by the contacts of a given user. For instance, users of Facebook see a \u201cNews Feed,\u201d which consists of reverse-chronologically ordered short updates from their list of contacts, as soon as they login to the system. Similarly, the primary content in Twitter presented to users is a list of Twitter updates,\u201ctweets,\u201d posted by the users\u2019 contacts. One of the main drivers of use in widely used SNS like Facebook and Twitter is in fact SAS. For example, on an average day, 15% of Facebook users in the US post at least one Facebook status update (Smith, 2011). SAS not only give users of SNS a means to be in sync with the events taking place in the lives of the members of their social networks, but also ways to engage in interactions around the posts they see. For instance, in Twitter, a popular SNS that allows posting of messages up to 140 characters, users can \u201creply\u201d to a post and take part in interactions with one or multiple other users. In Facebook, users can contribute a \u201ccomment\u201d to a status update they see on their News Feed, thus engaging in discussions of the subject matter of the original post.

In particular, user generated content on mobile-oriented platforms like Twitter allows for real-time narrations thanks to the instantaneous nature of publishing. A common practice for users is to include in the tweets links pointing to articles, media files and other resources. In this paper, we are interested in how the resources shared in a stream of tweets for an event can be analyzed, and how can they help tell the event story. We describe a system that extracts, resolves, and eventually filters the resources shared in tweets content according to two different ranking functions. We are interested in how these two ranking functions perform (with respect to speed and accuracy) for discovering important and relevant resources that will tell the event story. We describe an experiment on a sample set of events where we evaluate those functions.
