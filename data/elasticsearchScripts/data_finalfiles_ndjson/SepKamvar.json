{"title": "The eigentrust algorithm for reputation management in p2p networks\n", "abstract": " Peer-to-peer file-sharing networks are currently receiving much attention as a means of sharing and distributing information. However, as recent experience shows, the anonymous, open nature of these networks offers an almost ideal environment for the spread of self-replicating inauthentic files. We describe an algorithm to decrease the number of downloads of inauthentic files in a peer-to-peer file-sharing network that assigns each peer a unique global trust value, based on the peer's history of uploads. We present a distributed and secure method to compute global trust values, based on Power iteration. By having peers use these global trust values to choose the peers from whom they download, the network effectively identifies malicious peers and isolates them from the network. In simulations, this reputation system, called EigenTrust, has been shown to significantly decrease the number of inauthentic files on\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5430\n", "authors": ["1191"]}
{"title": "From instance-level constraints to space-level constraints: Making the most of prior knowledge in data clustering\n", "abstract": " We present an improved method for clustering in the presence of very limited supervisory information, given as pairwise instance constraints.  By allowing instance-level constraints to have space-level inductive implications, we are able to successfully incorporate constraints for a wide range of data set types.  Our method greatly improves on the previously studied constrained k-means algorithm, generally requiring less than half as many constraints to achieve a given accuracy on a range of real-world data, while also being more robust when over-constrained.  We additionally discuss an active learning algorithm which increases the value of constraints even further.", "num_citations": "764\n", "authors": ["1191"]}

In Quadratic Extrapolation, we take advantage of the fact that the first eigenvalue of a Markov matrix is known to be 1 to compute the nonprincipal eigenvectors using successive iterates of the Power Method.

The spam likelihood value is computed from an importance of the node and a derivative value of the importance function with respect to a coupling factor. The likelihood that the node's importance is inflated by link spam is estimated by calculating the ratio of the magnitude of the derivative value for the node to the rank for the node. Alternatively, the spam likelihood may be computed directly from a component of the principal eigenvector of A evaluated at two values of the parameter c. The normalized derivative value can also be used to provide an order of importance in a list of nodes.", "num_citations": "33\n", "authors": ["1191"]}

{"title": "Non-cooperation in competitive p2p networks\n", "abstract": " Large-scale competitive P2P networks are threatened by the non-cooperation problem, where peers do not forward queries to potential competitors. Non-cooperation will be a growing problem in such applications as pay-per-transaction file-sharing, P2P auctions, and P2P service discovery networks, where peers are in competition with each other to provide services. Here, the authors showed how non-cooperation causes unacceptable degradation in quality of results, and present an economic protocol to address this problem. This protocol, called the RTR protocol, is based on the buying and selling of the right-to-respond (RTR) to each query in the network. Through simulations it is shown how the RTR protocol not only overcomes non-cooperation by providing proper incentives to peers, but also results in a network that is even more effective and efficient through intelligent, incentive-compatible routing of messages", "num_citations": "31\n", "authors": ["1191"]}

An item, such as a document, is examined to identify terms related to the user's profile. A term profile for an identified term is compared to a user's profile. The more closely related the identified term is to the user's profile, the higher a similarity score will be. Alternatively, terms found in a document may have a user profile score which may be obtained by looking the term up in the user's profile. Terms having high profile similarity scores or high user profile scores are used in identifying snippets which may be relevant to a user.

With Aardvark, users ask a question, either by instant message, e-mail, Web input, text message, or voice. Aardvark then routes the question to the person in the user's extended social network most likely to be able to answer that question. As compared to a traditional Web search engine, where the challenge lies in finding the right document to satisfy a user's information need, the challenge in a social search engine like Aardvark lies in finding the right person to satisfy a user's information need. Further, while trust in a traditional search engine is based on authority, in a social search engine like Aardvark, trust is based on intimacy. We describe how these considerations inform the architecture, algorithms, and user interface of Aardvark, and how they are reflected in the behavior of Aardvark users.", "num_citations": "25\n", "authors": ["1191"]}

This data, accessible to teachers in a web dashboard, enables teachers to derive deeper insights from their classrooms. Sensei is currently deployed in three Montessori schools and we have evaluated the effectiveness of the system with teachers.

The present study attempts to enable the human work that goes into conducting exploratory searches to be efficiently captured and transmitted to other learners. By this method, web search expertise can transfer socially and implicitly between users instead of developing individually or through directed learning. The system we deployed uses an existing metaphor, the timeline, to structure insights from searches. We refer to these semantically meaningful representations as `weblines'. We deployed a live system to 81 users in three user populations. The resulting weblines were delineated into four types.
