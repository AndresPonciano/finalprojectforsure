However, the run to deploy Speech-based NUIs by the industry has had a large impact on the naturality of such interfaces. This paper presents a usability test of the most prestigious and internationally used Speech-based NUI (i.e., Alexa, Siri, Cortana and Google\u2019s). A comparison of the services that each one provides was also performed considering: access to music services, agenda, news, weather, To-Do lists and maps or directions, among others. The test was design by two Human Computer Interaction experts and executed by eight persons. Results show that even though there are many services available, there is a lot to do to improve the usability of these systems.

In a previous study (LAWWCC 2016) we reported results of an exploratory study that aimed to characterize the professional development model of people that studied Computer Sciences in Costa Rica, in terms of roles and industrial sectors with which they began their professional career and in which they report are currently working.. Surprisingly, no important gender differences were depicted amongst men and women. As a result, some valid concerns were raised regarding the question: do the results represent the behavior of women in all professional career stages? As a result, in this study, results are now grouped by generations. The aim of this study is to determine whether there are differences in these variables in the professional career evolution for different generations. Results are obtained from an online survey responded by 166 women professionals in Computer Sciences. Women are grouped in four generational categories: baby boomers, generation X, young and mature millennials. The main finding of this research is that the professional evolution of women, with respect to the role and sector in which they perform, revel different behaviors for women of different generations.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["2240"]}

Meanwhile, Collaborative Writing Environments (CWE) allow groups of people to work together and increase the chances of success and share knowledge when they are working on shared documents. An extremely important aspect in CWEs is notification mechanisms as these are essential to provide users awareness about the collaborative work they are doing. In this paper, we describe a set of augmented objects created to support the notification in CWEs; these objects can improve the way in which the notifications are delivered to users, according to the writing strategy defined by the collaboration team.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["2240"]}

Cognitive therapy teaches patients how to respond to triggering stimuli, by relaxing their mind and entering a state of reduced anxiety. Some of these methods depend on patient\u2019s imagination, since putting them in the situation or the object that triggers the anxiety (airplanes, spiders, public speaking, and dinosaurs) might be difficult. Our project proposes an interactive virtual reality system that enhances both the visual and hearing parts of the therapy, putting the patient in a virtual world where they can learn the proper techniques to learn how to respond to the anxiety triggers. We call our system VRPhobia. A prototype was created and it was evaluated with the aid of Cognitive Psychology therapists. The system takes into account the techniques used by the therapists and the training that the patient goes through. It works as a tool that enhances the therapy process.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["2240"]}

Smart devices are important to provide user awareness. However, their use must be controlled and human perception should be considered to avoid information overload.

This personalized notification mechanism uses an inference engine and a set of rules to generate notification alternatives and select the \u201cbest\u201d one. A continuous refinement approach is also used to improve notification delivery. Our system was evaluated and the baseline rules were established by 11 expert users.

Both are 4-credit-hour courses, with 64 hours of class time in a 16-week semester. The main objective of these courses is toprovide students with a practical introduction to software testing processes, techniques, andactivities within the context of quality assurance. In particular, the tools we used were Microsoft Visual Studio Ultimate 2010 (which includesMicrosoft Test Manager 2010) and Microsoft Team Foundation Server 2010. These toolswere chosen because they provide an integrated and comprehensive suite for the applicationlifecycle management, including test planning, authoring, automation, execution, tracking, monitoring and managing. Assessment Methods & FindingsOur approach of incorporating Microsoft test tools in the course was assessed from thestudents\u2019 and teacher\u2019s perspective. The students\u2019 perspective was obtained from a survey. The teacher\u2019s perspective consisted in a qualitative assessment of strengths and limitationsas well as a list of lessons learned. The main advantage of having such integrated tool suite to support a course is that studentsare able to put into practice the different concepts and facets of the testing process within asingle environment (IDE), with the consequent benefit of minimizing the learning curve andallowing full traceability from user stories to tasks to test cases to automation to bugs (whichwould be cumbersome if different tools were used for different facets of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["2240"]}
