Considering the presence of increasingly automated vehicles in the traffic stream, a number of research activities have focused on the influence of automated vehicles on the bulk traffic flow. In the present article, we demonstrate experimentally that intelligent control of an autonomous vehicle is able to dampen stop-and-go waves that can arise even in the absence of geometric or lane changing triggers. Precisely, our experiments on a circular track with more than 20 vehicles show that traffic waves emerge consistently, and that they can be dampened by controlling the velocity of a single vehicle in the flow. We compare metrics for velocity, braking events, and fuel economy across experiments.

Substantial theoretical and experimental underpinnings of vehicle automation and platooning were established in the from the USDOT Automated Highway System effort [1]. However, it is not yet clear whether the ACC vehicles that are currently commercially available will dampen or amplify phantom jams. The relevant measure for phantom traffic jam occurrence is string stability, which tells whether small perturbations from the equilibrium flow are amplified (unstable) or dissipated (stable) as they propagate from one vehicle to another along a string of vehicles.

{"title": "Modeling languages applied to decision controllers for embedded human systems\n", "abstract": " Embedded Human Systems are systems where components are necessarily human and computational. When these systems are heavily impacted by physical constraints, or safety requirements, a modeling approach to their design is merited, especially when certain aspects of the design can be automated, or verified, using computation methods. In this paper we review one such element of the design-the decision controller-and discuss the physical and computational methods that can be used to design and validate these controllers.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1396"]}
{"title": "Large-scale Cognitive Modeling Using Modelintegrated Computing\n", "abstract": " Research in cognitive modeling is increasingly addressing large-scale models that interact with complex synthetic task environments. These efforts bring with them a number of new challenges, including the need to manage the complexity of large models, to integrate the models into complex software simulations, and to understand and debug models that are specified at high levels of abstraction. These challenges are difficult in isolation; together they constitute an enormous obstacle combining the significant challenges of large-scale software engineering with the complexity of knowledge-based systems.This workshop will describe and debate the potential of a bold new solution to these challenges based on Model Integrated Computing (MIC). MIC is a modeling and systems integration paradigm, maturing at the vanguard of systems/software engineering (Sztipanovits & Karsai, 1997; Karsai, Agarwal, & Ledeczi, 2003). MIC is a promising foundation for large-scale cognitive modeling (LSCM) because it:(a) allows modelers to specify models in domainspecific, high-level languages;(b) efficiently combines models expressed in these languages; and (c) automates the integration of models into larger systems and task environments (Balasubramanian, Schmidt, Moln\u00e1r, & L\u00e9deczi, 2008).", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1396"]}

{"title": "Automated Model-Based Optimization of Data-Adaptable Embedded Systems\n", "abstract": " Dynamic data-driven applications such as object tracking, surveillance, and other sensing and decision applications are largely dependent on the characteristics of the data streams on which they operate. The underlying models and algorithms of data-driven applications must continually adapt at runtime to changes in data quality and availability to meet both functional and designer-specified performance requirements. Given the dynamic nature of these applications, point solutions produced by traditional design tools cannot be expected to perform adequately across varying execution scenarios. Additionally, the increasing diversity and interdependence of application requirements complicates the design and optimization process. To assist designers of data-driven applications, we present a modeling and optimization framework that enables developers to model an application's data sources, tasks, and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1396"]}

{"title": "Task transition scheduling for data-adaptable systems\n", "abstract": " Data-adaptable embedded systems operate on a variety of data streams, which requires a large degree of configurability and adaptability to support runtime changes in data stream inputs. Data-adaptable reconfigurable embedded systems, when decomposed into a series of tasks, enable a flexible runtime implementation in which a system can transition the execution of certain tasks between hardware and software while simultaneously continuing to process data during the transition. Efficient runtime scheduling of task transitions is needed to optimize system throughput and latency of the reconfiguration and transition periods. In this article, we provide an overview of a runtime framework enabling the efficient transition of tasks between software and hardware in response to changes in system inputs. We further present and analyze several runtime transition scheduling algorithms and highlight the latency and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1396"]}

{"title": "Model-driven optimization of data-adaptable embedded systems\n", "abstract": " Complex sensing and decision applications such as object tracking and classification, video surveillance, unmanned aerial vehicle flight decisions, and others operate on vast data streams with dynamic characteristics. As the availability and quality of the sensed data changes, the underlying models and decision algorithms should continually adapt in order to meet desired high-level requirements. Due to the complexity of such dynamic data-driven systems, traditional design time techniques are often incapable of producing a solution that remains optimal in the face of dynamically changing data, algorithms, and even availability of computational resources. To assist developers of these systems, we present a modeling and optimization methodology that enables developers to capture application task flows and data sources, define associated quality metrics with data types, specify each algorithm's data and quality\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1396"]}
{"title": "Stabilizing traffic with a single autonomous vehicle: Wip abstract\n", "abstract": " This work focuses on technologies for cyber-physical systems (CPS) to mitigate traffic instabilities that adversely affect fuel consumption (eg, stop-and-go waves) via precise velocity control of a small number of autonomous vehicles (AVs) on the highway. The main finding is that even a single autonomous vehicle may substantially reduce undesirable traffic waves in its vicinity when properly controlled. The general approach is to use AVs and their sensors to detect congestion events, and then close the loop by carefully following prescribed velocity controllers that are demonstrated to reduce the fuel consumption of the overall traffic flow.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1396"]}
{"title": "The 11th workshop on domain-specific modeling\n", "abstract": " Domain-Specific Modeling (DSM) raises the level of abstraction beyond programming by specifying the solution directly using visual models to express domain concepts. In many cases, final products can be generated automatically from these high-level specifications.

MEG measures the magnetic field outside the head: in effect, the resultant field from the flow of current inside the brain. We describe our current techniques to perform this inverse computation (called source estimation in much of the literature), which provides a view of brain activity that is less sensitive to disturbances which affect other kinds of brain activity measurements, though much more expensive to record.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1396"]}
{"title": "Toward design parameterization support for model predictive control\n", "abstract": " Research into the autonomous behavior of Un-manned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) requires concise and dependable specification techniques in order to provide behavioral descriptions for the controllers of these aircraft. Practical issues with autonomous aircraft involve the safety and reliability of the controller (eg, guarantee of stability), as well as verification of the high-level intention of the autonomous behavior. Since most behaviors are implemented orthogonally to their high-level specification, improvements in the ability to rapidly specify the models that govern the behavior are certainly welcome. This paper describes the framework for decreasing the abstraction required to specify the behavior of an autonomous controller implemented through model predictive control.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1396"]}
{"title": "Improving CBS tool development with technological spaces\n", "abstract": " The complexity of computer based systems (CBSs) requires that multiple levels of abstraction be available to a designer in order to facilitate their formal specification. Generating final executable code from the model of the system is preferred to hand-coding the implementation, but this is seldom done in one step-usually there are several cascading transformations that eventually result in the executable system. We explain how the concept of the technological space (TS) can be used to define and describe the layers between cascading transformations, and the transformations themselves. TSs are also shown as a categorization that better distinguishes between a domain and the technology used to store information in a domain.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1396"]}
{"title": "Managing Intent: Propagation of Meaning During Model Transformations\n", "abstract": " The Model Driven Architecture (MDA) maintains that systems can be abstractly specified, and specifically instantiated. The abstract specification is created using formally defined models; thus in order to fulfill these ambitions, model transformations must be employed on some level. The definition of these transforms\u2014however\u2014is not a trivial task. In addition to the basic problems of the transformation syntax, and an intuitive interface, there is a more significant and difficult problem: the translation of the platform-independent models (PIMs) into platform-specific models (PSMs) such that they are \u201ccorrect\u201d in the language of the PSM. This paper philosophically discusses the root causes of transformations, specifically the syntax and semantics changes that require MDA-like transformations between modeling languages. It also examines the difference between the intent of the modeler, and that of the model\u2014an important distinction when creating transformations.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1396"]}
