This paper studies the implications of the local network view of the controllers. In particular, we establish a connection to the field of local algorithms and distributed computing, and discuss lessons for the design of a distributed control plane. We show that existing local algorithms can be used to develop efficient coordination protocols in which each controller only needs to respond to events that take place in its local neighborhood. However, while existing algorithms can be used, SDN networks also suggest a new approach to the study of locality in distributed computing.

Various mechanisms have been designed to overcome this problem. However, the selfish behavior of peers has aspects which go beyond resource sharing. This paper studies the effects on the topology of a P2P network if peers selfishly select the peers to connect to. In our model, a peer exploits locality properties in order to minimize the latency (or response times) of its lookup operations. At the same time, the peer aims at not having to maintain links to too many other peers in the system. By giving tight bounds on the price of anarchy, we show that the resulting topologies can be much worse than if peers collaborated.

{"title": "Service chain and virtual network embeddings: Approximations using randomized rounding\n", "abstract": " The SDN and NFV paradigms enable novel network services which can be realized and embedded in a flexible and rapid manner. For example, SDN can be used to flexibly steer traffic from a source to a destination through a sequence of virtualized middleboxes, in order to realize so-called service chains. The service chain embedding problem consists of three tasks: admission control, finding suitable locations to allocate the virtualized middleboxes and computing corresponding routing paths. This paper considers the offline batch embedding of multiple service chains. Concretely, we consider the objectives of maximizing the profit by embedding an optimal subset of requests or minimizing the costs when all requests need to be embedded. Interestingly, while the service chain embedding problem has recently received much attention, so far, only non- polynomial time algorithms (based on integer programming) as well as heuristics (which do not provide any formal guarantees) are known. This paper presents the first polynomial time service chain approximation algorithms both for the case with admission and without admission control. Our algorithm is based on a novel extension of the classic linear programming and randomized rounding technique, which may be of independent interest. In particular, we show that our approach can also be extended to more complex service graphs, containing cycles or sub-chains, hence also providing new insights into the classic virtual network embedding problem.", "num_citations": "45\n", "authors": ["509"]}

This results in an overall performance degradation, and hence proper incentives are needed to encourage contributions. One interesting resource is bandwidth. Thereby, a service differentiation approach seems appropriate, where peers contributing higher upload bandwidths are rewarded with higher download bandwidths in return. Keeping track of the contribution of each peer in an open, decentralized environment, however, is a difficult task; many proposed systems are susceptible to false reports. Besides being prone to attacks, some solutions have a large communication and computation overhead, which can even be linear in the number of transactions\u2014an unacceptable burden in practical and active systems.

{"title": "Modeling Sensor Networks.\n", "abstract": " In order to develop algorithms for sensor networks and in order to give mathematical correctness and performance proofs, models for various aspects of sensor networks are needed. This chapter presents and discusses currently used models for sensor networks. Generally, \ufb01nding good models is a challenging task. On the one hand, a model should be as simple as possible such that the analysis of a given algorithm remains tractable. On the other hand, however, a model must not be too simplistic in the sense that it neglects important properties of the network. A great algorithm in theory may be inef\ufb01cient or even incorrect in practice if the analysis is based on idealistic assumptions. For example, an algorithm that ignores interference may fail in practice since communication happens over a shared medium. Many models for sensor network have their origin in classic areas of theoretical computer science and applied mathematics. Since the topology of a sensor network can be regarded as a graph, the distributed algorithms community uses models from graph theory, representing nodes by vertices and wireless links by edges. Another crucial ingredient of sensor network models is geometry. Geometry comes into play as the distribution of sensor nodes in space, as well as the propagation range of wireless links, usually adheres to geometric constraints.The chapter is organized as follows. In Section 4.2, the reader will become familiar with various models for the network\u2019s connectivity.

Based on the insight that code patterns reflect the data format of inputs processed by a program, we automatically construct an input dictionary by statically analyzing program control and data flow. Our analysis is performed before fuzzing commences, and the input dictionary is supplied to an off-the-shelf fuzzer to influence input generation. Evaluations show that our technique not only increases test coverage by 10\u201315% over baseline fuzzers such as afl but also reduces the time required to expose vulnerabilities\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "27\n", "authors": ["509"]}

However, distributed control planes are challenging to design and bootstrap, especially if to be done in-band, without dedicated control network, and without relying on legacy protocols. This paper promotes a distributed systems approach to build and maintain connectivity between a distributed control plane and the data plane. In particular, we make the case for a self-stabilizing distributed control plane, where from any initial configuration, controllers self-organize, and quickly establish a communication channel among themselves. Given the resulting managed control plane, arbitrary network services can be implemented on top.

This paper identifies and analyzes, a novel Denial-of-Service attack which is based on route hijacking, i.e., which exploits the way transactions are routed and executed along the created channels of the network. This attack is conceptually interesting as even a limited attacker that manipulates the topology through the creation of new channels can navigate tradeoffs related to the way it attacks the network. Furthermore, the attack also highlights a fundamental design tradeoff for the defender (who determines its own routes): to become less predictable and hence secure, a rational node has to pay higher fees to nodes that forward its payments. We find that the three most common implementations for payment channels in Bitcoin (lnd, C-lightning, Eclair) approach routing differently. We begin by surveying the current state of the Lightning network and explore the routes chosen by these implementations. We find that in the current network nearly 60\\% of all routes pass through only five nodes, while 80\\% go through only 10 nodes. Thus, a relatively small number of colluding nodes can deny service to a large fraction of the network. We then turn to study an external attacker who creates links to the network and draws more routes through its nodes by asking for lower fees.

However, configuring such static failover mechanisms to achieve a high degree of robustness is known to be challenging, in particular when packet tagging or dynamic node state cannot be used. This paper initiates the systematic study of such local fast failover mechanisms which not only provide connectivity guarantees, even under multiple link failures, but also account for the quality of the resulting failover routes, with respect to locality (i.e., route length) and congestion. Failover quality has received less attention in the literature so far, yet it is increasingly important to support emerging applications.We first show that there exists an inherent tradeoff in terms of achievable locality and congestion of failover routes.

To support nodes in learning about possible paths to route their transactions, these networks need to provide gossip and probing mechanisms. This paper explores whether these mechanisms may be exploited to infer sensitive information about the flow of transactions, and eventually harm privacy. In particular, we identify two threats, related to an active and a passive adversary. The first is a probing attack: here the adversary aims to detect the maximum amount which is transferable in a given direction over a target channel by actively probing it and differentiating the response messages it receives. The second is a timing attack: the adversary discovers how close the destination of a routed payment actually is, by acting as a passive man-in-the middle and analyzing the time deltas between sent messages and their corresponding responses. We then analyze the limitations of these attacks and propose remediations for scenarios in which they are able to produce accurate results.", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["509"]}

For instance, such migrations can be useful to reduce the peak resource loads in the network by spreading CloudNets across the infrastructure, to save energy by moving CloudNets together and switching off unused components, or for maintenance purposes. We present a very generic algorithm to compute optimal embeddings of CloudNets: It allows for different objective functions (such as load minimization or energy conservation), supports cost-aware migration, and can deal with all link types that arise in practice (e.g., full-duplex or even wireless or wired broadcast links with multiple endpoints).

In this paper, networks are studied where the congestion---and thus the bandwidth available to a host---varies over time, and where in addition packets are lost at random. First, we propose a network comprising both dynamically varying congestion and random errors. Second, our model is extended with network calculus concepts in order to study bursty changes of congestion.

While OpenFlow and its match-action concept provide primitive operations to manipulate hardware configurations, over the last years, several more expressive network programming languages have been developed. This paper presents WNetKAT, the first network programming language accounting for the fact that networks are inherently weighted, and communications subject to capacity constraints (e.g., in terms of bandwidth) and costs (e.g., latency or monetary costs). WNetKAT is based on a syntactic and semantic extension of the NetKAT algebra. We demonstrate several relevant applications for WNetKAT, including cost- and capacity-aware reachability, as well as quality-of-service and fairness aspects. These applications do not only apply to classic, splittable and unsplittable (s; t)-flows, but also generalize to more complex network functions and service chains. For example, WNetKAT allows to model flows which need to traverse certain waypoint functions, which may change the traffic rate. This paper also shows the relation between the equivalence problem of WNetKAT and the equivalence problem of the weighted finite automata, which implies undecidability of the former. However, this paper also succeeds to prove the decidability of another useful problem, which is sufficient in many practical scnearios: whether an expression equals to 0.

The problem of how to embed virtual clusters in a resource efficient manner has received much attention over the last years. However, existing virtual cluster embedding algorithms typically optimize the embedding of a single request. We demonstrate that this can lead to fragmentation and suboptimal data center resource utilization over time. We propose an alternative in two stages: First, we describe a novel embedding algorithm, called Tetris, which, in an effort to avoid resource fragmentation over time, takes into account the specific node-to-link resource ratios of the individual requests. While Tetris can be suboptimal when embedding only one request, we find that it performs much better than the state-of-the-art algorithms over time.

However, this paper demonstrates that virtual switches introduce new attack surfaces in cloud setups, whose effects can be disastrous. Our analysis shows that these vulnerabilities are caused by: (1) inappropriate security assumptions (privileged virtual switch execution in kernel and user space), (2) the logical centralization of such networks (e.g., OpenStack or SDN), (3) the presence of bi-directional communication channels between data plane systems and the centralized controller, and (4) non-standard protocol parsers. Our work highlights the need to accommodate the data plane(s) in our threat models. In particular, it forces us to revisit today's assumption that the data plane can only be compromised by a sophisticated attacker: we show that compromising the data plane of modern computer networks can actually be performed by a very simple attacker with limited resources only and at low cost (i.e., at the cost of renting a virtual machine in the Cloud). As a case study, we fuzzed only 2\\% of the code-base of a production quality virtual switch's packet processor (namely OvS), identifying serious vulnerabilities leading to unauthenticated remote code execution. In particular, we present the \"rein worm\" which allows us to fully compromise test-setups in less than 100 seconds. We also evaluate the performance overhead of existing mitigations such as ASLR, PIEs, and unconditional stack canaries on OvS.

Our chosen subject is one of the largest Online Social Networks, Google+. Google+ has two distinguishing features that make it particularly interesting: (1) it is a directed network, which yields a rich set of triangle motifs, and (2) it is a young and fast evolving network, whose role in the OSN space is still not fully understood. For the purpose of this study, we crawled the network over a time period of six weeks, collecting several snapshots. We find that some triangle types display significant dynamics, e.g., for some specific initial types, up to 20% of the instances evolve to other types. Due to the fast growth of the OSN in the observed time period, many new triangles emerge. We also observe that many triangles evolve into less-connected motifs (with less edges), suggesting that growth also comes with pruning. We complement the topological study by also considering publicly available user profile data (mostly geographic locations). The corresponding results shed some light on the semantics of the triangle motifs. Indeed, we find that users in more symmetric triangle motifs live closer together, indicating more personal relationships.

{"title": "(FPT-) approximation algorithms for the virtual network embedding problem\n", "abstract": " Many resource allocation problems in the cloud can be described as a basic Virtual Network Embedding Problem (VNEP): finding mappings of request graphs (describing the workloads) onto a substrate graph (describing the physical infrastructure). In the offline setting, the two natural objectives are profit maximization, i.e., embedding a maximal number of request graphs subject to the resource constraints, and cost minimization, i.e., embedding all requests at minimal overall cost. The VNEP can be seen as a generalization of classic routing and call admission problems, in which requests are arbitrary graphs whose communication endpoints are not fixed. Due to its applications, the problem has been studied intensively in the networking community. However, the underlying algorithmic problem is hardly understood. This paper presents the first fixed-parameter tractable approximation algorithms for the VNEP. Our algorithms are based on randomized rounding. Due to the flexible mapping options and the arbitrary request graph topologies, we show that a novel linear program formulation is required. Only using this novel formulation the computation of convex combinations of valid mappings is enabled, as the formulation needs to account for the structure of the request graphs. Accordingly, to capture the structure of request graphs, we introduce the graph-theoretic notion of extraction orders and extraction width and show that our algorithms have exponential runtime in the request graphs' maximal width.

We in this paper present KRAKEN, a system that allows tenants to dynamically request and update minimum resource guarantees for both network bandwidth and compute resources at runtime. Unlike previous work, Kraken does not require prior knowledge about the resource needs of the tenants' applications but allows tenants to modify their reservation at runtime.

Distributed sensor nodes (e.g., in the smart grid's distribution network) are closer to an observed event than a global and remote observer or controller. This improves the visibility and response time of the system. Moreover, in a distributed system, local problems may also be handled locally and without overloading the communication network. This paper studies alarming from a distributed computing perspective and for two fundamentally different scenarios: on-duty and off-duty. We model the alarming system as a sensor network consisting of a set of distributed nodes performing local measurements to sense events. In order to avoid false alarms, the sensor nodes cooperate and only escalate an event (i.e., raise an alarm) if the number of sensor nodes sensing an event exceeds a certain threshold.

We analyze the Nash equilibria and show that the Windfall of Friendship can never be negative. However, we find that if the valuation of a friend is independent of the total number of friends, the social welfare may not increase monotonically with the extent to which players care for each other; intriguingly, in the corresponding scenario where the relative importance of a friend declines, the Windfall is monotonic again.This article also studies convergence of best-response sequences.

In practice however, the permanent stream of updates to the FIB due to routing updates complicates FIB aggregation: keeping an optimally aggregated FIB in face of these routing updates is algorithmically challenging. A sensible trade-off has to be found between the aggregation gain and the number of changes to the aggregated FIB. This paper is the first to investigate whether the spatial and temporal locality properties of updates to the tree-like FIB data structure can be leveraged by online FIB aggregation. Our contributions include (a) an empirical study of the locality of updates in public Internet routing data, (b) the specification and simulations of our Locality-aware FIB Aggregation algorithm (LFA), and (c) a competitive analysis that sheds light on the performance of online algorithms under worst-case update streams. Our results show that even a simple algorithm like LFA can effectively exploit the locality of FIB churn to keep low the number of updates to the aggregated FIB, as most FIB updates affect only a small number of regions in the FIB.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["509"]}

{"title": "Logically Isolated, Actually Unpredictable? Measuring Hypervisor Performance in Multi-Tenant SDNs\n", "abstract": " Ideally, by enabling multi-tenancy, network virtualization allows to improve resource utilization, while providing performance isolation: although the underlying resources are shared, the virtual network appears as a dedicated network to the tenant. However, providing such an illusion is challenging in practice, and over the last years, many expedient approaches have been proposed to provide performance isolation in virtual networks, by enforcing bandwidth reservations. We in this paper study another source for overheads and unpredictable performance in virtual networks: the hypervisor. The hypervisor is a critical component in multi-tenant environments, but its overhead and influence on performance are hardly understood today. In particular, we focus on OpenFlow-based virtualized Software Defined Networks (vSDNs). Network virtualization is considered a killer application for SDNs: a vSDN allows each tenant to flexibly manage its network from a logically centralized perspective, via a simple API. For the purpose of our study, we developed a new benchmarking tool for OpenFlow control and data planes, enabling high and consistent OpenFlow message rates. Using our tool, we identify and measure controllable and uncontrollable effects on performance and overhead, including the hypervisor technology, the number of tenants as well as the tenant type, as well as the type of OpenFlow messages.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["509"]}

Independent from the initial network topology, the system converges to the desired topology via forwarding, inserting, and deleting links to neighboring nodes. Name-passing process calculi, like the pi-calculus, are a well-known and widely used method to model concurrent and distributed algorithms. The pi-calculus is designed to naturally express processes with a changing link infrastructure, as the communication between processes may carry information that can be used for a change in the linkage between the processes. We redesign a simple local linearization algorithm with asynchronous message-passing that was originally designed for a shared memory model. We use an extended localized pi-calculus, a variant of the pi-calculus, to model the algorithm. Subsequently, we formally prove the self-stabilizing properties closure, weak convergence for every arbitrary initial configuration, and strong convergence for two special cases. In our proofs we utilize rather an assertional reasoning than an action-based style. Furthermore, we describe the challenges in proving (strong) convergence in the general case. Additionally, we give strong arguments for strong convergence, supported by further proven lemmata, and discuss different approaches for a formal proof.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["509"]}

This can be inefficient and misses out on a basic optimization opportunity: as for any network optimization algorithm that faces repeating problem instances, it may be beneficial to learn from network states and the outcome of acceptance decisions of the past. In this paper, we propose Ismael, a machine learning framework for predicting the acceptance of virtual clusters, one of the most common virtual network abstractions in data centers. Ismael can be configured with, and learn from, different existing algorithms by combining fixed-size feature\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["509"]}
{"title": "The evolutionary price of anarchy: Locally bounded agents in a dynamic virus game\n", "abstract": " The Price of Anarchy (PoA) is a well-established game-theoretic concept to shed light on coordination issues arising in open distributed systems. Leaving agents to selfishly optimize comes with the risk of ending up in sub-optimal states (in terms of performance and/or costs), compared to a centralized system design. However, the PoA relies on strong assumptions about agents' rationality (e.g., resources and information) and interactions, whereas in many distributed systems agents interact locally with bounded resources. They do so repeatedly over time (in contrast to \"one-shot games\"), and their strategies may evolve. Using a more realistic evolutionary game model, this paper introduces a realized evolutionary Price of Anarchy (ePoA). The ePoA allows an exploration of equilibrium selection in dynamic distributed systems with multiple equilibria, based on local interactions of simple memoryless agents. Considering a fundamental game related to virus propagation on networks, we present analytical bounds on the ePoA in basic network topologies and for different strategy update dynamics. In particular, deriving stationary distributions of the stochastic evolutionary process, we find that the Nash equilibria are not always the most abundant states, and that different processes can feature significant off-equilibrium behavior, leading to a significantly higher ePoA compared to the PoA studied traditionally in the literature.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["509"]}

As updates communicated by the controller take effect asynchronously, the challenge is to perform these updates fast, i.e., using a minimal number of rounds (controller interactions).

{"title": "Consistent sdns through network state fuzzing\n", "abstract": " The conventional wisdom is that a software-defined network (SDN) operates under the premise that the logically centralized control plane has an accurate representation of the actual data plane state. Unfortunately, bugs, misconfigurations, faults or attacks can introduce inconsistencies that undermine correct operation. Previous work in this area, however, lacks a holistic methodology to tackle this problem and thus, addresses only certain parts of the problem. Yet, the consistency of the overall system is only as good as its least consistent part. Motivated by an analogy of network consistency checking with program testing, we propose to add active probe-based network state fuzzing to our consistency check repertoire. Hereby, our system, PAZZ, combines production traffic with active probes to periodically test if the actual forwarding path and decision elements (on the data plane) correspond to the expected ones (on the control plane). Our insight is that active traffic covers the inconsistency cases beyond the ones identified by passive traffic. PAZZ prototype was built and evaluated on topologies of varying scale and complexity. Our results show that PAZZ requires minimal network resources to detect persistent data plane faults through fuzzing and localize them quickly while outperforming baseline approaches.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["509"]}

Over the last almost 20 years, much progress has been made in devising oblivious routing schemes that guarantee close to optimal load and also algorithms for constructing such schemes efficiently have been designed. However, a common drawback of existing oblivious routing schemes is that they are not compact: they require large routing tables (of polynomial size), which does not scale. This paper presents the first oblivious routing scheme which guarantees close to optimal load and is compact at the same time -- requiring routing tables of polylogarithmic size. Our algorithm maintains the polynomial runtime and polylogarithmic competitive ratio of existing algorithms, and is hence particularly well-suited for emerging large-scale networks.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["509"]}

{"title": "Short schedules for fast flow rerouting\n", "abstract": " This paper studies the fundamental problem of how to reroute  unsplittable flows of a certain demand in a capacitated network from their current paths to their respective new paths, in a congestion-free manner and fast. This scheduling problem has applications in traffic engineering in communication networks and has recently received much attention in software-defined networks, in which updates are distributed over an asynchronous network by a software controller. However, existing algorithms for this problem either have a super-polynomial runtime or only compute feasible schedules, which do not provide any guarantees on the length of the rerouting schedule. This paper presents the first polynomial-time algorithm for computing shortest update schedules to reroute flows in a congestion-free manner. We contribute an almost tight characterization of the polynomial-time tractability of the problem: We present the first polynomial-time solution for this problem for two flows, but also show that even the question whether a feasible update schedule exists, is already NP-hard for six flows. In fact, the presented algorithm runs in linear time and is hence not only optimal in terms of scheduling but also asymptotically optimal in terms of runtime.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["509"]}

This paper presents Software-Defined Adversarial Trajectory Sampling (SoftATS), an OpenFlow-based mechanism to efficiently monitor packet trajectories, also in the presence of non-cooperating or even adversarial switches or routers, e.g., containing hardware backdoors. Our approach is based on a secure, redundant and adaptive sample distribution scheme which allows us to provably detect adversarial switches or routers trying to reroute, mirror, drop, inject, or modify packets (i.e., header and/or payload).

Based on this new networking paradigm, we formulate the Constrained Virtual Steiner Arborescence Problem (CVSAP) which asks for optimal locations to perform In-network processing, in order to jointly minimize processing costs and network traffic while respecting link and node capacities. We prove that CVSAP cannot be approximated (unless P = NP), and accordingly, develop the exact algorithm VirtuCast to compute (near) optimal solutions. VirtuCast consists of: (1) a compact single-commodity flow Integer Programming (IP) formulation; (2) a flow decomposition algorithm to reconstruct individual routes from the IP solution. The compactness of the IP formulation allows for computing lower bounds even on large instances quickly, speeding up the algorithm. We rigorously prove VirtuCast's correctness. To complement our theoretical findings, we have implemented VirtuCast and present an extensive computational evaluation, showing that using VirtuCast realistically sized instances can be solved (close to) optimality. We show that VirtuCast significantly improves upon naive multi-commodity formulations and also initiate the study of primal heuristics to generate feasible solutions during the branch-and-bound process.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["509"]}
{"title": "Simple Destination-Swap Strategies for Adaptive Intra-and Inter-Tenant VM Migration\n", "abstract": " This paper investigates the opportunities and limitations of adaptive virtual machine (VM) migration to reduce communication costs in a virtualized environment. We introduce a new formal model for the problem of online VM migration in two scenarios: (1) VMs can be migrated arbitrarily in the substrate network; e.g., a private cloud provider may have an incentive to reduce the overall communication cost in the network. (2) VMs can only be migrated within a given tenant; e.g., a user that was assigned a set of physical machines may exchange the functionality of the VMs on these machines. We propose a simple class of Destination-Swap algorithms which are based on an aggressive collocation strategy (inspired by splay datastructures) and which maintain a minimal and local amount of per-node (amortized cost) information to decide where to migrate a VM and how; thus, the algorithms react quickly to changes in the load. The algorithms come in two main flavors, an indirect and distributed variant which keeps existing VM placements local, and a direct variant which keeps the number of affected VMs small. We show that naturally, inter-tenant optimizations yield a larger potential for optimization, but generally also a tenant itself can improve its embedding. Moreover, there exists an interesting tradeoff between direct and indirect strategies: indirect variants are preferable under skewed and sparse communication patterns due to their locality properties.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["509"]}

This article proposes the medium access (MAC) protocol \\textsc{AntiJam} that is provably robust against a powerful reactive adversary who can jam a -portion of the time steps, where  is an arbitrary constant. The adversary uses carrier sensing to make informed decisions on when it is most harmful to disrupt communications; moreover, we allow the adversary to be adaptive and to have complete knowledge of the entire protocol history. Our MAC protocol is able to make efficient use of the non-jammed time periods and achieves an asymptotically optimal, -competitive throughput in this harsh scenario. In addition, \\textsc{AntiJam} features a low convergence time and has good fairness properties.

However, configuring these mechanisms to provide a high resilience against multiple failures while avoiding congestion along failover routes is algorithmically challenging, as the rerouting rules can only depend on local failure information and must be defined ahead of time. This paper presents a randomized local fast rerouting algorithm for Clos networks, the predominant datacenter topologies. Given a graph  describing a Clos topology, our algorithm defines local routing rules for each node , which only depend on the packet's destination and are conditioned on the incident link failures. We prove that as long as number of failures at each node does not exceed a certain bound, our algorithm achieves an asymptotically minimal congestion up to polyloglog factors along failover paths.

This paper is motivated by question whether the reactivity of a network can be improved by re-optimizing solutions dynamically rather than from scratch, especially if inputs such as link weights do not change significantly. This paper explores to what extent dynamic algorithms can be used to speed up fundamental tasks in network operations. We specifically investigate optimizations related to traffic engineering (namely shortest paths and maximum flow computations), but also consider spanning tree and matching applications.

In particular, we present LightPIR, an approach which allows a source to efficiently discover a shortest path to its destination without revealing any information about the endpoints of the transaction. The two main observations which allow for an efficient solution in LightPIR are that: (1) surprisingly, hub labelling algorithms - which were developed to preprocess \"street network like\" graphs so one can later efficiently compute shortest paths - also work well for the graphs underlying payment channel networks, and that (2) hub labelling algorithms can be directly combined with private information retrieval. LightPIR relies on a simple hub labeling heuristic on top of existing hub labeling algorithms which leverages the specific topological features of cryptocurrency networks to further minimize storage and bandwidth overheads.

The use of (deterministic) time-local algorithms in a distributed setting automatically leads to globally consistent decisions. Our key observation is that time-local online algorithms (in which the output at a given time only depends on local inputs in the temporal dimension) are closely connected to local distributed graph algorithms (in which the output of a given node only depends on local inputs in the spatial dimension). This makes it possible to interpret prior work on distributed graph algorithms from the perspective of online algorithms.

Furthermore, the resulting failover paths often have to fulfill additional requirements related to the policy and function implemented by the network, such as the traversal of certain waypoints (eg, a firewall). This paper presents local algorithms which ensure a maximally resilient path restoration for a large family of product graphs, including the widely used tori and generalized hypercube topologies. Our algorithms provably ensure that even under multiple link failures, traffic is rerouted to the other endpoint of every failed link whenever possible (ie detouring failed links), enforcing waypoints and hence accounting for the network policy. The algorithms are particularly well-suited for emerging segment routing networks based on label stacks.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["509"]}
{"title": "Brief Announcement: What can (not) be perfectly rerouted locally\n", "abstract": " In order to provide a high resilience and to react quickly to link failures, modern computer networks support fully decentralized flow rerouting, also known as local fast failover. In a nutshell, the task of a local fast failover algorithm is to pre-define fast failover rules for each node using locally available information only. Ideally, such a local fast failover algorithm provides a perfect resilience deterministically: a packet emitted from any source can reach any target, as long as the underlying network remains connected. Feigenbaum et al. showed [Feigenbaum and others, 2012] that it is not always possible to provide perfect resilience; on the positive side, the authors also presented an efficient algorithm which achieves at least 1-resilience, tolerating a single failure in any network. Interestingly, not much more is known currently about the feasibility of perfect resilience. This brief announcement revisits perfect resilience with local fast failover, both in a model where the source can and cannot be used for forwarding decisions. By establishing a connection between graph minors and resilience, we prove that it is impossible to achieve perfect resilience on any non-planar graph; On the positive side, we can derive perfect resilience for outerplanar and some planar graphs.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["509"]}
{"title": "Nap: Network-Aware Data Partitions for Efficient Distributed Processing\n", "abstract": " In order to support emerging data-intensive applications, many clever frameworks have been developed over the last years to efficiently and distributedly process big data sets, such as MapReduce. However, these frameworks are often optimized for relatively homogeneous environments, and accounting, e.g., for the varying connectivity of wide-area network infrastructure, may require complex placement algorithms. In this paper, we present Nap, which allows optimizing distributed data processing frameworks such as MapReduce for heterogeneous environments. Nap allows adapting resources dynamically, without requiring complex placement or migration algorithms, or modifications to the logic of the mappers and reducers. Rather, Nap simply changes the data partition, by spawning virtual nodes (e.g., reducers) depending on the demand. To this end, Nap leverages a connection to integer partition problems\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["509"]}
{"title": "Measuring the Complexity of Packet Traces\n", "abstract": " This paper studies the structure of several real-world traces (including Facebook, High-Performance Computing, Machine Learning, and simulation generated traces) and presents a systematic approach to quantify and compare the structure of packet traces based on the entropy contained in the trace file. Insights into the structure of packet traces can lead to improved network algorithms that are optimized toward specific traffic patterns. We then present a methodology to quantify the temporal and non-temporal components of entropy contained in a packet trace, called the trace complexity, using randomization and compression. We show that trace complexity provides unique insights into the characteristics of various applications and argue that there is a need for traffic generation models that preserve the intrinsic structure of empirically measured application traces. We then propose a traffic generator model that is able to produce a synthetic trace that matches the complexity level of its corresponding real-world trace.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["509"]}
{"title": "Overlay networks for peer-to-peer networks\n", "abstract": " At the heart of any distributed system lies some kind of logical interconnecting structure, also called overlay network, which supports the exchange of information between the different sites. With an increasing scale, distributed systems are likely to become more dynamic and have to deal with sites continuously entering and leaving the system. Reasons for a dynamic membership include, for example, site failures, sites which have to be updated and replaced by new sites, or the addition of new sites or resources which are required to preserve the functionality of the system. Hence, any large-scale distributed system needs an overlay network that supports joining, leaving, and routing between the sites. Without a scalable implementation of such a network, it is impossible to build large high-performance distributed systems.ABSTRACT", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["509"]}
{"title": "Congestion-free rerouting of flows on dags\n", "abstract": " Changing a given configuration in a graph into another one is known as a reconfiguration problem. Such problems have recently received much interest in the context of algorithmic graph theory. We initiate the theoretical study of the following reconfiguration problem: How to reroute k unsplittable flows of a certain demand in a capacitated network from their current paths to their respective new paths, in a congestion-free manner? This problem finds immediate applications, eg, in traffic engineering in computer networks. We show that the problem is generally NP-hard already for k= 2 flows, which motivates us to study rerouting on a most basic class of flow graphs, namely DAGs. Interestingly, we find that for general k, deciding whether an unsplittable multi-commodity flow rerouting schedule exists, is NP-hard even on DAGs. Our main contribution is a polynomial-time (fixed parameter tractable) algorithm to solve the route update problem for a bounded number of flows on DAGs. At the heart of our algorithm lies a novel decomposition of the flow network that allows us to express and resolve reconfiguration dependencies among flows.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["509"]}
{"title": "Loop-Free Route Updates for Software-Defined Networks\n", "abstract": " We consider the fundamental problem of updating arbitrary routes in a software-defined network in a (transiently) loop-free manner. Our objective is to compute fast network update schedules which minimize the number of interactions (ie, rounds) between the controller and the network nodes. We first prove that this problem is difficult in general: The problem of deciding whether a k-round update schedule exists is NP-complete already for k= 3, and there are problem instances requiring \u2126 (n) rounds, where n is the network size. Given these negative results, we introduce an attractive, relaxed notion of loop-freedom. We show that relaxed loop-freedom admits for much shorter update schedules (up to a factor \u2126 (n) in the best case), and present a scheduling algorithm which requires at most \u0398 (log n) rounds.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["509"]}
{"title": "Waypoint routing in special networks\n", "abstract": " Waypoint routing is a novel communication model in which traffic is steered through one or multiple so-called waypoints along the route from source to destination. Waypoint routing is used to implement more complex policies or to compose novel network services such as service chains, and also finds applications in emerging segment routing networks. This paper initiates the study of algorithms and complexity of waypoint routing on special networks. Our main contribution is an encompassing characterization of networks on which routes through an arbitrary number of waypoints can be computed efficiently: We present an algorithm to compute waypoint routes for the important family of outerplanar networks, which have a treewidth of at most two. We show that it is difficult to go significantly beyond the graph families studied above, by deriving NP-hardness results on slightly more general graph families (namely graphs of treewidth three). For the case that the number of waypoints is constant, we also provide a polynomial-time algorithm for any constant treewidth network, even if waypoints change the flow sizes. For arbitrary numbers of waypoints however, the constraint of different flow-sizes between waypoints turns the problem hard, already if the network contains just a single cycle. Finally, we extend the study of waypoint routing to special directed graph classes, in particular bidirected graphs.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["509"]}
{"title": "The Grand CRU Challenge\n", "abstract": " One of the main objectives of any cluster management system is the maximization of cluster resource utilization (CRU). In this paper, we argue that there is a dilemma underlying the challenge of maximizing CRU, as soon as network resources enter the picture. In contrast to local resources which can be handled in a more isolated fashion, global network resources are namely shared, and their allocation is intertwined with that of local resources. For effective resource management, either applications thus have to learn more about the infrastructure, or the resource manager has to understand application semantics--both options violate the separation of applications from the underlying infrastructure strived for by resource managers. This paper makes the case for a resource management system that addresses the dilemma, and presents first ideas.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["509"]}
{"title": "Convergence of even simpler robots without position information\n", "abstract": " The design of distributed gathering and convergence algorithms for tiny robots has recently received much attention. In particular, it has been shown that the convergence problem, that is, the problem of moving robots close to each other (i.e., inside an area of some maximum size, where the position of the area is not fixed beforehand), can even be solved for very weak, oblivious robots: robots which cannot maintain state from one round to the next. The oblivious robot model is hence attractive from a self-stabilization perspective, where the state is subject to adversarial manipulation. However, to the best of our knowledge, all existing robot convergence protocols rely on the assumption that robots, despite being \u201cweak\u201d, can measure distances.

{"title": "Opposites Attract: Virtual Cluster Embedding for Profit\n", "abstract": " It is well-known that cloud application performance critically depends on the network. Accordingly, new abstractions for cloud applications are proposed which extend the performance isolation guarantees to the network. The most common abstraction is the Virtual Cluster V C(n, b): the n virtual machines of a customer are connected to a virtual switch at bandwidth b. However, today, not much is known about how to efficiently embed and price virtual clusters. This paper makes two contributions. (1) We present an algorithm called Tetris that efficiently embeds virtual clusters arriving in an online fashion, by jointly optimizing the node and link resources. We show that this algorithm allows to multiplex more virtual clusters over the same physical infrastructure compared to existing algorithms, hence improving the provider profit. (2) We present the first demand-specific pricing model called DSP for virtual clusters. Our pricing model is fair in the sense that a customer only needs to pay for what he or she asked. Moreover, it features other desirable properties, such as price independence from mapping locations.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["509"]}

{"title": "A Distributed SDN Control Plane for Consistent Policy Updates\n", "abstract": " Software-defined networking (SDN) is a novel paradigm that out-sources the control of packet-forwarding switches to a set of software controllers. The most fundamental task of these controllers is the correct implementation of the \\emph{network policy}, i.e., the intended network behavior. In essence, such a policy specifies the rules by which packets must be forwarded across the network. This paper studies a distributed SDN control plane that enables \\emph{concurrent} and \\emph{robust} policy implementation. We introduce a formal model describing the interaction between the data plane and a distributed control plane (consisting of a collection of fault-prone controllers). Then we formulate the problem of \\emph{consistent} composition of concurrent network policy updates (short: the \\emph{CPC Problem}). To anticipate scenarios in which some conflicting policy updates must be rejected, we enable the composition via a natural \\emph{transactional} interface with all-or-nothing semantics. We show that the ability of an -resilient distributed control plane to process concurrent policy updates depends on the tag complexity, i. e., the number of policy labels (a.k.a. \\emph{tags}) available to the controllers, and describe a CPC protocol with optimal tag complexity .", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["509"]}

We consider a simple model where an attacker seeks to extract secret information about the substrate topology, by issuing repeated VNet embedding requests. We present a general framework that exploits basic properties of the VNet embedding relation to infer the entire topology.

{"title": "Dynamics and Cooperation Algorithmic Challenges in Peer-to-Peer Computing\n", "abstract": " Peer-to-peer (p2p) computing is one of the most intriguing new networking paradigms of the last ten years, and many applications today use peer-topeer technology, eg for large distributed computations, for file sharing, or for live media streaming. At the heart of the paradigm lies the idea of leveraging the resources of the system\u2019s participants. Thus, potentially scalable and robust architectures can be built.However, making use of the decentralized resources is challenging. The peers are under the control of the individual users who may only connect to the network for a short period of time. Consequently, there are frequent membership changes and p2p systems are highly dynamic. In addition to regular joins and leaves, the participating machines (often unreliable desktops) may crash. Peer-to-peer solutions are also faced with the fact that it is not always in the (anonymous) users\u2019 interest to contribute their resources. Rather, a user may be selfish and seek to exploit the system without reciprocating. This dissertation studies the challenges of the dynamics in p2p computing and of cooperation. We describe a system which is based on a hypercubic topology and which applies algorithms that maintain desirable network properties despite worst-case joins and leaves; these algorithms can also be used for pancake graphs. Besides membership dynamics, we investigate dynamic changes of the available bandwidth between two peers, and we analyze the throughput of different transfer protocols.
