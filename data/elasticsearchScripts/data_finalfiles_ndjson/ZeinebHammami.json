{"title": "On-line self-adaptive framework for tailoring a neural-agent learning model addressing dynamic real-time scheduling problems\n", "abstract": " The dynamic nature and time-varying behavior of actual environments provide serious challenges for learning models. Thus, changes may deteriorate the constructed control policy over time, which requires permanent adaptation strategies. Changes usually appear as an evolution in the relationship between instance variables composing stream data, known in machine learning under the term concept drift. Several adaptation strategies have been performed to tackle concept drifting data streams, always assuming that arrived instances are labeled, either completely or partially. However, this assumption is violated in many application areas, especially in the manufacturing field. We propose, in this paper, a new framework called Labeling Extraction from the current Model (LEM). LEM is adapted to retrieve learning labels, relying uniquely on unlabeled received instances and without any external supervision, which\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["1107"]}
{"title": "A self adaptive neural agent based decision support system for solving dynamic real time scheduling problems\n", "abstract": " Manufacturing production systems are facing growing challenges to ensure competitive advantages and survive world-class under a growing competition and increased customers' requirements. Production scheduling lies at the heart of the manufacturing systems performance, therefore, a better resolution of scheduling problems will ensure the above objectives. Agent based systems were widely adopted in the literature as dynamic and adaptive approaches capable of enhancing scheduling decisions, relying on their distributed nature as well as the adaptive and intelligent behavior of agents. In this study we present a self-adaptive neural-agent-based decision support system where we integrate a set of neural network (NN) candidates at each control system agent. This integration gave rise to simultaneously exploited agents' communication and NNs' learning capabilities. It builds an innovative agent-based\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["1107"]}
{"title": "Neural networks for online learning of non-stationary data streams: a review and application for smart grids flexibility improvement\n", "abstract": " Learning efficient predictive models in dynamic environments requires taking into account the continuous changing nature of phenomena generating the data streams, known in machine learning as \u201cconcept drift\u201d. Such changes may affect models\u2019 effectiveness over time, requiring permanent updates of parameters and structure to maintain performance. Several supervised machine learning methods have been developed to be adapted to learn in dynamic and non-stationary environments. One of the most well-known and efficient learning methods is neural networks. This paper focuses on the different neural networks developed to build learning models able to adapt to concept drifts on streaming data. Their performance will be studied and compared using meaningful criteria.

{"title": "Discussion and Review of the Use of Neural Networks to Improve the Flexibility of Smart Grids in Presence of Distributed Renewable Ressources\n", "abstract": " The evolving and nonstationary behavior of realworld data generally generated in streaming way creates serious challenges for learning models. Thus, changes may deteriorate previous decision models accuracy, which requires permanent adaptation strategies. Artificial neural networks have been among the popular choice of adaptation strategies to tackle concept drifting data streams, relying on their online learning capabilities. In this paper, the ability of most known neural networks of the literature to learn from data streams in presence of concept drift will be studied and compared using some meaningful criteria. Their limits will be highlighted using a case-study about the design of decision making aid model to improve the flexibility of electrical grids in presence of distributed Wind-PV renewable energy ressources.
