{"title": "Cross Project Software Defect Prediction using Extreme Learning Machine: An Ensemble based Study.\n", "abstract": " Cross project defect prediction, involves predicting software defects in the new software project based on the historical data of another project. Many researchers have successfully developed defect prediction models using conventional machine learning techniques and statistical techniques for within project defect prediction. Furthermore, some researchers also proposed defect prediction models for cross project defect prediction. However, it is observed that the performance of these defect prediction models degrade on different datasets. The completeness of these models are very poor. We have investigated the use of extreme learning machine (ELM) for cross project defect prediction. Further, this paper investigates the use of ELM in non linear heterogeneous ensemble for defect prediction. So, we have presented an efficient nonlinear heterogeneous extreme learning machine ensemble (NH ELM) model for cross project defect prediction to alleviate these mentioned issues. To validate this ensemble model, we have leveraged twelve PROMISE and five eclipse datasets for experimentation. From experimental results and analysis, it is observed that the presented nonlinear heterogeneous ensemble model provides better prediction accuracy as compared to other single defect prediction models. The evidences from completeness analysis also proved that the ensemble model shows improved completeness as compared to other single prediction models for both PROMISE and eclipse datasets.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1973"]}
{"title": "WR-ELM: weighted regularization extreme learning machine for imbalance learning in software fault prediction\n", "abstract": " Imbalanced data is a significant issue in software fault prediction. It is very challenging for software engineers to handle imbalanced software fault data for the early prediction of software faults. In the last two decades, many researchers have used synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), SMOTE for regression and other such techniques to preprocess the imbalanced software fault data. However, these preprocessing techniques do not produce consistently good accuracy, especially in inter release, and cross project fault prediction. The learning of imbalanced fault data for prediction of the number of software faults has not been explored in depth so far. To deal with this scenario, we have explored an efficient machine learning technique, namely extreme learning machine (ELM) for prediction of the number of software faults. Furthermore, a new variant of ELM, namely weighted regularization ELM, is\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1973"]}
{"title": "Analyzing effect of ensemble models on multi-layer perceptron network for software effort estimation\n", "abstract": " Effort Estimation is a very challenging task in the software development life cycle. Inaccurate estimations may cause client dissatisfaction and thereby, decrease the quality of the product. Considering the problem of software cost and effort estimation, it is conceivable to call attention to that the estimation procedure considers the qualities present in the data set, as well as the aspects of the environment in which the model is embedded. Existing literature have the instances where machine learning techniques have been used to estimate the effort required to develop any software. Yet it is quite uncertain for any particular model to perform well with all the data sets. In this paper, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLPNN) and its ensembles are explored in order to improve the performance of software effort estimation process. Firstly, MLPNN, Ridge-MLPNN, Lasso-MLPNN, Bagging-MLPNN, and AdaBoost-MLPNN models are\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1973"]}
{"title": "Extreme Learning Machine based Linear Homogeneous Ensemble for Software Fault Prediction\n", "abstract": " Many recent studies have experimented the software fault prediction models to predict the number of software faults using statistical and traditional machine learning techniques. However, it is observed that the performance of traditional software fault prediction models vary from dataset to dataset. In addition, the performance of the traditional models degrade for inter release prediction. To address these issues, we have proposed linear homogeneous ensemble methods based on two variations of extreme learning machine, Differentiable Extreme Learning Machine Ensemble (DELME) and Non-differentiable Extreme Learning Machine Ensemble (NELME), to predict the number of software faults. We have used seventeen PROMISE datasets and five eclipse datasets to validate these software fault prediction models. We have performed two types of predictions, within project defect prediction and inter release prediction, to validate our proposed fault prediction model. The experimental result shows consistently better performance across all datasets.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1973"]}
