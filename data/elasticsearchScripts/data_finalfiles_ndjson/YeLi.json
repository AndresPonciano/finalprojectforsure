{"title": "A cross-cultural study: Effect of robot appearance and task\n", "abstract": " This study investigates the effects of culture, robot appearance and task on human-robot interaction. We propose a model with culture (Chinese, Korean and German), robot appearance (anthropomorphic, zoomorphic and machinelike) and task (teaching, guide, entertainment and security guard) as factors, and analyze these factors\u2019 effects on the robot\u2019s likeability, and people\u2019s active response to, engagement with, trust in and satisfaction with the robot. We conducted a laboratory experiment with 108 participants to test the model and performed Repeated ANOVA and Kruskal Wallis Test on the data. The results show that cultural differences exist in participants\u2019 perception of likeability, engagement, trust and satisfaction; a robot\u2019s appearance affects its likeability, while the task affects participants\u2019 active response and engagement. We found the participants expected the robot appearance to match its task\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "334\n", "authors": ["2244"]}
{"title": "Effects of communication style and culture on ability to accept recommendations from robots\n", "abstract": " The objective of this paper is to investigate the effects of communication styles and culture on people\u2019s accepting recommendations from robots. The goal was to provide insight for culturally adaptive robot design. The independent variables were communication style (i.e. implicit or explicit), the participants\u2019 cultural background (i.e. Chinese or German), and the robot\u2019s language (i.e. native language and English for Chinese and German subjects). A laboratory experiment was conducted with 16 Chinese and 16 German college students. Basic descriptive statistics and t-test are used for biographical information analysis; reliability test is used for questionnaire; MANOVA and non-parametric test are used for testing the hypotheses. The results showed that the Chinese participants preferred an implicit communication style than German participants. Chinese participants evaluated the robots as being more likable\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "147\n", "authors": ["2244"]}
{"title": "Effects of a Social Robot's Autonomy and Group Orientation on Human Decision-Making\n", "abstract": " Social attributes of intelligent robots are important for human-robot systems. This paper investigates influences of robot autonomy (i.e., high versus low) and group orientation (i.e., ingroup versus outgroup) on a human decision-making process. We conducted a laboratory experiment with 48 college students and tested the hypotheses with MANCOVA. We find that a robot with high autonomy has greater influence on human decisions than a robot with low autonomy. No significant effect is found on group orientation or on the interaction between group orientation and autonomy level. The results provide implications for social robot design.", "num_citations": "33\n", "authors": ["2244"]}
{"title": "Effects of a dyad's cultural intelligence on global virtual collaboration\n", "abstract": " Research problem: The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of the cultural intelligence of a dyad (a team of two persons) on its global virtual collaboration processes and outcomes. Research question: Does a dyad's cultural intelligence have an effect on global virtual collaboration processes and outcomes? If yes, which effects does that cultural intelligence have? Literature review: We review literature on the management of cultural diversity in global virtual collaboration and cultural intelligence. The literature suggests that cultural diversity in global virtual teams is mainly managed with rigid approaches, which are ineffective in many situations. Leveraging cultural intelligence has the potential to improve global virtual collaboration. However, its effects at the team level or in a virtual setting are not yet clear. Methodology: We used a collaboration simulation with 70 participants recruited from two public\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["2244"]}
{"title": "\"Are you a trustworthy partner in a cross-cultural virtual environment?\" Behavioral cultural intelligence and receptivity-based trust in virtual collaboration\n", "abstract": " Globally distributed work has been prevalent in organizations. However, cultural issues in distributed work are still challenging team performance. Cultural intelligence, defined as individuals' capability to perform in cross-cultural settings, has great potential in untangling these issues. The present study examines three individual capabilities (behavioral cultural intelligence, language proficiency and technical skills) and their effects on partners' receptivity-based trust and satisfaction in a cross-cultural virtual environment. We develop a theoretical model based on the extended adaptive structuration theory (EAST) and verify the model in a cross-border experiment. The result suggests that focal members' behavioral cultural intelligence strongly influences their remote partners' receptivity/trust. This effect is moderated by language proficiency; 57% of the variance of partners' satisfaction is predicted by receptivity/trust and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["2244"]}
{"title": "Formulating Effective Coordination Strategies in Agile Global Software Development Teams\n", "abstract": " Coordination of interdependent tasks across geographical, temporal and socio-cultural boundaries has been identified as a critical antecedent to global software development (GSD) team performance. Since GSD teams are increasingly required to achieve software development agility and respond to changing business requirements, conventional plan-driven software development methods become inadequate to manage the cross-boundary dependencies. To cope with this issue, there is an emerging trend of implementing change-driven agile methods in GSD; we call this practice agile GSD. This paper focuses on the formulation of coordination strategies in agile GSD. We argue that Coordination Theory (CT) can serve as a useful lens to develop a deeper understanding of the formulation process. We present a case study in a leading software development company using agile GSD and present preliminary results by applying the lens of CT.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["2244"]}
{"title": "The roles of form and function in utilitarian mobile data service design\n", "abstract": " Mobile devices, as well as mobile data services (MDS), have become powerful aids in our daily life. Starting with simple communication services, MDS now offer a solution for almost every private and business life demand. The market for MDS has become very competitive, and continuously increasing consumer demands are putting pressure on MDS providers. Recently, the design of mobile devices and services has received much attention, since it provides vast opportunities for differentiating offerings and for gaining a competitive advantage. However, the concrete application of design often leads to semantic confusion. Based on Wixom and Todd\u2019s [2005] theoretical integration of user satisfaction and technology acceptance, and by conceptualizing form and function as the two major components of design, we propose a theoretical model that specifically investigates which MDS design characteristics influence users\u2019 satisfaction and, subsequently, their behavioral intention. We tested our model empirically by means of partial least square (PLS) analysis, using a sample of 2,295 responses from utilitarian MDS users in the mobile banking context. The findings reveal that both components of design\u2013form and function\u2013were positively associated with satisfaction. MDS consumer age and the MDS usage frequency moderated the relationship between form and satisfaction.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["2244"]}
{"title": "Designing a supply network artifact for data, process, and people integration\n", "abstract": " E-procurement and supplier-relationship management systems have helped to substantially advance process execution in supply management. However, current supply network systems still face challenges of high data integration efforts, as well as the decoupling of structured data and processes from the growing amount of digitalized unstructured interactions of supply management professionals. Inspired by the room for improvement posed by this challenges, our research proposes a design for a supply network artifact in supplier qualification that addresses these problems by enabling holistic integration of data, processes, and people. The artifact is developed following an action design research approach. Building on a set of meta-requirements derived from literature and practice explorations, we conceptualize two design principles and derive corresponding design decisions that have been\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["2244"]}
{"title": "Uncovering the effects of cultural intelligence on cross-cultural virtual collaboration processes\n", "abstract": " People from different countries are increasingly working together with the support of information and communication technologies. Such cross-cultural virtual collaboration is highly challenging due to the geographical separation and cultural diversity among collaborators. This study investigates the effects of an individual capability, cultural intelligence, on cross-cultural virtual collaboration processes in a controlled experiment. Thirty-five cross-cultural virtual dyads were formed and instructed to collaborate in a proposal writing task. Their interaction processes were analyzed with Bales\u2019 Interaction Process Analysis. The results suggest that individuals with higher CQ demonstrated more positive reactions and attempted answers in the cross-cultural virtual collaboration after controlling for foreign language proficiency. The increased amounts of the two categories of interaction acts led to improved peer\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["2244"]}
{"title": "Advancing task elicitation systems\u2013an experimental evaluation of design principles\n", "abstract": " In large IS development projects a huge number of natural language documents becomes available and needs to be analyzed and transformed into structured requirements. This elicitation process is known to be time-consuming and error-prone when performed manually by a requirements engineer. Thus, there is a clear demand for advanced support of the entire elicitation process. Our work focuses on providing automated and knowledge-based support of the task elicitation sub-process. Following a design science approach, design principles for task elicitation systems are conceptualized and instantiated in an artifact. We evaluate our design principles in a laboratory experiment and examine its external validity in a field setting. We contribute to the body of knowledge by explaining effects of the conceptualized and instantiated design principles. Specifically, our results show that the level of automation as well as the extent and origin of the knowledge used for the automation process affect task elicitation productivity.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["2244"]}
{"title": "Software Development Process Ambidexterity and Project Performance: A Coordination Cost-Effectiveness View\n", "abstract": " Software development process ambidexterity (SDPA) is the ability to demonstrate both process alignment and process adaptability simultaneously. Realizing process ambidexterity has recently been suggested as an effective approach to improving the performance of software development (SD) projects. To understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of ambidexterity, we focus in this study on the mediating effects of coordination, one of the most important activity in SD projects. Specifically, we hypothesize a mediating effect of coordination costs and coordination effectiveness on the relationship between SDPA and project performance. We conducted a quantitative study involving 104 SD projects across 10 firms to test the model. The results strongly suggest that the positive relationship between SDPA and project performance is negatively mediated by coordination costs and positively mediated by\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["2244"]}
