{"title": "A Malicious Attack and Defense Techniques on Android-Based Smartphone Platform\n", "abstract": " In this digital era after computer and internet smartphone is the third revolution and making ubiquitous computing possible. Android lead the smartphone market as most used operating system. This popularity of Android also makes it primary targets of cyber attackers and hackers. There are many different types of cyberattacks targeted towards Andorid environment. In this review paper, we have investigated various attacks reported with respect to Android and have also gathered different type of defenses available to protect users from these attacks. This work is focus on accumulating various literature works available in this domain and provide a comprehensive representation of these works. The various works are grouped into two broad categories ie signature and non-signature based, and techniques mentioned in each work is studied and technical observations are made against them which help to understand the usability of these techniques. Such organized and details review work is required to study the problem in depth and works towards solution. The literature works are summarized and organized in proper table which help to visualized and easy comparison the information.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["452"]}
{"title": "Cloud Computing: Analysis of Top 5 CSPs in SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Platforms\n", "abstract": " The Cloud computing refers to manipulating, configuring and accessing the applications as utilities over the internet. It involves online data computation, storation, infrastructure and application, and hence it is highly essential to make a smart decision, when and how computing, storage and network resources be distributed and allocated to users to utilize, manage and consume them. In this paper first architecture of cloud computing, characteristics of service models and services provided by CSPs are discussed, than after analyzed growth rate and market share of top five CSPs in cloud service models, i.e Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS)", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["452"]}
{"title": "Performance of Internet of Things (IOT) Based Healthcare Secure Services and Its Importance: Issue and Challenges\n", "abstract": " The IoT has a variety of application domains, including medical assistance. The IoT revolution is redesigning modern medical care with promising technological, economic and social prospects. This article shared short advances in IoT-based healthcare technologies and reviewed cutting-edge networking architectures/platforms, industrial applications and trends in IoT-based healthcare solutions. In addition, this article has analyzed other features in addition to the security and privacy of the IoT, including security requirements, threat models and attack taxonomies from the point of view of medical care. Furthermore, this article also proposed a smart collaborative security model to minimize security risk; will di scuss different innovations, such as the widespread use of big data, artificial intelligence in the context of medical care, various IoT and e-Health policies and regulations have been addressed worldwide to determine how economies and societies can facilitate sustainable development terms and provides some avenues for future research on health care based on the IoT based on a series of open problems and challenges.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["452"]}

{"title": "Cloud Computing: Comparison and Analysis of Cloud Service Providers-AWs, Microsoft and Google\n", "abstract": " The cloud computing refers to network that enables to distribute processing, application, storage capabilities among many remote located computer systems. In cloud computing platform the IT resources are utilized and released as per the requirement by using internet. It is a better option to organizations and ordinary users to utilize services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, DaaS etc) as provided by cloud service providers and need pay as use. Currently a large number of service providers in market and due to diversity of features and services, it very difficult to find suitable provider for s for long term needs. As per market share top three providers are Amazon, Microsoft and Google. In this paper we will analysis some of the tools such as compute, storage space management and performance offered by AWS, Azure and GCP which are the top three market leaders in cloud computing technology.

{"title": "A study of object oriented software reliability models\n", "abstract": " Object-oriented approach is becoming very popular in software development community as an alternative to traditional approach ie structured analysis & design methodologies due to obvious reasons. Consequence, this approach has become de facto standard of software development organization. As we know, software reliability is one of the important dynamic quality factors in overall quality models proposed in the literature. Several guidelines are available in literature that suggest various\" do's\" and\" don'ts\" to produce an\" easy to maintain\" and\" reliable\" system. Metrics to measure software reliability do exist and can be used starting in requirements phase to software design phase. In this paper we propose models that capture such ideas and prepare background for development of metrics for assessment of early reliability of software.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["452"]}
