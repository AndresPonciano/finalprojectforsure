{"title": "Refining the closed loop in the data age: research-to-practice transitions in diabetes technology\n", "abstract": " Since the publication of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial in 1993, 1 the primary challenge of diabetes care has been to achieve near-normal blood glucose (BG) levels while minimizing hypoglycemia. The past 5 years have shown advancement on the diabetes technology pathway as we have moved from commercially available sensor-augmented pump therapy to threshold suspend (TS) systems, which automatically suspend insulin delivery when the BG level reaches a certain threshold. In this issue of Diabetes Technology & Therapeutics, Agrawal et al. 2 present a retrospective analysis of real-world use of the TS feature based on CareLink\u00ae(Medtronic MiniMed, Inc., Northridge, CA) data. Their analysis shows that TS use was associated with a 69% relative reduction in BG values\u2264 50 mg/dL.

{"title": "Verifying conformance of neural network models\n", "abstract": " Neural networks are increasingly used as data-driven models for a wide variety of physical systems such as ground vehicles, airplanes, human physiology and automobile engines. These models are in-turn used for designing and verifying autonomous systems. The advantages of using neural networks include the ability to capture characteristics of particular systems using the available data. This is particularly advantageous for medical systems, wherein the data collected from individuals can be used to design devices that are well-adapted to a particular individual's unique physiological characteristics. At the same time, neural network models remain opaque: their structure makes them hard to understand and interpret by human developers. One key challenge lies in checking that neural network models of processes are \u201cconformant\u201d to the well established scientific (physical, chemical and biological) laws that\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1794"]}
{"title": "Bayesian parameter estimation for nonlinear dynamics using sensitivity analysis\n", "abstract": " We investigate approximate Bayesian inference techniques for nonlinear systems described by ordinary differential equation (ODE) models. In particular, the approximations will be based on set-valued reachability analysis approaches, yielding approximate models for the posterior distribution. Nonlinear ODEs are widely used to mathematically describe physical and biological models. However, these models are often described by parameters that are not directly measurable and have an impact on the system behaviors. Often, noisy measurement data combined with physical/biological intuition serve as the means for finding appropriate values of these parameters. Our approach operates under a Bayesian framework, given prior distribution over the parameter space and noisy observations under a known sampling distribution. We explore subsets of the space of model parameters, computing bounds on the likelihood for each subset. This is performed using nonlinear set-valued reachability analysis that is made faster by means of linearization around a reference trajectory. The tiling of the parameter space can be adaptively refined to make bounds on the likelihood tighter. We evaluate our approach on a variety of nonlinear benchmarks and compare our results with Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Sequential Monte Carlo approaches.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1794"]}

Our plants are modeled in terms of discrete linear systems whose variables are partitioned into system, control, and disturbance variables. We synthesize nonblocking controllers that satisfy a user-provided safety specification by means of a fixed point iteration over the control precondition state transformer.

{"title": "A Counter-Example Guided Framework for Robust Synthesis of Switched Systems Using Control Certificates\n", "abstract": " In this article, the problem of synthesizing switching controllers is considered through the synthesis of a \"control certificate\". Control certificates include control barrier and Lyapunov functions, which represent control strategies, and allow for automatic controller synthesis. Our approach encodes the controller synthesis problem as quantified nonlinear constraints. We extend an approach called Counterexample Guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS), originally proposed for program synthesis problems, to solve the resulting constraints. The CEGIS procedure involves the use of satisfiability-modulo theory (SMT) solvers to automate the problem of synthesizing control certificates. In this paper, we examine generalizations of CEGIS to attempt a richer class of specifications, including reach-while-stay with obstacles and control under disturbances. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to handle systems with nonpolynomial dynamics as well. The abilities of our general framework are demonstrated through a set of interesting examples. Our evaluation suggests that our approach is computationally feasible, and adds to the growing body of formal approaches to controller synthesis.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1794"]}

Our approach uses a restricted class of temporal logic formulas to represent the likely intentions of the agents along with a combination of temporal logic-based optimal cost path planning and Bayesian inference to compute the probability of these intents given the current trajectory of the robot. First, we construct a large but finite hypothesis space of possible intents represented as temporal logic formulas whose atomic propositions are derived from a detailed map of the robot\u2019s workspace. Next, our approach uses real-time observations of the robot\u2019s position to update a distribution over temporal logic formulae that represent its likely intent.

{"title": "Reachability Analysis Using Message Passing over Tree Decompositions\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we study efficient approaches to reachability analysis for discrete-time nonlinear dynamical systems when the dependencies among the variables of the system have low treewidth. Reachability analysis over nonlinear dynamical systems asks if a given set of target states can be reached, starting from an initial set of states. This is solved by computing conservative over approximations of the reachable set using abstract domains to represent these approximations. However, most approaches must tradeoff the level of conservatism against the cost of performing analysis, especially when the number of system variables increases. This makes reachability analysis challenging for nonlinear systems with a large number of state variables. Our approach works by constructing a dependency graph among the variables of the system.

However, if they are to be utilized in such safety-critical advisory settings, they must be provably\" conformant\" to the governing scientific (biological, chemical, physical) laws which underlie the modeled process.

Our approach uses a \u201ccounterexample-guided\u201d iterative loop that involves the interaction between a policy learner, a demonstrator and a verifier. The learner is responsible for querying the demonstrator in order to obtain the training data to guide the construction of a policy candidate. This candidate is analyzed by the verifier and either accepted as correct, or rejected with a counterexample. In the latter case, the counterexample is used to update the training data and further refine the policy.The approach is instantiated using receding horizon model-predictive controllers (MPCs) as demonstrators.
