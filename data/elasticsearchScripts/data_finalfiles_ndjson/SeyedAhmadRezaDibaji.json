{"title": "Three-dimensional numerical simulation of the slip flow through triangular microchannels\n", "abstract": " Three-dimensional numerical analysis for fully developed incompressible fluid flow and heat transfer through triangular microchannels over the slip flow regime is simulated in this paper. In order to study the flow through the channel, the Navier\u2013Stokes equations are solved in conjunction with slip/jump boundary conditions. The influences of Knudsen number (0.001\u00a0<\u00a0Kn\u00a0<\u00a00.1), aspect ratio (0.2\u00a0<\u00a0A\u00a0<\u00a04.5), and Reynolds number (1\u00a0<\u00a0Re\u00a0<\u00a015) on the fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics are extensively investigated in the paper. The numerical results reveal that the rarefaction decreases the Poiseuille number, while its effect on the Nusselt number completely depends on the interaction between velocity slip and temperature jump. It is also found that the aspect ratio has an important role in the analysis, but the variation of Reynolds number is less remarkable.", "num_citations": "43\n", "authors": ["1427"]}
{"title": "Numerical simulation of slip flow through rhombus microchannels\n", "abstract": " Microgeometry fluid dynamics has gotten a lot interest due to the arrival of Micro-Electro-Mechanical systems (MEMS). When the mean free path of a gas and characteristic length of the channel are in the same order, continuum assumption is no longer valid. In this situation velocity slip and temperature jump occur in the duct walls. Fully developed numerical analysis for characteristic laminar slip flow and heat transfer in rhombus microchannels are performed with slip velocity, and temperature-jump boundary condition at walls. The impacts of Reynolds number (0.1\u00a0<\u00a0Re\u00a0<\u00a040), velocity slip, and temperature-jump on Poiseuille number, and Nusselt number for different aspect ratio (0.15\u00a0<\u00a0A\u00a0<\u00a01.0), and Knudsen number are studied in detail. The contours of non-dimensional velocity for some cases are examined as well. The results show that aspect ratio and Knudsen number have important impact on Poiseuille\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "39\n", "authors": ["1427"]}
{"title": "Enhanced heat transfer and thermal dose using magnetic nanoparticles during HIFU thermal ablation\u2014an in-vitro study\n", "abstract": " Avoiding collateral damage to healthy tissues during the high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation of malignant tumors is one of the major challenges for effective thermal therapy. Such collateral damage can originate out of the need for using higher acoustic powers to treat deep seated or highly vascularized tumors. The objective of this study is to assess the utility of using magnetic nanoparticles (mNPs) during HIFU procedures to locally enhance heating at low powers, thereby reducing the likelihood of collateral thermal damage and undesired destruction due to cavitation. Tissue phantoms with 0% (control), 1% and 3% mNPs concentrations by volume were fabricated. Each tissue phantom was embedded with four thermocouples (TCs) and sonicated using transducer acoustic powers of 5.15\u2009W, 9.17\u2009W, and 14.26\u2009W.

{"title": "Enhanced thermal effect using magnetic nano-particles during high-intensity focused ultrasound\n", "abstract": " Collateral damage and long sonication times occurring during high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation procedures limit clinical advancement. In this reserarch, we investigated whether the use of magnetic nano-particles (mNPs) can reduce the power required to ablate tissue or, for the same power, reduce the duration of the procedure. Tissue-mimicking phantoms containing embedded thermocouples and physiologically acceptable concentrations (0%, 0.0047%, and 0.047%) of mNPs were sonicated at acoustic powers of 5.2 W, 9.2 W, and 14.5 W, for 30 seconds. Lesion volumes were determined for the phantoms with and without mNPs. It was found that with the 0.047% mNP concentration, the power required to obtain a lesion volume of 13 mm3 can be halved, and the time required to achieve a 21 mm3 lesion decreased by a factor of 5. We conclude that mNPs have the potential to reduce damage to healthy tissue, and reduce the procedure time, during tumor ablation using HIFU.", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["1427"]}
{"title": "Accuracy of commercial electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) temperature control technology\n", "abstract": " Objectives For electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), also commonly called e-cigarettes, coil temperature is a factor in the potential production of toxic chemical constituents. However, data are lacking regarding the temperatures that are achieved in the latest generation of these devices. Fourth-generation ENDS are capable of producing heating coil temperatures well above e-liquid boiling points, and allow the user to monitor and set the heating coil temperature during a puff. In this study, we evaluate the accuracy and consistency of the temperature measurement and control settings for different brands of fourth-generation ENDS.   Methods A study was performed using three commercially available, fourth-generation ENDS. The atomizer coil temperatures were obtained from the device (using the EScribe software) reading and from thermocouples attached to the coils during simulated puffing conditions. In addition, aerosol temperatures were measured inside the atomizer and at the mouthpiece.   Results Measured temperatures varied widely across samples taken from the same brand. For example, thermocouple measurements for one unit were 40 Celsius (\u00b0C) below the 300 \u00b0C set point, while another unit of the same brand exceeded the set point by more than 100 \u00b0C. We observed a significant variation in temperature (approximately 100 \u00b0C) along the length of the coil in some cases.   Conclusions The possibility of wide temperature variation across ENDS samples, as well as variations between maximum coil temperatures and internal temperature readings, may have implications for studies that seek to determine correlations between\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["1427"]}
{"title": "Localization of focused-ultrasound beams in a tissue phantom, using remote thermocouple arrays\n", "abstract": " In focused-ultrasound procedures such as vessel cauterization or clot lysis, targeting accuracy is critical. To investigate the targeting accuracy of the focused-ultrasound systems, tissue phantoms embedded with thermocouples can be employed. This paper describes a method that utilizes an array of thermocouples to localize the focused ultrasound beam. All of the thermocouples are located away from the beam, so that thermocouple artifacts and sensor interference are minimized. Beam propagation and temperature rise in the phantom are simulated numerically, and an optimization routine calculates the beam location that produces the best agreement between the numerical temperature values and those measured with thermocouples. The accuracy of the method was examined as a function of the array characteristics, including the number of thermocouples in the array and their orientation.

{"title": "Nonlinear derating of high-intensity focused ultrasound beams using Gaussian modal sums\n", "abstract": " A method is introduced for using measurements made in water of the nonlinear acoustic pressure field produced by a high-intensity focused ultrasound transducer to compute the acoustic pressure and temperature rise in a tissue medium. The acoustic pressure harmonics generated by nonlinear propagation are represented as a sum of modes having a Gaussian functional dependence in the radial direction. While the method is derived in the context of Gaussian beams, final results are applicable to general transducer profiles. The focal acoustic pressure is obtained by solving an evolution equation in the axial variable. The nonlinear term in the evolution equation for tissue is modeled using modal amplitudes measured in water and suitably reduced using a combination of \u201csource derating\u201d (experiments in water performed at a lower source acoustic pressure than in tissue) and \u201cendpoint derating\u201d (amplitudes\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1427"]}

{"title": "Characterization of Focal Location During High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation in a Tissue Phantom Using Remote Thermocouple Arrays\n", "abstract": " BackgroundHigh-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a medical procedure to locally heat and ablate malignant tumors. Characterization of the HIFU beam location during the ablation procedures is critical for both accurate prediction of induced hyperthermia and development of regulatory standards for clinical devices. An accurate beam location and the orientation of the transducer with respect to the tumors are essential for precise ablation. A small change in the radial location or tilt in the application of the HIFU can lead to ablation of healthy tissue and result in grave injury. In in vitro systems, difficulties arise in perfectly aligning the phantom with the transducer and small tilt angles cannot be completely avoided. Traditional methods of finding the focus location by ablating on the thermocouples (TCs) involve artifacts and can result in positioning errors.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1427"]}

A comprehensive flow characterization study was conducted to identify regulatory knowledge gaps using a generic inertia-based spiral channel model for particle sorting and facilitate standards development in the microfluidics community. Testing was performed using 2\u201320 \u00b5m rigid particles to represent blood elements and flow rates of 200\u20135000 \u00b5L/min to assess the effects of flow-related factors on overall system performance. Two channel designs were studied to determine the variability associated with using the same microchannel multiple times (coefficient of variation (CV) of 27% for Design 1 and 18% for Design 2, respectively). The impact of commonly occurring failure modes on device performance was also investigated by simulating progressive and complete channel outlet blockages. The pressure increased by 10\u2013250% of the normal channel pressure depending on the extent of the blockage. Lastly, two common data analysis approaches were compared\u2014imaging and particle counting. Both approaches were similar in terms of their sensitivity and consistency.

Our hypothesis is that the location of the beam can be affected by the power of the transducer. HIFU procedure with 30s of sonication time was performed at different powers of transducer (5 to 60 W) as well as different initial locations of beam in a tissue mimicking material. Eight thermocouples were embedded at 4 different layers in a phantom to measure the temperature rise during HIFU procedure. An inverse method based on experimental data and optimization algorithm was used to find the actual location of beam based on the experimental data.
