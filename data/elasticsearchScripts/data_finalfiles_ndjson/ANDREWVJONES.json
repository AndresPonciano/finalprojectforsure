In particular, I question the logical adequacy of equating visual surveillance with effective subjectification and self-discipline by drawing upon a range of philosophical and sociological perspectives. Philosophically, it is suggested that the Foucauldian thesis may well \u201cpathologise\u201d the relationship between subjectivity and visibility, and thereby overlook other dimensions of our experience of vision.

Our measurements suggest that the upper surface of these lava flows can be split into a minimum of four thermal components: core (>1050\u00b0C), visco-elastic skin (750\u2013900\u00b0C), rigid solid crust (<750\u00b0C), and flow margins (<175\u00b0C). For the \u2032a\u2032a flows investigated, a cool rigid crust characteristically developed in the central part of channels within 30 m of the source vent and incandescent lava was exposed in the marginal shear zones of channels.

{"title": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in cystic fibrosis: pathophysiological mechanisms and therapeutic approaches\n", "abstract": " Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a remarkably versatile environmental bacterium with an extraordinary capacity to infect the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung. Infection with P. aeruginosa occurs early, and although eradication can be achieved following early detection, chronic infection occurs in over 60% of adults with CF. Chronic infection is associated with accelerated disease progression and increased mortality. Extensive research has revealed complex mechanisms by which P. aeruginosa adapts to and persists within the CF airway. Yet knowledge gaps remain, and prevention and treatment strategies are limited by the lack of sensitive detection methods and by a narrow armoury of antibiotics. Further developments in this field are urgently needed in order to improve morbidity and mortality in people with CF. Here, we summarize current knowledge of pathophysiological mechanisms underlying P. aeruginosa infection in CF\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "86\n", "authors": ["301"]}

State Anxiety (SA), positive affect (PA), negative affect (NA), and self-reported fatigue were assessed immediately prior to, every 6 min during, and every 6 min following a 24 min bout of bicycle exercise performed at an RPE of 13 (+/-1). As expected, no significant group differences occurred for RPE (M= 13.5 for nonactive, 13.2 for active). The active group did, however, exercise at a greater absolute workload than the nonactive group (261.0+/-22.4 W vs 200.0+/-19.98 W, respectively). Analyses indicated similar changes in SA and fatigue for both groups, with significant reductions in SA occurring at 6 min post-exercise and remaining below pre-exercise levels throughout the post-exercise period, while fatigue was reduced at 12, 18, and 24 min post-exercise. A significant Group x Time interaction occurred for affective valence (PA-NA; p<. 01). Post hoc analyses indicated that for the active group, affect increased modestly (ie, more PA, less NA) during exercise; this increase was sustained post-exercise. The nonactive group evidenced a sharp drop in affect (ie, less PA, more NA) during exercise followed by a small post-exercise rise which did not return to pre-exercise levels. The results of the present study partially support the Opponent-Process model as an explanation for exercise-related affect.

This project quantified flavonoids and betaines released from seeds of seven Medicago species and measured their biological activities in R. meliloti. Seed compounds were separated by HPLC, identified by spectroscopic methods, and quantified by comparison with authentic standards. Regulatory activities of seed rinse fractions were measured as NodD1\u2010 or NodD2\u2010dependent transcription of a nodC\u2010lacZ fusion in R. meliloti.

The ensuing dysbiosis is conducive to the emergence of opportunistic pathogens such as Clostridium difficile. A novel approach to protect the microbiome from antibiotic-mediated dysbiosis is the use of beta-lactamase enzymes to degrade residual antibiotics in the gastrointestinal tract before the microflora are harmed. Here we present the preclinical development and early clinical studies of the beta-lactamase enzymes, P3A, currently referred to as SYN-004, and its precursor, P1A. Both P1A and SYN-004 were designed as orally-delivered, non-systemically available therapeutics for use with intravenous beta-lactam antibiotics.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From May 1984 until March 1996, 123 patients with stage 1 disease were treated at our institution. Sixty patients with seminoma and 31 with teratoma were treated with orchidectomy only and surveillance; 32 patients with stage 1 seminoma elected for orchidectomy and adjuvant radiotherapy. The mean ages were 40, 31 and 35 years, and the median follow-up 52, 47 and 49 months, respectively. RESULTS: There were no disease-or treatment-related deaths. However, 18 (30%) patients with seminoma treated by orchidectomy only relapsed (median time 8 months, range 3-19); 14 of these responded to radiotherapy, three to radiotherapy and chemotherapy for second relapses outside the irradiated fields, and one to chemotherapy initially, for large-volume relapse. Fifteen (48%) patients with teratoma relapsed (median time 3 months, range 1-12); all responded to 4-6 courses of bleomycin/etoposide/cisplatin chemotherapy. One patient had a second relapse and is currently disease-free 3 years after surgical excision of a lung metastasis. CONCLUSION: These results show that stage 1 testis tumours can be managed successfully in a district general hospital.

The bisimulation preserves formulas of ATL for both the objective and subjective variants of the state-based semantics with imperfect information, which are commonly used in the modeling and verification of multi-agent systems. Furthermore, we apply the theoretical result to the verification of coercion-resistance in the three-ballot voting system, a voting protocol that does not use cryptography. In particular, we show that natural simplifications of an initial model of the protocol are in fact bisimulations of the original model, and therefore satisfy the same ATL properties, including coercion-resistance. These simplifications allow the model-checking tool MCMAS to terminate on models with a larger number of voters and candidates, compared with the initial model.", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["301"]}

Practical limits to the maximum size of these optics motivates the development of quasi-optically-coupled (lenslet-coupled), multi-chroic detectors. These detectors can be sensitive across a broader bandwidth compared to waveguide-coupled detectors. However, the increase in bandwidth comes at a cost: the lenses (up to ~700 mm diameter) and lenslets (~5 mm diameter, hemispherical lenses on the focal plane) used in these systems are made from high-refractive-index materials (such as silicon or amorphous aluminum oxide) that reflect nearly a third of the incident radiation.

We introduce a modality called rewriting knowledge that operates on local equalities. We discuss the conditions under which its interpretation can be approximated by a second modality that we introduce called empirical knowledge. Empirical knowledge is computationally attractive from a verification perspective. We report on an implementation of a technique to verify this modality with the open source model checker mcmas. We evaluate the approach by verifying multi-agent models of electronic voting protocols automatically extracted from high-level descriptions.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["301"]}
{"title": "Modeling violent reaction following low speed impact on confined explosives\n", "abstract": " To ensure the safe storage and deployment of explosives it is important to understand the mechanisms that give rise to ignition and reaction growth in low speed impacts. The High Explosive Response to Mechanical Stimulus (HERMES) material model, integrated in the Lagrangian code LSDYNA, has been developed to model the progress of the reaction after such an impact. The low speed impact characteristics of an HMX based formulation have been examined using the AWE Steven Test. Axisymmetric simulations of an HMX explosive in the AWE Steven Test have been performed. A sensitivity study included the influence of friction, mesh resolution, and confinement. By comparing the experimental and calculated results, key model parameters which determine the explosive's response in this configuration have been identified. The model qualitatively predicts the point of ignition within the vehicle. Future\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["301"]}
{"title": "Bosiliack and a reconsideration of entrance graves\n", "abstract": " In 1984 the entrance grave at Bosiliack, Cornwall, was excavated by Charles Thomas on behalf of the Institute of Cornish Studies. It was a comparatively small example, approximately 5 m in diameter encircled by a substantial kerb. A deposit of cremated bone was found within the chamber accompanied by sherds of plain pottery from three vessels. Two radiocarbon determinations were obtained on the cremated bone. The dates were almost identical, falling between 1690 and 1500 cal bc.Because Bosiliack is the only entrance grave in Cornwall to have been excavated to modern standards, and to have had any analyses undertaken on the contents of its chamber, it is significant to the study of small chambered tombs elsewhere.

Three different physical models of the CO 2-N 2 system are examined. These are of increasing complexity to determine the effect of more realistic conditions on the flow parameters. The mass conservation equation has been changed to its divergent form, resulting in a much smoother distribution in the mass flow parameter. Small signal gain distributions obtained from the present theory are compared with the experimental results of various research workers. In doing so the validity of using the so-called'Sharma barrier'in determining the kinetic rates is investigated.

As the transverse shock interacts with the reactive flow field behind the incident shock, both its strength and inclination vary with distance downstream. From the observed density profile and the reaction kinetics of the system, values of the density ratio across the transverse shock are computed. The predicted particle velocity profile behind the front confirms that a one-dimensional approximation is valid in the region of interest close to the front, and also that the calculated values are compatible with the Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) theory at a distance further downstream. The theoretically derived transverse wave velocity is taken to be the measured quasi-steady value of 1.2 a CJ, where a CJ is the equilibrium CJ\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["301"]}

We hypothesised that different surface properties of uncemented cups will influence the cup stability. Mounted directly onto host bone, TM and cemented cups were significantly more stable than Trilogy cups (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), with minimal difference between TM and cemented cups (P\u00a0>\u00a00.1). On 100% graft bed, there was marginal difference between all three cup types (P\u00a0>\u00a00.1). Incremental cavitary and segmental defects resulted in reducing stability, with cemented cups being minimally more stable (P\u00a0>\u00a00.1).

The Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) guiding principles have prompted many stakeholders to consider strategies for tackling this challenge by making these digital resources follow common standards and best practices so that they can become more integrated and organized. Faced with the question of how to make digital resources more FAIR, it has become imperative to measure what it means to be FAIR. The diversity of resources, communities, and stakeholders have different goals and use cases and this makes assessment of FAIRness particularly challenging. To begin resolving this challenge, the FAIRshake toolkit was developed to enable the establishment of community-driven FAIR metrics and rubrics paired with manual, semi- and fully-automated FAIR assessment capabilities. The FAIRshake toolkit contains a database that lists registered digital resources, with their associated metrics, rubrics, and assessments. The FAIRshake toolkit also has a browser extension and a bookmarklet that enables viewing and submitting assessments from any website. The FAIR assessment results are visualized as an insignia that can be viewed on the FAIRshake website, or embedded within hosting websites.

{"title": "Lung clearance index in healthy volunteers, measured using a novel portable system with a closed circuit wash-in\n", "abstract": " Introduction Lung clearance index (LCI) is a sensitive measure of early lung disease, but adoption into clinical practice has been slow. Challenges include the time taken to perform each test. We recently described a closed-circuit inert gas wash-in method that reduces overall testing time by decreasing the time to equilibration. The aim of this study was to define a normative range of LCI in healthy adults and children derived using this method. We were also interested in the feasibility of using this system to measure LCI in a community setting.   Methods LCI was assessed in healthy volunteers at three hospital sites and in two local primary schools. Volunteers completed three washout repeats at a single visit using the closed circuit wash-in method (0.2% SF6 wash-in tracer gas to equilibrium, room air washout).   Results 160 adult and paediatric subjects successfully completed LCI assessment (95%) (100 in hospital, 60 in primary schools). Median coefficient of variation was 3.4% for LCI repeats and 4.3% for FRC. Mean (SD) LCI for the analysis cohort (n = 53, age 5\u201339 years) was 6.10 (0.42), making the upper limit of normal LCI 6.8. There was no relationship between LCI and multiple demographic variables. Median (interquartile range) total test time was 18.7 (16.0\u201322.5) minutes.   Conclusion The closed circuit method of LCI measurement can be successfully and reproducibly measured in healthy volunteers, including in out-of-hospital settings. Normal range appears stable up to 39 years. With few subjects older than 40 years, further work is required to define the normal limits above this age.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["301"]}

{"title": "The secondary shock wave in supported detonations with flow divergence\n", "abstract": " A shock wave is found to occur behind a driven planar detonation in a shock tube where the piston motion is provided by the contact surface between the detonated and expanding driver gas. Pressure and luminosity records taken in an oxyacetylene mixture, at an initial pressure of 30-50 Torr, show that the secondary shock has similar properties to those predicted by Lee's theory (1965); it is concluded, therefore, that the shock arises because of flow divergence behind the detonation front. Divergent flow in detonations confined in tubes is known to originate through the influence of the wall boundary layer, which effectively causes a negative or outward displacement of the flow boundary.

{"title": "Dietary nitrate\u2013An unrecognized nutrient?\n", "abstract": " Nitric oxide (NO), a powerful signalling molecule, regulates vascular flow, blood pressure, and tissue responses to hypoxia. Previous research suggested that NO is derived from endogenous synthesis via the conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline, which is oxygen dependent. Recent research has demonstrated the important role of exogenous synthesis, via consumption of dietary nitrate (NO3), which may subsequently be converted to nitrite (NO2) and NO in hypoxic conditions1. Dietary nitrate supplements reduce blood pressure2, improve exercise tolerance in peripheral arterial disease3, improve cerebral perfusion in older adults4 and reduce oxidative stress markers5. However, nitrate is a strictly controlled, environmental contaminant and not regarded as a nutrient essential for health. Plasma [nitrate] and [nitrite] increase after dietary nitrate supplements such as beetroot juice and sodium nitrate, but few studies have used whole, high nitrate vegetables to supplement a normal diet. The purpose of this study was to identify the effects of supplementation with high and low nitrate vegetables on plasma [nitrate],[nitrite], and blood pressure (BP) in a randomized, crossover trial. Fifteen non-smoking, physically active males, 18-40 years, were recruited from the University of Exeter, from January 2011 to March 2012.

{"title": "The physical and compositional properties of dust: what do we really know?\n", "abstract": " Many things in current interstellar dust studies are taken as well understood givens by much of the community. For example, it is widely held that interstellar dust is made up of only three components, i.e., astronomical silicates, graphite and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and that our understanding of these is now complete and sufficient enough to interpret astronomical observations of dust in galaxies. To zeroth order this is a reasonable approximation. However, while these three pillars of dust modelling have been useful in advancing our understanding over the last few decades, it is now apparent that they are insufficient to explain the observed evolution of the dust properties from one region to another. Thus, it is time to abandon the three pillars approach and to seek more physically-realistic interstellar dust analogues. The analy- sis of the pre-solar grains extracted from meteorites, interplanetary dust particles and from the Stardust mission, and the interpretation of x-ray scattering and absorption observations, supports the view that our current view of the interstellar dust composition(s) is indeed too naive. The aim of this review is to point out where our current views are rather secure and, perhaps more importantly, where they are far from secure and we must re-think our ideas. To this aim ten as- pects of interstellar dust will be scrutinised and re-evaluated in terms of their validity within the current observational, experimental, modelling and theoretical constraints. It is concluded from this analysis that we really do need to re-assess many of the fundamental assumptions relating to what we think we really do know about interstellar dust.

{"title": "Explosive response to low speed spigot impact\n", "abstract": " Safety is of paramount importance in the handling, processing and storage of explosives. Low speed impact has been identified as a credible ignition source that can occur during accident scenarios. To provide experimental evidence for the assessment of the threat created by such impacts, work has been ongoing at AWE and LLNL to measure the response of explosives to low speed spigot impact over a range of scales. In this paper the experimental results from impacts on three different HMX based Plastic Bonded Explosives, are presented. The explosives ranged from 90% to 95% by weight HMX content and had three different binders (HTPB Polyurethane, Viton A and a blend of NC and K10 liquid plasticizer). The experiments represent a basic spigot impact into bare unconfined explosives. Initial modelling results using the High Explosive Violent Reaction Model HERMES, as implemented in the LSTC finite element code LS-DYNA, are presented. The modelling results are compared qualitatively with the experimental data. In particular, the locations of predicted high values of the HERMES ignition parameter are compared with the available evidence of ignition location.

It has been observed that children receiving intravenous antibiotics usually show a significant improvement in FEV1 with therapy in the short term. We hypothesized that the FEV1 measured pre-antibiotic therapy and followed longitudinally would show a greater rate of decline and may be a better prognostic indicator than the FEV1 post antibiotic therapy. The study cohort consisted of 60 children with cystic fibrosis who attended the St. James' Hospital cystic fibrosis unit between 1993 and 1999. Mixed model regression analysis provided estimates of the average rate of change of the pre-FEV1, post-FEV1 and FEV1 difference in subgroups based on survival, sex and pseudomonas status.

{"title": "Anesthetic care of the trauma patient: Development of a web-based resource\n", "abstract": " PurposeThe motivation for undertaking this project came from the recognized need for a concise and easily obtainable resource that provided information regarding anesthetic care for trauma patients at our institution. Such a resource was determined to be useful because the facility is a busy Level I trauma center, receiving a large number of trauma referrals and transfers from surrounding rural communities. Many patients require surgical intervention and anesthetic care during off-shifts, when support resources are less readily available. In addition, many anesthesia providers work call shifts, sometimes providing anesthesia in areas other than their usual work sites, such as the interventional radiology or magnetic resonance imaging suites. Because this is a teaching institution, Adequate preparation by anesthesia providers promotes quality care and decreases the likelihood of morbidity and mortality.

{"title": "An Application of Sentiment Analysis\n", "abstract": " This paper describes a prototype application that gathers textual data from the microblogging platform Twitter and carries out sentiment analysis to determine the polarity and subjectivity in relation to Brexit, the UKs exit from the European Union. The design, implementation and testing of the developed prototype will be discussed and an experimental evaluation of the product described. Specifically we provide insight into how events affect public opinion and how sentiment and public mood may be gathered from textual twitter data and propose this as an alternative to opinion polls. Traditional approaches to opinion polling face growing challenges in capturing the public mood. Small sample response and the time it takes to capture swings in public opinion make it difficult to provide accurate data for the political process. With over 500 million daily messages posted worldwide, the social media platform Twitter is an untapped resource of information. Users post short real time messages views and opinions on many topics, often signed with a \u2018# hashtag\u2019to classify and document the subject matter in discussion. In this paper we apply automated sentiment analysis methods to tweets giving a measure of public support or hostility to a topic (\u2018Brexit\u2019). The data were collected during several periods to determine changes in opinion. Using machine learning techniques we show that changes in opinion were also related to external events.

Mycobacterium abscessus (M.abscessus) is a rapid growing multi-resistant NTM associated with severe NTM-PD requiring prolonged antibiotic therapy. Complications of therapy are common but reports on direct complications of active NTM-PD are rare. Vasculitis has been described as a rare complication of NTM-PD, most often in individuals with inherited immune defects. This case is the first to describe an ANCA positive vasculitide (Microscopic Polyangiitis) secondary to M.abscessus pulmonary disease. A 70\u00a0year old female with bronchiectasis underwent a clinical decline associated with the growth of M.abscessus and was diagnosed with NTM-PD. Before treatment could be initiated she developed small joint arthralgia and a glove and stocking axonal loss sensorimotor neuropathy. Positive Perinuclear Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies (P-ANCA) and Myeloperoxidase-ANCA (MPO-ANCA) titres led to a diagnosis of microscopic polyangiitis. Further investigation revealed reduced interferon-gamma production but no other significant immune dysfunction. Dual treatment with immunosuppressive therapy (Corticosteroids/Cyclophosphamide) for vasculitis and antimicrobial therapy for M.abscessus NTM-PD was initiated. Clinical stability was difficult to achieve with reductions in immunosuppression triggering vasculitic flares.

Once a rare cancer, the incidence of melanoma of the skin has risen faster than any other cancer type since the mid-1950s.

Furthermore, the median survival after the onset of distant metastasis is only six to nine months making advanced stage disease a rather ominous diagnosis.The objective of the present study was to use a population-based cohort to assess the incidence of suicide among patients with melanoma of the skin, and to identify demographic, clinical, and pathologic factors associated with suicide in this patient population.

DNA based methods offer better identification and quantification of microbial constituents of sputum than standard clinical culture and may help inform patient management strategies. Our study objective was to determine the longitudinal variability of the non-CF bronchiectasis microbiome in sputum with respect to clinical variables.Eighty-five patients with non-cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis and daily sputum production were recruited from outpatient clinics and followed for six months. Monthly sputum samples and clinical measurements were taken, together with additional samples during exacerbations. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the sputum microbiota was successful for 381 samples from 76 patients and analysed in conjunction with clinical data.Microbial communities were highly individual in composition and stability, usually with limited diversity and often containing multiple pathogens. When compared to DNA sequencing, microbial culture had restricted sensitivity in identifying common pathogens. With some exceptions, community characteristics showed poor correlations with clinical features including underlying disease, antibiotic use and exacerbations.The use of microbial community analysis of sputum added to information from microbial culture.

In this paper, we formulate a coarsegrained Markov-chain description of the post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs by either small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or microRNAs (miRNAs). We calculate the probability of an mRNA escaping from its domain before it is repressed by siRNAs/miRNAs via calculation of the mean time to threshold: when the number of bound siRNAs/miRNAs exceeds a certain threshold value, the mRNA is irreversibly repressed. In some cases, the analysis can be reduced to counting certain paths in a reduced Markov model.

Examples include digital resources tailored to a particular learner\u2019s needs, or individual feedback on a student\u2019s assessed work. In addition, personalised technology-enhanced learning (TEL) now seems to be attracting interest from philanthropists and venture capitalists indicating a new level of enthusiasm for the area and a potential growth industry. However, these industries may be driven by profit rather than pedagogy, and hence it is vital these new developments are informed by relevant, evidence-based research. For many people, personalised learning is an ambiguous and even loaded term that promises much but does not always deliver. This paper provides an in-depth and critical review and synthesis of how personalisation has been represented in the literature since 2000, with a particular focus on TEL. We examine the reasons why personalised learning can be beneficial and examine how TEL can contribute to this. We also unpack how personalisation can contribute to more effective learning.

This report was written by Sarah Hanson, Research Associate and Professor Andy Jones, both from the Norwich Medical School at the University of East Anglia. Executive summary and recommendations The Department of Health funded five \u2018Walking Cities\u2019 in 2013 \u2013 2015 to develop walking initiatives. There was great variety in the projects and evidence of much activity. The aim was also to target the particularly inactive and those who were less well socially situated. Whilst there are useful transferable lessons to be learned from this project, the poor reporting did not allow the assessment of how well aims were achieved. Where baseline measurements were recorded it appeared that participants were already physically active. Where interventions were particularly successful, they built on \u2018grass-roots\u2019 community assets already in existence which took them to the heart of a community. The use of community based assets was particularly important in accessing those who are harder to reach and hence the learnings from this programme support assessing and utilising the assets in a community. There were attempts to work with health professionals with direct referrals into the walking interventions. This met with very limited success and continues to represent a major missed opportunity in reaching those who are the most inactive and in poorest health\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["301"]}

Nevertheless, the specific environments that influence the wellbeing of young people are rather different to those observed for adults, largely as a result of variations in the settings within which children and adolescents spend their time. A key difference from adults is that young people spend a substantial percentage of their time in school settings.

Among GC targets, macrophages are considered ideal since they play a central role in inflammation and immune responses against foreign agents. In this context, we studied the effects of highly selective GCs in neutralizing toxin factors produced by B. anthracis during phagocytosis using murine macrophages. The effects of GCs were studied under three conditions: A) prior to, B) during, and C) following exposure of macrophages to B. anthracis individual toxin (protective antigen [PA], edema factor [EF], lethal factor [LF] or toxin complexes (PA-EF-LF, PA-EF, and PA-LF).

Since cotton is a host during the latter part of the growing season, any resistance developed during the season will reduce control realized in cotton. Pheromone traps have been used sporadically since the late 1980s throughout the cotton belt to collect male moths for testing resistance to a pyrethroid insecticide. Testing was conducted across the cotton belt in a coordinated fashion from 2007-2012 using a concentration of 5 \u00b5g/vial of cypermethrin as the diagnostic dose. Overall survival during 2012 was 14.8%, which was similar to previous years. However, resistance was not uniform across all states. Louisiana and Virginia consistently had much higher survival than all other states with 35% and 33%, respectively. Survival was< 20% in all other states. While there has been little change overall during the last six years of monitoring, a comparison of data from 1998-2000 with 2008-2010 data shows that overall survival at 5 \u00b5g/vial increased from 8% to 18% during the decade, and some increase was found in nearly all participating states. Consistent with historical data, survival was highest during July when moths emerge primarily from corn.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["301"]}

The initiation system has been tuned to deliver a suitable pressure/time profile to marginally initiate each of these compositions. Subsequently, a study of sensitivity and divergence as a function of charge attributes (e.g. composition and density) has been completed. In addition, first stage hydrocode modelling of the MIC Test has been completed using CTH. The modelling output has highlighted the relationship between the prominent features in the results and the confinement around the explosive sample.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["301"]}
{"title": "Silicate dust: from observations to the laboratory\n", "abstract": " Silicate dust is ubiquitous in the Interstellar Medium (ISM). It is thought to be, primarily, the product of the mass loss phase of oxygen rich Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars and to be transported into the ISM by stellar winds. In the ISM, dust is subjected to many processes which could explain its observed structural forms. In order to explain the different observed structures (amorphous, crystalline and often both), we have developed in the laboratory an experimental protocol simulating the different stages in the dust life-cycle (including formation, annealing and irradiation experiments). The synthesized and processed samples are studied by infrared (IR) spectroscopy and electron microscopy in order to infer their chemical, structural and micro-structural characteristics. The results are compared to astronomical observations and to Interplanetary Dust Particles (IDPs) collected in the upper Earth atmosphere by NASA.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["301"]}

{"title": "Effects of prior sprint exercise and muscle heating on oxygen uptake kinetics during heavy exercise\n", "abstract": " The aim of this study was to investigate whether the effects of prior heavy exercise on the oxygen uptake (VO 2) response to subsequent heavy exercise are consequent to an exerciseinduced acidosis or to an elevated muscle temperature. Nine healthy males perfomed 6 min of cycling exercise at an intensity half-way between the lactate threshold and maximum VO 2 (heavy cycling) 6 min following the completion of three separate prior conditions: 1) 6 min of heavy cycling; 2) 30 s of sprint cycling; and 3) immersion of the lower limbs in a hot water bath at 42 C for 40 min. Pulmonary gas exchange was measured breath-by-breath using a mass spectrometer and a turbine volume transducer. A model featuring three exponential terms was used to describe the VO 2 responses to heavy exercise. Blood [lactate] was elevated at the onset of the subsequent heavy exercise bout following prior heavy exercise (3.4\u00b10.3 mM\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["301"]}
{"title": "The Rotaflex total knee replacement--a 5 year review.\n", "abstract": " We report the results of a retrospective analysis of 43 patients who received 56 Rotaflex total knee arthroplasties, with a mean follow-up of 55.7 months. The British Orthopaedic Association (BOA) knee assessment protocol was used in evaluating the clinical results. Two patients could not receive post-operative scores. In the remaining 54 knees, the mean pre-operative score was 25.6, improving to 30.8 post-operatively. Ten knees showed a decrease in knee score, two were unchanged and 42 improved. The greatest improvements were in pain relief and maximum flexion. Wound infection and dehiscences were common, the latter requiring further surgery in five cases. Later, there were eight fractures involving the prosthesis, seven dislocated or subluxed patellae, two deep infections and three cases of severe aseptic loosening. A common feature was severe patellar wear, due to the design fault of an absent femoral groove. The high rate of complications and poor functional result of the Rotaflex knee preclude its use in current practice.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["301"]}

{"title": "Compounds\n", "abstract": " The role of polar solvent in determining the photophysics of normal (b*) and anomalous (a*) fluorescence from 4-N, N-dimethylaminobenzonitrile (DMABN) and related com-pounds has been investigated by means ofpicosecond time-resolved fluorescence studies in non-polar/polar solvent mixtures, and by electronic spectroscopic studies on com-plexes of 1: 1 stoichiometry prepared by nozzle expansion. The solution phase results indicate clearly that a DMABN-polar solvent complex is formed initially in either ground or excited state, and that this rearranges to a geometry from which the b* to a* state transition can occur. Specific solvent-solute interactions are clearly indicated by this work, and these lead to the necessity of modelling b* state decay kinetics in solution by a distribution of decay times. Laser induced fluorescence studies of jet-cooled solvated complexes ofDMABN and the related molecule 4-aminobenzonitrile (4-ABN) provide evidence for the existence of 1: 1 complexes involving interaction of a protic solvent molecule with either the cyano group or the amino group. In the case of 4-ABN both types of complex are fluorescent whereas in the case of DMABN, those complexes involving interaction with the dimethylamino group appear to be non-emissive. This behaviour may be due to formation of DMABN-solvent exciplex which constitutes a dark state under jet-cooled conditions. Neither the DMABN bare molecule nor the observed 1: 1 solvated com-plexes exhibit a* emission in the jet.

Unlike previous approaches to temporal-epistemic abstraction refinement, our procedure is modular and works at the local component level. Consequently, the validation of counterexamples and the refinement of quotient structures can be done in a compositional manner without constructing the full system. We show that our abstraction refinement technique can be applied easily to a common multi-agent formalism pertaining to synchronous systems. We demonstrate the technique by means of a simple example.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["301"]}
