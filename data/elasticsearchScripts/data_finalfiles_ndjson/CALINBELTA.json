Since M1 polarization is crucial during acute infectious diseases, we hypothesized that diet-induced obesity inhibits M1 polarization of macrophages in the response to bacterial infections. Bone marrow macrophages (BMM\u03a6) from lean and obese mice were exposed to live Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) for three incubation times (1 h, 4 h and 24 h). Flow cytometry analysis revealed that the M1 polarization was inhibited after P. gingivalis exposure in BMM\u03a6 from obese mice when compared with BMM\u03a6 from lean counterparts. Using a computational approach in conjunction with microarray data, we identified switching genes that may differentially control the behavior of response pathways in macrophages from lean and obese mice. The two most prominent switching genes were thrombospondin 1 and arginase 1. Protein expression levels of both genes were higher in obese BMM\u03a6 than in lean BMM\u03a6 after exposure to P. gingivalis. Inhibition of either thrombospondin 1 or arginase 1 by specific inhibitors recovered the M1 polarization of BMM\u03a6 from obese mice after P. gingivalis exposure.

Several studies have shown that the deletion of specific TLRs was beneficial for the host, as cytokine levels were decreased consequently. It is not clear, however, how targeting other components of the TLR pathways can improve the responses to infections. We applied the concept of Minimal Cut Sets (MCS) to the ihsTLR v1.0 model of the TLR pathways to determine sets of reactions whose knockouts disrupt these pathways. We decomposed the TLR network into 34 modules and determined signatures for each MCS, i.e. the list of targeted modules. We uncovered 2,669 MCS organized in 68 signatures. Very few MCS targeted directly the TLRs, indicating that they may not be efficient targets for controlling these pathways.

This suggests that increasing retroactivity, traditionally considered an impediment to designing robust synthetic systems, could be exploited to improve the performance of IFFLs.

Our recently proposed High Order CBFs (HOCBFs) can accommodate constraints of arbitrary relative degree. One of the main challenges in this approach is obtaining accurate system dynamics, which is especially difficult for systems that require online model identification given limited computational resources and system data. In order to approximate the real unmodelled system dynamics, we define adaptive affine control dynamics which are updated based on the error states obtained by real-time sensor measurements. We define a HOCBF for a safety requirement on the unmodelled system based on the adaptive dynamics and error states, and reformulate the safety-critical control problem as the above mentioned QP. Then, we determine the events required to solve the QP in order to guarantee safety. We also derive a condition that guarantees the satisfaction of the HOCBF constraint between events.

Advancements in next generation transportation system technologies and the emergence of CAVs (also known as self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles) have the potential to drastically improve a transportation network\u2019s performance by better assisting drivers in making decisions, ultimately reducing energy consumption, air pollution, congestion and accidents. One of the very early efforts exploiting the benefit of CAVs was proposed in [10], where an optimal linear feedback regulator was introduced for the merging problem to control a single string of vehicles. An overview of automated intelligent vehicle-highway systems was provided in [23]. There has been significant research in assisted traffic merging offering guidance to drivers so as to avoid congestion and collisions. A Classification and Regression Tree (CART) method was used in [26] to model merging behavior and assist decisions in terms of the time-to-collision between vehicles. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network was used in [7] to predict possible long-term congestion. In [30], a Radial Basis Function-Artificial Neural Network (RBF-ANN) is used to forcast the traffic volume in a merging area.

Consider, for example, the miniature Robotic Urban-Like Environment (RULE) shown in Fig. 1, where a robot might be required to \"Visit Road R1 or Road R2 without crossing Intersection I3, and then park in an available parking space,\" while at same time obeying the traffic rules.

{"title": "Enforcing temporal logic specifications via reinforcement learning\n", "abstract": " We consider the problem of controlling a system with unknown, stochastic dynamics to achieve a complex, time-sensitive task. An example of this problem is controlling a noisy aerial vehicle with partially known dynamics to visit a pre-specified set of regions in any order while avoiding hazardous areas. In particular, we are interested in tasks which can be described by signal temporal logic (STL) specifications. STL is a rich logic that can be used to describe tasks involving bounds on physical parameters, continuous time bounds, and logical relationships over time and states. STL is equipped with a continuous measure called the robustness degree that measures how strongly a given sample path exhibits an STL property [4, 3]. This measure enables the use of continuous optimization problems to solve learning [7, 6] or formal synthesis problems [9] involving STL.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1603"]}
{"title": "Abstractions for planning and control of robotic swarms\n", "abstract": " In this chapter, we outline a hierarchical framework for planning and control of arbitrarily large groups (swarms) of robots. At the first level of hierarchy, we aggregate the high dimensional control system of the swarm into a small dimensional control system capturing its essential features, such as position of the center, shape, orientation, and size. At the second level, we reduce the problem of controlling the essential features of the swarm to a model checking problem. In the obtained hierarchical framework, high-level specifications given in natural language such as linear temporal logic formulas over linear predicates in the essential features are automatically mapped to provably correct robot control laws. We present simulation results for the particular case of a continuous abstraction based on centroid and variance of a planar swarm made of fully actuated robots with polyhedral control constraints.As a result of tremendous advances in computation, communication, sensor, and actuator technology, it is now possible to build teams of hundreds and even thousands of small and inexpensive ground, air, and underwater robots.

Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) is applied to express a rich robotic specification. To overcome the environmental challenge, we propose a novel path planning-guided reward scheme that is dense over the state space, and crucially, robust to infeasibility of computed geometric paths due to the unknown robot dynamics. To facilitate LTL satisfaction, our approach decomposes the LTL mission into sub-tasks that are solved using distributed DRL, where the sub-tasks are trained in parallel, using Deep Policy Gradient algorithms.

In this paper, we introduce a time-incremental learning framework: given a dataset of labeled signal traces with a common time horizon, we propose a method to predict the label of a signal that is received incrementally over time, referred to as prefix signal. Prefix signals are the signals that are being observed as they are generated, and their time length is shorter than the common horizon of signals. We present a novel decision-tree based approach to generate a finite number of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications from the given dataset, and construct a predictor based on them. Each STL specification, as a binary classifier of time-series data, captures the temporal properties of the dataset over time. The predictor is constructed by assigning time-variant weights to the STL formulas. The weights are learned by using neural networks, with the goal of minimizing the misclassification rate for the prefix signals defined over the given dataset. The learned predictor is used to predict the label of a prefix signal, by computing the weighted sum of the robustness of the prefix signal with respect to each STL formula. The effectiveness and classification performance of our algorithm are evaluated on an urban-driving and a naval-surveillance case studies.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1603"]}

Optimal control methods are well studied, but become computationally infeasible for real-time applications when there are multiple hard safety constraints involved. To guarantee such safety constraints, it has been shown that optimizing quadratic costs while stabilizing affine control systems to desired (sets of) states subject to state and control constraints can be reduced to a sequence of Quadratic Programs (QPs) by using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs).

We formulate these specifications as rules, and specify their priorities by constructing a priority structure, called \\underline{T}otal \\underline{OR}der over e\\underline{Q}uivalence classes (TORQ). We propose a recursive framework, in which the satisfaction of the rules in the priority structure are iteratively relaxed in reverse order of priority. Central to this framework is an optimal control problem, where convergence to desired states is achieved using Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) and clearance with other road users is enforced through Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). We present offline and online approaches to this problem. In the latter, the AV has limited sensing range that affects the activation of the rules, and the control is generated using a receding horizon (Model Predictive Control, MPC) approach. We also show how the offline method can be used for after-the-fact (offline) pass/fail evaluation of trajectories - a given trajectory is rejected if we can find a controller producing a trajectory that leads to less violation of the rule priority structure. We present case studies with multiple driving scenarios to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms, and to compare the offline and online versions of our proposed framework.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1603"]}

Central to our approach are finite abstractions, which allow for the use of adapted temporal logics as specification languages, tools from formal verification resembling model checking for analysis and control, and techniques inspired from synchronization in concurrency theory for synthesis of communication strategies. We believe that we accomplished the initial objectives of the project. Specifically, we developed abstraction and control strategy for discrete-time affine systems, techniques for MDP control from PLTL and PCTL formulas, a top-down approach for distributed synthesis of control and communication strategies, and several applications to robot motion planning and control.Descriptors:", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1603"]}

This problem is motivated by applications in robotics, where such problems naturally arise when probabilistic models of robot motion are required to satisfy temporal logic task specifications. We transform this problem into a Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problem and develop a new approximate dynamic programming algorithm to solve it. This algorithm is of the actor-critic type and uses a least-square temporal difference learning method. It operates on sample paths of the system and optimizes the policy within a pre-specified class parameterized by a parsimonious set of parameters. We show its convergence to a policy corresponding to a stationary point in the parameters' space.

{"title": "A Formal Approach to the Automatic Generation of Ballet Phrases\n", "abstract": " This paper presents a novel example where formal methods can be used to generate a type of human behavior. Drawing inspiration from classical ballet, poses are cast as discrete states and movements as the transitions between these states. Using Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), we are able to further constrain the set of possible sequences through the transition system and thus prevent it from evolving through a sequence of states that is physically impossible or aesthetically undesirable. Thus, a given movement style is encoded in the availability of transitions at each state, and the dynamics of a complex physical trajectory are abstracted as a system which moves between these states. Our overarching objective is to facilitate subtle degrees of control over systems through a useful parameterization for human movement. Such subtleties are required, for example, by humanoid robots to interact in and analyze a social and aesthetically driven world.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1603"]}

We develop a framework called Scalable and Robust Algorithms for Task-based Coordination from High-level Specifications (ScRATCHS) to coordinate such teams.

ScRATCHS also enables optimization of the resulting plan to be maximally robust to agent attrition at the penalty of increased computation time.

We apply our results to a recent genome scale model of E. coli metabolism, in which we traverse the 51 anhydrous ESCR of the metabolic network to determine all 928 minimal aqueous nutrient media that render biomass weakly producible. We find 287 of these 928 species sets to be feasible as nutrients for biomass in the presence of irreversibility constraints.

{"title": "Investigating metabolite essentiality through genome scale analysis of E. coli production capabilities\n", "abstract": " Motivation: A phenotype mechanism is classically derived through the study of a set of mutants and comparison of their biochemical capabilities. One method of comparing mutant capabilities is to characterize producible and knocked out metabolites. However, such an effect is difficult to manually assess, especially for a large biochemical network and a complex media. Current algorithmic approaches towards analyzing metabolic networks either do not address this specific property or are computationally infeasible on the genome-scale.Results: We have developed a novel genome-scale computational approach that identifies the full set of biochemical species that are knocked out from the metabolome following a gene deletion. Results from this approach are combined with data from in vivo mutant screens to examine the essentiality of metabolite production for a phenotype. This approach can also be a useful tool for metabolic network annotation validation and refinement in newly sequenced organisms. Combining an in silico genome-scale model of E. coli metabolism with in vivo survival data, we uncover possible essential roles for several cell membrane, cell wall, and quinone species. We also identify specific biomass components whose production appears to be non-essential for survival, contrary to the assumptions of previous models.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of finding a control strategy for a discrete time positive monotone system with bounded uncertainties such that the evolution of the system is guaranteed to be confined to a safe set in the state space for all times. By exploiting monotonicity, we propose an approach to this problem which is based on constraint programming. We find control strategies that are based on repetitions of finite sequences of control actions. We show that, under assumptions made in the paper, safety control of cooperative systems does not require state measurement.

{"title": "Utilizing Signal Temporal Logic to Characterize and Compose Modules in Synthetic Biology\n", "abstract": " The goal of synthetic biology is to allow biologists and engineers to design and build new biological systems. One way this task is achieved is though the composition of DNA segments representing genetic parts and modules. In synthetic biology, parts represent promoters, ribosome binding sites, genes, terminators, etc. while modules are comprised of these parts and include gates, switches, and oscillators. Each of these constructs has a function which can be specified in a formal way using a language such as the hardware description language Verilog. It has been shown that it is possible to reliably synthesize genetic circuits specified in this language using well established methods from logic synthesis in digital electronics [4]. Although previous approaches are very good at predicting the behavior of a designed circuit, they are Boolean in nature and do not include information about the performance of a design. Genetic circuit designs often contain real-time and real-valued constraints that can affect the dynamics of the system with varying levels of magnitude. To improve on previous approaches and include performance metrics in design specifications, temporal logics such as signal temporal logic (STL)[3] can be used. STL adds the ability to create specifications that include parameters intrinsic to genetic components, interactions with complex environments and other components, and timing of interactions and events. For example, the genetic toggle switch shown in Figure 1 (a) can be described by the STL formula in Figure 1 (b). This STL formula states that the toggle switch starts in a state where both TetR and aTc are above a value of 30\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1603"]}

{"title": "PA 19104, USA\n", "abstract": " This paper addresses the problem of controlling a large number of robots required to accomplish a task as a group. We propose an abstraction based on the definition of a map from the configuration space of the robots to a lower dimensional manifold, whose dimension does not scale with the number of robots. The task to be accomplished by the team suggests a natural feedback control system on the group manifold. We show that, if mean and covariance matrix are chosen as group variables for fully actuated robots, it is possible to design decoupling control laws, ie, the feedback control for a robot is only dependent on the state of the robot and the state of the group, therefore the communication necessary to accomplish the task is kept to a minimum.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1603"]}
{"title": "New metrics for trajectory generation and interpolation on SE (3)\n", "abstract": " This paper develops a method for generating smooth trajectories for a moving rigid body with speci ed boundary conditions. It is well known that SE (3), the set of all rigid body translations and orientations, is a non Euclidean space. In general, the problem of determining trajectories that are optimal with respect to some meaningful metric does not have an analytical solution. Thus it is di cult to develop e cient solutions for real time applications in computer graphics and robotics.In this paper, we consider SE (n) to be a submanifold (and a subgroup) of the Lie group of a ne maps in IRn, GA (n). Our method involves two key steps:(1) the generation of optimal trajectories in GA (n); and (2) the projection of the trajectories from GA (n) to SE (n). The overall procedure is invariant with respect to both the local coordinates on the manifold and the choice of the inertial frame. The bene ts of the method are two-fold. First, it is possible to apply any of the variety of well-known, e cient techniques to generate optimal curves on GA (n) 7, 8]. Second, the method yields approximations to optimal solutions for general choices of Riemannian metrics on SE (3).", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1603"]}
{"title": "Uncovering complex essential reaction sets in E. coli metabolism through pathway fragment analysis\n", "abstract": " Genome scale metabolic network models enable in silico knockout experiment design for the purposes of metabolic engineering, drug discovery, and improving the systems-level understanding of metabolism. Currently, the primary method for genome-scale in silico knockout design is flux balance analysis (FBA), which uses linear programming (LP) to exhaustively test the metabolic capabilities of all single, double, triple, etc. knockout combinations [5]. In genome-scale models, this\u2019 brute force\u2019LP approach is computationally limited to the testing of small knockout combinations [2]. The minimal cut set (MCS) algorithm is an alternative\u201d rational\u201d approach for finding reactions sets (ie MCS) essential for an objective function; however, it is intractable for large (ie genome-scale) metabolic networks due to the computational complexity of elementary mode enumeration [4, 3].In this paper we outline and apply a network-based approach for genome-scale metabolic knockout design that involves analysis of pathway fragments (PF). PF are analogues of extreme pathways, arising from partial satisfaction of network-level metabolite steady-state requirements. PF are computable at the genome-scale using a modification of expa, the standard algorithm for generating extreme pathways [1]. Since the cone generate by PF over-approximates the feasible flux cone, a simple traversal of PF can be used to generate cut sets for an objective reaction in the network (see Figure 1). We apply our PF-based knockout design method to uncover over 11,000 complex essential reaction sets for biomass production in an in silico genome-scale model of E. coli [6].", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1603"]}
{"title": "Symbolic motion planning and control in the presence of noise\n", "abstract": " We present a scheme for autonomous control of a mobile robot with noisy sensors and actuators moving in a partially known environment. The motion of the robot and the environment are together modeled as a Partially Observed Markov Decision Process (POMDP). We use cost functions to encode tasks to be executed over the POMDP and develop (sub-) optimal control strategies to achieve these tasks through the use of finite-stage look ahead dynamic programming. The method is illustrated through the use of simulation and experimental results.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1603"]}
{"title": "Euclidean metrics for motion generation on SE\u01613\u017d\n", "abstract": " Previous approaches to trajectory generation for rigid bodies have been either based on the so-called invariant screw motions or on ad hoc decompositions into rotations and translations. This paper formulates the trajectory generation problem in the framework of Lie groups and Riemannian geometry. The goal is to determine optimal curves joining given points with appropriate boundary conditions on the Euclidean group. Since this results in a two-point boundary value problem that has to be solved iteratively, a computationally efficient, analytical method that generates near-optimal trajectories is derived. The method consists of two steps. The first step involves generating the optimal trajectory in an ambient space, while the second step is used to project this trajectory onto the Euclidean group. The paper describes the method, its applications and its performance in terms of optimality and efficiency.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1603"]}
