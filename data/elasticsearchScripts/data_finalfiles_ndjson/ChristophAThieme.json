{"title": "Assessing ship risk model applicability to Marine Autonomous Surface Ships\n", "abstract": " Marine Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) are tested in public waters. A requirement for MASS to be operated is that they should be at least as safe as conventional ships. Hence, this paper investigates how far the current ship risk models for ship-ship collision, ship-structure collision, and groundings are applicable for risk assessment of MASS. Nine criteria derived from a systems engineering approach are used to assess relevant ship risk models. These criteria aim at assessing relevant considerations for the operation of MASS, such as technical reliability, software performance, human-machine interfaces, operating, and several aspects of communication. From 64 assessed models, published since 2005, ten fulfilled six or more of these criteria. These models were investigated more closely. None of them are suitable to be directly used for risk assessment of MASS. However, they can be used as basis for\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "67\n", "authors": ["1486"]}

Unanticipated faults and events might lead to loss of vessels, transported goods, collected scientific data, and business reputation. Hence, systems have to be in place that monitor the safety performance of operation and indicate if it drifts into an intolerable safety level. This article proposes a process for developing safety indicators for the operation of autonomous marine systems (AMS). The condition of safety barriers and resilience engineering form the basis for the development of safety indicators, synthesizing and further adjusting the dual assurance and the resilience based early warning indicator (REWI) approaches. The article locates the process for developing safety indicators in the system life cycle emphasizing a timely implementation of the safety indicators. The resulting safety indicators reflect safety in AMS operation and can assist in planning of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "44\n", "authors": ["1486"]}

Expected benefits of autonomous marine system in comparison to conventional marine systems are reduced cost, reduced risk to operators, and increased efficiency of such systems. Autonomous underwater vehicles are applied in scientific, commercial, and military applications for surveys and inspections of the sea floor, the water column, marine structures, and objects of interest. Autonomous underwater vehicles are costly vehicles and may carry expensive payloads. Hence, risk models are needed to assess the mission success before a mission and adapt the mission plan if necessary. The operators prepare and interact with autonomous underwater vehicles to carry out a mission successfully. Risk models need to reflect these interactions.

Today, about 40% of the world's population lives near a coast and many of the biggest cities are located near the sea or along rivers. In Norway, a high percentage of people live in coastal areas. There are many waterways, such as canals and fjords, in these coastal areas. Constructing bridges over these water channels is expensive and may hinder marine traffic. Therefore, in the coastal cities, urban ferries are much more than tourist attractions.

It is based on a case study of the Applied Underwater Robotics Laboratory of NTNU, which operates several UUV.

Efficient interaction and communication between these agents are crucial for safe operation. Conventional methods for hazard identification and safety assessment focus often on one of the aspects of the system only, e.g., human reliability, software failures, or equipment reliability. The method Human-System Interaction in Autonomy (H-SIA) was recently proposed, focusing on autonomous ships operation and collision scenarios. H-SIA provides a framework for analyzing autonomous ship operation as an entirety, rather than each agent separately.

If a fault or an unexpected deviation from the mission plan should occur, which the autonomous capability of the AUV does not discover as a fault, the operators have to detect these instead and act appropriately. This paper presents a Bayesian Belief Network to assess the probability of monitoring success of an AUV mission. Some of the influences that are incorporated in the model are; Trust in the System, Automation Etiquette, Additional Workload, Time Delay and Loss of Status Messages.

The AUR Lab of NTNU operates one REMUS 100 AUV and several other unmanned underwater vehicles in Norway s fjords. In order to minimize the risk, inherent to these operations, a risk management system should be developed.This thesis summarizes the findings during development. The risk management process and the framework document are based on ISO 31000 (2009). In the course of the development, an exemplary risk assessment was carried out. The aim of the risk assessment was to assess the risk of loss of the AUV and unplanned mission abort. The assessment described is one of the first to use human risk analysis in connection with reliability analysis of AUV. Besides human reliability assessment, fault tree analysis, event tree analysis and expert estimation were the main methods used to assess the risk.The results of the risk assessment were unsatisfying. The risk found seems to be overestimated this can be accounted to some of the methods used, the low experience with these methods and the low experience in general with AUV operation. The methods applied seem to be suitable in most cases but some require modifications for future use. Despite the low confidence in the data obtained, the recommendations made, are assumed to be helpful to improve operation. The main recommendations are improved or newly written procedures for maintenance, planning of missions and fault recognition and solving.The risk management framework still has to be reviewed by the heads of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1486"]}

The aim of this work is to study the safety and cyber security of the communication system of an APS, namely the MilliAmpere2 APS.

{"title": "Risk Analysis and Modelling of Autonomous Marine Systems\n", "abstract": " Autonomous marine systems (AMSs) are of increasing interest for the marine and maritime industries. AMSs are engineered, computer-controlled systems that take (to some degree) decisions independent of their human operators. Different types of AMSs can be differentiated, for example, maritime autonomous surface ships (MASSs), autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), or unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). AMSs reduce the operational cost, the risk with respect to personnel, and the energy consumption in comparison to their conventional equivalents. AUVs are already in use and MASSs are expected to be in operation before 2020 (Kongsberg Maritime, 2017). To accept these systems, the public and authorities require that they are safe and do not have higher levels of risk than conventional systems (Danish Maritime Authority, 2018).   The objective of this thesis is to present risk analysis and risk modelling approaches for AMSs. These risk models and risk modelling approaches assist in demonstrating that AMSs are as safe as required and provide decision support during the design and operation of AMSs. This thesis addresses three issues: (i) Identification of risk-influencing factors for AMSs, (ii) presentation of risk analysis and risk modelling approaches for AMSs, and (iii) description of a risk monitoring approach for the operation of AMSs.   Risk assessments are used to analyse and evaluate the level of risk through risk models and suggest improvement measures to reduce the level of risk if necessary (Rausand, 2011). In this thesis, current risk models and approaches have been reviewed to evaluate their applicability for AMSs\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1486"]}

In this regard, the state of system is defined as the maximum transferable charging power into the onboard batteries from shore which can be comprimised by the failure of the individual compoents. As the results of Markov chain analysis, the probability of the operation states and Mean Time to The First Failure (MTTFF) are calculated. Further, to clearify the impact of the failure of the individual compoents on the charigng mission, an application-specific failure threshold is defined.
