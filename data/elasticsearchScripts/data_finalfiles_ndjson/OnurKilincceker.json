{"title": "Vascular landmark classification in retinal images using fuzzy RBF\n", "abstract": " This paper suggests the use of radial based neural networks for classification of the landmark points from retina vessels in the retinal vascular images to diagnose the disease in the diabetic retinopathy patients and to track the periodic differences in retinal vessel images. In the suggested method, Gold Standard images from DRIVE database are used. The performance of landmark detection by the suggested method shows that the method can be used as an algorithm for registration of retinal images.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["2043"]}
