On the other hand, the IoT poses challenges that will require enhancements and extensions of the current state of the art in the BPM field.

In the course of the production plant lifecycle, engineers from a variety of disciplines (eg, mechanics, electronics, automation) need to collaborate in multi-disciplinary settings that are characterized by heterogeneity in terminology, methods, and tools. This collaboration yields a variety of engineering artifacts that need to be linked and integrated, which on the technical level is reflected in the need to integrate heterogeneous data. Semantic Web technologies, in particular ontology-based data integration (OBDI), are promising to tackle this challenge that has attracted strong interest from the engineering research community. This interest has resulted in a growing body of literature that is dispersed across the Semantic Web and Automation System Engineering research communities and has not been systematically reviewed so far. We address this gap with a survey reflecting on OBDI applications in the context of Multi-Disciplinary Engineering Environment (MDEE). To this end, we analyze and compare 23 OBDI applications from both the Semantic Web and the Automation System Engineering research communities. Based on this analysis, we (i) categorize OBDI variants used in MDEE,(ii) identify key problem context characteristics,(iii) compare strengths and limitations of OBDI variants as a function of problem context, and (iv) provide recommendation guidelines for the selection of OBDI variants and technologies for OBDI in MDEE.", "num_citations": "39\n", "authors": ["601"]}

Declarative process models gained plenty of traction lately as they have proven to provide a good fit for the problem at hand, i.e. visualizing and executing flexible business processes. These models are based on constraints that impose behavioral restrictions on process behavior. Essentially, a declarative model is a set of constraints defined over the set of activities in a process. While allowing for very flexible process specifications, a major downside is that the combination of constraints can lead to behavioral restrictions not explicitly visible when reading a model. These restrictions, so-called hidden dependencies, make the models much more difficult to understand.

The models are well-capable of representing flexible behavior, as everything that is not forbidden by the constraints in the model is possible during execution. These models, however, are more difficult to comprehend and require a higher mental effort of both the modeler and the reader. Since constraints can be added freely to the model, it is often overseen what impact the combination of them has. This is often referred to as hidden dependencies.

We elicited relevant queries from EMSE researchers and systematically integrated information from 30 representative research papers into the KB.[Results] The resulting KB was effective and efficient in answering the relevant queries, enabling knowledge reuse for analyses beyond the results from the SLR process.[Conclusion] The SKE approach showed promising results in the software inspection context and should be also evaluated in other contexts for building EMSE BoKs faster.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["601"]}

{"title": "Conceptualizing the domain of automated feedback for learners\n", "abstract": " Achieving high-quality automated feedback that helps and guides students in their learning process is one of the most pursued challenges within the field of technology-enhanced learning (TEL). However, there is no theoretical foundation that conceptualizes what automated feedback consists of in order to understand what must be considered to automatically design and deliver feedback. Based on a critical review of the literature, this paper presents a framework that identifies and defines the most important factors to characterise automated feedback. The framework can 1) help to better frame scientific contributions on automated feedback, which will facilitate their application and validation; and 2) serve researchers and developers as guidance in the design and implementation of quality automated feedback within TEL environments.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["601"]}

Despite the many advantages that UI preview could offer, it is not provided by current UI development environments. This paper presents UI-GEAR, a UI generation preview capable to adapt in real-time. UI-GEAR is developed within the MERODE method, a model-driven engineering approach capable to generate a fully functional system prototype from its specification in models. UI-GEAR extends MERODE with a UI development environment that enables developers to play with generation options and to straightforwardly and in real-time visualize the consequences of their choices on the UI to be generated, thus providing them with immediate guidance and design flexibility.

A ramp-up team needs to find a capable production process for a new production site to produce the product in sufficient quality and volume efficiently and with reasonable investment costs. Capable production processes have to be qualified first regarding the specification criteria of the created product. However, currently the ramp-up team does not have a well-structured process to follow or a measurement system for guidance. In this paper we propose the\" knowledge-based production ramp-up process\"(K-RAMP) for the ramp-up of a new product with specified requirements in a target production system. Based on these knowledge assets, we introduce the\" ramp-up recommender system\" that systematically helps determine reusable processes in the target production system.

Business processes are starting to take advantage of IoT by adapting to the physical environment or by automating process tasks. The Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) specification has been employed in numerous studies to include IoT devices and resources. While aggregating low-level IoT data into process-relevant data is of paramount importance for IoT processes, BPMN may not be the best approach to model this data aggregation. Decision Model and Notation (DMN), however, is a recently introduced standard which is inherently used to aggregate low-level information into high-level information. This makes DMN a promising match for modelling context data aggregation in IoT processes.

In practice, engineers still prefer using well-known UML diagrams for graphically representing their systems and as foundation for high-quality software code derivation. To bridge the gap between traditional and semanticbased data model design, we presented the umlTUowl tool that supports transforming UML class diagram data formats (XMI) into semantic data (ie, OWL ontologies). However, it is essential that the generated data can be efficiently managed by non-experts in semantic technologies and that the models are preserved consistently. In this paper, we address these important issues by extending the umlTUowl tool towards a fully-fledged model-driven development (MDD) process, umlTUmany, that (a) supports the generation of Java code and (b) provides Java and semantic mechanisms for testing and consistency checking. We evaluated umlTUmany in a pilot application based on a real-world project management use case in a heterogeneous and distributed engineering environment.

{"title": "Improving Understandability of Declare Models by Revealing Hidden Dependencies\n", "abstract": " Declarative process models have become a mature alternative to procedural ones. Instead of focusing on what has to happen, they rather follow an outside-in approach based on a rule base containing different types of constraints. The models are well-capable of representing flexible behavior, as everything that is not allowed by the constraints in the model is possible during execution. These models, however, are more difficult to comprehend and require a higher mental effort of both the modeler and the reader. Since constraints can be added freely to the model, it is often overseen what impact the combination of them has. This is often referred to as hidden dependencies. This paper proposes a methodology to make these dependencies explicit for the declarative process modeling language Declare by considering a Declare model as a graph and relying on the constraints\u2019 characteristics. Moreover, this paper also contributes by empirically confirming that a tool that can visualize hidden dependency information on top of a Declare model has a significant positive impact on the understandability of Declare models.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["601"]}
