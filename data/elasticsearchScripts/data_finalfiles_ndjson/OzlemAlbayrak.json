In this paper, we analyze the impact of certain defect types on the effectiveness of code inspection. We conducted an experiment in an academic environment with 88 subjects to empirically investigate the effect of two maintainability defects, ie, indentation and naming conventions, on the number of functional defects found, the effectiveness of functional defect detections, and the number of false positives reported during individual code inspections.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["1262"]}
{"title": "Incomplete software requirements and assumptions made by software engineers\n", "abstract": " Many software engineers make implicit assumptions when working with incomplete software requirements. To study assumptions made by software engineers while converting incomplete requirements to software design or to implementation phase deliverables, we conducted an experiment with 251 software engineers from eight companies. The results of this empirical study showed that how software engineers responded (using source code, pseudo code, or prototype) to an incomplete requirement significantly impacted the number of explicit assumptions they made. We studied relationships between the number of explicit assumptions and the engineers' experience and educational backgrounds. On average, non-computer-background engineers made more explicit assumptions than computer background graduates. We found a significant relationship between the engineers' experience and the number of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["1262"]}

It further aims to present diffusion of DMIS technology innovations and utilizations in Turkey, a country that is exposed to many different sources of disasters. Management of technology utilized for disaster management is a challenging topic, because effective disaster management is not only a complex problem which involves many parameters that are usually difficult to measure and identify, but also an important subject which can save lives and millions of dollars. Analysis of current situation, planning, optimum resource management, coordination, controlling and monitoring current activities and making quick and correct decisions in case of crisis and emergency are only some of many parameters, whose complete list is very long\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["1262"]}
{"title": "An experiment to observe the impact of UML diagrams on the effectiveness of software requirements inspections\n", "abstract": " Software inspections aim to find defects early in the development process and studies have found them to be effective. However, there is almost no data available regarding the impact of UML diagram utilization in software requirements specification documents on inspection effectiveness. This paper addresses this issue by investigating whether inclusion of UML diagrams impacts the effectiveness of requirements inspection. We conducted an experiment in an academic environment with 35 subjects to empirically investigate the impact of UML diagram inclusion on requirements inspections' effectiveness and the number of reported defects. The results show that including UML diagrams in requirements specification document significantly impacts the number of reported defects, and there is no significant impact on the effectiveness of individual inspections.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1262"]}

This study proposes a simple hypothetical model on the factors that influence the instructor's acceptance of the utilization of games (whether serious or not) in undergraduate software engineering education. The suggested model is tested by means of a pilot questionnaire conducted in Turkey. Data collected from 30 instructors revealed that \"the number of hours per week the instructor plays game\", \"instructor's experience in using games for educational purposes in general\", and \"instructor's experience in designing games\" have significant impact on the instructor's decision to use games in software engineering education. We found no significant impact of \"instructor's previous research experience in education\", \"intention to conduct future research on education\", and \"awareness of games used in\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1262"]}
{"title": "Are software engineers' responses to incomplete requirements related to project characteristics?\n", "abstract": " Software requirements quality affects software product quality. For high-quality software products, software requirements must be complete. When faced with incomplete requirements, software engineers attempt to fill the requirements' gaps differently, either by getting feedback from the user or by making assumptions. Assumptions may be explicit or implicit. Explicit assumptions are preferable to implicit assumptions as explicit assumptions can be validated. We conduct an empirical study to determine whether the number of explicit assumptions made by software engineers is related to a project's characteristics. Using data from two CMMI Level 3 companies and 16 projects, we investigated the responses of 92 software engineers to the same incomplete software requirement. Our findings show possible relationships between projects' characteristics and the number of explicit assumptions.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1262"]}

Digital twins with AI/ML/DL capabilities are among these applications. Steel is an important process industry, where such applications have vast potential to provide positive impacts on different aspects, including energy consumption and cost benefits. The Cognitive Plants Through Proactive Self-Learning Hybrid Digital Twins (CogniTwin) project aims at adding the cognitive elements to the existing process control systems, enabling their capability to self-organise and offer solutions to unpredicted behaviours. In NOKSEL pilot of CogniTwin, the main problem is related to very high costs of machines breakdowns. By developing digital, hybrid and cognitive twins, the pilot aims at reducing energy consumption and average duration of machine downtimes.

The AIS-SIGSAND 2007 study, the first phase, was part of ongoing research by which systems analysis and design-teaching experiences related to course evaluation items were enlightened. This study summarizes previous studies and introduces new findings suggested by those studies that relate to teaching challenges on systems analysis and design in software engineering. The first challenge studied is to decide a suitable evaluation item set in undergraduate level system analysis and design courses for software engineers. The second challenge relates to implicit assumptions made by software engineers during the analysis phase. Based on pre-interview, test\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1262"]}

This requires not only fast and thorough processing and optimization abilities, but also real-time data provided to the DMIS.

{"title": "A study to observe relations between software engineers' responses to incomplete requirements and requirements volatility\n", "abstract": " For high quality software, software requirements must be complete. In practice, not all software requirements are complete. In case of incomplete software requirements, software engineers fill in the requirements' gaps by getting feedback from the stakeholders or by making explicit or implicit assumptions. Explicit assumptions can be validated during analysis, while implicit assumptions validation is carried to design and implementation. Thus, compared to implicit assumption, explicit assumptions are better. Software requirements specifications change during different phases of project life-cycle. In an attempt to improve software development processes, we conducted an empirical study to search possible relationships between the number of implicit assumptions made by software engineers and requirements' volatility. This practice paper presents data from three completed projects at one CMMI level 3 company. Within the limit of our data set, our experience shows that possible relationships between projects' requirements volatility and the number of implicit assumptions are worth studying.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1262"]}
