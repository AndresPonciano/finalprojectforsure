{"title": "Performance Analysis of Feature Selection Methods in Software Defect Prediction: A Search Method Approach\n", "abstract": " Software Defect Prediction (SDP) models are built using software metrics derived from software systems. The quality of SDP models depends largely on the quality of software metrics (dataset) used to build the SDP models. High dimensionality is one of the data quality problems that affect the performance of SDP models. Feature selection (FS) is a proven method for addressing the dimensionality problem. However, the choice of FS method for SDP is still a problem, as most of the empirical studies on FS methods for SDP produce contradictory and inconsistent quality outcomes. Those FS methods behave differently due to different underlining computational characteristics. This could be due to the choices of search methods used in FS because the impact of FS depends on the choice of search method. It is hence imperative to comparatively analyze the FS methods performance based on different search methods in SDP. In this paper, four filter feature ranking (FFR) and fourteen filter feature subset selection (FSS) methods were evaluated using four different classifiers over five software defect datasets obtained from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) repository. The experimental analysis showed that the application of FS improves the predictive performance of classifiers and the performance of FS methods can vary across datasets and classifiers. In the FFR methods, Information Gain demonstrated the greatest improvements in the performance of the prediction models. In FSS methods, Consistency Feature Subset Selection based on Best First Search had the best influence on the prediction models.

It helps software engineer to optimally, allocate limited resources to defective software modules or components in the testing or maintenance phases of the software development life cycle (SDLC).  Nonetheless,  the predictive performance of SDP  models reckons largely on the quality of dataset utilized for training the predictive models.  The high dimensionality of software metric features has been noted as a  data quality problem which negatively affects the predictive performance of SDP  models. Feature  Selection  (FS) is a well-known method for solving high dimensionality problem and can be divided into filter-based and wrapper-based methods. Filter-based  FS has low computational cost, but the predictive performance of its classification algorithm on the filtered data cannot be guaranteed.  On the contrary,   wrapper-based   FS have good predictive performance but with the high computational cost and lack of generalizability. Therefore, this study proposes a hybrid multi-filter wrapper method for feature selection of relevant and irredundant features in software defect prediction.

This paper presents t-way generation strategy for both a uniform and variable strength test suite by applying the ABC strategy (ABCVS) to reduce the size of the test suite and to subsequently enhance the test suite generation interaction. To assess both the effectiveness and performance of the presented ABCVS, several experiments were conducted applying various sets of benchmarks. The results revealed that the proposed ABCVS outweigh the existing based strategies and demonstrated wider interaction between components as opposed to AI-search based and computational based strategies. The results also revealed higher prospect of ABCVS in the aspect of its effectiveness and performance as observed in the majority of case studies.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["377"]}

Recently, researchers have been advocating the adoption of meta-heuristic algorithms for t-way testing strategies (where t points the interaction strength among parameters). Although helpful, no single meta-heuristic based t-way strategy can claim dominance over its counterparts. For this reason, the hybridization of meta-heuristic algorithms can help to ascertain the search capabilities of each by compensating for the limitations of one algorithm with the strength of others. Consequently, a new meta-heuristic based t-way strategy called Hybrid Artificial Bee Colony (HABCSm) strategy, based on merging the advantages of the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm with the advantages of a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed in this paper. HABCSm is the first t-way strategy to adopt Hybrid Artificial Bee Colony (HABC) algorithm with Hamming distance as its core method for generating a final test set and the first to adopt the Hamming distance as the final selection criterion for enhancing the exploration of new solutions. The experimental results demonstrate that HABCSm provides superior competitive performance over its counterparts.

However, choosing an appropriate filter feature selection (FFS) method that will generate and guarantee optimal features in SDP is an open research issue, known as the filter rank selection problem. As a solution, the combination of multiple filter methods can alleviate the filter rank selection problem. In this study, a novel adaptive rank aggregation-based ensemble multi-filter feature selection (AREMFFS) method is proposed to resolve high dimensionality and filter rank selection problems in SDP. Specifically, the proposed AREMFFS method is based on assessing and combining the strengths of individual FFS methods by aggregating multiple rank lists in the generation and subsequent selection of top-ranked features to be used in the SDP process. The efficacy of the proposed AREMFFS method is evaluated with decision tree (DT) and na\u00efve Bayes (NB) models on defect datasets from different repositories with diverse defect granularities. Findings from the experimental results indicated the superiority of AREMFFS over other baseline FFS methods that were evaluated, existing rank aggregation based multi-filter FS methods, and variants of AREMFFS as developed in this study. That is, the proposed AREMFFS method not only had a superior effect on prediction performances of SDP models but also outperformed baseline FS methods and existing rank aggregation based multi-filter FS methods. Therefore, this study recommends the combination of multiple FFS methods to utilize the strength of respective FFS\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["377"]}
{"title": "DSP: Schema Design for Non-Relational Applications\n", "abstract": " The way a database schema is designed has a high impact on its performance in relational databases, which are symmetric in nature. While the problem of schema optimization is even more significant for NoSQL (\u201cNot only SQL\u201d) databases, existing modeling tools for relational databases are inadequate for this asymmetric setting. As a result, NoSQL modelers rely on rules of thumb to model schemas that require a high level of competence. Several studies have been conducted to address this problem; however, they are either proprietary, symmetrical, relationally dependent or post-design assessment tools. In this study, a Dynamic Schema Proposition (DSP) model for NoSQL databases is proposed to handle the asymmetric nature of today\u2019s data. This model aims to facilitate database design and improve its performance in relation to data availability. To achieve this, data modeling styles were aggregated and classified. Existing cardinality notations were empirically extended using synthetically generated queries. A binary integer formulation was used to guide the mapping of asymmetric entities from the application\u2019s conceptual data model to a database schema. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the impact of the DSP model on NoSQL schema production and its performance. A profound improvement was observed in read/write query performance and schema production complexities. In this regard, DSP has significant potential to produce schemas that are capable of handling big data efficiently. View Full-Text", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["377"]}
{"title": "Data Harmonization for Heterogeneous Datasets in Big Data-A Conceptual Model\n", "abstract": " Data comes from machines, transactions, and social media, which is gigantic and disparate in nature. About 80% of today\u2019s data is unstructured, while the remaining percentage is semistructured and structured. It is a big challenge for management to make efficient decisions on run time and also to store heterogeneous nature of data by existing tools. Data Harmonization can be used to solve the heterogeneity problem; the idea of data harmonization is to provide a uniform representation and remove all forms of heterogeneity from the heterogeneous datasets. In recent studies, various models have been developed for integrating, mapping, and fusion of structured and semistructured datasets, but no such model has been developed for structured, semistructured, and unstructured datasets. Information extraction is used as a vital component to extract data from different textual datasets that information formats\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["377"]}

It has multifunction among the old folk community and recently, it is employed in biochemical for functional food and structural engineering application in biocomposite materials. In Malaysia, kenaf plant is used as a material to the process of obtaining fiber for structural application. It also has excellent medicinal value for treating diseases through biochemical processing, but its profiling is still limited in the literature. This study aimed to (i) screen the secondary metabolite compound, and (ii) investigate the potential of kenaf leaf as a new functional food. The qualitative and quantitative phytochemical screenings of leaf extracts, as per the standard protocols were performed to identify the feasibility of kenaf leaf for use as a functional food. Bioactive compounds were found in both young and old kenaf leaves. In quantitative results, TPC, flavonoid and tannin, estimation of vitamin C, and DPPH test were carried out. This kinetic study showed that old leaf contained higher bioactive compounds than the young one. Kenaf leaf has the potential to be used as promising prototypes sources of functional food, and it is rich in antioxidants and bioactive compounds which are beneficial to human health.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["377"]}

{"title": "ISO/IEC9126-based Analyzability Estimation Model for OO Software\n", "abstract": " In software metrics literature, Object-Oriented (OO) metrics have been proposed for measuring the structural attributes and qualities of Object-Oriented software (OOS) designs. This paper presents an objective model for the measurement of the analyzability of OOS design based on the ISO/IEC 9126 quality model which specifies analyzability as one of the subcharacteristics of maintainability. Unlike existing analyzability estimation models, the proposed model is objective in measurement method and can be used in the design phase of software development. The OO metrics used in the proposed model measure the OO mechanisms (encapsulation and information hiding, inheritance and polymorphism), cohesion and coupling. The proposed model can be used to facilitate the optimization of the analyzability of OOS at the High Level Designs (HLD) stage of process software development.
