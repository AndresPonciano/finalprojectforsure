{"title": "Examining the usability of touch screen gestures for children with down syndrome\n", "abstract": " The use of multi-touch devices for all types of users (from children to the elderly) has grown considerably in the recent years. However, despite the huge interest in this technology there is a lack of research addressing usability studies on children with Down\u2019s Syndrome. This article evaluates the abilities of these children (aged from 5 to 10 years) when performing a basic set of multi-touch gestures (tap, double tap, long press, drag, scale up and down, rotation) in tablet devices. The results show that regardless of their more limited motor skills, DS children are able to perform most of the evaluated multi-touch gestures with success rates close to 100% and that this technology could be fully exploited for developing applications targeted specifically at this type of user.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1268"]}

{"title": "A generic user interface for energy management in smart homes\n", "abstract": " Building operating systems play an important role in monitoring energy consumption of devices and improving energy efficiency in household buildings. From this arises a need for a preferably flexible and full-featured user interface to visualize the energy data in the building and allow residents to collect and realize various needs and preferences to the system. This article introduces a generic user interface for building operating systems which is presented from aspects of design, implementation and evaluation. To ensure the user interface can be flexibly adapted to various types of buildings, we design a series of generic data models which are independent of any building operating system. Besides, three roles with different permissions and a number of functional components of the user interface are also introduced in the article. Based on the design, a prototype of such a generic user interface named Building\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1268"]}
{"title": "Examining the usability of touch screen gestures for elderly people\n", "abstract": " This paper presents an experimental study to assess the capabilities of older adults to interact with multi-touch surfaces. The study involved 100 elderly people between 61\u201392 years old. We selected two different elderly centres in Madrid, with different characteristics in terms of income level. The \u201cGesture Games\u201d tool was used because it allows experimenting with the seven more used multi-touch gestures: Tap, Double tap, Long press, Drag, Scale up, Scale down and One-finger rotation. The analysis of the data showed that older adults have total capacity to execute these seven tasks. Some of the tasks, such as \u201cscale down\u201d and \u201cscale up\u201d were found easier for them, while other tasks, such as \u201cdouble tap\u201d were more difficult.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1268"]}

The current work initially analyzes a conceptual reference framework with fundamental definitions from CMMI. Then, based on surveys, it presents a study of the current quality situation in software development companies, determining the priority given to the quality of the technological product delivered to the end customer. Subsequently, it proposes a set of policies and procedures based on CMMI for information systems quality control at software development companies. These proposals are present-ed clearly and concisely for each of the processes covered by the Engineering Area of CMMI. Finally, a validation of the applicability of the proposal for a medium-sized, nationally-representative software development company is presented.
