Peter Naur was a major contributor to the development of Algol-60 and co-inventor of the Backus-Naur notation in which its syntax and that of many subsequent languages was described. The original ideas of object oriented programming came out of the work of Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard on Simula 67. Per Brinch Hansen did fundamental work in concurrency and operating systems and in languages for parallel programming. Bjarne Stroustrup brought object orientation to the huge community of C programmers in the C++ language.Now Lars Mathiassen, Andreas Munk-Madsen, Peter Axel Nielsen, and Jan Stage have written this excellent book on object-oriented analysis and design. It is written in a refreshingly mild style, open-minded and gentle and easy to read. The case studies are varied: two well-known example problems, automobile cruise control and IFIPS conference management, and two less familiar, the management of a hairdressing salon and a monitoring system for a rescue station that operates fire engines, ambulances and breakdown trucks.

In this paper, we present an analysis of how an IS implementation team designed and enacted a coordinated strategy of organizational influence to achieve implementation success despite these barriers.

The company has also successfully implemented significant parts of the agile methodology Scrum. We describe this case and we analyse using Soft Systems Methodology how well the development process combines these diverging sets of process requirements. We find that despite much effort the agile development process suffers from its adaptation to the FDA standard, but at the same time many of the genuine qualities of an agile process have been maintained.

{"title": "Learning SPI in practice\n", "abstract": " According to the common rhetoric of software process improvement (SPI), there are a few basic steps to improving your software development process. First, you assess your organization\u2019s current capability to develop quality software. Based on this, you derive a stepwise, focused strategy for improving this capability. You then make improvement efforts an integral part of your organization\u2019s long-term goals. The result? Both the quality of your services and the productivity of your processes increase. SPI rhetoric is certainly powerful and appealing, and it inspires many software organizations to engage in improvement initiatives. However, even though most organizations struggle to meet expectations, many of them eventually fail. Starting SPI is not difficult. You begin by assessing your current processes. Typically, enthusiasm at this point is high. Most of your colleagues will be eager to learn about the strengths and weaknesses in the way projects are organized and carried out. However, turning assessment insights into action is the point at which many organizations fail. Others manage to initiate focused improvement projects, only to find that implementing new ideas is very difficult (see Chapter 15). Even when you succeed in implementing an idea in an individual project, you are still a long way from institutionalizing improvements. In addition to the predictable challenges at each stage, you\u2019re likely to encounter other challenges. These include conflicts between SPI efforts and other traditional improvement initiatives, and the tendency for resources to grow scarce as the first wave of energy for SPI dies out.

{"title": "Approaches to appreciate information systems methodologies\n", "abstract": " A vast number of different methodologies for developing computer-based information systems are available. They form a motley spectrum in the sense that they apply to different parts of the development process and to different modes of thinking and acting. At a meta-level relative to methodologies is the discipline that deals with these differences and the applicability of methodologies in different situations. It encompasses theories, ideas and, especially, appreciation approaches, ie approaches to understand, evaluate and compare methodologies.This article is a survey of the appreciation approaches found in the literature. The survey has been conducted as a soft systems enquiry. The appreciation approaches are understood and partly evaluated by mapping them unto a soft systems model that explicate how to answer the fundamental question of: Which methodologies in which situations? It is argued that the appreciation approaches found are static and general in the sense that the fundamental question is assessed detached from a particular situation. Furthermore, it is argued on the basis of Schon's theory on reflection-in-action and Checkland's soft systems thinking that we need appreciation approaches that facilitate dynamic and situational thinking about the use of methodologies.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["1354"]}
{"title": "Model and migrating birds optimization algorithm for two-sided assembly line worker assignment and balancing problem\n", "abstract": " Worker assignment is a relatively new problem in assembly lines that typically is encountered in situations in which the workforce is heterogeneous. The optimal assignment of a heterogeneous workforce is known as the assembly line worker assignment and balancing problem (ALWABP). This problem is different from the well-known simple assembly line balancing problem concerning the task execution times, and it varies according to the assigned worker. Minimal work has been reported in worker assignment in two-sided assembly lines. This research studies worker assignment and line balancing in two-sided assembly lines with an objective of minimizing the cycle time (TALWABP). A mixed-integer programming model is developed, and CPLEX solver is used to solve the small-size problems. An improved migrating birds optimization algorithm is employed to deal with the large-size problems due to the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["1354"]}
{"title": "Integrating usability practices into agile development: A case study\n", "abstract": " Within agile software development there is a growing concern with how development organizations can integrate usability work into agile practices. The concern occurs as frustration experienced in practice by agile developers and usability designers, and it also occurs as a gap in the research literature. With this paper we report from a case study in a software company that is committed to agile development, to usability work, and to their integration. The theoretical starting point is an initial framework that has been elicited from the research literature; and the paper\u2019s contribution is an extension and modification of the initial framework based on our case study results. The resulting framework points to three enablers (attitudes, compromises, skills), three tasks (upfront design, low-fi prototyping, iterative evaluating), and three alternative modes of collaboration/work organization (parallel, embedded, fully integrated) in agile usability practices. In addition, end-user involvement may vary. The paper contributes by extending existing frameworks on integration and thus providing better explanations for practitioners and researchers of integration of usability.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["1354"]}

{"title": "Unmanned aerial vehicle routing problems: a literature review\n", "abstract": " Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) routing is transitioning from an emerging topic to a growing research area as the 3D flexible utilization of airspace, promogulated by UAVs, is a potential game changer in solving the urban air mobility challenge by allowing to reshape transportation and logistics in the future. This has revealed a need to classify different types of research and examine the general characteristics of the research area. This research aims to assist in identifying the main topics and emerging research streams and provides a published overview of the current state and contributions to the area of the UAV routing problem (UAVRP) and a general categorization of the vehicle routing problem (VRP) followed by a UAVRP classification with a graphical taxonomy based on the analysis of UAVRP current status. To achieve this, an analysis of the existing research contributions promulgated in this domain is conducted. This analysis is used to identify the current state of UAVRP and the gaps related to the UAVs\u2019 flight dynamics and weather conditions, which significantly influence the fuel consumption of the UAV when modeling the UAVRP.

The considered UAVs delivery problem aims at a trajectory planning issue addressed for UAVs operating in a hostile environment while considering battery and payload weight as well as vehicles reuse. Employed UAVs fly on a 3D plane matching a distribution network while servicing customers and ensuring collision avoidance among team members. The objective is to get a sequence of submissions that ensures delivery to customers satisfying the requested amount and demands within a given time horizon.

{"title": "A solution approach for UAV fleet mission planning in changing weather conditions\n", "abstract": " With a rising demand for utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to deliver materials in outdoor environments, particular attention must be given to all the different aspects influencing the deployment of UAVs for such purposes. These aspects include the characteristics of the UAV fleet (eg, size of fleet, UAV specifications and capabilities), the energy consumption (highly affected by weather conditions and payload) and the characteristics of the network and customer locations. All these aspects must be taken into account when aiming to achieve deliveries to customers in a safe and timely manner. However, at present, there is a lack of decision support tools and methods for mission planners that consider all these influencing aspects together. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a decomposed solution approach, which provides decision support for UAVs\u2019 fleet mission planning. The proposed approach assists flight mission planners in aerospace companies to select and evaluate different mission scenarios, for which flight-mission plans are obtained for a given fleet of UAVs, while guaranteeing delivery according to customer requirements in a given time horizon. Mission plans are analyzed from multiple perspectives including different weather conditions (wind speed and direction), payload capacities of UAVs, energy capacities of UAVs, fleet sizes, the number of customers visited by a UAV on a mission and delivery performance. The proposed decision support-driven declarative model supports the selection of the UAV mission planning scenarios subject to variations on all these configurations of the UAV system and variations in the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["1354"]}

The business case is a tool that has increased popularity in both the public and private sector to support the management of value creation with IT. However, experiences from local government reveal difficulties in developing effective IT business cases beyond simple cost savings. Based on collaborative action research with Danish municipalities we present insights on contemporary IT business case practices. Based on these insights we formulate lessons for business case practices in local government that we have incorporated into a business case method, that has subsequently been evaluated by IT managers in local government.

{"title": "Multi criteria decision making for the multi-satellite image acquisition scheduling problem\n", "abstract": " The multi-satellite image acquisition scheduling problem is traditionally seen as a complex optimization problem containing a generic objective function that represents the priority structure of the satellite operator. However, the majority of literature neglect the collective and contemporary effect of factors associated with the operational goal in the objective function, ie, uncertainty in cloud cover, customer priority, image quality criteria, etc. Consequently, the focus of the article is to integrate a real-time scoring approach of imaging attempts that considers these aspects. This is accomplished in a multi-satellite planning environment, through the utilization of the multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) models, Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality (ELECTRE-III) and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), and the formulation of a binary linear programming model. The two scoring approaches belong to different model classes of MCDM, respectively an outranking approach and a distance to ideal point approach, and they are compared with a naive approach. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the models and illustrate the importance of criteria neglected in previous studies. The results demonstrate the customized behaviour allowed by MCDM methods, especially the ELECTRE-III approach. View Full-Text", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1354"]}

We offer explanations based on system justification theory illuminating what would-be integrators might be up against. The analysis shows how the developers only pay lip service to usability work and how they treat users superficially. It further shows how that leads to stereotyping of usability designers and users in order to preserve status quo, and how internalization of inequality between the developers and usability designers rationalizes the preservation of status quo. These findings will have significant implications for managers of software development.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1354"]}

{"title": "Managerial and Organizational Assumptions in the CMMs\n", "abstract": " Software development is both an important activity for developed countries\u2019 economic progress, and a complex, problematic and occasionally spectacularly, unsuccessful one. Software projects have a reputation for being late and over budget, and the resultant software often provokes complaints from purchasers and users. The organisations that commission and eventually pay for software naturally try to seek contractual guarantees that they will get a product with which they are happy; accordingly, software firms look for ways to reliably deliver outcomes that will satisfy their customers. However, increases in the complexity of the tasks facing software developers match various contributing developments in the fields that support software development, such as programming, mathematical and algorithmic support from computer scientists, technique and automation help from software engineers, and method support from information systems specialists. An important parallel development in the practice and literature of software development has been the emergence of support for the management of the software development task in the form of software process improvement (SPI). This literature has resulted in a variety of approaches for improving the organisation and management of software projects, including the BOOTSTRAP methodology (Kuvaja and Bicego 1994, p. 195; Kuvaja et al. 1994), TAPISTRY (a software process improvement approach tailored for small enterprises)(Kuvaja et al. 1999), SPICE (Software Process Improvement and Capability dEtermination), the Industrialized Software Organisation or Japanese Software", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1354"]}
{"title": "Innovation, employment and competence development\n", "abstract": " The aim of this paper is to analyze the relation between innovation, employment and competence development empirically. In order to focus the most important elements and relations, a theoretical framework will be applied, which combines two system approaches: system of innovation and system of employment in a learning perspective. The two system approaches are both well developed (see Lundvall 1992, Edquist 2001 and Hendry 1995), but the systems are seldom combined analytically. A system of innovation is constituted by elements and relationships, which interact in the production, diffusion and use of new and economically useful knowledge (Lundvall op. cit. 1992). If we focus on the firm as center of the system of innovation, the external context of the firm are defined by institutions and organizations such as other private firms, universities, government agencies, financial institutions etc. In the same way the internal context are defined by the firm\u2019s institutions and organizational elements that are important for learning and promoting product and process innovation. This analysis will concentrate on the internal context of learning, but will also relate to the external context of the firm.The system of employment gives a framework for understanding the nature of the employment relations in the firm (Marsden 1999). The system is constituted by elements such as recruitment, competence development, training, integration and mobility and the relations between these elements. Again, it is institutions and organizations that constitute the system.

A method of calculating the virtual temperature (T v ) of the power semiconductors is laid out. Contrary to previous work, the method enables T v  characterization of the semiconductors by means of sampled data during normal operation of the converter, without the need for special calibration routines. The dynamic operation of the wind turbine and the large amount of data sampled in the CMU enables a statistical approach to generate reference data for T v  calculations. The method was tested on machine side converter diodes of the test turbine, based on samples of collector-emitter voltage (vce on ) and current (i c ). Other temperature sensitive electrical parameters may also be used as input to the method.

Intrafirm knowledge transfer of agile software practices between projects is a key concern in this redefinition. While knowledge transfer is essential for an organization to develop or keep its competitive advantage, it is also both difficult and time consuming, due to a wide range of barriers. Transferring knowledge on agile practices is even more complex due to there being a high degree of tacit knowledge. Research on knowledge of agile practices focuses on adoption of agile practices within a single team, thus extant research lacks focus on intrafirm transfer.

IT-business-cases har i forskellige former vundet indpas i kommunal, statslig og privat regi i b\u00e5de ind-og udland. I DISIMIT forskningsprojektet [1] har vi udviklet en metode til udarbejdelse af business-cases for IT-investeringer i danske kommuner. Metoden er dels udviklet p\u00e5 baggrund af diskussioner i temaet \u201cIT fra omkostning til v\u00e6rdiskabelse\u201d, hvor vi har gennemg\u00e5et business-cases fra Aalborg Kommune, Favrskov Kommune og Gentofte Kommune samt gennemg\u00e5et de forskellige tilgange herunder ogs\u00e5 hvordan KMD A/S og Ramb\u00f8ll Management Consulting A/S anvender business-cases. Metoden er dels udviklet p\u00e5 baggrund af praktisk viden og dels forskning fra ind-og udland. Den er udviklet til sm\u00e5 og mellemstore kommunale IT-investeringer.I denne metode ser vi prim\u00e6rt en business-case som et centralt dokument i realisering af gevinster. Vi ser derfor en IT-investering som noget, der tages beslutning om i starten af et projekt, men en business-case er i lige s\u00e5 h\u00f8j grad en aftale, der l\u00f8bende skal laves opf\u00f8lgning p\u00e5, og som ofte skal \u00e6ndres undervejs, n\u00e5r nogle af foruds\u00e6tningerne \u00e6ndrer sig.

{"title": "Collaborative coding of qualitative data\n", "abstract": " The purpose of this white paper is to explore how software applications can support the process in empirical research known as qualitative data analysis and in particular how these applications can support the collaborative process of coding qualitative, empirical data. This white paper explain the coding process, the collaborative coding process and then evaluates a prominent set of applications, namely NVivo, Atlas. ti, HyperResearch, Dedoose and to a lesser degree. The specific features of these applications are compared, contrasted and evaluated. It is concluded that the older tools NVivo, Atlas. ti and HyperResearch each have useful features to support individuals coding; but also that they are insufficient to support collaborative coding. Dedoose on the other hand is fully and transparently collaborative while it does not posses the many features to analyse the coding and it particularly does not easily relate codes to each other in a structure (hierarchical or network). The white paper ends with a decision structure to support the selection of an application to match a particular research set-up.

{"title": "Pneumographic imaging of potential cleavage planes within the ventricular myocardium in histology and computed tomography\n", "abstract": " We distended the relaxed porcine left ventricular myocardium by inflating the coronary arteries with compressed air, using rising pressures between 1 and 3 atmospheres. Computed tomographic analysis revealed a feathered arrangement of the myocardium aggregated together within the walls, with an overall system of spatially netted lamellar structures. Histological examination in orthogonal planes revealed the lamellas themselves to be made up of endless chains of myocytes, which show the well recognised systematic change in helical angle when traced through the thickness of the walls. The pneumatic distension had opened clefts between the lamellas, with sparse and loosely aligned fibrous tissue present within the clefts. The lamellar structure itself is continuous through the walls via a system of interlamellar connections from epicardium to endocardium, and from the ventricular base to the apex. The ventricular walls, therefore, which appear compact when sectioned without pneumatic distension, are shown by distension to be composed of a system of three-dimensionally curved and nested blades, with the individual blades taking their origin from a central circular myocardial collar, Krehls Triebwerkzeug, and then extending with opposing curvatures towards the endocardium and epicardium.\u00a9 2011 Bull.

A Case Study of Successful Information Systems Development\n", "abstract": " Research on information systems development methods has by and large acknowledged a significant difference between a method and its use and that the use depends on the situation and the developers, as well as other contingencies. We extend this research and focus in particular on the relationship between actors\u2019 competencies and their deployment of methods, arguing that this relationship is described over-simplistically and needs a better explanation. Through a case study of a successful information systems development project we identify some central situations where a variety of competencies and methods are exercised. Emphasising the intertwining of competencies and methods, we discuss the character of the intertwining process, how different actors relate to different methods, and how methods may be part of the problem rather than part of the solution to challenges in information systems development.

{"title": "The Role of improvisation in adoption of process technology in a small software firm\n", "abstract": " Software process improvement (SPI) has become an increasingly important technology for software firms struggling to stay competitive. The Capability Maturity Model (CMM)(Paulk et al. 1993) and the more recent CMM Integrated (CMMI Production Team 2000; 2002) have sparked a new discipline of engineering management that plays a dominating role in practice and research (Hansen et al. 2004). The CMMs are based on the ideal of a rational, control-centered culture for software development (Ngwenyama and Nielsen 2003), and although other SPI approaches have been suggested, they do not differ from the CMMs when it comes to underlying values (Hansen et al. 2004). While the literature offers a number of successful cases of adopting CMM (Carnegie Mellon 2005; Dion 1992; Humphrey et al. 1991; Wohlwend and Rosenbaum 1994), reports on failure and difficulties have lately increased (Hansen et al. 2004 Mathiassen et al. 2002; Rodenbach et al. 2000). Especially within small software firms, adoption of SPI technology seems problematic since these organizations lack sufficient resources to invest in improvements (Brodman and Johnson 1994; Brouse and Buys 1999; Steel 2004; Villalon et al. 2002), and SPI knowledge is not sufficiently tailored to their needs (Kilpi 1998; Saastamoinen and Tukiainen 2004).

{"title": "Software Process Improvement Using Light Knowledge Tools\n", "abstract": " Since the mid 1990\u2019s several organizations have invested heavily in off-the-shelf knowledge management systems. The considerable interest in tool support for knowledge management in organizations has led to several reports on unsuccessful implementations of such software systems. Schultze and Boland (2000) report success rates as low as 30% caused by technologists\u2019 lack of ability to understand the work practices of knowledge workers. This has also been supported by others' research (Alavi and Leidner 1999; Swan et al. 1999).In software engineering a common example is that of the experience factory (Basili et al. 1994; Basili and Green 1994; Rus and Lindvall 2002). The idea of the experience factory is to capture, explicate, and disseminate information and knowledge within the software organization. The experience factory\u2019s knowledge base is managed by a team of people in charge of collecting, storing and updating information in a database. Knowledge management is taken to be concerned with what should be stored in the database and how the data in the base should be searched (Althoff et al. 2000; Conradi and Dings\u00f8yr 2000; Lindvall et al. 2001). There is, however, a scarcity of reports on successful implementations of the experience factory. Desouza (2003) provides three reasons for this, of which the most significant is that knowledge cannot be sufficiently captured and categorized in existing knowledge management systems and a literature review shows that most research on knowledge management in software process improvement conclude how difficult it is", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1354"]}

Business cases have become popular as part of managing value creation in information systems (IS) projects. Nevertheless, business cases are often poorly communicating the rationale and justification of the value to be gained from IS investments. Against this backdrop, we investigate how an IS business case can communicate well when seen through the lens of semiotics. Semiotics is the study of how meaning is generated and interpreted through signs. In this paper, we use semiotics to analyze an IS business case on the digitization of diplomas at a Danish University. Our analysis shows that its (1) addresser and addressee should be explicitly and implicitly identifiable;(2) self-referentiality helps set the context and allow uncertainties in the message;(3) a template instigates the medium and codes for value.

The study shows that organizational factors have the strongest influence on employees\u2019 knowledge sharing followed by individual factors. The technological factors do not seem to affect employees\u2019 knowledge sharing as much as previously, but it is the influence from the combination of the individual and organizational factors, which determine whether an employee decides to adopt social media platforms for knowledge sharing.

The drug is prescribed both prophylactic and therapeutically to a large group of patients at increased risk of thromboembolism. Optimal treatment with coumarins (ie warfarin) has been reported difficult mainly due to high inter-and intraindividual variability between patients\u2019 response to the required maintenance dose. Also dietary interaction from food containing vitamin K adds to difficulties in treatment with VKA, as vitamin K has an opposing effect of warfarin. Research has shown how involvement of patients in their VKA treatment improves the quality of the treatment; this is especially the case when patients are allowed to adjust medicine intake based upon International Normalized Ratio (INR). The treatment is a balance between avoiding adverse events as hemorrhages due to over-treatment and thromboembolisms due to under-treatment. The quality of the treatment may be further increased by introducing predictive models. Such models should account for variance in INR values and be able to aid patients in optimal dosing of warfarin by keeping the INR value at therapeutic level.This PhD-project aims to develop predictive models that are able to account for inter-and intraindividual variability in patients\u2019 response to warfarin treatment. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that including dietary information on vitamin K intake will increase precision of INR predictions. A novel compartment model of vitamin K has been developed and integrated into an already described model, which is able to predict INR values based upon warfarin\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1354"]}

Many important contributions have come out of this tradition: for example, the work of B\u00f6rje Langefors on theories of information systems (1966), which contributed to the establishment of our field, and the controversial contributions of Kristen Nygaard (1971), emphasizing the political aspects and the strengths of action research approaches as integral parts of information systems studies.One of the most common misconceptions about Scandinavian IS research is captured in the notion of \u201cThe Scandinavian Approach.\u201d Research contributions from Scandinavia often have special features because they are created as part of societies with long traditions for democracy in the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1354"]}

{"title": "Biological iron and manganese removal\n", "abstract": " In 1995 Krueger built a new WTW for the Danish municipality of Esbjerg situated on Jutland's west coast. The WTW, based on biological iron and manganese removal, is claimed to be the first of its kind in Denmark. Prior to the opening of the WTW, the municipality of Esbjerg had faced a problem supplying drinking water. Unable to use groundwater because of a high iron content of up to 15mg/l, it saw no other solution than to continue boring outwards in a quest for suitable potable sources. To solve the problem, Krueger proposed to use a biological technique for removal of iron. Using this method, iron can be removed without the addition of chemicals. Chemical methods have traditionally been used in Denmark for treatment of groundwater with a high iron content. Having secured the municipality's approval, a pilot plant was built to verify that raw water was suitable for biological iron removal and to determine\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1354"]}
{"title": "Action Research into Participative IS Development,\u201d\n", "abstract": " The paper analyses the similarities and differences between action research approaches to participation in IS development. This is done using a simple framework and applying it to four representative examples of action research where participation plays a role in the outcome of the effort: ETHICS, SSM, Multiview, and CRA. It is common to assume that because of the collaborative nature of action research it follows that the research results in experiences, approaches and methodologies with a strong element of participation. The analysis shows that this assumption does not hold in general. The analysis identifies two distinctions between action research approaches to participation: The first distinction highlights whether the participative element is inherent in the research results or it has emerged through the research. The second distinction focuses on whether the purpose of the resulting approach is construction\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1354"]}

We address this theme by demonstrating and reflecting upon a systematic and inexpensive approach to surface organizational competence in initial analysis and design of an information system. The approach relies on the specific organizational competence of the actors already in the organization. Change is brought about by using soft systems and contradictions to surface the competence, knowledge, views, and ideas present in the situation at hand.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1354"]}
