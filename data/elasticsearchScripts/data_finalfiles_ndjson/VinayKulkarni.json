A data centric approach can support change management process by providing an avenue to capture, store, and manage information, activities, and knowledge relating to changes. In addition, it can provide an avenue for re-using previous (successful) change management strategies to adapt to similar changes in the future.

{"title": "Developing configurable extensible code generators for model-driven development approach.\n", "abstract": " The need for agility and adaptiveness of business applications is on the rise with continued increase in business dynamics. Codecentric techniques show unacceptable responsiveness in this dynamic context as business applications are subjected to changes along multiple dimensions that evolve independently. Use of model driven techniques for developing such business applications is argued as a preferable option as platform independent specification can be retargeted to technology platform of choice through a code generation process. Recent literature suggests the use of product line architectures to increase agility and adaptability by capturing commonality and variability, and configuring them appropriately. By visualizing a business application along five dimensions, namely, Functionality (F), Business process (P), Design decisions (D), Architecture (A) and Technology platform (T), the use of models are largely limited to F and P dimensions in commonly used model-driven development techniques and thus use of product line concept is also limited to these two dimensions. In this paper we argue the use of product line concept, ie variability and configurability, in these two dimensions is not sufficient to achieve the desired agility and adaptability. It is as well critical to use product line concept for code generators that addresses D, A and T dimensions.

Emerging programmatic and service delivery considerations, aiming to increase the effectiveness of PMTCT programs to overcome barriers faced by women in accessing PMTCT services are also discussed. Worldwide elimination of pediatric HIV is now a possibility due to the increasing similarity of PMTCT guidelines in developing countries to those in developed countries. However the resulting practical challenges of implementation will require resources and support at local, national, and international levels. As developing countries strive to adopt and implement more efficacious drug regimens, the effectiveness of PMTCT programs will be determined by coverage of services and the recruitment and retention of pregnant women in the cascade.

{"title": "Automated completeness check in KAOS\n", "abstract": " KAOS is a popular and useful goal oriented requirements engineering (GORE) language, which can be used in business requirements modelling, specification, and analysis. Currently, KAOS is being used in areas such as business process modelling, and enterprise architecture (EA). But, an incomplete or malformed KAOS model can result to incomplete and erroneous requirements analysis, which in turn can lead to overall systems failure . Therefore, it is necessary to check that a requirements specification in KAOS language are complete and well formed. The contribution at hand is to provide an automated technique for checking the completeness and well-formed-ness of a requirements specification in KAOS language. Such a technique can be useful, especially to business or requirements analysts in industries and research, to check that requirements specification in KAOS language is well formed.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["594"]}

Furthermore, current modelling languages only encourage linear thinking. By drawing upon existing research on (computational) organisation theory and multi-agent systems, we propose implementation requirements for a next generation enterprise modelling language that supports agent based simulation.

With increased dynamics that enterprises are witnessing, it is becoming progressively difficult to maintain synchrony within the enterprise for it to function effectively. Current practice is to rely on human expertise which is time-, cost-, and effort-wise expensive and also lacks in certainty.

We illustrate how this leads to the need for a modeling language engineering platform. A configurable extensible architecture for modeling language engineering platform is proposed along with an outline of its realization using the existing model processing technology infrastructure.

As a result, the tools do not reach the expected levels of adoption. This paper presents the experiences of a software services company in India in the development and deployment of new technology tools for developer productivity.

{"title": "Generating enterprise applications from models\u2013experience and best practices\n", "abstract": " Modern business systems need to cater to rapidly evolving business requirements in an ever-shrinking window of opportunity. Modern business systems also need to keep pace with rapid advances in technology. Modeldriven development approach addresses these issues by separating the technology concerns from functionality by providing a set of modeling notations for specifying different layers of a system namely user interface, application functionality and database, and a set of code generators that transform these models into platform-specific implementations. We have used this approach extensively to construct medium and large-scale enterprise applications resulting in improved productivity, better quality and platform independence. We discuss this experience and the best practices that evolved there from. Large-scale applications benefited from a centralized model repository that provided a single point of control for integration, change management and consistent generation of various code and document artifacts. They also benefited from an architecture-aware special-purpose language for specifying business logic, a set of abstractions for partitioning the models into well-defined modules organized into workspaces with a well-defined integration policy, and a model-driven testing approach for independent unit testing of client and server sides. This has resulted in improved productivity, better quality and smoother integration. Small-to-medium scale projects were predominantly Java or.

{"title": "Supporting Aspects in MDA\n", "abstract": " For developing large and complex applications, industrial practice uses a combination of nonformal notations and methods. Different notations are used to specify the properties of different aspects of an application and these specifications are transformed into their corresponding implementations through the steps of a development process. The development process relies heavily on manual verification to ensure the different pieces integrate into a consistent whole. This is an expensive and error prone process. Model-driven development approach addresses this problem by providing a set of modeling notations for specifying the different layers of a software architecture and a set of code generators for transforming the models into an implementation. Model-driven development has resulted in improved productivity, better quality and platform independence. However, it has not been very successful in supporting reuse and system evolution due to inadequate modeling support for clear separation of concerns and their composition. The model driven architecture (MDA) initiative of OMG aims to shift the focus of software development further towards modeling. With model content in system specifications increasing more and more, it is critical to address the issue of separation of concerns at model level. Aspect oriented programming addresses separation of concerns at the code level. In this paper, we argue for supporting aspects in MDA. We propose an approach wherein different aspects can be specified using different modeling notations and propose model transformations as a mechanism for weaving them.

A rapid tool wear in micromilling often deteriorates the surface quality, which could be due to the occurrence of plowing. The effects of tool condition on the transition in cutting mechanisms from shearing to plowing have not been adequately addressed in micro milling. In this work, we attempt to correlate cutting mechanism with tool conditions, so that their influence on force and surface profiles are investigated. Micro milling experiments are performed to investigate these correlations. A fluctuation parameter has been defined to quantify the fluctuation in force signal. It is evident that as the feed varies from 0.2 \u03bcm/teeth to 5 \u03bcm/teeth, the fluctuation reduces and similar fluctuations are reflected on the generated surface also.

Results: The qualitative analysis revealed only 23% correlation between face and inverted tooth form. Quantitative analysis revealed the Relative Size Ratio of face and teeth was in the range of 13 to 16 for females and 15 to 16 for males.
