{"title": "Everyone's an influencer: quantifying influence on twitter\n", "abstract": " In this paper we investigate the attributes and relative influence of 1.6 M Twitter users by tracking 74 million diffusion events that took place on the Twitter follower graph over a two month interval in 2009. Unsurprisingly, we find that the largest cascades tend to be generated by users who have been influential in the past and who have a large number of followers. We also find that URLs that were rated more interesting and/or elicited more positive feelings by workers on Mechanical Turk were more likely to spread. In spite of these intuitive results, however, we find that predictions of which particular user or URL will generate large cascades are relatively unreliable. We conclude, therefore, that word-of-mouth diffusion can only be harnessed reliably by targeting large numbers of potential influencers, thereby capturing average effects.

To do so, we exploit a recently introduced feature of Twitter known as\" lists\" to distinguish between elite users-by which we mean celebrities, bloggers, and representatives of media outlets and other formal organizations-and ordinary users. Based on this classification, we find a striking concentration of attention on Twitter, in that roughly 50% of URLs consumed are generated by just 20K elite users, where the media produces the most information, but celebrities are the most followed. We also find significant homophily within categories: celebrities listen to celebrities, while bloggers listen to bloggers etc; however, bloggers in general rebroadcast more information than the other categories.

Although considerable attitude similarity exists among friends, the results show that friends disagree more than they think they do.

Our first experiment estimates a baseline amount of dishonesty for this task in this population. The second experiment tests the hypothesis that the level of dishonesty in the population will be sensitive to the relative amount that can be gained by dishonest reporting, and the third experiment, manipulates the degree to which dishonest reporting can be detected at the individual level.

For complex tasks, however, where both the potential benefits and costs of coordinated work increase with the number of workers, neither theoretical arguments nor empirical evidence consistently favor larger vs. smaller teams. Experimental findings, meanwhile, have relied on small groups and highly stylized tasks, hence are hard to generalize to realistic settings. Here we narrow the gap between real-world task complexity and experimental control, reporting results from an online experiment in which 47 teams of size ranging from n = 1 to 32 collaborated on a realistic crisis mapping task. We find that individuals in teams exerted lower overall effort than independent workers, in part by allocating their effort to less demanding (and less productive) sub-tasks; however, we also find that individuals in teams collaborated more with increasing team size. Directly comparing these competing effects, we find that the largest teams outperformed an equivalent number of independent workers, suggesting that gains to collaboration dominated losses to effort. Importantly, these teams also performed comparably to a field deployment of crisis mappers, suggesting that experiments of the type described here can help solve practical problems as well as advancing the science of collective intelligence.", "num_citations": "99\n", "authors": ["2084"]}

The term crowdsourcing has its origin in an article by Howe (2006), who defined it as a job outsourced to an undefined group of people in the form of an open call. One of the main benefits of these platforms to behavioral researchers is that they provide access to a large set of people who are willing to do tasks\u2014including participating in research studies\u2014for relatively low pay. The crowdsourcing site with one of the largest subject pools is Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk (AMT), so it is the focus of this tutorial.Originally, Amazon built Mechanical Turk specifically for \u201chuman computation\u201d tasks. The idea behind its design was to build a platform for humans to do tasks that are very difficult or impossible for computers, such as extracting data from images, audio transcription and filtering adult content. In its essence, however, what Amazon created was a labor market for micro-tasks (Huang, Zhang, Parkes, Gajos, & Chen, 2010). Today Amazon claims hundreds of thousands of workers, and roughly ten thousand employers, with AMT serving as the meeting place and market (Pontin, 2007; Ipeirotis, 2010).

When complex problems are solved by collectives rather than individuals, this explore-exploit trade-off is complicated by the presence of communication networks, which can accelerate collective learning, but can also lead to convergence on suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we report on a series of 195 web-based experiments in which groups of 16 individuals collectively solved a complex problem and shared information through different communication networks. We found that network structure affected collective performance indirectly, via its impact on individual search strategies, as well as directly, by impacting the speed of information diffusion. We also found that networks in general suppress individual exploration, but greatly amplify the benefits of the exploration that takes place. Finally, we identified two ways in which individual and collective performance were in tension, consistent with longstanding theoretical claims.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["2084"]}

For technological innovations, the process of diffusion through imitation clearly can benefit the group (Mason, Jones & Goldstone 2008, Mason & Watts 2012). Why, then, does culture follow the same pattern?In part, this may be a result of the challenge in differentiating beneficial behaviors from idiosyncratic behaviors without costly trial and error, so it is more efficient to simply imitate everything.
