Software application cannot afford to stop its functioning in the production environment during business hours. However, it is hard to restore the software application service without identifying the root cause.

Generally there is no management staff in the business operation can tolerate the software application downtime beyond the Service Level Agreement (SLA). The time duration spent on root cause analysis activity of software application error carries crucial impact to the business transaction. This is because business operation cannot afford if the software application downtime gets prolonged. Especially an enterprise level of software application is involving multiple tiers. There will be at least one or even more log files at each tier. Of course the root cause analysis activity will easily get prolonged as more than one log file are required for analysis activity. The research is not only to mitigate the time duration prolonging on root cause analysis activity. It is also to increase the accuracy of identifying the actual root cause during analysis activity. This is a necessity to have a proposed logic model sitting at the logic tier. The logic model can analyze the required log files, and then identify the root cause without creating any interruption to the existing software application executing in the production environment. Therefore, this is the strong reason for a Prescriptive Analytical Logic Model (PAL) incorporated with Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) proposed. The proposed logic model will contribute a new knowledge in the area of log file analysis.

{"title": "The Root Cause Analysis Algorithm Design Incorporated with Analytic Hierarchy Process for Software Application Error\n", "abstract": " Software application normally comes along with its event logging feature today. However, with only the software application event log would be hard to determine the root cause if the error occurs beyond the software application boundary. In such circumstance, the time duration of conducting the root cause analysis activity will be easily prolonged. In order to identify the root cause more effectively, multiple event log files from different boundaries that are involved with software application such as Operating System, Networking, Middleware, Database Management System and etc are required. Therefore it will add additional complexity to the root cause analysis process. With such challenge, a new analysis approach is proposed. This new analysis approach is a logic model incorporated with Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). It will be sitting at the logic tier to conduct the analysis without interferes the existing software application. The objectives of the logic model is not only to mitigate the time duration prolonging on root cause analysis activity.
