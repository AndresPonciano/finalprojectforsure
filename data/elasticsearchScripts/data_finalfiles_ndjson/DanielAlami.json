{"title": "A gamified tutorial for learning about security requirements engineering\n", "abstract": " Thanks to the advent of interactive technologies, education institutions are looking for innovative teaching methods to increase the engagement and reach of students. Besides the uprise of MOOCs, gamification has been shown to produce positive results when it comes to increasing people's engagement and interest in conducting tasks. Unfortunately, the application and benefits of these technologies in teaching requirements engineering remain largely unexplored. In this paper we introduce the STS-Tooltorial, an interactive gamified platform that executes within a security requirements modeling tool and helps learners apprehend the STS-ml language and basic notions about security requirements. We present the design principles of our functional prototype: its educational content and the embedded game elements. Furthermore, we report on an early evaluation with IT professionals and postgraduate information\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["778"]}
{"title": "Experiences from the Design and Development of an Institutional Linked Open Data Portal\n", "abstract": " Linked Open Data initiative, based on the open publication of datasets, provides new mechanisms for the development of novel services, and through rigorous data analysis new indicators for government strategies. We contribute with a linked open portal to integrate curriculum data of our academic staff. We analyse our experience in the creation of the semantic model and we include some cases of data exploitation. The main contributions are a better management of curricular data, the quality and efficiency of exploitation tasks, and the transparency, dissemination and collaboration with other researchers and with the citizenship.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["778"]}
