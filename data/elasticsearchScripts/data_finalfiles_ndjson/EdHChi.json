{"title": "A taxonomy of visualization techniques using the data state reference model\n", "abstract": " In previous work, researchers have attempted to construct taxonomies of information visualization techniques by examining the data domains that are compatible with these techniques. This is useful because implementers can quickly identify various techniques that can be applied to their domain of interest. However, these taxonomies do not help the implementers understand how to apply and implement these techniques. The author extends and proposes a new way to taxonomize information visualization techniques by using the Data State Model (E.H. Chi and J.T. Reidl, 1998). In fact, as the taxonomic analysis in the paper will show, many of the techniques share similar operating steps that can easily be reused. The paper shows that the Data State Model not only helps researchers understand the space of design, but also helps implementers understand how information visualization techniques can be applied\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "813\n", "authors": ["1174"]}
{"title": "Using information scent to model user information needs and actions and the Web\n", "abstract": " On the Web, users typically forage for information by navigating from page to page along Web links. Their surfing patterns or actions are guided by their information needs. Researchers need tools to explore the complex interactions between user needs, user actions, and the structures and contents of the Web. In this paper, we describe two computational methods for understanding the relationship between user needs and user actions. First, for a particular pattern of surfing, we seek to infer the associated information need. Second, given an information need, and some pages as starting pints, we attempt to predict the expected surfing patterns. The algorithms use a concept called \u201cinformation scent\u201d, which is the subjective sense of value and cost of accessing a page based on perceptual cues. We present an empirical evaluation of these two algorithms, and show their effectiveness.", "num_citations": "617\n", "authors": ["1174"]}

In this exploratory research paper, we start from this premise and posit that all existing index structures can be replaced with other types of models, including deep-learning models, which we term\\em learned indexes. We theoretically analyze under which conditions learned indexes outperform traditional index structures and describe the main challenges in designing learned index structures. Our initial results show that our learned indexes can have significant advantages over traditional indexes.

To integrate browsing and searching smoothly into a single interface, we introduce a novel approach called ScentTrails.

This interface enables users to interpolate smoothly between searching and browsing to locate content matching complex information goals effectively.

We show that recent editing activity suggests that Wikipedia growth has slowed, and perhaps plateaued, indicating that it may have come against its limits to growth. We measure growth, population shifts, and patterns of editor and administrator activities, contrasting these against past results where possible. Both the rate of page growth and editor growth has declined. As growth has declined, there are indicators of increased coordination and overhead costs, exclusion of newcomers, and resistance to new edits.

How can we train such a classifier when data on the protected group is difficult to attain? In many settings, finding out the sensitive input attribute can be prohibitively expensive even during model training, and sometimes impossible during model serving. For example, in recommender systems, if we want to predict if a user will click on a given recommendation, we often do not know many attributes of the user, e.g., race or age, and many attributes of the content are hard to determine, e.g., the language or topic. Thus, it is not feasible to use a different classifier calibrated based on knowledge of the sensitive attribute. Here, we use an adversarial training procedure to remove information about the sensitive attribute from the latent representation learned by a neural network. In particular, we study how the choice of data for the adversarial training effects the resulting fairness properties. We find two interesting results: a small amount of data is needed to train these adversarial models, and the data distribution empirically drives the adversary's notion of fairness.", "num_citations": "238\n", "authors": ["1174"]}

Our findings reveal that for the tasks performed in our corpus, spreading activation over text is more useful than citation data. Further, fusing text and citation data via spreading activation results in the most useful recommendations. The fused spreading activation techniques outperform traditional text-based retrieval methods. Finally, we introduce a preliminary user interface for the display of recommendations from these algorithms.", "num_citations": "96\n", "authors": ["1174"]}

Therefore we ask: How can we train an ML model to improve fairness when we do not even know the protected group memberships? In this work we address this problem by proposing Adversarially Reweighted Learning (ARL). In particular, we hypothesize that non-protected features and task labels are valuable for identifying fairness issues, and can be used to co-train an adversarial reweighting approach for improving fairness.

As biologists gather more sequence data, sequence similarity algorithms are more and more useful, but take longer and longer to run. BLAST is one of the most popular sequence similarity algorithms in me today, but its running time is approximately proportional to the size of the database. Sequence similarity analysis using BLAST is becoming a bottleneck in genetic sequence analysis.

{"title": "Transfer of machine learning fairness across domains\n", "abstract": " If our models are used in new or unexpected cases, do we know if they will make fair predictions? Previously, researchers developed ways to debias a model for a single problem domain. However, this is often not how models are trained and used in practice. For example, labels and demographics (sensitive attributes) are often hard to observe, resulting in auxiliary or synthetic data to be used for training, and proxies of the sensitive attribute to be used for evaluation of fairness. A model trained for one setting may be picked up and used in many others, particularly as is common with pre-training and cloud APIs. Despite the pervasiveness of these complexities, remarkably little work in the fairness literature has theoretically examined these issues. We frame all of these settings as domain adaptation problems: how can we use what we have learned in a source domain to debias in a new target domain, without directly debiasing on the target domain as if it is a completely new problem? We offer new theoretical guarantees of improving fairness across domains, and offer a modeling approach to transfer to data-sparse target domains.

{"title": "Understanding and improving knowledge distillation\n", "abstract": " Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a model-agnostic technique to improve model quality while having a fixed capacity budget. It is a commonly used technique for model compression, where a larger capacity teacher model with better quality is used to train a more compact student model with better inference efficiency. Through distillation, one hopes to benefit from student's compactness, without sacrificing too much on model quality. Despite the large success of knowledge distillation, better understanding of how it benefits student model's training dynamics remains under-explored. In this paper, we categorize teacher's knowledge into three hierarchical levels and study its effects on knowledge distillation: (1) knowledge of the `universe', where KD brings a regularization effect through label smoothing; (2) domain knowledge, where teacher injects class relationships prior to student's logit layer geometry; and (3) instance specific knowledge, where teacher rescales student model's per-instance gradients based on its measurement on the event difficulty. Using systematic analyses and extensive empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we confirm that the aforementioned three factors play a major role in knowledge distillation. Furthermore, based on our findings, we diagnose some of the failure cases of applying KD from recent studies.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["1174"]}

By optimizing these quantities in terms of the initialization hyperparameters, we derive a novel initialization scheme that eliminates or reduces training instabilities.

{"title": "Improving uncertainty estimates through the relationship with adversarial robustness\n", "abstract": " Robustness issues arise in a variety of forms and are studied through multiple lenses in the machine learning literature. Neural networks lack adversarial robustness -- they are vulnerable to adversarial examples that through small perturbations to inputs cause incorrect predictions. Further, trust is undermined when models give miscalibrated or unstable uncertainty estimates, i.e. the predicted probability is not a good indicator of how much we should trust our model and could vary greatly over multiple independent runs. In this paper, we study the connection between adversarial robustness, predictive uncertainty (calibration) and model uncertainty (stability) on multiple classification networks and datasets. We find that the inputs for which the model is sensitive to small perturbations (are easily attacked) are more likely to have poorly calibrated and unstable predictions. Based on this insight, we examine if calibration and stability can be improved by addressing those adversarially unrobust inputs. To this end, we propose Adversarial Robustness based Adaptive Label Smoothing (AR-AdaLS) that integrates the correlations of adversarial robustness and uncertainty into training by adaptively softening labels conditioned on how easily it can be attacked by adversarial examples. We find that our method, taking the adversarial robustness of the in-distribution data into consideration, leads to better calibration and stability over the model even under distributional shifts.

Therefore, information seeking systems should focus on providing cues that might make these explorations more efficient. One possible solution is in building information seeking systems in which navigation signposts are provided by social cues provided by a large number of other people. One possible source for social cues is all of the social bookmarks on social tagging sites. Social tagging arose out of the need to organize found information that is worth revisiting. The collective behavior of users who tagged contents seems to offer a good basis for exploratory search interfaces, even for users who are not using social bookmarking sites. In this paper, we present the algorithm of a tag-based exploratory system based on this idea.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1174"]}

Contrary to recent findings, we found that video watch time is correlated with the positive sentiment expressed in the comments of YouTube videos. More precisely, videos with more positive sentiment on average in the comments are more likely to be watched longer, while videos with negative comment sentiment on average are more likely to have shorter watch durations. These results suggest that users prefer videos that evoke positive emotional responses.

{"title": "A Machine Learning Approach to Databases Indexes\n", "abstract": " Databases rely on indexing data structures to efficiently perform many of their core operations. In order to look up all records in a particular range of keys, databases use a BTree-Index. In order to look up the record for a single key, databases use a Hash-Index. In order to check if a key exists, databases use a BitMap-Index (a bloom filter). These data structures have been studied and improved for decades, carefully tuned to best utilize each CPU cycle and cache available. However, they do not focus on leveraging the distribution of data they are indexing. In this paper, we demonstrate that these critical data structures are merely models, and can be replaced with more flexible, faster, and smaller machine learned neural networks. Further, we demonstrate how machine learned indexes can be combined with classic data structures to provide the guarantees expected of database indexes. Our initial results show, that we are able to outperform B-Trees by up to 44% in speed while saving over 2/3 of the memory. More importantly though, we believe that the idea of replacing core components of a data management system through learned models has far reaching implications for future systems designs. 2", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1174"]}

The (positive) user feedback available to train such agents is extremely scarce in retrospect. Improving the sample efficiency of RL algorithms is thus of paramount importance when developing RL agents for recommender systems.

How much of a user's experience over time with a recommender is caused by the recommender system's choices and biases, and how much is based on the user's preferences and biases? Popularity bias and filter bubbles are two of the most well-studied recommender system biases, but most of the prior research has focused on understanding the system behavior in a single recommendation step. How do these biases interplay with user behavior, and what types of user experiences are created from repeated interactions? In this work, we offer a simulation framework for measuring the impact of a recommender system under different types of user behavior. Using this simulation framework, we can (a) isolate the effect of the recommender system from the user preferences, and (b) examine how the system performs not just on average for an \"average user\" but also the extreme experiences under atypical user behavior. As part of the simulation framework, we propose a set of evaluation metrics over the simulations to understand the recommender system's behavior. Finally, we present two empirical case studies -- one on traditional collaborative filtering in MovieLens and one on a large-scale production recommender system -- to understand how popularity bias manifests over time.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1174"]}

Real-world recommender systems are often composed of multiple models, built by multiple teams. However, most research on fairness focuses on improving fairness in a single model. Further, recent research on classification fairness has shown that combining multiple \"fair\" classifiers can still result in an \"unfair\" classification system. This presents a significant challenge: how do we understand and improve fairness in recommender systems composed of multiple components? In this paper, we study the compositionality of recommender fairness. We consider two recently proposed fairness ranking metrics: equality of exposure and pairwise ranking accuracy. While we show that fairness in recommendation is not guaranteed to compose, we provide theory for a set of conditions under which fairness of individual models does compose. We then present an analytical framework for both understanding whether a real system's signals can achieve compositional fairness, and improving which component would have the greatest impact on the fairness of the overall system.

{"title": "Understanding and Improving Fairness-Accuracy Trade-offs in Multi-Task Learning\n", "abstract": " As multi-task models gain popularity in a wider range of machine learning applications, it is becoming increasingly important for practitioners to understand the fairness implications associated with those models. Most existing fairness literature focuses on learning a single task more fairly, while how ML fairness interacts with multiple tasks in the joint learning setting is largely under-explored. In this paper, we are concerned with how group fairness (e.g., equal opportunity, equalized odds) as an ML fairness concept plays out in the multi-task scenario. In multi-task learning, several tasks are learned jointly to exploit task correlations for a more efficient inductive transfer. This presents a multi-dimensional Pareto frontier on (1) the trade-off between group fairness and accuracy with respect to each task, as well as (2) the trade-offs across multiple tasks. We aim to provide a deeper understanding on how group fairness interacts with accuracy in multi-task learning, and we show that traditional approaches that mainly focus on optimizing the Pareto frontier of multi-task accuracy might not perform well on fairness goals. We propose a new set of metrics to better capture the multi-dimensional Pareto frontier of fairness-accuracy trade-offs uniquely presented in a multi-task learning setting. We further propose a Multi-Task-Aware Fairness (MTA-F) approach to improve fairness in multi-task learning.

{"title": "Measuring Model Fairness under Noisy Covariates: A Theoretical Perspective\n", "abstract": " In this work we study the problem of measuring the fairness of a machine learning model under noisy information. Focusing on group fairness metrics, we investigate the particular but common situation when the evaluation requires controlling for the confounding effect of covariate variables. In a practical setting, we might not be able to jointly observe the covariate and group information, and a standard workaround is to then use proxies for one or more of these variables. Prior works have demonstrated the challenges with using a proxy for sensitive attributes, and strong independence assumptions are needed to provide guarantees on the accuracy of the noisy estimates. In contrast, in this work we study using a proxy for the covariate variable and present a theoretical analysis that aims to characterize weaker conditions under which accurate fairness evaluation is possible. Furthermore, our theory identifies potential sources of errors and decouples them into two interpretable parts  and . The first part  depends solely on the performance of the proxy such as precision and recall, whereas the second part  captures correlations between all the variables of interest. We show that in many scenarios the error in the estimates is dominated by  via a linear dependence, whereas the dependence on the correlations  only constitutes a lower order term. As a result we expand the understanding of scenarios where measuring model fairness via proxies can be an effective approach.

Further, trust is undermined when models give miscalibrated uncertainty estimates, ie the predicted probability is not a good indicator of how much we should trust our model. In this paper, we study the connection between adversarial robustness and calibration on four classification networks and datasets. We find that the inputs for which the model is sensitive to small perturbations (are easily attacked) are more likely to have poorly calibrated predictions. Based on this insight, we examine if calibration can be improved by addressing those adversarially unrobust inputs. To this end, we propose Adversarial Robustness based Adaptive Label Smoothing (AR-AdaLS) that integrates the correlations of adversarial robustness and uncertainty into training by adaptively softening labels for an example based on how easily it can be attacked by an adversary. We find that our method, taking the adversarial robustness of the in-distribution data into consideration, leads to better calibration over the model even under distributional shifts. In addition, AR-AdaLS can also be applied to an ensemble model to further improve model's calibration.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1174"]}
{"title": "End-to-End Deep Attentive Personalized Item Retrieval for Online Content-sharing Platforms\n", "abstract": " Modern online content-sharing platforms host billions of items like music, videos, and products uploaded by various providers for users to discover items of their interests. To satisfy the information needs, the task of effective item retrieval (or item search ranking) given user search queries has become one of the most fundamental problems to online content-sharing platforms. Moreover, the same query can represent different search intents for different users, so personalization is also essential for providing more satisfactory search results. Different from other similar research tasks, such as ad-hoc retrieval and product retrieval with copious words and reviews, items in content-sharing platforms usually lack sufficient descriptive information and related meta-data as features. In this paper, we propose the end-to-end deep attentive model (EDAM) to deal with personalized item retrieval for online content-sharing platforms\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1174"]}
{"title": "Data Efficient Training for Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive Behavior Policy Sharing\n", "abstract": " Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is proven powerful for decision making in simulated environments. However, training deep RL model is challenging in real world applications such as production-scale health-care or recommender systems because of the expensiveness of interaction and limitation of budget at deployment. One aspect of the data inefficiency comes from the expensive hyper-parameter tuning when optimizing deep neural networks. We propose Adaptive Behavior Policy Sharing (ABPS), a data-efficient training algorithm that allows sharing of experience collected by behavior policy that is adaptively selected from a pool of agents trained with an ensemble of hyper-parameters. We further extend ABPS to evolve hyper-parameters during training by hybridizing ABPS with an adapted version of Population Based Training (ABPS-PBT). We conduct experiments with multiple Atari games with up to 16 hyper-parameter/architecture setups. ABPS achieves superior overall performance, reduced variance on top 25% agents, and equivalent performance on the best agent compared to conventional hyper-parameter tuning with independent training, even though ABPS only requires the same number of environmental interactions as training a single agent. We also show that ABPS-PBT further improves the convergence speed and reduces the variance.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1174"]}
{"title": "BRPO: Batch Residual Policy Optimization\n", "abstract": " In batch reinforcement learning (RL), one often constrains a learned policy to be close to the behavior (data-generating) policy, e.g., by constraining the learned action distribution to differ from the behavior policy by some maximum degree that is the same at each state. This can cause batch RL to be overly conservative, unable to exploit large policy changes at frequently-visited, high-confidence states without risking poor performance at sparsely-visited states. To remedy this, we propose residual policies, where the allowable deviation of the learned policy is state-action-dependent. We derive a new for RL method, BRPO, which learns both the policy and allowable deviation that jointly maximize a lower bound on policy performance. We show that BRPO achieves the state-of-the-art performance in a number of tasks.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1174"]}
{"title": "Building healthy recommendation sequences for everyone: A safe reinforcement learning approach\n", "abstract": " A key consideration in the design of recommender systems is the long term well-being of users. In this work, we formalize this challenge as a multi-objective safe reinforcement learning problem, balancing positive user feedback and the \u201chealthiness\u201d of user trajectories. We note that in some cases, naively balancing these objectives can lead to unhealthy experiences, even if unlikely, still occurring in a small subset of users. Therefore, we examine a distributional notion of recommendation safety. We propose a reinforcement learning approach that optimizes for positive feedback from users while simultaneously optimizing for the health of worst-case users to remain high. To empirically validate our method, we develop a research simulation environment motivated by a MovieLens recommendation setting that considers exposure to violence as a proxy for unhealthy recommendations. We demonstrate that our method reduces unhealthy recommendations to the most vulnerable users without sacrificing much user satisfaction.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1174"]}
{"title": "The Dynamics of Signal Propagation in Gated Recurrent Neural Networks\n", "abstract": " Training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on long sequence tasks is plagued with difficulties arising from the exponential explosion or vanishing of signals as they propagate forward or backward through the network. Many techniques have been proposed to ameliorate these issues, including various algorithmic and architectural modifications. Two of the most successful RNN architectures, the LSTM and the GRU, do exhibit modest improvements over vanilla RNN cells, but they still suffer from instabilities when trained on very long sequences. In this work, we develop a mean field theory of signal propagation in LSTMs and GRUs that enables us to calculate the time scales for signal propagation as well as the spectral properties of the state-to-state Jacobians. By optimizing these quantities in terms of the initialization hyperparameters, we derive a novel initialization scheme that eliminates or reduces training instabilities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our initialization scheme on multiple sequence tasks, on which it enables successful training while a standard initialization either fails completely or is orders of magnitude slower. We also observe a beneficial effect on generalization performance using this new initialization.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1174"]}

{"title": "A comparison of generated Wikipedia profiles using social labeling and automatic keyword extraction\n", "abstract": " In many collaborative systems, researchers are interested in creating representative user profiles. In this paper, we are particularly interested in using social labeling and automatic keyword extraction techniques for generating user profiles. Social labeling is a process in which users manually tag other users with keywords. Automatic keyword extraction is a technique that selects the most salient words to represent a user\u2019s contribution. We apply each of these two profile generation methods to highly active Wikipedia editors and their contributions, and compare the results. We found that profiles generated through social labeling matches the profiles generated via automatic keyword extraction, and vice versa. The results suggest that user profiles generated from one method can be used as a seed or bootstrapping proxy for the other method.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1174"]}
{"title": "Designing for learning communities in a large enterprise\n", "abstract": " This position paper presents the research efforts and results of two case studies conducted during the ongoing deployment of online learning communities in a large IT services enterprise. We first provide an overview of the research project and the communities launched, and then present the two case studies. The preliminary findings led to the identification of two problem areas where web-based Collective Intelligence tools can give support:(1) lowering the cost of sharing;(2) lowering the fragmentation of information across multiple information channels. The last part of the paper summarizes two ongoing technological interventions aimed at allowing these professionals to share at a lower cost and manage information across channels. Our findings suggest that new tools can more effectively promote participation and new intelligence at the level of larger learning communities by addressing needs at the lower levels of individuals and task forces.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1174"]}

{"title": "Learned Index Structures\n", "abstract": " Indexes are models: a BTree-Index can be seen as a model to map a key to the position of a record within a sorted array, a Hash-Index as a model to map a key to a position of a record within an unsorted array, and a BitMap-Index as a model to indicate if a data record exists or not. In this talk, we start from this premise and posit that all existing index structures can be replaced with other types of models, including deeplearning models, which we term learned indexes. The key idea is that a model can learn the sort order or structure of lookup keys and use this signal to effectively predict the position or existence of records. Our initial results show, that by using simple neural nets we are able to outperform cache-optimized B-Trees by up to 70% in speed while saving an order-of-magnitude in memory over several real-world data sets. More importantly though, we believe that the idea of replacing core components of a (data management) system through learned models might have significant implications for future systems designs.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1174"]}
{"title": "Mail2Wiki: Low-cost sharing and organization on wikis\n", "abstract": " Sharing and organizing content using corporate wikis remains prohibitively costly for most knowledge workers in organizations. This problem has led to low adoption rates, compromising the utility of such tools. To reduce these costs and increase the benefits we introduce two proof-ofconcept prototypes. We characterize the lifecycle of production and consumption of shared knowledge in a community of professionals that use wikis as CIorg tools. That is, we analyze breakdowns or gaps in the current lifecycle, identify interventions that can improve it, and specify requirements for different roles involved in it. Then, we illustrate the design of the two prototypes that support users in feeding information into wikis and curating this information for better exploitation. First, we present an email plugin that allows knowledge workers to easily feed new content into their wiki sites directly from the email client (see workshop theme \u201cFeeding CIorg\u201d). Second, we present a MediaWiki plugin that allows wiki curators to update and organize the content shared on the wikis via a combination of machine-based functions and human input on interactive visualizations (see workshop theme \u201cExploiting CIorg\u201d). The two prototypes were motivated by the same vision and were developed using an iterative and participatory design approach (see workshop theme \u201cDesign Methods\u201d).", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1174"]}
