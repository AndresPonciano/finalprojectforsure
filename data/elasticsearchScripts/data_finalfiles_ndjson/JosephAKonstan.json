Information filtering (IF) focuses on the analysis of item content and the development of a personal user interest profile. Collaborative filtering (CF) focuses on identification of other users with similar tastes and the use of their opinions to recommend items. Each technique has advantages and limitations that suggest that the two could be beneficially combined.This paper shows that a CF framework can be used to combine personal IF agents and the opinions of a community of users to produce better recommendations than either agents or users can produce alone. It also shows that using CF to create a personal combination of a set of agents produces better results than either individual agents or other combination mechanisms. One key implication of these results is that users can avoid having to select among agents; they can use them all and let the CF framework select the best ones for them.", "num_citations": "1314\n", "authors": ["1159"]}
{"title": "Collaborative filtering recommender systems\n", "abstract": " Recommender systems are an important part of the information and e-commerce ecosystem. They represent a powerful method for enabling users to filter through large information and product spaces. Nearly two decades of research on collaborative filtering have led to a varied set of algorithms and a rich collection of tools for evaluating their performance. Research in the field is moving in the direction of a richer understanding of how recommender technology may be embedded in specific domains. The differing personalities exhibited by different recommender algorithms show that recommendation is not a one-size-fits-all problem. Specific tasks, information needs, and item domains represent unique problems for recommenders, and design and evaluation of recommenders needs to be done based on the user tasks to be supported. Effective deployments must begin with careful analysis of prospective users and their goals. Based on this analysis, system designers have a host of options for the choice of algorithm and for its embedding in the surrounding user experience. Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems provides a broad overview of the current state of collaborative filtering research. It discusses the core algorithms for collaborative filtering and traditional means of measuring their performance against user rating data sets.

{"title": "Letting users choose recommender algorithms: An experimental study\n", "abstract": " Recommender systems are not one-size-fits-all; different algorithms and data sources have different strengths, making them a better or worse fit for different users and use cases. As one way of taking advantage of the relative merits of different algorithms, we gave users the ability to change the algorithm providing their movie recommendations and studied how they make use of this power. We conducted our study with the launch of a new version of the MovieLens movie recommender that supports multiple recommender algorithms and allows users to choose the algorithm they want to provide their recommendations. We examine log data from user interactions with this new feature to under-stand whether and how users switch among recommender algorithms, and select a final algorithm to use. We also look at the properties of the algorithms as they were experienced by users and examine their relationships to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "91\n", "authors": ["1159"]}
{"title": "Rating-based collaborative filtering: algorithms and evaluation\n", "abstract": " Recommender systems help users find information by recommending content that a user might not know about, but will hopefully like. Rating-based collaborative filtering recommender systems do this by finding patterns that are consistent across the ratings of other users. These patterns can be used on their own, or in conjunction with other forms of social information access to identify and recommend content that a user might like. This chapter reviews the concepts, algorithms, and means of evaluation that are at the core of collaborative filtering research and practice. While there are many recommendation algorithms, the ones we cover serve as the basis for much of past and present algorithm development. After presenting these algorithms we present examples of two more recent directions in recommendation algorithms: learning-to-rank and ensemble recommendation algorithms.

Recommender systems on wireless mobile devices may have the same impact on the way people shop in stores. There are several important challenges that interface designers must overcome on mobile devices: Providing sufficient value to attract prospective wireless users, handling occasionally connected devices, privacy and security, and surmounting the physical limitations of the devices. We present our experience with the implementation of a wireless movie recommender system on a cellphone browser, an AvantGo channel, a wireless PDA, and a voice-only phone interface. These interfaces help MovieLens users select movies to rent, buy, or see while away from their computer.

{"title": "Evaluating recommender behavior for new users\n", "abstract": " The new user experience is one of the important problems in recommender systems. Past work on recommending for new users has focused on the process of gathering information from the user. Our work focuses on how different algorithms behave for new users. We describe a methodology that we use to compare representatives of three common families of algorithms along eleven different metrics. We find that for the first few ratings a baseline algorithm performs better than three common collaborative filtering algorithms. Once we have a few ratings, we find that Funk's SVD algorithm has the best overall performance. We also find that ItemItem, a very commonly deployed algorithm, performs very poorly for new users. Our results can inform the design of interfaces and algorithms for new users.", "num_citations": "70\n", "authors": ["1159"]}

Prior work in the field has adopted informal taxonomies of question types as a mechanism for interpreting user behavior and community outcomes. In this work, we contribute a formal taxonomy of question types to deepen our understanding of the nature and intent of questions that are asked online. Our taxonomy is grounded in Aristotelian rhetorical theory, and complemented by contributions of leading twentieth century rhetorical theorists. This taxonomy offers a way to differentiate between similar-sounding questions, while remaining flexible enough to encompass the wide range of questions asked online. To ground the taxonomy in reality, we code questions drawn from three popular social Q&A sites, and report on the distributions of several objective and subjective measures.", "num_citations": "68\n", "authors": ["1159"]}

Motivated by these positive results, we propose a design space framework and its associated algorithms to support both global and contextual recommendations. To evaluate the algorithms, we developed the CommunityCommands plug-in for AutoCAD.

According to the most common definition, serendipity consists of three components: relevance, novelty and unexpectedness, where each component has multiple variations. In this paper, we looked at eight different definitions of serendipity and asked users how they perceived them in the context of movie recommendations. We surveyed 475 users of the movie recommender system, MovieLens regarding 2146 movies in total and compared those definitions of serendipity based on user responses. We found that most kinds of serendipity and all the variations of serendipity components broaden user preferences, but one variation of unexpectedness\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "53\n", "authors": ["1159"]}

Such systems have become increasingly popular in entertainment and e-commerce domains, but have thus far had little success in information-seeking domains such as identifying published research of interest. We report on several recent publications that show how recommenders can be extended to more effectively address informationseeking tasks by expanding the focus from accurate prediction of user preferences to identifying a useful set of items to recommend in response to the user's specific information need. Specific research demonstrates the value of diversity in recommendation lists, shows how users value lists of recommendations as something different from the sum of the individual recommendations within, and presents an analytic model for customizing a recommender to match user information-seeking needs.", "num_citations": "52\n", "authors": ["1159"]}

{"title": "User choices and regret: Understanding users\u2019 decision process about consensually acquired spyware\n", "abstract": " Spyware is software which monitors user actions, gathers personal data, and/or displays advertisements to users. While some spyware is installed surreptitiously, a surprising amount is installed on users\u2019 computers with their active participation. In some cases, users agree to accept spyware as part of a software bundle as a cost associated with gaining functionality they desire. In many other cases, however, users are unaware that they installed spyware, or of the consequences of that installation. This lack of awareness occurs even when the functioning of the spyware is explicitly declared in the end user license agreement (EULA). We argue and demonstrate that poor interface design contributes to the difficulty end users experience when trying to manage their computing environment. This paper reviews the legal, technical, and design issues related to the installation of spyware bundled with other software. It reports on results of an experiment in which thirty-one users were asked to configure computers, deciding which software to install from a set of software that included disclosed spyware. The results suggest that current EULA interfaces do little to encourage informed decision-making and that simpler interfaces with key terms highlighted have potential to improve informed decision-making.", "num_citations": "46\n", "authors": ["1159"]}

Human consent in online studies appears more relative, continuous, inherent, tenuous, and diverse than in offline studies.

{"title": "Supporting multimedia designers: Towards more effective design tools\n", "abstract": " Current multimedia tools have fallen short of meeting the unique needs of a multimedia designer, presumably due to a misunderstanding of what those unique needs actually are. To better understand a designer\u2019s needs and practices, we interviewed (12) and surveyed (13) professional multimedia designers. From this study, we report on the process of multimedia design, design artifacts produced in that process, and tools used to produce those design artifacts. An important finding of our study is that a multimedia designer struggles to explore and communicate behavioral design ideas early in the design process. To address that need, we have developed an interactive multimedia storyboard tool called DEMAIS, which operationalizes a designer\u2019s ink strokes and textual annotations, producing a working example early in the design process. Using a working example, a designer can directly experience a behavioral design idea, facilitating the rapid exploration and effective communication of that behavioral idea.", "num_citations": "43\n", "authors": ["1159"]}

Our technique is able to leverage a small amount of eye tracking data to infer gaze patterns for other users. We evaluate our prediction models in MovieLens--an online movie recommender system.

As a result, techniques for notifying users of new or updated information must do so in a manner that is both timely and non-intrusive to their current task. In this paper we propose a new awareness technique, called Adjusting Windows, suitable for informing users of updated information on real-time information sites. The technique has been fully implemented within a new web browser application. We conducted a small user study in order to compare Adjusting Windows against two other awareness techniques in terms of awareness time, awareness strategy, and overall preference.

This finding is robust to different measures of longevity (aggregate number of sessions and attritions after sessions 1, 5, and 10). The immediate implication is an effective classifier for identifying users with higher (or lower) expected longevity from the first-session activity.

Unfortunately, most device interfaces are designed for interactive human control rather than programmed control.

{"title": "Authoring interactive media\n", "abstract": " Multimedia presentations utilize content derived from a variety of information sources in order to convey a message to a viewer. Examples of multimedia content include recorded and synthesized audio, video, still images, bitmap and vector graphics, animations, and text. Although a message could be conveyed through any one of these media, combining them into a synchronized, coherent presentation creates a more appealing, compelling, and entertaining display. For example, watching an entertaining television commercial, which creatively uses synchronized audio, video, and special effects, creates a more compelling presentation than a print advertisement or radio commercial. A well-designed multimedia presentation continually makes use of the viewer\u2019s auditory and visual senses through dynamically changing displays, and as a result, offers a more interesting and effective medium for conveying information (19, 20, 33).The difference between a non-interactive and interactive multimedia presentation involves the participatory role of the viewer. In a non-interactive presentation, the role of the viewer is that of a passive observer. The viewer is external to the display of information and is forced to experience it from the beginning to the end; eg, a television viewer can neither skip to the end of a show to see how it ends, nor influence the way it ends. In an interactive presentation, the role of the viewer is transformed from a passive observer to an active participant enabling a unique, individual experience. To create this unique experience, an interactive presentation may allow the viewer to actively navigate among its content, periodically\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1159"]}
{"title": "Applying knowledge from KDD to recommender systems\n", "abstract": " We investigate a new class of software for knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), called recommender systems.  Recommender systems aply KDD-like techniques to the problem of making product recommendations during a live customer interaction.  These systems are achieving widespread success in E-Commerce today.  We extend previously studied KDD models to incorporate customer interaction so these models can be used to describe both traditional KDD and recommender systems.  Recommender systems face three key challenges: producing high quality recommendations, performing many recommendations per second for millions of cusotmers and products, and achieving high coverage in the face of data sparsity.  One successful recommender system technology is collaborative filtering, which works by matching customer preferences to other customers in making recommendations. Collaborative filtering has been shown to produce high quality recommendations, but the performance degrades with the number of customers and products.  New recommender system technologies are needed that can quickly produce high quality recommendations, even for very large-scale probelms.  For example, traditional KDD techniques might be applied in the context of our model to address these challenges.  We have explored one technology called Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce the dimensionality of recommender system problems.  We report an experiment where we use SVD on a recommender system database, and use the relationship between customers in the reduced factor space to generate predictions for products\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1159"]}

One crucial unsolved problem for recommender systems is how best to learn about a new user. In this paper we study six techniques that collaborative filtering recommender systems can use to learn about new users. These techniques select a sequence of items for the collaborative filtering system to present to each new user for rating. The techniques include the use of information theory to select the items that will give the most value to the recommender system, aggregate statistics to select the items the user is most likely to have an opinion about, balanced techniques that seek to maximize the expected number of bits learned per presented item, and personalized techniques that predict which items a user will have an opinion about. We study the techniques thru offline experiments with a large pre-existing user data set, and thru a live experiment with over 300 users. We show that the choice of learning technique significantly affects the user experience, in both the user effort and the accuracy of the resulting predictions.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1159"]}

These notations ap-pear in research papers, books, lecture notes, blog posts, and software documentation. The dis-ciplinary diversity of the field has not contributed to consistency in notation; scholars whose home base is in information retrieval have different habits and expectations than those in ma-chine learning or human-computer interaction. In the course of years of teaching and research on recommender systems, we have seen the val-ue in adopting a consistent notation across our work. This has been particularly highlighted in our development of the Recommender Systems MOOC on Coursera (Konstan et al. 2015), as we need to explain a wide variety of algorithms and our learners are not well-served by changing notation between algorithms. In this paper, we describe the notation we have adopted in our work, along with its justification and some discussion of considered alternatives. We present this in hope that it will be useful to others writing and teaching about recommender systems. This notation has served us well for some time now, in research, online education, and traditional classroom instruction.

We recruited subjects by individual e-mails to the users of RefWorks-a web-based personal reference management tool installed for use at the University of Minnesota. To participate, subjects needed to give their consent and share their references with us. 96 subjects participated, majority (65) of who were graduate students, resulting into 30,336 references. Based on the type of the reference, these were stratified into one of the three valid identifying IDs-DOI, ISBN, or URL. Multiple reference resolvers (CrossRef, WorldCat) were used to enhance the overall resolvability of these collections.Analysis. Descriptive statistics and simple graphics analysis were used to describe the dataset. Results. Over 90% of the total references in users' personal collections could possibly have a valid ID (DOI, ISBN, URL), and therefore, are potentially resolvable. However, only about 17% of the references in these collections had a valid ID, and fewer than 11% actually resolved successfully. Using a combination of reference resolvers, the total resolvability of the references in these collections was enhanced from under 11% to over 41%. Conclusions.

A variety of interfaces have emerged for entity-linking at popular online sites; such interfaces vary in the way that entity linking is initiated (in-band or out-of-band with respect to the message creation), the timing of entity resolution (interrupting or deferred), and the method of resolving the entity (auto-completion or search). Four interfaces mimicking popular entity linking websites were developed and tested. Results showed that out-of-band initiation (eg, a link button) was faster to learn, but that in-band initiation performance improved with familiarity.
