{"title": "New nonlinear optical processes in liquid crystals\n", "abstract": " We have worked out some consequences of the optical nonlinearities due to laser induced changes in the order parameter of a liquid crystal. The change in the order parameter can be affected by laser induced suppression of the director fluctuations in liquid crystals and or changes in the tilt angle of smectic liquid crystals. Both the processes lead to well known nonlinear optical effects like self-focusing, self-divergence, self-phase modulation, wave mixing, and so on. In addition, we predict some new phenomena like self-iridescence and new types of optical spatial solitons. In the case of chiral liquid crystals in the short wavelength limit the laser beam induces a change in the twist and at the long wavelength edge of the Bragg band it leads to temporal oscillations in the twist and the transmitted intensity. In smectic liquid crystals interesting periodic structures in a standing laser wave are to be expected.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["2210"]}

Customer Realtionship Management (CRM) has become a leading business strategy in highly competitive business environments. Clustering customers provides an in-depth understanding of their behavior. Clustering is one of the most important and useful technologies in data mining methods. Clustering is to group objects together, which is based on the difference of similarity on each object, and making highly homogeneity in the same cluster, or highly heterogeneity between each group. The scope of this paper to understand and predict the behavior of customers with behaviour segmentation methodology. The result of the study can support customer development by offering the right products to right customers and better targeting of product promotion campaigns. The policy holders claim dataset of health insurance company is taken for analysis. This behaviour segmentation methodology with clustering is applied in this chapter to predict distinct customer segments facilitating the development of customized new products and new offerings which better address the specific priorities and preferences of the customers. Apriori association rule performed on clusters of claim dataset gives the association among attributes in the claims dataset is derived from Clustering Based Association Rule Mining (CBARM) model.

E-learners can experience the best learning when the web based material provides interactive communication; and information presented in a different ways with the control over learning. Knowledge about a user inferred from user interactions with the Elearning systems is used to adapt offered learning resources and guide a learner through them. Reasoning on the knowledge can be applied to adapt access, presentation, and navigation in the information resources. Semantic web technologies allow to link information of learning objects thus moving from document centric idea of current web to more fine grained semantic structures. The study is made on the derived Instructional Design Template for further incorporation with the SCORM model which has shifted the course delivery from simple presentation to learning objects.

{"title": "Nematic kink states in a laser field\n", "abstract": " We have investigated the nonlinear optical interaction of uniform and kink states of a nematic and a ferrofluid-doped nematic (ferronematic) liquid crystal with an incident laser field. We find that the transition between the permitted uniform oreintational states of these systems is of first order in the case of nematics, and of second order in the case of ferronematics. In the latter case we also find the phenomenon of reentrance. We find new kink states in a magnetic field with topological winding different from \u03c0 in the case of nematics, and 2 \u03c0 in the case of ferronematics. In ferronematics, due to grain segregation the phase diagrams for uniform and kink states are entirely different. In these systems we find a first or second order structural transformation from a single kink into a pair of kinks. Further, we obtain a rich variety of kink states as the intensity of the laser field is varied.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["2210"]}

{"title": "Adaptive Color Filter Array Interpolation Algorithm based on hue transition and edge direction\n", "abstract": " Most of the digital cameras used now has single sensor with an array of color filters to capture the digital images. Color Filter Array (CFA) uses alternating color filters to sample only one color of a pixel location to reduce the price. In the entire image, only one third of sampled pixels have genuine values from the sensors. Remaining pixels are interpolated from these genuine values. In this work, a new adaptive CFA interpolation model is proposed. Pixels are divided into edge pixels and non-edge pixels. If the pixel is not in an edge, then smooth hue transition interpolation is used. For the pixels in the edge, Edge sensing interpolation algorithm is used. A mathematical model is proposed for interpolation based on the direction of the edges. Two sample images are taken and reconstructed by methods such as hue transition interpolation, edge sensing interpolation and combined approach.

{"title": "A genetic programming approach for record deduplication\n", "abstract": " In this article we are going to discuss about how genetic programming can be used for record deduplication. Several systems that rely on the integrity of the data in order to offer high quality services, such as digital libraries and ecommerce brokers, may be affected by the existence of duplicates, quasi-replicas, or near-duplicates entries in their repositories. Because of that, there has been a huge effort from private and government organizations in developing effective methods for removing replicas from large data repositories. This is due to the fact that cleaned, replica-free repositories not only allow the retrieval of higher-quality information but also lead to a more concise data representation and to potential savings in computational time and resources to process this data. In this work, we extend the results of a GP-based approach we proposed to record deduplication by performing a comprehensive set of experiments regarding its parameterization setup. Our experiments show that some parameter choices can improve the results to up 30%. Thus, the obtained results can be used as guidelines to suggest the most effective way to set up the parameters of our GP-based approach to record deduplication.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["2210"]}

Since the messages arrive continuously, it is essential that the query processing rate matches the data arrival rate. Therefore, it is necessary to index the given set of query expressions appropriately to enable real-time processing of the streaming XML data. In this paper we propose a simple and scalable system for the XML stream querying problem. The system indexes the queries compactly using a query guide and uses simple integer stacks to efficiently process the stream. Our experiments demonstrate that the new system outperforms the classical stream query processor YFilter by sizeable margins without asking for more index space.

In customers identification data mining has been used extensively to predict potential customers for a product and service. Modern companies and organizations efficiently implement a CRM strategy for managing a company interactions and relationships with customers. CRM systems have been developed and designed to support the areas of marketing, service process and sales. Many literature studies are available to preserve the customer relationship but small drawbacks occur in the existing methods. One method to maintain the customer relationship is frequency based method ie, The Company will give declination to the customer based on the historical data that is the customers how many times come to that company. These methods are not effective. Because the customers give revenue to that company is less. So the company revenue is affected. In the data mining field, association rules have been researched for more than ten years; however, the degree to which the support threshold effectively discovers interesting association rules has received little attention. Most of the research effort in the scope of association rules has been oriented to simplify the rule set and to improve performance of the algorithm. With the recent advancement of Internet and Web Technology, web search has taken an important role in the ordinary life. To discover interesting patterns or relationship between data in large database association rule mining is used.
