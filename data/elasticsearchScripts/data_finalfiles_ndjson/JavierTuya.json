{"title": "Leveraging conceptual data models to ensure the integrity of Cassandra databases\n", "abstract": " The use of NoSQL databases for cloud environments has been increasing due to their performance advantages when working with big data. One of the most popular NoSQL databases used for cloud services is Cassandra, in which each table is created to satisfy one query. This means that as the same data could be retrieved by several queries, these data may be repeated in several different tables. The integrity of these data must be maintained in the application that works with the database, instead of in the database itself as in relational databases. In this paper, we propose a method to ensure the data integrity when there is a modification of data by using a conceptual model that is directly connected to the logical model that represents the Cassandra tables. This method identifies which tables are affected by the modification of the data and also proposes how the data integrity of the database may be ensured. We detail the process of this method along with two examples where we apply it in two insertions of tuples in a conceptual model. We also apply this method to a case study where we insert several tuples in the conceptual model, and then we discuss the results. We have observed how in most cases several insertions are needed to ensure the data integrity as well as needing to look for values in the database in order to do it.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["566"]}

The aim of this paper is to get closer to a measurement of the coverage of SQL statements and to show how, using this measurement, we might change the testing databases by means of completing or deleting information which provides improvements to the measurement, in order to achieve the highest possible percentage of coverage of the statements which have access to the database.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["566"]}
{"title": "Synchronous Estelle: A language for Specifying Distributed Control System\n", "abstract": " Distributed systems are getting more and more popular in every field of computing. This is also true for reactive systems. Traditional techniques for developing reactive systems are not very suitable for developing distributed reactive systems, because they are based on synchrony hypothesis, and it can not be hold in a distributed system. It is necessary to develop new techniques to deal with distributed reactive systems. In this paper we propose to join the features of two techniques used to specify systems: Estelle and StateCharts. The first one is very suitable for distributed systems, meanwhile the second one is broadly used for specifying reactive systems.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["566"]}
{"title": "Modelling Test Views for Graph Database Applications\n", "abstract": " Since NoSQL databases use data models, access modes and query languages that differ from the relational databases, the testing NoSQL database applications raises new challenges. There has been much attention to testing relational database applications, however testing NoSQL database applications is an area that has been hardly explored. This paper describes a model-based approach that allows the tester to model the important features of a graph database application to be tested, called test views. These test views are used to derive the test requirements that guide the generation of test cases. The approach is illustrated with an application that represents a real-world problem related with access control. The results show that using this model-based approach leads to test cases that are able to reveal faults and failures in both system specification and implementation.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["566"]}

{"title": "A new model for testing CRUD operations in a NoSQL database\n", "abstract": " NoSQL databases provide high availability and efficiency in data processing but at the expense of weaker consistency. In this paper, we propose a new approach in order to test NoSQL key/value databases in general and their CRUD operations in particular. We design a new context-aware model that takes into account the contextual requirements of clients (users) and the NoSQL database system. Accordingly, we develop a transaction model and testing criteria in order to test NoSQL databases by taking into account transactional and nontransactional CRUD operations. Results from testing criteria are used to analyse the trade-off between availability and consistency of NoSQL databases. In addition, these are used to help NoSQL database users and developers to choose between transactional and non-transactional CRUD operations.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["566"]}

Por ello, durante el dise\u00f1o de los casos de prueba se debe considerar tanto la interacci\u00f3n con el usuario como la interacci\u00f3n con la base de datos. Adem\u00e1s, la estructura de la base de datos puede tener una gran complejidad, lo que dificulta el dise\u00f1o de datos de prueba de calidad.

Para ello se modela de forma conjunta la estructura de la base de datos y del interfaz del usuario, dando lugar a un modelo llamado Modelo Integrado de Datos (IDM), y se expresa la funcionalidad requerida mediante un conjunto de reglas de negocio, escritas en t\u00e9rminos del IDM, que forman el Modelo de Reglas Integrado (IRM).

{"title": "Simulation-based management for software dynamic testing processes\n", "abstract": " Managing software development projects requires the coordination of different processes which may be performed by different teams, eg, a development team and a separate testing team. This coordination aims at optimizing the trade-off between cost, schedule and delivered quality. Simulation models are a powerful tool to explore what-if scenarios that help managers to achieve this trade-off and to fine-tune different project parameters. This paper presents a simulation model based on a multi-paradigm approach which connects development and testing processes. The testing process model is based on the process model described in the ongoing standard ISO/IEC DIS 29119-2. The simulation model is built using two different methods: the discrete-event approach, to simulate the execution of the dynamic testing processes, and the agent-based approach, to in-depth simulate defects life cycle. Results show how the simulation model is used to optimize the efficiency of the testing process.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["566"]}

Usually, XML data is stored in XML repositories, which can be accessed efficiently using the standard XPath as query language. However, the specific techniques for testing these queries often ignore the functional testing. This work addresses this problem by introducing a technique based on the category-partition method for the systematic design of test input data for an XPath query. The method permits the automatic identification of categories and choices in the XPath and XML Schema implementations and the construction of constraints in order to obtain complete and valid test cases. The technique is illustrated over a practical example.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["566"]}

{"title": "Effort measurement in student software engineering projects\n", "abstract": " Teaching software engineering by means of student involvement in the team development of a product is the most effective way to teach the main issues of software engineering. Some of its difficulties are those of coordinating their work, measuring the time spent by the students (both in individual work and in meetings) and making sure that meeting time will not be excessive. Starting in the academic year 1998/1999, we assessed, improved and documented the development process for the student projects and found that measurement is one of the outstanding issues to be considered. Each week, the students report the time spent on the different project activities. We present and analyze the measurement results for our 16 student teams (each one with around 6 students). It is interesting to note that the time spent in meetings is usually too long, ranging from 46% in the requirements analysis phase to 21% in coding\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["566"]}
