The paper starts with discussing the working conditions of content-based retrieval: patterns of use, types of pictures, the role of semantics, and the sensory gap. Subsequent sections discuss computational steps for image retrieval systems. Step one of the review is image processing for retrieval sorted by color, texture, and local geometry. Features for retrieval are discussed next, sorted by: accumulative and global features, salient points, object and shape features, signs, and structural combinations thereof. Similarity of pictures and objects in pictures is reviewed for each of the feature types, in close connection to the types and means of feedback the user of the systems is capable of giving by interaction. We briefly discuss aspects of system engineering: databases, system architecture, and evaluation.

Surface curvature sign labeling provides an initial coarse image segmentation, which is refined by an iterative region-growing method based on variable-order surface fitting.

Most research for establishing correspondence uses only two frames of a sequence to solve this problem. By using a sequence of frames, it is possible to exploit the fact that due to inertia the motion of an object cannot change instantaneously. By using smoothness of motion, it is possible to solve the correspondence problem for arbitrary motion of several nonrigid objects in a scene. We formulate the correspondence problem as an optimization problem and propose an iterative algorithm to find trajectories of points in a monocular image sequence. A modified form of this algorithm is useful in case of occlusion also.

To annotate the images more accurately, we propose a novel kNN-sparse graph-based semi-supervised learning approach for harnessing the labeled and unlabeled data simultaneously. The sparse graph constructed by datum-wise one-vs-kNN sparse reconstructions of all samples can remove most of the semantically unrelated links among the data, and thus it is more robust and discriminative than the conventional graphs. Meanwhile, we apply the approximate k nearest neighbors to accelerate the sparse graph construction without loosing its effectiveness. More importantly, we propose an effective training label refinement strategy within this graph-based learning framework to handle the noise in the training labels, by bringing in a dual regularization for both the quantity and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "264\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

In After Sex? prominent contributors to the development of queer studies offer personal reflections on the field\u2019s history, accomplishments, potential, and limitations. They consider the purpose of queer theory and the extent to which it is or is not defined by its engagement with sex and sexuality. For many of the contributors, a broad notion of sexuality is essential to queer thought. At the same time, some of them caution against creating an all-embracing idea of queerness, because it empties the term \u201cqueer\u201d of meaning and assumes the universality of ideas developed in the North American academy. Some essays recall the political urgency of the late 1980s and early 1990s, when gay and lesbian activist and queer theory projects converged in response to the AIDS crisis. Other pieces exemplify more recent trends in queer critique, including the turn to affect and the debates surrounding the \u201cantisocial thesis,\u201d which associates queerness with the repudiation of heteronormative forms of belonging.

Rules using these cues are developed, and a voting scheme is implemented to accumulate classification evidence incrementally. Both methods compared favorably with human inspector performance.< >", "num_citations": "151\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

{"title": "Segmentation through symbolic surface descriptions\n", "abstract": " Perception of surfaces plays a key role in three-dimensional object recognition. Recognition of three-dimensional objects from their images is performed by matching perceived surface descriptions with stored models of objects. The first step in object recognition is the segmentation of an image. If the pixels of a digi-tal surface can be correctly grouped into symbolic surface descriptions that have meaningful interpretations based only on general knowledge of surfaces, this grouping process would provide a fundamental service to higher level matching (recognition) processes. In this paper, an approach for image segmentation in terms of symbolic surface descriptions is discussed. Our approach may be con-sidered stimulus bound in that it considers that the ultimate truth is the sensed image data, and hence the output iof all processes should conform to the sensed values.

The actual length of the sequence varies with each instantiation of the gesture, and can be quite long in the case of a multiple gesture sequence. To achieve adequate system response we introduce the concept of recursive estimation of the gesture state. This consists of modeling the gestures as a sequence of static hand poses. Using a hidden Markov model where the unobservable state is the spatio-temporal gesture and the hand poses are the observations allows us to determine the current probabilities of each gesture with a finite state estimator. This decomposes the gesture recognition process into two stages: identification of the hand pose within the current image frame and incorporation of the new information into the probability estimates. We illustrate the performance of the estimator by describing the implementation of a telerobotic\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "99\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

{"title": "Intrinsic and extrinsic surface characteristics\n", "abstract": " A matrix of distance values, known as a depth map or range image, can be considered as noisy, discrete sam-ples of some surface described by a function of the type2= f (x, y). Due to the explicitness of this type of depth information, depth maps are finding increasing applica-tions in robotic vision. Most researchers have used, how-ever, only planar and quadratic surfaces to describe depth images. In this paper, a more rigorous approach for characterizing surfaces is proposed. Mean curvature and Gaussian curvature are identified as local second order surface characteristics which possess desirable invariance properties. The importance of surface curva-ture is emphasized using theorems from differential geometry. First order surface characteristics, such as critical points and large metric determinant points (which occur at depth-discontinuities), can also be used to complement the surface curvature information. Experimental surface characterization results are shown for real and synthetic depth maps which indicate the usefulness of these quantitative features. characterization of the surface that preserves structural surface information and is insensitive to noise. The noise insensitivity could possibly be achieved by computing redundant or at least\" overlapping\" information about a surface. In order to have a very rich geometric representation then, we propose to combine surface critical points (local maxima, minima and saddle points) and large metric determinant points (depth-discontinuities) with the surface curvature information to characterize a depth map surface in more detail.

Epidemiological data reveals that there are 360 million carriers of hepatitis-B virus throughout the globe and 78% of the world populations\u2019 hail from Asia. Though several studies from Indian sub-continent have provided an estimate of the prevalence of this viral infection, there exist only few studies, which reflect the status in the general population. AIM: The present study was designed to investigate the prevalence of hepatitis-B infection in North Indian general population. METHODS: The study population comprised of 20,000 healthy blood donors who were screened for hepatitis-B surface antigen (HBsAg) status using third generation ELISA kit. Seroprevalence rate of seropositive donors was calculated and stratified by age, sex and blood groups. Statistical analysis was performed using tests of proportions, chi-square and confidence interval. RESULTS: The study showed that out of 20,000 donors, 450 (2.25%) were HBsAg positive (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.0445-2.4554). Higher prevalence of HbsAg was found among males (440/19235) than females (10/765). The age specific prevalence rose from 1.78% (108/6058) in donors aged 19-25 years to a maximum of 3.03% (96/3161) in donors aged 35-45 years and decreased in older age groups. The peaks were detected in male donors aged 35-45 years and in females aged 25-35 years.

The authors combine the equations by the method of resultants with the MAXIMA symbolic algebra system, reducing the system to a single polynomial. Its real roots are then found with Sturm sequences. Since this system has multiple solutions, a hypothesize-and-verify scheme is used to eliminate incorrect ones. The scheme diminishes the sensitivity of using polynomial equations. The authors examine the effect of different rotation axes and angles on SFM accuracy and compare the performance of the algorithm to a few earlier approaches. Generally, it is found that a large amount of motion is the most important factor in getting good SFM accuracy.< >", "num_citations": "67\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

Substandard soils occupy more than 7 million hectares in central and southern India (fig. 1). A common characteristic of these soils is the rela-tively high salt content. Soil salinity or alkalinity in arid and semiarid regions is attributed to (a) sodic or alkali par-ent material,(b) irrigation with groundwater of high salt content, and (c) fluctuating water tables (Abrol 1986). Some of the substandard soils in India previously supported agricul-tural and forest production.

As examples, we studied several types of data: neural data with real-valued observations, count data from a market basket analysis, and ratings data from a movie recommendation system. The main idea is that each observation is modeled conditioned on a set of latent embeddings and other observations, called the context, where the way the context is defined depends on the problem. In language the context is the surrounding words; in neuroscience the context is close-by neurons; in market basket data the context is other items in the shopping cart. Each instance of an embedding defines the context, the exponential family of conditional distributions, and how the embedding vectors are shared across data. We infer the embeddings with stochastic gradient descent, with an algorithm that connects closely to generalized linear models. On all three of our applications\u2014neural activity of zebrafish, users\u2019 shopping behavior, and movie ratings\u2014we found that exponential family embedding models are more effective than other dimension reduction methods.

We show that if an image segment has an enclosing rectangle having sides of lengths x and y, such that 2 N-1  \u00d7 max (x, y) \u2a7d 2 N , then the optimal quadtree may be the one representing an image of size 2 N  \u00d7 2 N  or 2 N+1  \u00d7 2 N+1 . It is shown that in some situations the quadtree corresponding to the larger image has fewer nodes. Also, some necessary conditions are derived to identify segments for which the larger image size results in a quadtree which is no more expensive than the quadtree for the smaller image size.", "num_citations": "44\n", "authors": ["1156"]}
{"title": "Experiential sampling in multimedia systems\n", "abstract": " Multimedia systems must deal with multiple data streams. Each data stream usually contains significant volume of redundant noisy data. In many real-time applications, it is essential to focus the computing resources on a relevant subset of data streams at any given time instant and use it to build the model of the environment. We formulate this problem as an experiential sampling problem and propose an approach to utilize computing resources efficiently on the most informative subset of data streams. First, in this paper, we focus on theoretical background and develop a theoretical framework for a single data stream. We generalize the notion of static visual attention in a dynamical systems setting and propose a dynamical attention-orientated analysis method. This is achieved by a sampling representation that utilizes the current context and past experience for attention evolution.

A key initial stage in the signal to symbol conversion process, essential for the interpretation of the data, is three-dimensional image segmentation involving the processes of partitioning and identification. Most segmentation and grouping research in computer vision has addressed partitioning of 2D images, f(x,y). In this paper, we present a parallel 3D image segmentation algorithm which, through the use of \u03b1-partitioning and volume filtering, segments 3D images such that the greylevel variation within each volume can be described by a regression model. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm on several real-World 3D images.", "num_citations": "43\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

{"title": "Direct estimation and error analysis for oriented patterns\n", "abstract": " This paper presents an estimation algorithm and error analysis for single linear oriented pattern in images. The estimation is formulated in terms of minimizing an objective function, using the Lagrange multiplier rule. No specific noise model is assumed. The estimation algorithm uses the intensity image of a flow pattern and directly determines a symbolic description of the pattern. No preprocessing or enhancement is needed on the intensity image or any intermediate data. This results in an efficient computational algorithm. We show that it is feasible to directly compute relative divergence, curl, and deformation from the intensity image of an oriented flow pattern. These relative properties are further used for identification of the type of pattern in the intensity image. Since an oriented pattern is corrupted by noise and is distorted to some degree from a linear flow pattern, quality measures of the estimation are proposed\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "41\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

In the process, unresolved questions of interpretation and problems with the implementation of a consistent notion of time across a network are uncovered. It is observed that there are two Ada mechanisms that can involve a distributed sense of time: the conditional entry call, and the timed entry call. It is shown that a recent interpretation by the Language Maintenance Committee resolves the questions for the conditional entry calls but results in an anomaly for timed entry calls. A detailed discussion of alternative implementations for the timed entry call is made, and it is argued that: 1) timed entry calls imply a common sense of time between the machines holding the calling and called tasks; and 2) the measurement of time for the expiration of the delay and the decision of whether or not to perform the rendezvous\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "38\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

As responses to simultaneous biotic and abiotic stresses are non-linear, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms involved in order to develop stress-tolerant crop plants.

Design:  After geographically-spaced community sampling of households, one individual per household was tested for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 N-protein in a two-week interval.   Setting:  Slum and non-slum communities in three wards, one each from the three main zones of Mumbai.    Participants:  Individuals over age 12 who consent to and have no contraindications to venipuncture were eligible. 6,904 participants (4,202 from slums and 2,702 from non-slums) were tested.  Main outcome measures:  The primary outcomes were the positive test rate for IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 N-protein by demographic group (age and gender) and location (slums and non-slums).  The secondary outcome is seroprevalence at slum and non-slum levels.  Sera was tested via chemiluminescence (CLIA) using Abbott Diagnostics ArchitectTM N-protein based test.

With our definition, meaning is no longer a characteristic of the image that is extracted and compared in the querying process. Meaning is a product of the query process.

A case report.\n", "abstract": " Localized tenosynovial giant cell tumor of tendon sheath (TGCT-L) is a benign, slowly growing lesion with a peak incidence in the third to fifth decade of life. It is thought to arise from the synovium of tendon sheaths, frequently affecting interphalangeal joints of the hands, feet, ankles and knees. Although the histopathologic appearances are well established, only a few reports describe the cytomorphology of this lesion. A 37-year-old female presented with a slowly growing, nontender mass located near the left ankle joint. The cytologic features of localized tenosynovial giant cell tumor of tendon sheath (TGCT-L) include abundant mononuclear histiocytic cells occurring singly and in three-dimensional tissue fragments, hemosiderin within histiocytes and a few multinucleated giant cells. Subsequently, the histopathologic examination of the surgical specimen was proven to be TGCT-L. Fine needle aspiration cytology can be used as a diagnostic tool for early and accurate detection of TGCT-L since the cytologic features combined with clinical details are sufficiently distinctive.", "num_citations": "26\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

Hel-N1 binds to RNA containing short stretches of uridylates similar to those found in the 3'untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of oncoprotein and cytokine mRNAs. The GLUT1 glucose transporter has an extensive 3'UTR that is AU-rich reminiscent of the 3'UTR of an oncogene mRNA. An in vitro RNA binding assay using Hel-N1 demonstrated binding to a specific portion of the GLUT1 3'UTR. Analysis of the folding pattern of this region depicted the retention of a stem loop structure, wherein the loop is composed of a stretch of uridylates. To further analyze the potential function of Hel-N1, stable transfectants were made in the 3T3-L1 cell line. The transfectants have been characterized, and the presence of the Hel-N1 DNA and protein verified. Data indicate Hel-N1 is a ligand for GLUT1 and its binding affects the stability and translatability of the GLUT1 message.", "num_citations": "26\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

The units of abstraction are models in which levels of abstraction are determined by the degree of assumption necessary for their application.

This strategy was applied to the recognition and pose determination of objects comprising simple and compound cylindrical and planar surfaces in dense range data. A method of computing reliable Gaussian and mean curvature sign-map descriptors from the polynomial approximations of surfaces is demonstrated. A means for determining the pose of constructed geometric forms whose algebraic surface descriptions are nonlinear in terms of their orienting parameters is developed.

Most approaches for establishing correspondence in a sequence of frames depend heavily on the 2-D features and 2-D distance in the location of correspondence tokens in two frames.

It has proven to be extraordinarily difficult to program computers to understand and describe these images in a general purpose way. One important problem is that digitized intensity images are rectangular arrays of numbers which indicate the brightness at individual points on a regularly spaced rectangular grid and contain no explicit information that is directly usable in depth perception. Yet human beings are able to correctly infer depth relationships quickly and easily among intensity image regions whereas automatic inference of such depth relationships has proven to be remarkably complex. In fact, many famous visual illusions, such as Kanizsa's triangle, vividly demonstrate that humans impose 3-D surface structure on images to interpret them. Computer vision researchers recognized the importance of surfaces in the understanding of images. The popularity of shape from... approaches in the last decade is the result of this recognition.In recent years digitized range data has become available from both active and passive sensors, and the quality of this data has been steadily improving. Range data is usually produced in the form of a rectangular array of numbers, referred to as a depth map or range image, where the numbers quantify the distances from the sensor plane to the surfaces within the field of view along the rays emanating from a regularly spaced rectangular grid. Not only are depth relationships between depth map regions explicit, but the three-dimensional shape of depth map regions approximates the three\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

Routing is a key issue which needs to be addressed for efficient forwarding of packets from source to destination. Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) is a proactive or table driven routing protocol in MANETS which works on the principal of link sensing. Multi Point Relay (MPR) node is mainly responsible for forwarding of topology control messages in OLSR. In this work MPR node is selected on the basis of node\u2019s willingness to be selected as MPR. Wireless links are generally much inferior and prone to link losses. Frequent link failures result in lesser QoS parameters such as lesser throughput, higher end to end delay, higher latency and less utilization of link bandwidth.

However, lack of any decision-making methodology makes it difficult for the rural entrepreneur to setup a business. This paper has developed a Multi-Criteria Decision Making template, using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), of ranking the best technology for extraction of nine medicinal plants which grow in Western Ghats of India. These plants have more than 20% subsidy in cultivation under NMMP and have an anticancer property. The technologies selected for AHP were agitation/centrifugation, cold solvent extraction, reflux/soxhlet extraction, cold percolation, microwave assisted extraction, sonication and hot solvent extraction. The ability of the tool to provide selection of the extraction technology with process flexibility like criteria selection, technology selection and criteria weightages allows its use by rural entrepreneurs, technology facilitators, rural entrepreneur proposal evaluators and policy makers.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

But he assigned no specific name to this flower. Then, nearly six years later, two detailed accounts of this flower were published almost simultaneously, one by Verma (1956) and the other by one of us (PRAKASH, 1955). Verma called it Sahnipushpam shuklai and assigned it to Sonneratiaceae while Prakash described it as S. glandulosum showing its near approach to Myrtaceae. Though both these accounts were fairly detailed, yet some structural details, particularly about. the androecium, were not known. Also there was considerable unanimity between the earlier authors (Prakash and Verma) about morphological interpretations but there were some differences in observations particularly about the structure of the pollen grains and the type of placentation. Thus, according to Verma (loc. cit.) the pollen grains are I-sulcate and the placentation is basal while according to Prakash (loc. cit.) the pollen grains are'\" dicolporate, syncolpate\" and the placentation is probably apical. Therefore, in view of these structural ambiguities and controversial systematic position, further vvork on this interesting fossil flower was considered necessary.On breaking and cutting a rich piece of chert from Mohgaon Kalan, about 100flowers were obtained.

This setting is useful in many social science applications involving human raters and the approximate rank of every item is desired. Approximate or coarse ranking can significantly reduce the number of ratings required in comparison to the number needed to find an exact ranking. We propose a computationally efficient PAC algorithm LUCBRank for coarse ranking, and derive an upper bound on its sample complexity.

In this paper, we argue that Hyperbolic space is more suitable for learning user-item embeddings in the recommendation domain.

We propose HyperBPR (Hyperbolic Bayesian Personalized Ranking), a conceptually simple but highly effective model for the task at hand.

{"title": "Solubility enhancement of poorly water soluble drug by using nano-suspension technology\n", "abstract": " Solubility is an essential factor for drug effectiveness, independent of the route of administration. Poorly soluble drugs are often a challenging task for formulators in the industry. Conventional approaches for enhancement of solubility have limited applicability, especially when the drugs are poorly soluble simultaneously in aqueous and in non-aqueous media. Nanosuspension technology can be used to improve the stability as well as the bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs. The problem is even more complex for drugs like itraconazole, simvastatin, and carbamazepine which are poorly soluble in both aqueous and nonaqueous media, belonging to BCS class II as classified by biopharmaceutical classification system. Formulation as nanosuspension is an attractive and promising alternative to solve these problems. Nanosuspension consists of the pure poorly water-soluble drug without any matrix material suspended in dispersion. Preparation of nanosuspension is simple and applicable to all drugs which are water insoluble. A nanosuspension not only solves the problems of poor solubility and bioavailability, but also alters the pharmacokinetics of drug and thus improves drug safety and efficacy. This review article describes the preparation methods, characterization, and applications of the nanosuspension.", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

The emission rate of styrene from VE resins is affected by various parameters, including styrene content, temperature, and resin surface-to-volume ratio. This study experimentally measured the effect of these parameters on styrene emission rates from VE resins. It was observed that the emission rate and amount of styrene decreased with decreasing surface-to-volume ratio, temperature, and styrene content.

This demands techniques to discover those events from media and sensor data that have been captured during missions.

{"title": "Firing bandits: Optimizing crowdfunding\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we model the problem of optimizing crowdfunding platforms, such as the non-profit Kiva or for-profit KickStarter, as a variant of the multi-armed bandit problem. In our setting, Bernoulli arms emit no rewards until their cumulative number of successes over any number of trials exceeds a fixed threshold and then provides no additional reward for any additional trials-a process reminiscent to that of a neuron firing once it reaches the action potential and then saturates. In the spirit of an infinite armed bandit problem, the player can add new arms whose expected probability of success is drawn iid from an unknown distribution\u2013this endless supply of projects models the harsh reality that the number of projects seeking funding greatly exceeds the total capital available by lenders. Crowdfunding platforms naturally fall under this setting where the arms are potential projects, and their probability of success is the probability that a potential funder decides to fund it after reviewing it. The goal is to play arms (prioritize the display of projects on a webpage) to maximize the number of arms that reach the firing threshold (meet their goal amount) using as few total trials (number of impressions) as possible over all the played arms. We provide an algorithm for this setting and prove sublinear regret bounds.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

In this paper, we propose a new Data-driven, Multi-metric, and Time-varying (DMT) energy benchmarking framework that utilizes these new data streams to benchmark building energy use across multiple metrics at the daily time scale. High fidelity data from smart meters enables the DMT benchmarking framework to produce daily benchmarking scores and use daily weather data to understand seasonally adjusted performance. Intra-day building efficiency is also investigated by benchmarking buildings across several metrics (e.g., total energy usage, operational energy usage, non-operational energy usage) thereby enabling deeper insights into building operations than\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["1156"]}
{"title": "Public expenditure, governance and human development\n", "abstract": " This paper examines the link between quality of governance, public expenditure and human development outcomes in the state of Madhya Pradesh. The role of governance is measured in five dimensions: Political, Legal & Judicial, Administrative, Economic and Social. A total of 22 indicators have been used to measure the Governance Index (GI) of Madhya Pradesh at district level. The results in this paper suggest that, at district level, development expenditure alone is not sufficient in achieving human development outcomes. However, the effectiveness of public expenditures improves with better governance indicators. In addition, GI is found to be significant and positive in improving development outcomes. Among the governance dimensions, weak administrative index appears to be the main constraint in improving the human development outcomes in less developed districts. Disaggregated analysis suggests that the districts with lower human development achievements need to prioritize only in one or two dimensions of governance, in particular administrative governance. Prioritization of various or specific dimensions of governance should help in reducing the divergences in development outcomes across the districts. The findings of this paper are very important as they suggest that public expenditure efficiency depends on the quality of governance. Hence, there is a need to equally focus, both, on improving governance as well as on increasing development expenditures. In the context of achieving SDGs and with the lessons learnt from MDGs, the findings of the paper suggest that we should focus on policy both at the sub-national and sub\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

{"title": "A graph regularized dimension reduction method for out-of-sample data\n", "abstract": " Among various dimension reduction techniques, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is specialized in treating vector data, whereas Laplacian embedding is often employed for embedding graph data. Moreover, graph regularized PCA, a combination of both techniques, has also been developed to assist the learning of a low dimensional representation of vector data by incorporating graph data. However, these approaches are confronted by the out-of-sample problem: each time when new data is added, it has to be combined with the old data before being fed into the algorithm to re-compute the eigenvectors, leading to enormous computational cost. In order to address this problem, we extend the graph regularized PCA to the graph\u00a0regularized linear regression PCA (grlrPCA). grlrPCA eliminates the redundant calculation on the old data by first learning a linear function and then directly applying it to the new data\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

A good design of bituminous mix is expected to result in a mix which is adequately strong, durable and resistive to fatigue and permanent deformation and at the same time environment friendly and economical. A mix designer tries to achieve these requirements through a number of tests on the mix with varied proportions of material combinations and finalizes the best one. This often involves a balance between mutually conflicting parameters. Bitumen mix design is a delicate balancing act among the proportions of various aggregate sizes and bitumen content. For a given aggregate gradation, the optimum bitumen content is estimated by satisfying a number of mix design parameters. Fillers play an important role in engineering properties of bituminous paving mixes. Conventionally stone dust, cement and lime are used as fillers. An attempt has been made in this investigation to assess the influence of non-conventional and cheap fillers such as brick dust and silica fume in bitumen paving mixes. It has been observed as a result of this project that bituminous mixes with these non-conventional fillers result in satisfactory Marshall Properties though requiring a bit higher bitumen content, thus substantiating the need for its use. The fillers used in this investigation are likely to partly solve the solid waste\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

Computed tomography (CT) scan showed an encapsulated mass with multiple cysts. Histopathological examination revealed the characteristic findings, which were consistent with soft-tissue hydatid disease. In the absence of visceral organ involvement, this is the first reported case of a primary subcutaneous hydatid cyst in the skin of face in India. In the English literature, only one case of this kind has been reported till date. When imaging methods confirm cystic nature of a swelling, even in unusual sites, one should always keep a possibility of hydatid cyst and manage accordingly during surgery to avoid precipitation of acute anaphylaxis.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

In the vast economy with enormous feature criteria for everyone, it is an ongoing challenge for the insurance companies to assess each applicant based on various factors to provide right policies on the basis of a risk score. We propose a method of ensemble learning as a solution to this problem where the predictions from pre-existing supervised learning algorithms can be used to enhance the accuracy of prediction. A real-world dataset having 128 attributes has been used to study the risk value associated with a policy applicant. Machine learning algorithms were applied to the dataset to predict the risk associated with the applicant.

The scene brightness is derived from camera parameters that are automatically set when photos are taken and recorded with each photo as metadata in standard forms like EXIF data. This information is available from metadata and is very inexpensive computationally resulting in fast segmentation. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering method is applied to build the event hierarchy of the photo stream based on the scene brightness difference.

The effect of optimized concentration of zinc dust and micaceous iron oxide (MIO) as pigments is evaluated for these surface tolerant coating systems. It has been noticed that the presence of these two ingredients has enhanced corrosion resistance more than several times as compared to commercially available coating systems. The corrosion simulation test in 3.5\u2009wt.% NaCl has evident for significant improvement in terms of delaying blistering and delamination. The high pore resistance  ()  indicates the slow migration of ions and water into the substrate and coating interface, which could be the reason of the improvement in corrosion process.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to analyze the past dataset of crop yields and predict future yields using regression-based approximation of time series fuzzy data. A framework-based algorithm, which we named DAbFP (data algorithm for degree approximation-based fuzzy partitioning), is proposed to forecast wheat yield production with fuzzy time series data. Specifically, time series data were fuzzified by the simple maximum-based generalized mean function. Different cases for prediction values were evaluated based on two-set interval-based partitioning to get accurate results. The novelty of the method lies in its ability to approximate a fuzzy relation for forecasting that provides lesser complexity and higher accuracy in linear, cubic, and quadratic order than the existing methods. A lesser complexity as compared to dynamic data approximation makes it easier to find the suitable de-fuzzification process and obtain accurate predicted values. The proposed algorithm is compared with the latest existing frameworks in terms of mean square error (MSE) and average forecasting error rate (AFER).

However, the location is not the whereabouts of the scene taken by the photographer but the whereabouts of the photographer himself. To determine the actual location of an object seen in a photo some sophisticated and tiresome steps are required on a special camera rig, which are generally not available in common digital cameras. This article proposes a novel method to determine the geometric location corresponding to a specific image pixel. A new technique of stereo triangulation is introduced to compute the relative depth of a pixel position.

{"title": "Use of polypropylene fiber reinforced concrete as a construction material for rigid pavements\n", "abstract": " Quantitatively concrete occupies the largest volume in any modern construction activity and it is expected that there will be no substitute for concrete in the near future.  Since such high volumes of concrete are being used for new construction, it is imperative to produce good quality concrete that will be durable with enhanced mechanical properties to maximize the service life of a structure. Though good concrete can be produced using automation and controlled environment, it is not possible to alter its inherent brittle nature and the lack of any tensile strength. In this context, fibre reinforced concrete (FRC) seems to be a viable alternative. The present study focuses on feasibility of using polypropylene fibres as secondary reinforcement to concrete to change its brittle nature. Accordingly, various percentages of polypropylene fibres were added to concrete and a series of laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the use of polypropylene FRC in rigid pavements.  Mechanical properties of concrete such as compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, flexural strength and toughness, abrasion and impact were determined.  Except for abrasion, polypropylene fibres improved the mechanical properties of control concrete and 0.6% by volume was found to be the ideal fibre dosage.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

Moreover, system designs generally start with the assumption that the environment, context, and sensors always remain static. With such a tight coupling, it becomes very difficult to port the system to new environments. Furthermore, for most of the systems, there is no straightforward way to upgrade the existing system to incorporate technological advancements such as new sensors or novel feature extraction techniques. We propose a flexible surveillance system architecture which can be easily ported in different environments, is dynamic without any significant compromise in system performance, and can be extended to integrate newer technological developments.

{"title": "An ecosystem for semantics\n", "abstract": " It has become increasingly clear that multimedia content exhibits multiple semantics that depend on different factors, such as time, context, and user tasks. Managing such semantics has become a crucial aspect of modern multimedia systems and has been the focus of a great deal of research. However, current research in this area typically doesn\u2019t consider the problem in its entirety. Today\u2019s systems mostly focus on distinct aspects of multimedia semantics rather than cultivate a comprehensive approach. 1, 2 Consequently, we have developed the Semantics Ecosystem (SES), a theoretical approach for understanding the different factors that influence multimedia semantics. By basing the SES on the work of philosopher Karl Popper, we situate the concept of semantics in the context of semiotics, a general philosophical theory of representations that focuses on the meaning of signs and symbols. 3-5 Altogether, the SES defines five kinds of semantics: natural, analytical, user, expressive, and emergent. The SES is motivated by the practical problem of understanding the multiple factors that influence the semantics of multimedia albums created by the context-driven authoring tool xSmart for page-based multimedia presentations. 6 The semantics of the multimedia presentations authored in xSmart are implicit, but can be made explicit by extracting and expressing the derivation rules applied during the authoring process.

Eighty-five subjects were analysed, and diagnosed histologically as CIN (n= 33) and invasive cancer (n= 22). Thirty women with normal Pap test results served as controls. Results on cellular markers showed a significant decrease in peripheral blood lymphocyte counts in patients with higher grades of cervical lesions as compared to controls (CIN III P< 0.05 and invasive cancer P< 0.001). Similar trends were observed for CD22 cell counts (P< 0.001). A consistent decrease was observed for CD2 positive T lymphocytes in patients with higher grade cervical lesions only.

{"title": "Utilizing diffraction imaging for nondestructive wafer topography measurements\n", "abstract": " Real-time process monitoring has been a primary concern of the semiconductor industry for a number of years. In an attempt to provide higher yield and performance it has become accepted that the monitoring of the etch step is critical. This is the primary motivation for the development of a real time process monitor with particular attention paid to wafer monitoring at the surface. To this end, the use of the results of diffraction, in particular, diffraction from 3-dimensional gratings is proving to be a viable technique for real time, process monitoring. Thus, the primary focus of this paper is to present the progress made toward the development of a non destructive, real time, optical metrology based system for direct wafer monitoring, utilizing the results of diffraction from a grating structure.

To date, we have various techniques that give a prediction of software reliability like neural networks, fuzzy logic, and other evolutionary algorithms. A genetic algorithm has been explored for predicting software reliability. One of the important aspects of software quality is called software reliability, thus, software engineering is of a great place in the software industry. To increase the software reliability, it is mandatory that we must design a model that predicts the fault and error in the software program at early stages, rectify them and then increase the functionality of the program within a minimum time and in a low cost. There exist numerous algorithms that predict software errors such as the Genetic Algorithm, which has a very high ability to predict software bugs, failure and errors rather than any other algorithm. The main purpose of this paper is to predict software errors with so precise, less time-consuming and cost-effective methodology.

It should be such that before delivery, it is energetically favorable for the drug molecule to be encapsulated, and as soon as it reaches the desired cell, it is energetically favorable to be ejected, so that the contents are deposited to the target site. Due to the dawn of nanotechnology, especially the use of nanoparticles and nanotubes as delivery vehicles, the idealized concept of the \u201cmagic bullet,\u201d which was first proposed in the beginning of the 20th century, is now becoming reality. These nanoscale drug carriers, owing to their accurate targeting nature and protective environment, not only make it possible to use a stronger drug at a lower dose, but also result in less side effects existing for current methods like highly toxic chemotherapeutic cancer treatments. Apart from this, nanocarriers offer improvement to drug-delivery methods for autoimmune diseases, metabolic diseases, infections, pain treatment, and gene therapy. Recently, nanotubes have gained significant attention in nanocarrier-based drug delivery as they offer a lot of advantages, with the potential for improved results. Some of the advantages offered by nanotubes include a larger inner volume, which permits more drug molecules to be encapsulated; discrete inner and outer surfaces for functionalization; readily accessible volume and surfaces of the nanotube, since the end caps can be easily detached; and greater stability, biocompatibility, and nonimmunogenicity.

Overcoming undernutrition is critical not only to meet the first Millennium Development Goal (MDG) to halve poverty and hunger but to achieve the other MDG goals pertaining to maternal health, child survival, HIV/AIDS, education and gender equity. In India, the data on trend in undernutrition in the last decade in the country is not available despite the introduction of the National Health Surveys since 1992. This is primarily due to the fact that a standard criterion has also not been used for classification of undernutrition in the national surveys. Therefore, there is a need to convert the available data of the various national nutrition surveys to a specific age group and then study the trend and associations of the prevalence rate of undernutrition. With this aim the present paper is written with the objective to estimate the prevalence of undernutrition (underweight and stunting) in children below two years in India and to study the factors contributing significantly to undernutrition. The raw data of second and third round of National Family Health Survey (NFHS) are used for comparing the prevalence of undernutrition in children. Logistic regression model has been used as the statistical method to analyze the data examining significant association between level of malnutrition and selected risk factors.

The TiO2, due to its very small particle size, passes between the cellulosic fibers and drains into the white water. To overcome this problem, papermakers try to use various retention aids for improving overall retention of TiO2, but agglomeration of TiO2 causes a decrease in light scattering efficiency of TiO2. During the subsequent saturation operation, the air in the voids is replaced by melamine formaldehyde, which has a refractive index close to that of cellulose. As a result, the sheet becomes translucent and poses' see through'problem. Keeping this in view, anhydrous magnesium silicate is used as an extender with TiO2 because it effectively increases the overall filler retention, sheet brightness, opacity. The dispersed aqueous slurry of anhydrous magnesium silicate forms fine gel that entraps TiO2 in the wet web and prevents removal of fines and fillers. The addition of 25% TiO2, 7% micronized soapstone powder, 8% anhydrous magnesium silicate, 1% melamine formaldehyde, and 0.1% sodium hexameta-phosphate was found to improve the overall retention by 65.25% and to cut the manufacturing cost by US $546.00 per tonne of pulp without affecting the product quality.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

We consider different information components of context such as time, location, and optical setting for inexpensive segmentation of photo streams from common users of modern digital camera. As events are hierarchical, we propose to segment photo stream using hierarchical mixture model.

The range of the mean number of NORs per nucleus was 1.3-1.7 (95% CI: 1.4-1.6) for normal liver, 2.4-3.5 (2.8-3.2) for cirrhosis, 3.0-7.9 (3.7-5.6) for HCC and 4.0-4.2 (3.9-4.3) for cholangiocarcinoma. The difference observed was statistically significant. The AgNORs were small and discrete in normal and cirrhotic liver and relatively larger and scattered in distribution in HCC.

A video database system must be designed to extract, represent and organize this information in a fashion that supports querying, manipulation and data visualization by a user. As a data modeling exercise, objects and events are defined in terms of semantic attributes such that an end-user's queries are expressible through the modeling language. On the other hand, as a feature extraction exercise, objects are defined as solutions to equations, often in terms of low-level visual primitives like voxels or contours. These two formalisms constitute entirely different languages. However, integration of these two approaches can provide a powerful mechanism for description and manipulation of complex visual data.

Before database issues can be addressed, it is necessary to give a definition of similarity as an operation. In this paper we study several models proposed in the psychological literature to explain the characteristics of human similarity assessment, and discuss their computational characteristics. In addition, we develop a similarity measure, based on fuzzy logic, that exhibit several features that match experimental findings in humans. The model is dubbed Fuzzy Feature Contrast (FFC) and is an extension to a more general domain of the Feature Contrast model due to Tversky. We show how the FFC model can be used to model similarity assessment from fuzzy judgment of properties, and we address the use of fuzzy measures to deal with dependencies among the properties. Finally, we show how the parameters of the model can be tuned by comparative judgment experiments.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

Visual representations are used extensively within new user interfaces. Powerful visual approaches are being experimented for data manipulation, including the investigation of three dimensional display techniques. Similarly, sophisticated data visualization techniques are dramatically improving the understanding of the information extracted from a database. On the other hand, more and more applications use images as basic data or to enhance the quality and richness of data manipulation services. Image management has opened a wide area of new research topics in image understanding and analysis. The IFIP 2.6 Working Group on Databases strongly believes that a significant mutual enrichment is possible by confronting ideas, concepts and techniques supporting the work of researcher and practitioners in the two areas of visual interfaces to DBMS and DBMS management of visual data. For this reason, IFIP 2.6 has launched a series of conferences on Visual Database Systems. The first one has been held in Tokyo, 1989. VDB-2 was held in Budapest, 1991.

Road Transport is the most common escape route for many criminals. Thefts and many other crimes remain unregistered and unsolved due to lack of evidence. Effective tracking of vehicles and criminals is still a big problem and involves plenty of resources. To evade such a condition, we have proposed a machine learning-based practical crime detection system using the text and face recognition techniques. Such systems will be proved useful in parking lots, toll stations, airports, border crossings, etc. In the proposed system, the text recognition involves extracting the characters present in the Indian number plates and the predicted output will be compared with the registered vehicle database.

Alarmingly, the widespread use of smartphone platforms implies that people are carrying around sensitive information in their pocket, making the information more available physically. As smartphone owners are often using their devices in public areas, these short numeric codes or other forms of passwords can be obtained quickly through shoulder surfing, resulting in making that restricted data far more accessible for those who are not authorized to access the device. In this paper, we address the problem of biometric verifi-cation on smartphones. We propose a new approach for gesture-based verification that makes use of open set recognition algorithms.

It is a simple, inexpensive and a rapid diagnostic test which can be performed in a short duration of time. We organized a study to compare the diagnostic utility of IOC with the histopathological examination (gold standard technique) in ovarian benign and malignant neoplasms.Materials and Methods: We conducted a prospective study on 68 suspected ovarian neoplasms and samples were collected using touch, imprint, scrape or crush technique. The samples were fixed by 95% ethyl alcohol and stained with hematoxylin and eosin stain. An experienced cytopathologist diagnosed and interpreted the cytology slides of ovarian neoplasm and correlated the histopathological diagnosis with cytological interpretation. Based on the data the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy were determined.Results: Among the 68 cases, the standard histopathological diagnosis confirmed 24 as benign, 6 as borderline and 38 as malignant lesions. The diagnostic concordance between cytological and histopathological study was observed in 65 of the 68 cases. We observed a satisfactory diagnostic accuracy of the intraoperative imprint cytology (95.60%) in our study.

PRSV population profile has been based on coat protein gene sequences for twenty isolates originating from different locations. Available data suggest that the PRSV population comprising P and W types is highly heterogenous (up to 14% at amino acid levels). This is in contrast to the situation prevailing in Australia, America, Brazil and Mexico where PRSV population is homogenous. More isolates originating from different locations will have to be examined to ascertain the complete profile.

{"title": "Geographical routing using partial information for wireless ad\n", "abstract": " In this paper we present an algorithm for routing in wireless ad hoc networks using information about geographical location of the nodes. We assume each node knows its geographical position and the position of the node to which it wants to send a packet. Initially, the nodes know only their neighbors, but over time they discover other nodes in the network. The routing table at a node S is a list h (pi; S i) i, where pi is a geographical position and S i is a neighbor of node S. When node S receives a packet for a node D at position pos (D), it finds the pi in its routing table which is closest to pos (D) and forwards the packet to the neighbor S i. We prove the correctness of the algorithm and show that our algorithm naturally aggregates the nodes so that the routing tables remain small. We show that the mean routing table size is O (L log n), where L is the average number of hops between two nodes and n is the number of nodes in the network. We also present methods for taking positional errors, node failures and mobility into account. We justify the results through simulation.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

{"title": "An approach for the direct computation of the focus of expansion\n", "abstract": " Determination of optical flow has attracted the attention of many researchers interested in developing systems for the understanding of dynamic scene from sequence of frames [3, 6-18, 29). It has been shown that optical flow carries valuable information about the nature and depth of surfaces, and the relative motion between observer and objects [4, 5, 8, 16, 18-22].Discontinuities in the optical flow are due to the discontinuity of some intrinsic characteristics, eg, the depth or orientation of surfaces, in images. It has been argued that many human visual systems use optical flow for the segmentation and further analysis of a dynamic scene [8, 16]. Some early dynamic scene analysis systems segmented each frame, then used matching for the detection and measurement of the motion of objects [1, 2, 17, 24). Such systems do not exploit the most useful information, namely, the motion cue, for the segmentation of a dynamic scene. Later researcher developed methods such that all available information in a frame sequence can be exploited [11, 14, 18, 27, 28] for the analysis of a dynamic scene. Many approaches [11, 13, 18, 23] have been developed for the segmentation of dynamic scene exploiting the motion of the moving objects. An object's 3-D structure is important to the understanding of a scene while occlusion gives valuable information about the relative depth of surfaces. In dynamic scenes, motion can be used to obtain the 3-D structure [25, 27] and occlusion [1, 14, 17].

Each day, most people go to sleep without any idea about how their night\u2019s rest will be or how they can leverage their data to improve it. For an activity that humans spend near a third of their life doing, there is a surprising amount of mystery around it. Despite current research, creating personalized sleep models in real-world settings has been challenging. Existing literature provides several connections between daily activities and sleep quality. Unfortunately, these insights do not generalize well in many individuals. For these reasons, it is essential to create a data-driven personalized sleep model. This research proposes a sleep model that captures causal relationships between daily activities and sleep quality and presents the user with specific feedback recommendations to improve sleep quality. Using N-of-1 experiments on longitudinal user data and event mining, the model generates a probabilistic understanding between lifestyle choices (exercise, eating, circadian rhythm, environmental selection) and their respective impact on sleep quality. Our experimental results identified and quantified relationships while extracting confounding variables through a causal framework. We then utilize the generated model to provide lifestyle recommendations to optimize sleep outcomes in a context-aware health recommendation system.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

{"title": "Report of 2017 NSF Workshop on Multimedia Challenges, Opportunities and Research Roadmaps\n", "abstract": " With the transformative technologies and the rapidly changing global R&D landscape, the multimedia and multimodal community is now faced with many new opportunities and uncertainties. With the open source dissemination platform and pervasive computing resources, new research results are being discovered at an unprecedented pace. In addition, the rapid exchange and influence of ideas across traditional discipline boundaries have made the emphasis on multimedia multimodal research even more important than before. To seize these opportunities and respond to the challenges, we have organized a workshop to specifically address and brainstorm the challenges, opportunities, and research roadmaps for MM research. The two-day workshop, held on March 30 and 31, 2017 in Washington DC, was sponsored by the Information and Intelligent Systems Division of the National Science Foundation of the United States. Twenty-three (23) invited participants were asked to review and identify research areas in the MM field that are most important over the next 10-15 year timeframe. Important topics were selected through discussion and consensus, and then discussed in depth in breakout groups. Breakout groups reported initial discussion results to the whole group, who continued with further extensive deliberation. For each identified topic, a summary was produced after the workshop to describe the main findings, including the state of the art, challenges, and research roadmaps planned for the next 5, 10, and 15 years in the identified area.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1156"]}
{"title": "Detecting events of daily living using multimodal data\n", "abstract": " Events are fundamental for understanding how people experience their lives. It is challenging, however, to automatically record all events in daily life. An understanding of multimedia signals allows recognizing events of daily living and getting their attributes as automatically as possible. In this paper, we consider the problem of recognizing a daily event by employing the commonly used multimedia data obtained from a smartphone and wearable device. We develop an unobtrusive approach to obtain latent semantic information from the data, and therefore an approach for daily event recognition based on semantic context enrichment. We represent the enrichment process through an event knowledge graph that semantically enriches a daily event from a low-level daily activity. To show a concrete example of this enrichment, we perform an experiment with eating activity, which may be one of the most complex events, by using 14 months of data for three users. In this process, to unobtrusively complement the lack of semantic information, we suggest a new food recognition/classification method that focuses only on a physical response to food consumption. Experimental results indicate that our approach is able to show automatic abstraction of life experience. These daily events can then be used to create a personal model that can capture how a person reacts to different stimuli under specific conditions.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1156"]}
{"title": "Chemical impacts of the microbiome across scales reveal novel conjugated bile acids\n", "abstract": " A mosaic of cross-phyla chemical interactions occurs between all metazoans and their microbiomes. In humans, the gut harbors the heaviest microbial load, but many organs, particularly those with a mucosal surface, associate with highly adapted and evolved microbial consortia1. The microbial residents within these organ systems are increasingly well characterized, yielding a good understanding of human microbiome composition, but we have yet to elucidate the full chemical impact the microbiome exerts on an animal and the breadth of the chemical diversity it contributes2. A number of molecular families are known to be shaped by the microbiome including short-chain fatty acids, indoles, aromatic amino acid metabolites, complex polysaccharides, and host lipids; such as sphingolipids and bile acids3\u201311. These metabolites profoundly affect host physiology and are being explored for their roles in both health and disease. Considering the diversity of the human microbiome, numbering over 40,000 operational taxonomic units12, a plethora of molecular diversity remains to be discovered. Here, we use unique mass spectrometry informatics approaches and data mapping onto a murine 3D-model13\u201315 to provide an untargeted assessment of the chemical diversity between germ-free (GF) and colonized mice (specific-pathogen free, SPF), and report the finding of novel bile acids produced by the microbiome in both mice and humans that have evaded characterization despite 170 years of research on bile acid chemistry16.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

{"title": "A bandit approach to sequential experimental design with false discovery control\n", "abstract": " We propose an adaptive sampling approach for multiple testing which aims to maximize statistical power while ensuring anytime false discovery control. We consider n distributions whose means are partitioned by whether they are below or equal to a baseline (nulls), versus above the baseline (actual positives). In addition, each distribution can be sequentially and repeatedly sampled. Inspired by the multi-armed bandit literature, we provide an algorithm that takes as few samples as possible to exceed a target true positive proportion (ie proportion of actual positives discovered) while giving anytime control of the false discovery proportion (nulls predicted as actual positives). Our sample complexity results match known information theoretic lower bounds and through simulations we show a substantial performance improvement over uniform sampling and an adaptive elimination style algorithm. Given the simplicity of the approach, and its sample efficiency, the method has promise for wide adoption in the biological sciences, clinical testing for drug discovery, and online A/B/n testing problems.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

This helps improve the sensitivity of existing current-based protection which can be subjected to sensitivity issues given the evolving distribution grids with multiple generation sites. The analysis of the voltage transient immediately after a disturbance can provide much useful information about the nature of the disturbance, which may otherwise be hidden. Therefore, augmenting transient based fault detection to existing techniques can improve the system protection. The proposed algorithm analyses the relative and individual content of high and low wavelet-level coefficients to reliably detect faults, and not trigger during non-fault disturbances like capacitor switching. The performance of the element is validated using results from power system simulation models and field event reports.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

Currently available auditory testing methods include both behavioural and non-behavioural or objective tests of hearing. This study was planned with an objective to assess hearing loss in children using behavioural observation audiometry and brain stem evoked response audiometry.Methods: A total of 105 cases suffering from severe to profound hearing loss were registered. After proper history and clinical examination patients were subjected to behavioural observation audiometry (BOA) and brainstem evoked response audiometry test (BERA).Results: Out of 105 cases in 62 cases (59.05%) the findings of both BOA and BERA tests were similar but in 43 cases the findings of both tests were not similar. In total 18 cases (17.14%) diagnosis of severe hearing loss could be made by BERA test only because of in 10 cases there was inconclusive BOA finding and in 8 cases there was no response in BOA test.Conclusions: Behavioural observation audiometry can detect hearing loss but in developmentally retardrd children in whom responses are difficult to elicited, this test is not so conclusive. BERA is the tool which can confirm the normal sensitivity of hearing in such persons whenever required and is very useful in early detection of hearing loss and planning rehabilitative procedures.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

The recommendations based on the current state-of-the-art technologies pertain to: selection of viscosity grade bitumen; amount of natural sand in fine aggregate; Marshall mix design procedures in the latest Asphalt Institute MS-2; mixing and compaction temperatures based on viscosity graded bitumen; minimum mat compaction density based on theoretical maximum specific gravity of loose mix; and quality acceptance criteria. It has been recommended to have only one specification each for all dense graded bituminous mixes used in base course, binder course, and wearing course. Together, all recommendations form guidelines for obtaining long lasting pavements in India.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1156"]}
{"title": "Emission modeling of styrene from vinyl ester resins with low hazardous air pollutant contents\n", "abstract": " Styrene is a commonly used co-monomer in vinyl ester (VE) resins, which acts as a reactive diluent and is required in most liquid molding fabrication methods to reduce viscosity and improve overall resin performance. Resins containing low hazardous air pollutant contents have been developed to reduce the styrene emissions during composite fabrication. VE monomers with a bimodal molecular weight distribution have been used to effectively decrease the amount of styrene in the system while maintaining low resin viscosities. Fatty acid vinyl ester (FAVE) resins partially replace styrene with non-volatile fatty acid monomers to reduce styrene emissions. The emissions from bimodal and FAVE resins were measured as a function of time and various parameters, including styrene content, VE molecular weight, and fatty acid monomer content and chain length. The initial emission rate from VE resins is only\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

This environment poses a number of challenges which include achieving scalability while accessing all the available media, live and archived, inferring its context, and delivering media to all interested parties with its context attached. We envision a solution to this set of challenges in a novel system architecture. As a starting point, however, we select a previously described framework, Event-Web [7], suitable for annotating raw multimedia data with context meaningful to end users. We then map it onto a distributed architecture capable of correlating, analyzing, and transporting the volumes of data characteristic of the problem space.

{"title": "Co-administration of melatonin reverses the Tinprotoporphyrin (SnPP) induced decline of Cytochrome P450 content in vivo in rats\n", "abstract": " Melatonin (N-acetyl-5 methoxytryptamine) is a low molecular weight antioxidant and is an endogeneous defence system against the deleterious actions of the extremely reactive hydroxyl radical. Among the enzymes that participate in the antioxidant functions is cytochrome P-450, a stalwart of the detoxification system in the body. Our results revealed that tin-protoporphyrin administration brought about a marked decline in cytochrome P-450 levels. This decline was, however, reversed by the co-administration of the antioxidant, melatonin. Thus, the enhanced antioxidant status in melatonin-treated rats may act as a protective mediator of various pharmacological functions altered during tin-protoporphyrin (an antihyperbilirubemenic agent) administration to Wistar rats.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1156"]}
{"title": "Semiorder database for complex activity recognition in multi-sensory environments\n", "abstract": " A prototype semiorder database used for activity recognition in multi-sensory monitoring environments is described. Activities are spatio-temporal compositions of events, which are a type of atomic semantic units for such compositions. The focus is on the temporal composition of activities from events in the presence of bounded duration of temporal uncertainty in an event occurrence. Such temporal uncertainty forces the concurrency between event occurrences to be intransitive. Under certain assumptions, a subclass of partial orders, known as semiorders, models such intransitive concurrency appropriately. The semiorder database stores events and their semiorder temporal order of occurrences. A semiorder data model and the corresponding query language that embeds a semiorder pattern language are the main constituents of the semiorder database.

Typical stereo algorithms produce sparse depth maps and cannot be used to distinguish between holes and solid objects in the environment. The authors present a novel methodology for creating a three-dimensional model of the environment. They divide the environment into a set of disjoint cells. Using multiple images obtained from different view points, they estimate the mean and variance of intensity observed for each cell. The computed variance can be used to distinguish between empty and full cells in the environment. The technique, unlike the typical stereo methodology, does not rely on solving the correspondence problem. The resulting model of the environment is dense and can be used directly for navigation.

Each day, most people go to sleep without any idea about how their night's rest is going to be. For an activity that humans spend around a third of their life doing, there is a surprising amount of mystery around it. Despite current research, creating personalized sleep models in real-world settings has been challenging. Existing literature provides several connections between daily activities and sleep quality. Unfortunately, these insights do not generalize well in many individuals. For these reasons, it is important to create a personalized sleep model. This research proposes a sleep model that can identify causal relationships between daily activities and sleep quality and present the user with specific feedback about how their lifestyle affects their sleep. Our method uses N-of-1 experiments on longitudinal user data and event mining to generate understanding between lifestyle choices (exercise, eating, circadian rhythm) and their impact on sleep quality. Our experimental results identified and quantified relationships while extracting confounding variables through a causal framework. These insights can be used by the user or a personal health navigator to provide guidance in improving sleep.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

Using visual concepts in photos together with space and time information, we formulate the situation detection into a semi-supervised learning framework and propose new graph-based models to solve the problem. To extend the method for unknown situations, we introduce a soft label method which enables the traditional semi-supervised learning framework to accurately predict predefined labels as well as effectively form new clusters. To overcome the noisy data which degrades graph quality, leading to poor recognition results, we take advantage of two kinds of noise-robust norms which can eliminate the adverse effects of outliers in visual concepts and improve the accuracy of situation recognition.

{"title": "Issues in rotational (non-) invariance and image preprocessing\n", "abstract": " This paper addresses two problems that have been largely overlooked in the literature. First, many systems seek to use, and algorithms claim to provide, rotational in-variance, such as fingerprint minutiae or SIFT/SURF features. We introduce a statistical test for rotational independence, using lossless rotations to show the differences are statistically significant and cannot be attributed to image noise. We use this to experimentally show fingerprint feature extractors fail to be rotation independent. We show the popular\" rotation invariant\" SURF and SIFT feature extractors, used in both biometric and general vision, also fail the rotation independence test. We then introduce a match-twist-match (MTM) paradigm and experimentally demonstrate that, by reducing the effective angular difference between probe and gallery, we can improve system matching performance. Our analysis, using FVC2002 and FVC2004 datasets, further shows that differences in extracted features impact the overall system performance of fingerprint matching of both matchers tested.

It aims to extract interesting correlations, frequent patterns, associations or casual structures among sets of items in the transaction databases or other data repositories. However, no method has been shown to be able to handle data streams, as no method is scalable enough to manage the high rate which stream data arrive at. More recently, they have received attention from the data mining community and methods have been defined to automatically extract and maintain gradual rules from numerical databases. In this paper, we thus propose an original approach to mine data streams for Association rule mining. Our method is based on Q-Based and FP growth in order to speed up the process.

The adsorptive capacity of PACs are commonly characterized using aqueous-phase indices such as iodine (I2), methylene blue (MB), p-nitrophenol (PNP), molasses, and tannin. PACs may also be characterized using gas adsorption with nitrogen to develop detailed pore size distribution information. This paper describes the characterization of the internal porous nature of 12 PACs used in water treatment using both aqueous-and gaseous-phase methods. The results showed that the internal surface areas of PACs tended to be ordered: wood> bituminous coal> lignite coal. The results showed that the bituminous and lignite carbons had a majority of their internal pores in the microporous range (< 20\u00c5) whereas wood-based carbons tended to have a much wider pore size distribution well into the mesoporous range. The results showed that the molasses and tannin numbers correlated well with the total pore volume of pores greater than about 11\u00c5. The MB and I2 numbers correlated well with total surface area if the micropores below 11\u00c5 also were included.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

Ten cases each of reactive lymphadenitis and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) were included in the present study. Out of 10 cases of NHL, 5 cases each were of Low grade and High grade lymphomas. The morphometric analysis and quantification of AgNORs were curried out using a specific programme of an automatic image analysis Biovis Image measure version 1.0. The results revealed that mean AgNOR count was maximum in high grade lymphoma (5.17+/-0.255) when compared with low grade lymphoma (4.78+/-0.41) and reactive lymph nodes (2.45+/-0.486). Similarly, the mean of total AgNOR area in high grade lymphoma (511.9+/-41.52) was highest followed by low grade lymphoma (451.12+/-37.1) and reactive lymphadenitis (215+/-37).

The diffusion of point defects from higher concentration region to lower concentration region may give rise to the unpinning of some of the pinned dislocations, whose interaction with the color centers may cause the capture of their electrons. The captured electrons may move with the unpinned dislocations and they may subsequently be transported to different trapping centers. This process may give rise to the decay of coloration in the microcrystalline powders. Considering the decay of coloration by the unpinning of dislocations, an expression has been derived for the coloration decay in microcrystalline powders of alkali halides.

{"title": "Surface reconstruction using robust backpropagation\n", "abstract": " Conventional surface reconstruction methods often either require segmenting data into regions corresponding to piecewise smooth surface patches prior to reconstruction, or have difficulties in preserving discontinuities as well as removing severe noise effects such as outliers. The authors propose a new surface reconstruction method using multilayer feedforward neural networks. The parametric form represented by multilayer neural networks can model piecewise smooth surfaces in a way that is more general and flexible than many of the classical methods. The new approximation method is based upon a robust backpropagation (BP) algorithm, which is resistant to the noise effects and is capable of rejecting gross errors during the approximation process. The spirit of this algorithm comes from the pioneering work in robust statistics by Huber and Hampel.

The information about the environment is acquired by using multiple disparate sensors, from multiple viewpoints, and at multiple time instants.

A special class of coherent weakly non-linear modes as solutions to the wave equation describing R-T instability driven modes, is obtained. It is shown that the R-T modes in the equatorial F-region can evolve into coherent non-linear almost sinusoidal stationary wave structures. These structures are found to travel with a constant phase velocity and to have distorted sinusoidal shapes.

OLSR (Optimized Link State Routing) is a proactive or table driven routing protocol in MANETS which works on the principal of link sensing. These mobile nodes are battery operated and due to limited battery early death of node results in network partitioning. Energy becomes an important parameter to be conserved so design of energy efficient routing protocol is the need of hour for extending network lifetime. In this work, OLSR routing protocol is implemented according to modified Dijakstra\u2019s algorithm which works on residual energy of nodes. Proposed energy aware OLSR-MD is compared with conventional OLSR. Extensive simulations were performed using NS-2 Simulator, and simulation\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

One of the adequate clarifications to overwhelm this limitation is by using Cognitive Radios (CR). These networks are likely to boost spectrum consumption professionally by permitting Secondary Users (SUs) to take advantage of the use of the approved spectrum of primary users (PUs). CR is a kind of a sensible radio that can sense the extraneous surroundings, analyze the past and build perspicacious conclusions to switch its transmission factors in step with the current state of the atmosphere. An Ad-hoc Network engaging Cognitive Radios (CR) can often be termed as Cognitive Radio Adhoc Network (CRAHN). Routing in CRAHN is not an easy mission due to spectrum availability, power, link stability, etc. Among all the parameters, the one among the best parameter for route selection is throughput. Since several applications need a high value of throughput like Audio & Video Broadcasting, Interactive audio & Video Streaming, etc. and some require the low value of throughput like E-mail, Telnet, etc. This paper design a routing strategy based on finding an optimal throughput path using fuzzy logic. To show the efficiency of a designed scheme it is compared with the shortest path routing mechanism. Our result shows that the proposed method is efficient than Shortest Spectrum.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1156"]}
{"title": "Simulation based Performance Comparison & Analysis regarding Static and Mobile Throwboxes impact on Network Performance in Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) using ONE Simulator\n", "abstract": " Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) is another category of network that lacks continuous network connectivity. Nodes are dependent on opportunistic contacts for message forwarding. Every node has a buffer space where messages are stored till the messages are forwarded to other nodes existing the network, till the message reach the destination node. Buffer space is a crucial resource in DTNs. When a buffer space becomes full, to accommodate new messages, older messages are dropped from buffer space. As nodes in DTN are subject to high data loss and intermittent connection problems. To overcome this issue, relay nodes, i.e. Throwboxes are introduced into the network. Throwboxes are tiny, inexpensive devices, acting as additional storage units for nodes to enhance the overall DTN based network performance.

Inherently, this means using data to generate a list of recommendations for a given situation. The rapid growth of multi-modal wearables and sensors have not made this jump effectively in the domain of health. Modern user content consumption and decision making in both cyber (e.g. entertainment, news) and physical (eg. food, shopping) spaces rely heavily on targeted personalized recommender systems. The utility function is the primary ranking method to predict what a given person would explicitly prefer. In this work we describe two unique layers of user and context modeling that can be coupled to traditional recommender system approaches. The exogenous layer incorporates factors outside of the person's body (eg. location, weather, social context), while the endogenous layer integrates data to estimate the physiologic or innate needs of the user. This is accomplished through multi-modal sensor data integration applied to domain-specific utility functions, filters and re-ranking weights. We showcase this concept through a nutrition guidance system focused on controlling sodium intake at a personalized level, dramatically improving upon the fixed recommendations.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

Rising urbanization, energy consumption and subsequent emissions are putting pressure on city officials to institute policies and programs to make our urban buildings more energy efficient. One such strategy, energy benchmarking of buildings, has begun to be widely adopted by cities both within the United States and worldwide. Benchmarking programs facilitate or in some cases mandate the disclosure of energy consumption and other building characteristic (eg size, year built, assessed value) data of all buildings above a specified size threshold. Based on participation in numerous national initiatives, we estimate that over 50,000 building across the United States are currently or on track to collect benchmarking data. While municipalities aim to leverage such data in their energy efficiency policy and program decision-making, they currently lack a tool that can harness the depth of information embedded in multi-dimensional building data and visualize the results in a comprehendible manner.In this paper, we introduce a prototype visual data exploration tool for building benchmarking data. We introduce the underlying design methodology and apply our tool to a case study of data from 1,159 buildings in the City of Philadelphia Building Energy Benchmarking Initiative. Results demonstrate how policy makers can visually explore the data, intelligently identify specific buildings that require additional energy efficiency measures and augment decision-making regarding future city energy efficiency programs.

Power quality has become an important topic of discussion and research, especially in a deregulated environment. As per IEEE 519 std. these parameters of power quality measurement are four in number, of which Total Harmonic Distortion is most widely used. The power quality disturbances decrease the efficiency of power system equipments such as generators. Therefore the issue of power quality is important to both the consumers and the utility of electric power. There are many facets of power quality disturbances and each has its own source and mitigation techniques. The power system faults are important source of power quality disturbances. This paper deals with power quality improvement in four bus system during faulty conditions using double tuned filter to reduce the effects of disturbances on the generators. The four bus system having two load and two generator buses is modeled in MATLAB/Simulink environment. A fault is created near the load bus and power quality disturbances are detected near the generator bus and improved using double tuned filter near the generator bus under study. The Matlab results show the performance of double tuned filter in improvement of power quality disturbances during faulty conditions.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

{"title": "Human-centric control of video functions and underlying resources in 3D tele-immersive systems\n", "abstract": " 3D tele-immersion (3DTI) has the potential of enabling virtual reality interaction among remote people with real-time 3D video. However, today's 3DTI systems still suffer from various performance issues, limiting their broader deployment, due to the enormous demand on temporal (computing) and spatial (networking) resources. Past research focused on system-centric approaches for technical optimization, without taking human users into the loop. We argue that human factors (including user preferences, semantics, limitations, etc.) are an important and integral part of the cyber-physical 3DTI systems, and should not be neglected. This thesis proposes a comprehensive, human-centric framework for managing video data and functions across the 3DTI pipeline. Our approach is comprehensive because it involves all components of the video function pipeline.

The network is ad-hoc because it does not rely on a preexisting infrastructure, such as routers in wired networks or access points in managed (infrastructure) wireless networks. Wireless is a term used to describe telecommunications in which electromagnetic waves carry the signal over part or the entire communication path. This paper evaluates about propagation models, their path loss behavior, propagation mechanisms, and propagation prediction techniques. A propagation model is a set of mathematical expressions, diagrams, and algorithms used to represent the radio characteristics of a given environment. Generally, the prediction models can be either empirical or theoretical, or a combination of both. The accuracy of any particular propagation model in any given condition will depend on the suitability among the constraints required by the model\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

The sensor and its package design are analogous to the structural design and the transduction process of a human-ear cochlea. The sensor responds when nanowires shear against the fixed membrane, in response to the motion of the flexible membrane on interaction with the acoustic waves. This results in a change in the magnetic flux in the nanowires, which is converted into electrical voltage by a giant magnetoresistive (GMR) sensor. As the acoustic sensor is designed for underwater applications, packaging is a key issue for the effective working of this sensor.

This is clearly evident from the seven-fold increase in numbers of critical and overexploited assessment units, which have increased from 6 during 1984 to 43 as of 2004, over a period of two centuries. These units show decline in water levels and in certain situations sharp deterioration in groundwater quality. The coastal aquifers are also under stress where excessive groundwater development has led to progressive deterioration in groundwater quality. The sustainability of the groundwater resources in the highly stressed aquifers in these areas has assumed criticality and its capability to meet the basic needs for economic development in its present status needs to be addressed through scientifically sound management interventions. This paper incorporates a river basin-wise review of groundwater levels, with special reference to the water stressed aquifers in Gujarat.

Hearts with increased antioxidant capacity have been reported to be more resistant to in vivo and in vitro oxidative stress. On the other hand, cardiomyopathy with heart failure is accompanied by increased free radicals and lipid peroxidation and a relative deficit in \u2018antioxidant reserve\u2019may contribute to the decompensated state. The aim of this study was to assess the status of oxidative stress by a study on level variation of pro-oxidant malonaldehyde (MDA) and antioxidant ceruloplasmin (Cp) in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy of ischemic and idiopathic etiology. 76 dilated cardiomyopathy patients (52 men and 24 women, ages 2 years to 65 years) of which 42 are of idiopathic (primary cases) and 34 are of ischemic etiology (secondary cases), and 100 healthy volunteers matched for age and sex were considered for the level variation of MDA and Cp. A significant increase in the patient group compared to controls (P< 0.01, 0.05), was observed in both pro-oxidant malonaldehyde and antioxidant ceruloplasmin levels, which can be correlated to membrane susceptibility to peroxidation as well as increased free radical generation in patients. We conclude that in patients with idiopathic or ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, increased antioxidant levels may be in response to the increased peroxidation. Thereby, protecting the heart muscle from further degradation/tissue injury and conferring resistance to free radical generation in such patients.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

{"title": "VLSI architectures for high-speed range estimation\n", "abstract": " Depth recovery from gray-scale images is an important topic in the field of computer and robot vision. Intensity gradient analysis (IGA) is a robust technique for inferring depth information from a sequence of images acquired by a sensor undergoing translational motion. IGA obviates the need for explicitly solving the correspondence problem and hence is an efficient technique for range estimation. Many applications require real time processing at very high frame rates. The design of special purpose hardware could significantly speed up the computations in IGA. In this paper, we propose two VLSI architectures for high-speed range estimation based on IGA. The architectures fully utilize the principles of pipelining and parallelism in order to obtain high speed and throughput. The designs are conceptually simple and suitable for implementation in VLSI.< >", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

Recent advances in wearable and mobile technology have generated increased interest in digital mental healthcare that enables individuals to address episodic mental health symptoms. However, these efforts are typically reactive and symptom-focused and do not provide comprehensive, wrap-around, customized treatments that capture an individual's holistic mental health model as it unfolds over time. Recognizing that each individual is unique, we present the notion of Personalized Mental Health Navigation (MHN): a therapist-in-the-loop, cybernetic goal-based system that deploys a continuous cyclic loop of measurement, estimation, guidance, to steer the individual's mental health state towards a healthy zone. We outline the major components of MHN that is premised on the development of an individual's personal mental health state, holistically represented by a high-dimensional cover of multiple knowledge layers such as emotion, biological patterns, sociology, behavior, and cognition.

In this modern era, energy planners are aiming to increase electricity supply in India by using oil, gas, nuclear, and renewable energy sources. For the past few years, India has been one of the leading world producers of renewable energy [1]. Renewable energy is the energy that is directly collected from renewable sources such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, etc. It often provides energy for electricity generation, air and water heating/cooling, transportation, and rural (off-grid) energy services [2, 3]. At present coal-based thermal power plants are the major source of electricity generation and they will continue to dominate in the next few decades. One of the major disadvantages of coal-based thermal power plants is a problem with fly ash disposal. It was earlier considered as a total waste and an environmental hazard so its use was limited but without much comprehension. Fortunately, because of its useful properties, it has now begun to be considered a useful raw material for various applications [4, 5]. Fly ash is a byproduct of burning pulverized coal in electric power generating plants. During combustion, mineral impurities in the coal (clay, feldspar, quartz, and shale) fuse in suspension and float out of the combustion chamber with the exhaust gases. As the fused material rises, it cools and solidifies into spherical glassy particles called fly ash [6]. There are numerous advantages of fly ash utilization such as energy-saving, protection of environment and agriculture. In construction it can also partly replace cement [7].

We can build such models using food logging platforms that capture the users\u2019 food events. As proposed in the Westermann and Jain event model, capturing six facets of multi-modal data provides a holistic view of any event. Five of these facets are temporally captured during the event (temporal, structural, informational, experiential, spatial), while the sixth facet is related to the causality of the event. This causal facet is needed to build a robust PFM if all the other relevant information in the aforementioned five facets are captured. Any food logger and subsequent processing should collect all this data in the food event. Ultimately, we want to know what caused this person to eat this food and what this food event causes changes in the person\u2019s health state. In this paper, we identify details of the food event model that may help build a causal understanding in PFM to address the first aspect of the causality, what may be the contextual factors that cause a certain food event to occur for a user. We utilize an event mining approach to determine the causal relationships to build a contextual understanding of the PFM. We generate data using a food event simulator that can generate needed food event data for a person with known PFM.

{"title": "Combination of Virtual Private Network and Wireless Sensor Network: Protection Against The Interference Problem of IOT\n", "abstract": " As the era of the Internet of Things (IoT) is emerging rapidly, the interference problem is also increasing at the same pace. In IoT based connections, as we know that devices share a common communication channel to interact with each other, the interference problem arises as all the devices are connected. Once an attacker gains access to any of the devices in an IoT enabled network, the whole IoT network becomes susceptible to breach. The biggest example of it is the IoT enabled CCTV hacking. In this work, we are proposing the usage of Virtual Private Network (VPN) and Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) to create a virtual environment and to protect each device from IP address breach that is connected to an IoT network. Using VPN, each IoT device will gain their own virtual environment which will enable it for using a dynamic IP address to connect to another IoT device\u2019s virtual environment.

{"title": "Dual-band electromagnetically induced transparency effect in asymmetrically coupled terahertz metamaterials\n", "abstract": " In this article, we numerically and experimentally investigate a metamaterial geometry capable of exhibiting dual-band electromagnetic induced transparency (EIT) effect in terahertz frequency regime. The meta-molecule unit consists of two asymmetric C resonators, placed alternately on both sides of a cut-wire (CW). The near field coupling between the CW and C resonators of the MM structure leads to the evolution of the dual-band EIT effect. We observe that the dual-band EIT effect can be modulated by changing the distance between the CW and the 2C resonators.

Exposure to pollutants such as airborne particulate matter and ozone has been associated with increases in morbidity and mortality, especially with regards to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Unfortunately, individuals do not have readily accessible methods by which to track their exposure to pollution. This paper proposes how pollution parameters like CO, NO2, O3, PM2.5, PM10 and SO2 can be monitored for respiratory and cardiovascular personalized health during outdoor exercise events. Using location tracked activities, we synchronize them to public data sets of pollution sensors.

{"title": "Surface Type Estimation from GPS Tracked Bicycle Activities\n", "abstract": " Road conditions affect both machine and human powered modes of transportation. In the case of human powered transportation, poor road conditions increase the work for the individual to travel. Previous estimates for these parameters have used computationally expensive analysis of satellite images. In this work, we use a computationally inexpensive and simple method by using only GPS data from a human powered cyclist. By estimating if the road taken by the user has high or low variations in their directional vector, we classify if the user is on a paved road or on an unpaved trail. In order to do this, three methods were adopted, changes in frequency of the direction of slope in a given path segment, fitting segments of the path, and finding the first derivative and the number of points of zero crossings of each segment. Machine learning models such as support vector machines, K-nearest neighbors, and decision trees were used for the classification of the path. We show in our methods, the decision trees performed the best with an accuracy of 86\\%. Estimation of the type of surface can be used for many applications such as understanding rolling resistance for power estimation estimation or building exercise recommendation systems by user profiling as described in detail in the paper.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

Many national, state and local variables other than wind potential play a role in site selection. The weights given to different local variables during wind power investment decisions are not known and are difficult to estimate in data paucity settings in India. Accordingly, this study proposes a framework to estimate the weights given to different local parameters in wind power investment decisions.

In this approach, the sub-carriers are initially allocated considering the equal power distribution. Then, a fair allocation of sub-carriers is achieved in such a way that comparatively equal data rate is obtained for all competing users and no user is completely starved; and the minimum desired sum rate is achieved in case a low channel gain user has been assigned the sub-carrier. Upon completion of the sub-channels allocation to all secondary users (SUs), the power allocation for each user is performed by means of the water-filling algorithm.

Instead of selecting the cluster head randomly, we include chain forming concept of PEGASIS (Power Efficient Gathering in Sensor Information System). In our work we consider heterogeneous nodes. Unlike LEACH, proposed protocol uses the selection criteria for Cluster-Head depending on the residual energy of the nodes and relative distance of cluster heads.

The current definition of delirium describes as acute and fluctuating disturbance of consciousness with reduced ability to focus, maintain, or shift attention, accompanied by change in cognition and perceptual disturbances secondary to a general medical condition [1]. It must be differentiated from emergence delirium (ED), which occurs immediately following extubation. Both the definition of emergence delirium and the phrasing (delirium, confusion, excitement, agitation) vary, as does its onset interval (upon awakening, within the few hours, days or weeks). Another difficulty is the quantification of this agitation as there is no specific scale [2]. A study by Lepouse found that probable", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

It is polymicrobial in nature. Till recently the emphasis has been given on identification of microbial flora associated with perforation peritonitis. The aim of this study was to determine the significance of intraoperative peritoneal fluid culture of fungus and to establish the indications for treatment. Methods: Fifty three patients admitted with a Perforated peptic ulcer (PPU) were studied. Clinical data and peritoneal fluid for culture were collected. Risk factors for a positive peritoneal fluid culture of fungus and outcome were evaluated and related to the development of surgical site infection, duration of hospital stay and mortality rate.Results: 53 with a PPU were included; 24 (45.2 per cent) had positive peritoneal fluid fungal culture. Age, preoperative organ failure, delay in operation, high Mannheim Peritonitis Index (MPI) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores, and preoperative antibiotic therapy were risk factors for a positive fungal culture. Sex and an MPI score of 20 or more remained significant in multivariate analysis (P< 0\u00b7 001). Patients with a positive fungal culture had a higher incidence of surgical site infection, a longer hospital stay and a significantly higher mortality rate, especially when this was combined with a high MPI score.Conclusion: Positive peritoneal fungal culture was common and was a significant risk factor for adverse outcome in patients with a PPU. A high MPI score could be used as an indicator for prophylactic antifungal therapy.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

It provides an on demand service to its users using the Internet. It provides the users with the resources as per their demand and also enables the users to pay as per their usage of resources. The users can access the cloud anytime using the Internet. Such features eliminate the requirement of carrying documentation for the users as the cloud can be accessed globally and remotely by the user. But, this introduces the possibility of security breaches or intruder attacks while the user interacts with the cloud database. In this paper, some of the security concerns while using a Cloud based Online Judge will be addressed using new approaches. An Online Judge is a system which takes a code, compiles it, checks for compilation errors, and executes the code by giving it some hidden inputs and capturing the output produced after it. It checks for runtime errors and finally matches the output with the expected output from the solution. The Online Judge system is very important for grading of coding assignments and for programming contests as it can include the constraints on the solutions for source code limit and various resources such as time and space requirements. It also removes the subjective nature in the grading system of coding assignments. The Online judge faces various security issues at authorization level and access rights of users. There is also possibility of a user running a malicious code on the judge thus harming the server or other resources. In this paper we address such issues.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

Merrill) is also known as Golden bean and Miracle crop of 21st century due to its rich source of protein, amino acid and satisfactory proportion of carbohydrates for predominantly vegetarian population. Soybean belongs to the order Fabales, the family Fabaceae, the subfamily Faboidae and the genus Glycine. Soybean is a diploidized allotetraploid (2n= 40), autogamous plant. They account for roughly one fifth of the total area under food grain crops and contribute about one-twelfth of the total food grain production in India.The use of biochemical marker (allozyme or Isozyme) analysis has been used for over 60 years for various research purposes in biology, viz., to study population genetics, to delineate phylogenetic relationships, to estimate genetic variability and taxonomy, and in developmental biology, towards characterization in plant genetic resources management as well as plant breeding. Isozymes are the biochemical markers of choice for initiating or advancing genetic studies of plants. Isozymes are the multiple molecular forms of an enzyme sharing catalytic activity as derived from tissues of an organism (Markert and Moller, 1959)[14]. Since isozymes are direct gene products, the banding patterns so obtained, called zymograms, can be effectively correlated to the genetic make-up of the particular sample. These zymograms are analogous to\" fingerprints\".

Dynamic Wireless Sensor Network (DWSN) supports mobility of sensor nodes such that nodes with similar characteristics dynamically form a group which is called a cluster. Each cluster consists of a Cluster head which collects and send the aggregated data to a base station (BS). BS manages node mobility and authentication for each node. Hence for such systems security is a concern and there is a need of secure and energy efficient communication algorithm for these low power devices. One solution to address these security concerns for such systems is Public Key Encryption like ECC. Seung-Hyun Seo et al. introduced CLEKM to overcome various drawbacks in previous solutions by providing low overhead for certificate exchange and more security management by using different keys such as pair wise key, individual key etc. In this paper we tend to enhance the security by adding redundant BS for distributing the key management activity, and use HEED clustering algorithm for enhancing the energy efficiency.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

This study tries to develop one such extraction process for phenolic acid extraction from Phyllanthus amarus Schum and Thonn. The study selected cold solvent extraction as rurally relevant technology and performed laboratory level analysis of phenolic acid extraction from sample using two different extraction processes methods. Method I was made sophisticated and costly process with lower solvent to sample ratio while Method II was made simple rural level process with higher solvent to sample ratio which can be easily adapted to the rural areas. The results showed that the phenolic acid yield was better in Method II compared to Method I due to better solvent to sample ratio despite having simpler technology. This study concluded that simpler technologies which are rurally relevant can be developed with proper selection of parameters, which improve programme acceptability and rural livelihoods.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

They can\u2019t find logical relations among alerts. In addition, IDS\u2019s accuracy is low; a lot of alerts are false alerts. To reduce this problem we propose a hybrid approach which is the combination of K-Medoids clustering and Na\u00efve-Bayes classification. The proposed approach will be clustering all data into the corresponding group before applying a classifier for classification purpose. The proposed work will explore Na\u00efve-Bayes Classification and K-medoid methods for intrusion detection and how it will useful for IDS. The reasons for introducing Na\u00efve Bayes Classification are the involvement of many features where there is no dividation between normal operations and anomalies. Thus Na\u00efve Bayes Classification can be mined to find the abstract correlation among different security features. In this, we will present implementation results on existing intrusion detection system and K-medoid cluster technique with Na\u00efve Bayes classification for intrusion detection system. An experiment is carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach using our own created dataset.

They are considered to be an excellent material for reducing vehicle weight, lowering fuel consumption and, thereby, reducing CO2 emissions [1]. Magnesium is the lightest of all the engineering metals, having very low density of 1.74 gm/cm 3 that is only 65% of aluminum (2.7 g/cm 3) and 25% of iron (7.86 g/cm 3). Thus, magnesium is used in the applications where weight reducing of the products is of significant concern.One of the main reasons, limiting or even preventing larger scale use of light magnesium for various applications is their high corrosion susceptibility. Magnesium is a very reactive metal, when exposed to environments containing aggressive species because its native oxide film rapidly dissolves in contact with moisture therefore, improving the corrosion protection of Mg without the loss of high strength/weight ratio is a real challenge that can lead to break-through in many industrial areas [1].", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

Attempts in the literature employ complicated features and recognition engines in trying to cope with the variety of symbols. But this makes the process slow. In contrast, objective of less time consumption can be achieved by either reducing the number of features by PCA or by reducing the number of samples. The proposed method focuses on reduction of samples by using simple density features with utilization of hierarchical clustering to make the process fast.

CALPUFF is a suite of 3 numerical models used in series to determine predicted pollution concentrations. Details of the simulation program were presented, and its performance was evaluated through an analysis of the Williams Lake airshed in British Columbia. CALMET is a diagnostic computer model that produces a detailed 3-D field of meteorological parameters based on surface and upper air measurements, digital land use data, and terrain data. The 3-D fields produced by CALMET are then used by CALPUFF to calculate the dispersion of emissions over distances of a few metres to hundreds of kilometres. CALPOST is a statistical processing program used to summarize and tabulate the concentrations calculated by CALPUFF. The dispersion of emissions from point, area, and mobile sources in the Williams Lake airshed was simulated using data collected between June 2003 to June 2004 to establish a baseline. Baseline modelling was then compared with ambient monitoring data in the airshed to determine sources of error and model accuracy. Airshed boundaries were defined by UTM grid coordinates. Modelling domain boundaries were defined by the map of the Williams Lake region, which also showed the locations of industrial sources and air quality monitors used in the comparison with the model. The ambient concentrations that were predicted by the dispersion model were compared with the ambient air quality objectives and guidelines applicable to the Williams Lake Airshed and regulated by both provincial and federal governments.

For comparison, the human dataset was processed by a statistical classifier. Quantitative accuracy of the algorithm is assessed by the use of a phantom. This work demonstrates that the Liou-Jain technique is effective in automatically detecting anatomical organ and lesion surfaces in 3D datasets and in obtaining volume estimates.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1156"]}
{"title": "Visual Motion Analysis Using Feedback\n", "abstract": " This paper presents a feedback scheme for estimating a linear global model of the image plane motion. This estimation uses a sparse image velocity field. The orientation of the individual pixel motion is treated as a vector field and a global model is estimated. The model to be estimated is chosen based on the type of motion of the robot as measured by independent sensors. The use of orientation of pixel motion makes the model independent of the structure of the scene.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

Fourier imaging is used to observe the evolving topography of wafers as they are being  etched in a reactive ion etcher. The focus of the research described in this paper is the segmentation and analysis of images generated from FI. A brief overview of the theory of FI is presented. Segmentation of a Fourier image is done in three steps; local maxima detection, Fourier component extent identification, and boundary tracking. Quantification descriptions for each component are then generated from the segmented image. The algorithm presented demonstrates how it is possible to obtain subpixel resolution automatically in image analysis to collect data that may be used to compute critical dimensions of the microtopography of the wafer substrate.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1156"]}

In most robotic applications, the environment is known and several aspects of it may be controlled. The knowledge about the environment may be used by image understanding algorithms to facilitate the recovery of information from images.

We demonstrate the role of such knowledge in robotic applications for recovering information in dynamic scenes. In the first application, the knowledge of ego-motion parameters of a mobile robot is used for segmentation of a scene and recovery of depth information. In the second application, a hypothesize and test approach is used to find road edges in real scenes for an autonomous vehicle.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1156"]}
{"title": "Segmentation through symbolic surface descriptions\n", "abstract": " Perception of surfaces plays a key role in three-dimensional object recognition. Recognition of three-dimensional objects from their images is performed by matching perceived surface descriptions with stored models of objects. The first step in object recognition is the segmentation of an image. If the pixels of a digital surface can be correctly grouped into symbolic surface descriptions that have meaningful interpretations based only on general knowledge of surfaces, this grouping process would provide a fundamental service to higher level matching (recognition) processes. In this paper, an approach for image segmentation in terms of symbolic surface descriptions is discussed. Our approach may be con-sidered stimulus bound in that it considers that the ultimate truth is the sensed image data, and hence the output o all processes should conform to the sensed values. Range images offer a simpler domain to study grouping processes for segmentation than intensity images because depth values depend only on geometry, not on reflectance and illumination. Since the problems of range image segmentation are also encountered in the more difficult intensity image segmentation, an effective solution to those problems will be extremely useful to both areas. Our experimental results indicate excellent segmentation performance on range images and support the statement that techniques for range image segmentation may be successfully applied to intensity images.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1156"]}
