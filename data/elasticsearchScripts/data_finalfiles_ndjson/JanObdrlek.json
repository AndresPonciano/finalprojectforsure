We consider the natural adaptation of this game to directed graphs and show that monotone strategies in the game yield a measure, called dag-width, that can be seen to describe how close a directed graph is to a directed acyclic graph (dag). We also provide an associated decomposition and show how it is useful for developing algorithms on directed graphs. In particular, we show that the problem of determining the winner of a parity game is solvable in polynomial time on graphs of bounded dag-width.

Bova, Ganian and Szeider [CSL-LICS'14] initiated the study of the complexity of FO model checking on partially ordered sets (posets). Bova, Ganian and Szeider showed that model checking existential FO logic is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) on posets of bounded width, where the width of a poset is the size of the largest antichain in the poset.

{"title": "Algorithmic analysis of parity games\n", "abstract": " Parity games are discrete infinite games of two players with complete information. There are two main motivations to study parity games. Firstly the problem of deciding a winner in a parity game is polynomially equivalent to the modal \u00b5-calculus model checking, and therefore is very important in the field of computer aided verification. Secondly it is the intriguing status of parity games from the point of view of complexity theory. Solving parity games is one of the few natural problems in the class NP\u2229 co-NP (even in UP\u2229 co-UP), and there is no known polynomial time algorithm, despite the substantial amount of effort to find one.In this thesis we add to the body of work on parity games. We start by presenting parity games and explaining the concepts behind them, giving a survey of known algorithms, and show their relationship to other problems. In the second part of the thesis we want to answer the following question: Are there classes of graphs on which we can solve parity games in polynomial time? Tree-width has long been considered the most important connectivity measure of (undirected) graphs, and we give a polynomial algorithm for solving parity games on graphs of bounded tree-width. However treewidth is not the most concise measure for directed graphs, on which the parity games are played. We therefore introduce a new connectivity measure for directed graphs called DAG-width. We show several properties of this measure, including its relationship to other measures, and present a polynomialtime algorithm for solving parity games on graphs of bounded DAG-width of [BDHK06].

{"title": "Efficient loop navigation for symbolic execution\n", "abstract": " Symbolic execution is a successful technique used in software verification and testing. A key limitation of symbolic execution is in dealing with code containing loops. We introduce a technique which, given a start location above some loops and a target location anywhere below these loops, returns a feasible path between these two locations, if such a path exists. The technique infers a collection of constraint systems from the program and uses them to steer the symbolic execution towards the target. On reaching a loop it iteratively solves the appropriate constraint system to find out which path through this loop to take, or, alternatively, whether to continue below the loop. To construct the constraint systems we express the values of variables modified in a loop as functions of the number of times a given path through the loop was executed.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["706"]}

However, despite intensive work on the subject, there still exist well-established hard problems where neither a parameterized algorithm nor a theoretical obstacle to its existence are known. Our article is interested mainly in the digraph case, targeting the well-known Minimum Leaf Out-Branching (cf. also Minimum Leaf Spanning Tree) and Edge Disjoint Paths problems on digraphs of bounded clique-width with non-standard new approaches. The first part of the article deals with the Minimum Leaf Out-Branching problem and introduces a novel XP-time algorithm wrt. clique-width. We remark that this problem is known to be W [2]-hard, and that our algorithm does not resemble any of the previously published attempts solving special cases of it such as the Hamiltonian Path. The second part then looks at the Edge Disjoint Paths problem (both on graphs and digraphs) from a different perspective--rather surprisingly showing that this problem has a definition in the MSO_1 logic of graphs. The linear-time FPT algorithm wrt. clique-width then follows as a direct consequence.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["706"]}

Our focus on a formally clean and unified approach for the considered algorithmic problems is in contrast with many previous published XP algorithms running on graphs of bounded clique-width, which mostly used ad hoc techniques and ideas. The new contributions include faster algorithms for computing the chromatic number and the chromatic polynomial on graphs of bounded rank-width, and new algorithms for solving the defective colouring, the min-leaf outbranching, and the directed cut problems.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["706"]}
{"title": "When trees grow low: Shrub-depth and m-partite cographs\n", "abstract": " The recent increase of interest in the graph invariant called tree-depth and in its algorithmic applications leads to a natural question: Is there an analogously useful \u201cdepth\u201d notion also for dense graphs (say; one which is stable by graph complementation)? To this end we introduce the notion of shrub-depth of a graph class which is related to the established notion of clique-width in a similar way as tree-depth is related to tree-width. We also introduce a common extension of cographs and of classes with bounded shrub-depth\u2014m-partite cographs, which are well-quasi-ordered by the relation \u201cbeing an induced subgraph of\u201d and therefore allow polynomial time testing of any hereditary properties.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["706"]}

{"title": "FO Model Checking of Interval Graphs\n", "abstract": " We study the computational complexity of the FO model checking problem on interval graphs, i.e., intersection graphs of intervals on the real line. The main positive result is that FO model checking and successor-invariant FO model checking can be solved in time O(n log n) for n-vertex interval graphs with representations containing only intervals with lengths from a prescribed finite set. We complement this result by showing that the same is not true if the lengths are restricted to any set that is dense in an open subset, e.g., in the set .", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["706"]}
{"title": "Faster Existential FO Model Checking on Posets\n", "abstract": " We prove that the model checking problem for the existential fragment of first-order (FO) logic on partially ordered sets is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) with respect to the formula and the width of a poset (the maximum size of an antichain). While there is a long line of research into FO model checking on graphs, the study of this problem on posets has been initiated just recently by Bova, Ganian and Szeider (CSL-LICS 2014), who proved that the existential fragment of FO has an FPT algorithm for a poset of fixed width. We improve upon their result in two ways: (1) the runtime of our algorithm is O(f(|{\\phi}|,w).n^2) on n-element posets of width w, compared to O(g(|{\\phi}|). n^{h(w)}) of Bova et al., and (2) our proofs are simpler and easier to follow. We complement this result by showing that, under a certain complexity-theoretical assumption, the existential FO model checking problem does not have a polynomial kernel.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["706"]}
