However, many QoS values are unknown in reality. Therefore, it is necessary to predict the unknown QoS values of Web services based on the obtainable QoS values.

However, the QoS values may be contributed from unreliable users, leading to inaccuracy of the prediction results. To address this problem, we present a highly credible approach, called reputation-based Matrix Factorization (RMF), for predicting the unknown Web service QoS values.

Ethereum is a blockchain-based platform supporting smart contracts. The open nature of blockchain makes the transaction data on Ethereum completely public, and also brings unprecedented opportunities for the transaction network analysis. By taking the realistic rules and features of transaction networks into consideration, we first model the Ethereum transaction network as a Temporal Weighted Multidigraph (TWMDG), where each node is a unique Ethereum account and each edge represents a transaction weighted by amount and assigned with timestamp. Then we define the problem of Temporal Weighted Multidigraph Embedding (T-EDGE) by incorporating both temporal and weighted information of the edges, the purpose being to capture more comprehensive properties of dynamic transaction networks. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed embedding method, we conduct experiments of node classification on real-world transaction data collected from Ethereum. Experimental results demonstrate that T-EDGE outperforms baseline embedding methods, indicating that time-dependent walks and multiplicity characteristic of edges are informative and essential for time-sensitive transaction networks.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["446"]}

As a result, SUs usually suffer from the poor network connectivity due to the high interference caused by PUs. Different from omni-directional antennas, directional antennas can concentrate the transmission on some desired directions and reduce interference on other undesired directions. In this paper, we investigate the network connectivity of a novel cognitive radio ad hoc network with directional antennas (DIR-CRAHNs), in which both PUs and SUs are equipped with directional antennas. We derive the local connectivity (i.e., probability of node isolation) of such DIR-CRAHNs in closed form and numerical results show that the proposed DIR-CRAHNs have higher local connectivity than conventional cognitive radio ad hoc\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["446"]}

To address this problem, we propose a model called Weight-based Matrix Factorization (WMF), which can capture user-specific interests and give a more accurate prediction on these apps. WMF views each user as a document and each app as a word, and calculates the weight of each app for target users.

Currently, most works on attacking GNNs are mainly using gradient information to guide the attack and achieve outstanding performance. However, the high complexity of time and space makes them unmanageable for large scale graphs and becomes the major bottleneck that prevents the practical usage. We argue that the main reason is that they have to use the whole graph for attacks, resulting in the increasing time and space complexity as the data scale grows. In this work, we propose an efficient Simplified Gradient-based Attack (SGA) method to bridge this gap.

However, most of the existing methods like spectral clustering suffer from the sparsity, scalability, robustness and handling high dimensional raw information in clustering. To address this issue, we propose a deep probabilistic model, called Variational Graph Embedding and Clustering with Laplacian Eigenmaps (VGECLE), which learns node embeddings and assigns node clusters simultaneously. It represents each node as a Gaussian distribution to disentangle the true embedding position and the uncertainty from the graph. With a Mixture of Gaussian (MoG) prior, VGECLE is capable of learning an interpretable clustering by the variational inference and generative process. In order to learn the pairwise relationships better, we propose a Teacher-Student mechanism encouraging node to learn a better Gaussian from its instant neighbors in the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training fashion.

However, these metrics badly represent semantic relationships and impose strict identity matching, leading to moderate correlation with human judgments. In this paper, we propose a novel MT automatic evaluation metric Semantic Travel Distance (STD) based on word embeddings. STD incorporates both semantic and lexical features (word embeddings and n-gram and word order) into one metric. It measures the semantic distance between the hypothesis and reference by calculating the minimum cumulative cost that the embedded n-grams of the hypothesis need to \u201ctravel\u201d to reach the embedded n-grams of the reference.

Although multiple works have been proposed to improve their robustness against such structural adversarial attacks, the reasons for the success of the attacks remain unclear. In this work, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that structural adversarial examples can be attributed to the non-robust aggregation scheme (i.e., the weighted mean) of GCNs. Specifically, our analysis takes advantage of the breakdown point which can quantitatively measure the robustness of aggregation schemes. The key insight is that weighted mean, as the basic design of GCNs, has a low breakdown point and its output can be dramatically changed by injecting a single edge. We show that adopting the aggregation scheme with a high breakdown point (e.g., median or trimmed mean) could significantly enhance the robustness of GCNs against structural attacks. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that such a simple but effective method achieves the best robustness performance compared to state-of-the-art models.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["446"]}

Comprehensive experiments are conducted by employing a wellknown MPI benchmark and comparing the performance of our method with those of other methods. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our topology-aware deployment method. Copyright c\u20dd 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["446"]}

Graph learning (GL) tries to mine and analyze graph data so that valuable information can be discovered. Existing GL methods are designed for centralized scenarios. However, in practical scenarios, graph data are usually distributed in different organizations, i.e., the curse of isolated data islands. To address this problem, we incorporate federated learning into GL and propose a general Federated Graph Learning framework FedGL, which is capable of obtaining a high-quality global graph model while protecting data privacy by discovering the global self-supervision information during the federated training. Concretely, we propose to upload the prediction results and node embeddings to the server for discovering the global pseudo label and global pseudo graph, which are distributed to each client to enrich the training labels and complement the graph structure respectively, thereby improving the quality of each local model. Moreover, the global self-supervision enables the information of each client to flow and share in a privacy-preserving manner, thus alleviating the heterogeneity and utilizing the complementarity of graph data among different clients. Finally, experimental results show that FedGL significantly outperforms baselines on four widely used graph datasets.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["446"]}

Service recommendation technology is adopted and studied as an effective approach currently. This paper focuses on the user\u2019s trust network, where the users share their experience and rating for the invoked services. To attack the data sparsity and cold-start problems in the user-service rating matrix, an improved random walk algorithm is proposed. Firstly, we employ the non-negative matrix factorization method to compute the similarities between users and services separately. Then our method introduces the trust relationship in iterations of the random walk to select the trust users accurately. At last, the real dataset is used to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["446"]}
{"title": "An effective rewiring strategy for optimizing traffic performance of communication networks\n", "abstract": " Much prior work has demonstrated that the underlying network topology of communication networks is highly relevant to the intended communication performance of the networks. For reliable and efficient traffic transmission, the traffic load distribution in the network should be uniform and the average data transmission distance should be short. In this paper, we aim to find the optimal network topology that can achieve the most balanced traffic loads and the shortest average distance. We propose a rewiring strategy using the simulated annealing algorithm to optimize the traffic performance of a given communication network while keeping its degree distribution fixed. Our simulation results show that our proposed strategy can effectively balance traffic loads and improve the overall network traffic capacity for both the artificial scale-free and the Internet AS-level networks.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["446"]}
{"title": "On analyzing eavesdropping behaviours in underwater acoustic sensor networks\n", "abstract": " Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UWASNs) have the wide of applications with the proliferation of the increasing underwater activities recently. Most of current studies are focused on designing protocols to improve the network performance of WASNs. However, the security of UWASNs is also an important concern since malicious nodes can easily wiretap the information transmitted in UWASNs due to the vulnerability of UWASNs. In this paper, we investigate one of security problems in UWASNs-eavesdropping behaviours. In particular, we propose a general model to quantitatively evaluate the probability of eavesdropping behaviour in UWASNs. Simulation results also validate the accuracy of our proposed model.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["446"]}
{"title": "Qos prediction in dynamic web services with asymmetric correlation\n", "abstract": " Web services are the mainstream implementation of service-oriented architectures in which both functional and non-functional Quality of Service (QoS) is significantly considered by service users and providers. Although multiple QoS-based models to QoS prediction for Web services via collaborative filtering have been proposed, the accuracy of existing ones is not adequate, since these works rarely have considered the influence of asymmetric correlation among service users on prediction accuracy. This paper combines asymmetric correlation among service users and asymmetric correlation propagation into the deviation computation of different service items in QoS prediction. In this paper, a novel method for QoS prediction in dynamic Web services is proposed, which includes a framework consisting of asymmetric correlation model, asymmetric correlation propagation model and deviation computation\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["446"]}
{"title": "An optimized player taxonomy model for Mobile MMORPGs with millions of users\n", "abstract": " Massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) have great potential as sites for research within the social and human-computer interaction. In the MMORPGs, a stability player taxonomy model is very important for game design. It helps to balance different types of players and improve business strategy of the game. The players in mobile MMORPGs are also connected with social networks; many studies only use the player's own attributes statistics or questionnaire survey method to predict player taxonomy, so lots of social network relations' information will be lost. In this paper, by analyzing the impacts of player's social network, commercial operating data from mobile MMORPGs is used to establish our player taxonomy model (SN model). From the model results, social network-related information in mobile MMORPGs will be considered as important factors to pose this optimized player taxonomy\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["446"]}
{"title": "Optimization technique for commercial mobile mmorpg\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we discuss the model and strategy to improve the performance of mobile MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game). For mobile games, there are lot restrictions like the JAR, Heap and Bandwidth on mobile devices. Memory optimization and network bandwidth reduction are crucial in mobile MMORPG. In this paper, we discuss our optimization experience in crafting a commercially launched game \u201cZhanGuo\u201d [14], which is proven to run in more than 800 types of mobile phones owned by a million subscribers since 2005. Based on our first-hand experience, we have found out three interesting properties in mobile online game development: 1) extremely small memory factor in both storage and runtime heap memory; 2) the extensive use of graphics and background maps in game; 3) frequent and massive network communication. The idea we presented is only the very first\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["446"]}
{"title": "Design and Implementation of Interaction Adaptive Game Engine for Mobile Phones [J]\n", "abstract": " Developing MMORPG for resource-constrained mobile phones is extremely challenging. Because of the screen and input mechanism variance of different mobile phones, game engine for a certain mobile phone is difficult to be used on other mobile phones. An interactive adaptive mobile MMORPG game engine was proposed, which could auto-adapt to the screen and input mechanism of different mobile phones. A commercial game was given to verify the design of this paper at the end. This game has been run in more than 100 types of mobile phones, and wins the top-ten mobile network games of 2006 in China.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["446"]}
