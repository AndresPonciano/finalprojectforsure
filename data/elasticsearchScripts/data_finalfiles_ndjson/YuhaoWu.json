{"title": "DeepFed: Federated Deep Learning for Intrusion Detection in Industrial Cyber\u2013Physical Systems\n", "abstract": " The rapid convergence of legacy industrial infrastructures with intelligent networking and computing technologies (e.g., 5G, software-defined networking, and artificial intelligence), have dramatically increased the attack surface of industrial cyber\u2013physical systems (CPSs). However, withstanding cyber threats to such large-scale, complex, and heterogeneous industrial CPSs has been extremely challenging, due to the insufficiency of high-quality attack examples. In this article, we propose a novel federated deep learning scheme, named DeepFed, to detect cyber threats against industrial CPSs. Specifically, we first design a new deep learning-based intrusion detection model for industrial CPSs, by making use of a convolutional neural network and a gated recurrent unit. Second, we develop a federated learning framework, allowing multiple industrial CPSs to collectively build a comprehensive intrusion detection\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "50\n", "authors": ["826"]}
{"title": "A novel framework for detecting social bots with deep neural networks and active learning\n", "abstract": " Microblogging is a popular online social network (OSN), which facilitates users to obtain and share news and information. Nevertheless, it is filled with a huge number of social bots that significantly disrupt the normal order of OSNs. Sina Weibo, one of the most popular Chinese OSNs in the world, is also seriously affected by social bots. With the growing development of social bots in Sina Weibo, they are increasingly indistinguishable from normal users, which presents more huge challenges in detecting social bots. Firstly, it is difficult to extract the features of social bots completely. Secondly, large-scale data collection and labeling of user data are extremely hard. Thirdly, the performance of classical classification approaches applied to social bot detection is not good enough. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel framework for detecting social bots in Sina Weibo based on deep neural networks and active learning\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["826"]}
{"title": "ReAL: A New ResNet-ALSTM Based Intrusion Detection System for the Internet of Energy\n", "abstract": " The Internet of energy (IoE), envisioned to be a promising paradigm of the Internet of things (IoT), is characterized by the deep integration of various distributed energy systems. However, the fusion of heterogeneous IoE communication networks creates a new threat landscape. To thwart and mitigate various types of cyber threats to IoE networks, this paper proposes a novel intrusion detection system (IDS) based on a designed residual network with attention long short term memory (ReAL). Specifically, we design a light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM)-based feature selection method to identify the most useful features. Then, a residual network (ResNet) and a long short term memory neural network with an attention mechanism (ALSTM) are employed, to extract temporal patterns of network traffic events. After that, these patterns are orchestrated to identify the anomalies in IoE networks. The high effectiveness\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["826"]}
{"title": "Large-Scale Analysis of Software Reuse for Code and License Changes\n", "abstract": " Code reuse is a very common practice in software engineering. When performed in a correct way, code reuse can help developers create software products with higher quality more efficiently. Although code reuse is beneficial in many aspects, there are also several issues that we need to take special care of. One important aspect is software license, without which source code cannot be reused legally. Another aspect is the efficiency or barriers during the process code reuse.In the first part of this dissertation, we deal with the issue of software license. Software license is a written text that grants the permissions of reusing and redistributing the software to its users. Removing or modifying the license statement by re-distributors will result in the inconsistency of license with its ancestor, and may potentially cause license infringement. However, in our study we have encountered cases where multiple source files that have the same source code but are under different licenses. Therefore, we describe and categorize different types of license inconsistencies and propose a method to detect them. Then we applied this method to Debian 7.5 and a collection of 10,514 Java projects on GitHub and present the license inconsistency cases found in these systems. With a manual analysis, we summarized various reasons behind these license inconsistency cases, some of which imply potential license infringement and require attention from the developers. This analysis also exposes the difficulty to discover license infringements, highlighting the usefulness of finding and maintaining source code provenance.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["826"]}
