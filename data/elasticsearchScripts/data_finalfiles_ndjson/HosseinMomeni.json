{"title": "CORBA Components Collocation Optimization Enhanced with Local ORB-Like Services Support\n", "abstract": " Some current implementations of CORBA Component Model (CCM) are flawed with unreasonable communication overheads when components are in the same address space and in the same container. Alternative approaches have introduced mechanisms for direct local communication of such components. In these approaches collocated components do not communicate through ORB and therefore cannot use ORB services such as events, naming and transactions locally, unless they are programmed explicitly. This paper presents a new approach for communication of collocated components with local ORB-like services support. A unit inside each container is responsible for handling communication between components within or outside the container. Local requests are passed to the local components without ORB involvement. Local or remoteness of a request is determined from the IOR of the called\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "48\n", "authors": ["1425"]}
{"title": "A new approach to task allocation in wireless sensor actor networks\n", "abstract": " Since wireless sensor actor networks (WSANs) interact with critical physical environments, one of the important issues of WSANs is real-time considerations. Existing WSANs suffer from the lack of a real-time task allocation in support of real-time communication and coordination. In this paper we present a two level task allocation mechanism. We first break end-to-end periodic tasks into real-time jobs, and then use appropriate algorithms for sensing tasks and acting tasks. To formally state our approach, we propose a model for WSANs using graph transformation systems. Using this formalism we analyze the correctness of our algorithms. We show that the proposed algorithms guarantee that the tasks complete their activities before their deadlines expire. To show the efficiency of our algorithms we have simulated the model.

{"title": "Task allocation to actors in wireless sensor actor networks: an energy and time aware technique\n", "abstract": " Task allocation is a critical issue in proper engineering of cooperative applications in embedded systems with latency and energy constraints, as in wireless sensor and actor networks (WSANs). Existing task allocation algorithms are mostly concerned with energy savings and ignore time constraints and thus increase the makespan of tasks in the network as well as the probability of malfunctioning of the network. In this paper we take both energy awareness and reduction of actor tasks\u2019 times to completion in WSANs into account and propose a two-phase task allocation technique based on Queuing theory. In the first phase, tasks are equally assigned to actors just to measure the capability of each actor to perform the assigned tasks. Tasks are then allocated to actors according to their measured capabilities in such a way to reduce the total completion times of all tasks in the network.

With the development of more complex computer systems and applications, the required operating systems become complex too. But the proper management of such complex operating systems by human beings has shown to be impractical. Nowadays, self managing concepts provide the basis for developing appropriate mechanisms to handle complex systems with less human interventions. Although the implications of deploying self managing and autonomic attributes and concepts at the application levels have been studied, their deployment at system software level such as in operating systems have not been fully studied. Self managed applications may not enjoy the whole benefit of self management if the platform on which they run, specially its operating system, is not self managed.

In aspect-oriented programming, concern networks and requirement networks are independent and can easily be added to or removed from a model of system; therefore maintenance and modifying in aspect-oriented system models are easier than object-oriented ones. Software maintenance is an important activity in software development and one of the most expensive activities. Also, its vagueness in prediction at early stage of development makes the process more complex. Researchers and developers are working on devising various techniques/algorithms for better prediction. The aim of the paper is to show that ANFIS can more accurately predict maintainability as compared to other models such as Fuzzy Logic. For this we selected four metrics and used them for training, testing and validation.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1425"]}

{"title": "Service requirements for actor-actor coordination through sensor nodes in wireless sensor actor networks\n", "abstract": " Wireless sensor actor networks are a new challenging type of network in which sensor and actor nodes must coordinate to achieve network goals. But in some situations actors cannot directly communicate with each other. The wide extent of environment, obstacles in the environment and bad communication conditions are some of the reasons. One solution is to exploit accessible sensor nodes to indirectly route packets between actors. To do so, sensor nodes must know the locations of actors because actors can move. In this paper we propose a minimal set of services that actors need to coordinate. The services are finding an actor, finding multiple actors, finding the nearest actor and finding n-nearest actors. The services are exemplified and further partly simulated.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1425"]}

Requirement prioritizing plays an important role in decision making process in subsequent phases and eliminates the complexities resulting from vague requirements.

{"title": "A Hybrid Meta-heuristic Approach to Cope with State Space Explosion in Model Checking Technique for Deadlock Freeness\n", "abstract": " Model checking is an automatic technique for software verification through which all reachable states are generated from an initial state to finding errors and desirable patterns. In the model checking approach, the behavior and structure of system should be modeled. Graph transformation system is a graphical formal modeling language to specify and model the system. However, modeling of large systems with the graph transformation system suffers from the state space explosion problem which usually requires huge amounts of computational resources. In this paper, we propose a hybrid meta-heuristic approach to deal with this searching problem in the graph transformation system because meta-heuristic algorithms are efficient solutions to traverse the graph of large systems. Our approach, using Artificial Bee Colony and Simulated Annealing, replaces a full state space generation, only by producing part of it checking the safety, and finding errors (e.g., deadlock).

So, cloud computing has contributed to the advancement of real-time applications such as signal processing, environment surveillance and weather forecast where time and energy considerations to perform the tasks are critical. In real-time applications, missing the deadlines for the tasks will cause catastrophic consequences; thus, real-time task scheduling in cloud computing environment is an important and essential issue. Furthermore, energy-saving in cloud data center, regarding the benefits such as reduction of system operating costs and environmental protection is an important concern that is considered during recent years and is reducible with appropriate task scheduling. In this paper, we present an energy-aware task scheduling approach, namely EaRTs for real-time applications. We employ the virtualization and consolidation technique subject to minimizing the energy consumptions, improve resource utilization and meeting the deadlines of tasks. In the consolidation technique, scale up and scale down of virtualized resources could improve the performance of task execution.

We calculate the best rate of dispatching of tasks by the network sink to allocated actors through a steady state analysis of our proposed model to solve equations and inequalities. We show that this dispatching rate reduces the overall completion time of all tasks in the network too. Experimental results on typical scenarios have shown 53% improvement in reducing the number of waiting tasks and 40% improvement in reducing the network makespan compared to stochastic allocation of tasks to actors. We also show that this makespan improvement results in more power savings in actors.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1425"]}
