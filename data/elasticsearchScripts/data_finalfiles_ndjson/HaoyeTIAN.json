{"title": "Interactive Design of 3D Dynamic Gesture Based on SVM-LSTM Model\n", "abstract": " Visual hand gesture interaction is one of the main ways of human-computer interaction, and provides users more interactive degrees of freedom and more realistic interactive experience. Authors present a hybrid model based on SVM-LSTM, and design a three-dimensional dynamic gesture interaction system. The system uses Leap Motion to capture gesture information, combined with SVM powerful static gesture classification ability and LSTM powerful variable-length time series gesture processing ability, enabling real-time recognition of user gestures. The gesture interaction method can automatically define the start and end of gestures, recognition accuracy reached 96.4%, greatly reducing the cost of learning. Experiments have shown that the gesture interaction method proposed by authors is effective. In the simulated mobile environment, the average gesture prediction only takes 0.15 seconds, and ordinary\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["2131"]}
{"title": "A Music Recommendation System Based on logistic regression and eXtreme Gradient Boosting\n", "abstract": " With the rapid growth of music industry data, it is difficult for people to find their favorite songs in the music library. Therefore, people urgently need an efficient music recommendation system to help them retrieve music. Traditional collaborative filtering algorithms are applied to the field of music recommendation. However, collaborative filtering does not handle data sparse problems very well when new items are introduced. To solve this problem, some people use the logistic regression method as a classifier to predict the user's music preferences to recommend songs. Logistic regression is a linear model that does not handle complex non-linear data features. In this paper, we propose a hybrid LX recommendation algorithm by integrating logistic regression and eXtreme Gradient Boosting(xgboost). A series of experiments are conducted on a real music dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed LX model\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["2131"]}
