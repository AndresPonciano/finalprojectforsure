Five spectral intervals in the shortwave and five intervals in the infrared are employed, with the ice cloud optical properties parameterized in terms of ice water path (IWP) and the effective radius (re) of the ice crystal size distribution. The parameterization thus allows the flexibility of varying the ice water path and effective radius independently of each other. The parameterized optical properties are used to calculate the bulk reflectivity, transmissivity, and emissivity for cirrus clouds with realistic ranges of IWP and re.

MVEV is enzootic in northern Australia and Papua New Guinea and epizootic in other parts of Australia. Activity of MVEV in Western Australia (WA) is monitored by detection of seroconversions in flocks of sentinel chickens at selected sample sites throughout WA. Rainfall is a major environmental factor influencing MVEV activity. Utilising data on rainfall and seroconversions, statistical relationships between MVEV occurrence and rainfall can be determined. These relationships can be used to predict MVEV activity which, in turn, provides the general public with important information about disease transmission risk. Since ground measurements of rainfall are sparse and irregularly distributed, especially in north WA where rainfall is spatially and temporally highly variable, alternative data sources such as remote sensing (RS) data represent an attractive alternative to ground measurements.

Which methods yield identical information to each other? Which methods provide complementary information? The initial phase of the project focused on prescribed errors and quantitative precipitation forecasts over the central United States.

Therefore, High Impact Weather Project (HIWeather), a 10-year research project (https://public. wmo. int/en/resources/bulletin/hiweather-10-yearresearch-project), was established in 2016 by WMO (World Meteorology Organization) WWRP (World Weather Research Program: https://www. wmo. int/pages/prog/arep/wwrp/new/wwrp_new_en. html). HIWeather aimed at achieving dramatic improvements in the effectiveness of weather-related hazard warnings, following recent advancement in numerical weather prediction at km-scale and in disaster risk reduction. The implementation plan was developed under the concept of warning chain, which comprises all components and the connections between to a successful weather-hazards warning: observations, weather forecast, hazard forecast, impact forecast, the generation of warnings and decision making (Fig. 1). A successful warning relies on information produced by the meteorological and related physical sciences, thus its effectiveness of delivery depends on applications of social, behavioral and economic sciences. The workshop of WMO High Impact Weather Project was held in Beijing during 20\u201322 November of 2018, attracted a diverse and interdisciplinary group of over 70 scientists from 25 countries in the broad field of physical and social science, during which all elements of the warning chain were discussed critically.The aims of the workshop were to review progress to date, to refresh the aims and objectives of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1876"]}

To better prepare for future events, a pilot forecasting system for epidemic thunderstorm asthma (ETSA) risk has been developed for Victoria. The system uses a categorical risk-based approach, combining operational forecasting of gusty winds in severe thunderstorms with statistical forecasts of high ambient grass pollen concentrations, which together generate the risk of epidemic thunderstorm asthma. This pilot system provides the first routine daily epidemic thunderstorm asthma risk forecasting service in the world that covers a wide area, and integrates into the health, ambulance, and emergency management sector\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1876"]}

Place-based and ecosystem-based management approaches employed by CRCP require that spatially explicit information about benthic habitats and fish utilization are available to characterize coral reef ecosystems and set conservation priorities. To accomplish this, seafloor habitat mapping of coral reefs around the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) and Puerto Rico has been ongoing since 2004. In 2008, fishery acoustics surveys were added to NOAA survey missions in the USVI and Puerto Rico to assess fish distribution and abundance in relation to benthic habitats in high priority conservation areas. NOAA\u2019s National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) have developed fisheries acoustics survey capabilities onboard the NOAA ship Nancy Foster to complement the CRCP seafloor habitat mapping effort spearheaded by the Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment Biogeography Branch (CCMA-BB). The integration of these activities has evolved on the Nancy Foster over the three years summarized in this report. A strategy for improved operations and products has emerged over that time. Not only has the concurrent operation of multibeam and fisheries acoustics surveys been beneficial in terms of optimizing ship time and resources, this joint effort has advanced an integrated approach to characterizing bottom and mid-water habitats and the fishes associated with them.

Surface observations of this phenomenon are hampered by poor visibility during the portion of the year when the ice crystals are probably most abundant. The radiative effects of these ice crystals are routinely neglected in both local and global climate simulations, including models of the equilibrium thickness of the sea ice. The paper argues that these ice crystals are playing one of the larger and more important roles in both the radiation balance and air chemistry of the Arctic during winter and spring.

{"title": "Development and evaluation of pollen source methodologies for the Victorian Grass Pollen Emissions Module VGPEM1. 0\n", "abstract": " We present the first representation of grass pollen in a 3-D dispersion model in Australia, tested using observations from eight counting sites in Victoria. The region's population has high rates of allergic rhinitis and asthma, and this has been linked to the high incidence of grass pollen allergy. Despite this, grass pollen dispersion in the Australian atmosphere has not been studied previously, and its source strength is untested. We describe 10 pollen emission source methodologies examining the strengths of different immediate and seasonal timing functions, and the spatial distribution of the sources. The timing function assumes a smooth seasonal term, modulated by an hourly meteorological function. A simple Gaussian representation of the pollen season worked well (average r=0.54), but lacked the spatial and temporal variation that the satellite-derived enhanced vegetation index (EVI) can provide. However, poor results were obtained using the EVI gradient (average r=0.35), which provides the timing when grass turns from maximum greenness to a drying and flowering period; this is due to noise in the spatial and temporal variability from this combined spatial and seasonal term. Better results were obtained using statistical methods that combine elements of the EVI dataset, a smooth seasonal term and instantaneous variation based on historical grass pollen observations (average r=0.69). The seasonal magnitude is inferred from the maximum winter-time EVI, whereas the timing of the season peak is based on the day of the year when the EVI falls to 0.05 below its winter maximum.

To encourage the development of user-oriented verification approaches and support the major projects of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) World Weather Research Program, a challenge was issued to develop and demonstrate new user-oriented forecast verification metrics. Several new forecast verification metrics were proposed to meet the needs of very different user-communities including public safety and amenity, shipping, aviation, defence, agriculture, and water resources. A few general purpose metrics were also proposed. The winner of the inaugural verification challenge proposed a new metric called the Spatial Probability Score for assessing forecasts for the location of a relevant boundary or contour, for example, sea ice edge or extent of flood inundation.

{"title": "Atmospheric modelling of grass pollen rupturing mechanisms for thunderstorm asthma prediction\n", "abstract": " The world\u2019s most severe thunderstorm asthma event occurred in Melbourne, Australia on 21 November 2016, coinciding with the peak of the grass pollen season. The aetiological role of thunderstorms in these events is thought to cause pollen to rupture in high humidity conditions, releasing large numbers of sub-pollen particles (SPPs) with sizes very easily inhaled deep into the lungs. The humidity hypothesis was implemented into a three-dimensional atmospheric model and driven by inputs from three meteorological models. However, the mechanism could not explain how the Melbourne event occurred as relative humidity was very low throughout the atmosphere, and most available grass pollen remained within 40 m of the surface. Our tests showed humidity induced rupturing occurred frequently at other times and would likely lead to recurrent false alarms if used in a predictive capacity. We used the model to investigate a range of other possible pollen rupturing mechanisms which could have produced high concentrations of SPPs in the atmosphere during the storm. The mechanisms studied involve mechanical friction from wind gusts, electrical build up and discharge incurred during conditions of low relative humidity, and lightning strikes. Our results suggest that these mechanisms likely operated in tandem with one another, but the lightning method was the only mechanism to generate a pattern in SPPs following the path of the storm. If humidity induced rupturing cannot explain the 2016 Melbourne event, then new targeted laboratory studies of alternative pollen rupture mechanisms would be of considerable value to help constrain the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1876"]}

This raises the possibility of improved monitoring of highly dynamic ecosystems, such as grasslands, including fine-scale phenology retrievals from vegetation index (VI) time series. However, identifying and understanding how GEO VI temporal profiles would be different from traditional LEO VIs need to be evaluated, especially with the new generation of geostationary satellites, with unfamiliar observation geometries not experienced with MODIS, VIIRS, or Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) VI time series data. The objectives of this study were to investigate the variations in AHI reflectances and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and two-band EVI (EVI2) in relation to diurnal phase angle variations, and to compare AHI VI seasonal datasets with MODIS VIs (standard and sun and view angle-adjusted VIs) over a functional range of dry grassland sites in eastern Australia. Strong NDVI diurnal variations and negative NDVI hotspot effects were found due to differential red and NIR band sensitivities to diurnal phase angle changes. In contrast, EVI and EVI2 were nearly insensitive to diurnal phase angle variations and displayed nearly flat diurnal profiles without noticeable hotspot influences.

Whereas the number killed has exhibited a downward trend over the past half century, the cost of damage has steadily increased. Those affected may suffer serious injury or debilitating illness, loss of personal wealth, raised food prices, or temporary loss of electric power or road access. Cost of damage is largely deduced from insurance claims, which are often the only data available, but these represent only a fraction of the full economic impact. Poor economies may suffer a long term setback to development following major or repeated disasters (Mochizuki et al., 2014).A weather-related disaster occurs when hazardous weather impacts the lives, wealth or livelihoods of people so as to cause serious disruption of the functioning of their community, requiring outside help for recovery (UNISDR, 2016). A disaster may be prevented or mitigated by reducing the hazard (only generally possible if human activity contributes to the hazard, eg pollution emissions, or deforestation), reducing the community\u2019s exposure (eg by evacuation or land use zoning), or reducing their vulnerability (eg by building hazard-resistant buildings or by improving nutrition). These responses all require policy decisions based on accurate and detailed information about hazard, exposure and vulnerability.

However, when verified using traditional metrics such as root mean square error, threat score, etc., they often score quite poorly because of the difficulty of predicting an exact match to the observations at high resolution. Recent years have seen the development of neighbourhood (also known as\" fuzzy\") verification approaches that reward closeness by relaxing the requirement for exact matches between forecasts and observations. Some of these neighbourhood methods compute standard verification metrics for deterministic forecasts using a broader definition of what constitutes a hit. Other neighbourhood methods treat the forecasts and/or observations as probability distributions and use verification metrics suitable for probability forecasts. Each method is distinguished by a unique decision model for defining a\" good\" forecast. All methods can be implemented using a common moving-window framework in which the forecasts within a certain space-time window are compared to observation (s) either in the same window or in the center of the window. By varying the threshold intensity used to define an event and the size of the spacetime window, the dependence of forecast accuracy on intensity and scale can be evaluated.

Management decisions such as sowing time, cultivar selection, fertiliser application and disease treatment can be made more efficiently when a monthly or seasonal forecast is available. Studies using idealised forecasts show that some management decisions have more to gain from a forecast than others. Australia\u2019s seasonal climate forecast model, POAMA, is used to demonstrate the value of a real, imperfect forecast system. The model is shown to have skill at forecasting seasonal rainfall in the southern part of the WA wheat belt that equals or exceeds a suite of benchmark models. However, skill in the northern part of the wheat belt is only marginal. Climatological analysis of observations and the model (Pook et al. 2010, 2011) indicates that this is likely to be due to model difficulty in representing one of the key rain-bearing weather systems, the cutoff low, and this is associated with a common model difficulty in simulating atmospheric blocking.Previous studies of the value of basing nitrogen fertiliser (N) application rates on a climate forecast have assumed a maximum rate of N application. This study uses a more realistic and conservative strategy where the expected return from adding $1 of N is typically $2. Using a POAMA-1.5 model forecast in this case achieves a long-term return of more than $50/ha in the southern wheat belt (Asseng et al. 2011a).

Hourly fine-scale numerical guidance is available from a few locally produced, nested regional models. There has been recent interest in combining these different sources to produce hourly, 5km grid-based objective guidance over Australia.The site-based Operational Consensus Forecast (OCF) method of Woodcock and Engel (2005) performs statistical corrections of local and overseas model output followed by weighted average consensus. This scheme was shown to produce guidance competitive with subjective official forecasts for daily forecast fields such as maximum and minimum daily air temperature (Woodcock and Engel, 2005).

Validation of TRaP forecasts for five Australian tropical cyclones during the 2003-04 season showed significant skill in predicting heavy rainfall. The predictions of maximum rain at landfall compared well with gauge observations in most cases. In terms of spatial rain coverage and amount, the AMSU-based TRaPs performed noticeably better than the SSM/I-based TRaPs, giving higher correlations with the observations, more accurate estimates of rain area and conditional rain rate, and lower root mean squared errors. The TRaPs performed neither better nor worse than mesoscale numerical weather prediction models. A decomposition of the TRaP error for regions of heavy rain suggests that only a small portion was related to errors in the track forecasts. Pattern errors, which relate to the shape, size, and fine scale structure of the forecast entity, accounted for about half of the total error, while rain volume error was about one third of the total error. These relate to errors in the satellite rain rate retrieval as well as the assumption of a nonvarying rain pattern.

{"title": "9A. 4 SPATIAL VERIFICATION OF HIGH-RESOLUTION WEATHER FORECASTS: BEYOND TRADITIONAL METRICS\n", "abstract": " As models are refined and developed, it is imperative to have objective ways to evaluate forecast quality. This is important for comparing different model configurations or tracking performance over time. Greater computing power has allowed finer grid spacing and more explicit handling of previously unresolved circulations (which is crucial for distinguishing high impact events with intense peaks in wind or precipitation). The problem is, as grid spacing decreases, the traditional verification methods become swamped by small-scale errors and they often cannot discriminate between a somewhat-useful forecast and a totally useless forecast. For example, a high-resolution forecasted precipitation field may look very good and be quite useful, but if it is slightly offset from the observations, the traditional verification scores (such as critical success index and equitable threat score) will be dominated by false-alarms and misses due to slight displacement errors. Forecasted and observed events are unlikely to be matched up exactly on a point-bypoint basis and the forecast is \u201cdoubly-penalized\u201d for false alarms and misses associated with what is essentially the same entity. We would like our verification metric to be sensitive to displacement errors, but at the same time not give an inordinate amount of weight to trivial deviations from the observations (truth). It is with this in mind that we look at several innovative approaches to spatial forecast verification. These methods, which were discussed at a verification workshop in Feb. 2007, can be divided into three broad categories: feature-based, neighborhood approach, and scale decomposition.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1876"]}

This is done by verifying against reference data such as rain gauge or radar analyses, where these are assumed to give a reasonable representation of the true precipitation distribution. The traditional verification approach is to compare the value of the forecast in each given grid box with the corresponding observation in that grid box. This matching strategy makes it very difficult for high resolution QPFs to demonstrate good skill, due not only to model errors but also to sampling and observation errors. Upscaling to coarser space and time resolution is a well known approach for reducing the sampling error, but this process loses information, much of which may be useful. For many applications it may not be essential to get the rainfall position and timing exactly right; instead,\" close enough\" may be good enough.A new verification approach called\" fuzzy verification\" has been proposed by Ebert (2008). The term\" fuzzy\" is in keeping with the spirit of fuzzy logic as it describes the inexact nature of the verification\u2013an estimate can be partially correct and partially incorrect.

A secondary aim is to investigate when and where satellite rainfall estimates generally perform better or worse than short-term rainfall predictions from NWP models. These validation activities were motivated by expanding requirements in climate modeling, data assimilation, nowcasting, and hydrological applications.The development of high resolution precipitation products (HRPP; typically blends of low Earth orbiting passive microwave radiometric (PMW) and geostationary-based imagers) has also proceeded to the point where a more thorough analysis of their performance is required. The goal of the expanded Program to Evaluate High Resolution Precipitation Products (PEHRPP) is to characterize as clearly as possible the errors in various HRPP on many spatial and temporal scales, over variable background surfaces, and across seasons and climate regimes.

Sensitivity to ice thickness resolution\n", "abstract": " A one-dimensional ice thickness distribution model is presented to determine the minimum number of ice thicknesses necessary to resolve the area-averaged annual cycles of ice thickness and turbulent fluxes.  The baseline case includes 40 ice thickness categories; ice thickness and area, meltwater ponds, ice salinity and age, snow cover, and surface albedo evolve independently for each ice category.  A ridging and ice export parameterization, and a coupled one-dimensional ocean mixed layer model are also included.  Sensitivity studies indicate that 16 ice thickness categories can accurately resolve the baseline annual cycles of area-averaged ice thickness and the summertime turbulent fluxes in this model, provided that one third of the thickness categories represent ice thinner than 0.8 m.  Resolving the distribution of ice in this thickness range is important in simulating the area-averaged ice characteristics. Wintertime values of the turbulent fluxes differ from the baseline by up to 1 W m     -     2     for fewer than 40 ice thickness categories.  The large difference in turbulent fluxes between open water and ice thickner than 1.6 m makes the area-averaged value sensitive to the number of ice thickness categories, since this number can affect the categories that are merged, the categories that melt completely, ice that is ridged, and the resolution of the ice thickness distribution.  This makes an accurate simulation of the baseline wintertime turbulent fluxes difficult.

Considerably more effort has been made to document this phenomenon in the Antarctic than in the Arctic. As a result, the climatology of this phenomenon is uncertain particularly in the Arctic, although a number of inferences can be made from available observations. Surface observations of this phenomenon are hampered by poor visibility during the portion of the year when the ice crystals are probably most abundant. In the Antarctic during the polar day, these ice crystals are readily evident by their optical effects. In the Arctic, the ice crystals are rarely associated with these optical effects, since the ice crystals occur in the Arctic for the most part during the polar night. Hoff (1988) has described the cloudless ice crystal precipitation as\" ground-based cirrus cloud.\" However, cloud observation conventions preclude the classification of the ice-crystal precipitation as cirrus. Instead, a surface observer may only report the ice crystals using the present weather code. Given the variability in practices about reporting the present weather, it is doubtful that any kind of meaningful statistics about the ice crystal precipitation can be derived from existing surface observations. The situation for satellite observation of this phenomena is similarly discouraging. The visible reflectivity of a snow/ice surface is virtually the same as that of a layer of ice crystals overlying a snow/ice surface. Textural features of the ice crystal layers are also lacking.

The extension of a hazard forecast towards the description of impacts on the forecast recipient might effect a more suitable mitigating response and has led to an emerging and growing desire among National Hydrological and Meteorological Services for impactbased forecasts and warnings (Harrowsmith 2015; World Meteorological Organization 2015).A number of major weather services (eg UK Met Office, Bureau of Meteorology) have therefore introduced impact-based services in recognition of the above findings. Since 2011 the UK Met Office has issued impact-based warnings where the warning level is derived from a risk matrix in a partly subjective procedure (Met Office 2018). In a related manner, the Extreme Weather Desk at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology has recently developed the Community Hazard Risk Outlook.

Validation of TRaP forecasts for five Australian tropical cyclones during the 2003-04 season showed significant skill in predicting heavy rainfall. The predictions of maximum rain at landfall compared well with gauge observations in most cases. The AMSU-based TRaPs performed noticeably better than the SSM/I-based TRaPs in predicting spatial rain coverage and amount, giving higher correlations with the observations, more accurate estimates of rain area and conditional rain rate, and lower root mean squared errors. The TRaPs performed neither better nor worse than mesoscale numerical weather prediction models. A decomposition of the TRaP error for regions of heavy rain suggests that only a small portion was related to errors in the track forecasts. Pattern errors, which relate to the shape, size, and fine scale structure of the forecast entity, accounted for about half of the total error, while rain volume error was about one third of the total error. These relate to errors in the satellite rain rate retrieval as well as the assumption of a time-invariant rain pattern. An ensemble of TRaP forecasts could account for some of these uncertainties, leading to more useful objective guidance.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1876"]}
{"title": "9.1 INTERCOMPARISON OF SPATIAL VERIFICATION METHODS\n", "abstract": " As atmospheric models are developed and refined, it is imperative to have objective ways to evaluate forecast quality. This is important for comparing different model configurations or tracking performance over time. Greater computing power has allowed finer grid spacing and more explicit handling of previously unresolved circulations (which is crucial for distinguishing high impact events with intense peaks in wind or precipitation). The problem is, as grid spacing decreases, the traditional verification methods become swamped by small-scale errors and they often cannot discriminate between a somewhat-useful forecast and a totally useless forecast. For example, a high-resolution forecasted precipitation field may look very good and be quite useful, but if it is slightly offset from the observations, the traditional verification scores (such as critical success index and equitable threat score) will be dominated by false-alarms and misses due to slight displacement errors. Forecasted and observed events are unlikely to be matched up exactly on a point-bypoint basis and the forecast is \u201cdoubly-penalized\u201d for false alarms and misses associated with what is essentially the same entity. We would like our verification metric to be sensitive to displacement errors, but at the same time not give an inordinate amount of weight to trivial deviations from the observations (truth). It is with this in mind that we look at several innovative approaches to spatial forecast verification.

The simulated reflectivity field and precipitation distribution have realistic features and spatial structure that can provide valuable guidance to forecasters on the mode of convective evolution (Weisman et al., 2008). However, the traditional verification scores often do not reflect this improvement. Small errors in the position or timing of convective features result in both false alarms and missed events that dominate the 2x2 contingency table that serves as the foundation of traditional categorical verification scores (Wilks, 2006). This problem is only exacerbated by tighter grid spacing. Several traditional scores such as critical success index (CSI or threat score) and Gilbert skill score (GSS or equitable threat score) have been used for decades, but their utility is limited when it comes to diagnosing displacement error or an incorrect mode of convective organization.The spatial verification method Intercomparison Project, or ICP, was organized to explore better ways of evaluating high-resolution numerical model forecasts. The ICP stemmed from a verification workshop originally held in Boulder, CO.

The open ocean composite showed the strongest winds in the right forward quadrant, with the maximum inflow angle to the right rear, in agreement with many other studies. At landfall, the winds over the land weakened and turned towards the storm centre, due to the increased surface roughness. A secondary wind speed maximum developed over the water in the offshore flow on the left of the storm.Similar studies of Hurricanes Alicia (Powell 1987) and Hugo (Powell et al 1991) did not find this latter feature.
