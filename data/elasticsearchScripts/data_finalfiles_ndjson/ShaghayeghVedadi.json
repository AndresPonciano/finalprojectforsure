{"title": "Development of cosmic scaling factors using classification of functional requirements\n", "abstract": " The focus of this paper is estimating COSMIC function points early in the software development lifecycle. The main input to function point sizing is the set of functional requirements for a piece of software. However, very early in the lifecycle it is unrealistic to expect this set of requirements to describe the full scope of functionality, including all the necessary functional details. The application of the size scaling factors developed within this context is illustrated with two COSMIC case studies. While the scaling factors are specific to the case studies used, the approximation technique presented can be used in most organizations provided that data on past projects can be collected and relevant classifications of functionalities identified. For the purpose of this paper, the ISO 19761 COSMIC function points standard is taken as reference for discussion, while the majority of concepts presented are generic to other similar ISO standards.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["2020"]}
