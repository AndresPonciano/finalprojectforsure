{"title": "Open source software in quantum computing\n", "abstract": " Open source software is becoming crucial in the design and testing of quantum algorithms. Many of the tools are backed by major commercial vendors with the goal to make it easier to develop quantum software: this mirrors how well-funded open machine learning frameworks enabled the development of complex models and their execution on equally complex hardware. We review a wide range of open source software for quantum computing, covering all stages of the quantum toolchain from quantum hardware interfaces through quantum compilers to implementations of quantum algorithms, as well as all quantum computing paradigms, including quantum annealing, and discrete and continuous-variable gate-model quantum computing. The evaluation of each project covers characteristics such as documentation, licence, the choice of programming language, compliance with norms of software engineering, and the culture of the project. We find that while the diversity of projects is mesmerizing, only a few attract external developers and even many commercially backed frameworks have shortcomings in software engineering. Based on these observations, we highlight the best practices that could foster a more active community around quantum computing software that welcomes newcomers to the field, but also ensures high-quality, well-documented code.", "num_citations": "57\n", "authors": ["854"]}
{"title": "Molecular docking with Gaussian boson sampling\n", "abstract": " Gaussian Boson Samplers are photonic quantum devices with the potential to perform intractable tasks for classical systems. As with other near-term quantum technologies, an outstanding challenge is to identify specific problems of practical interest where these devices can prove useful. Here, we show that Gaussian Boson Samplers can be used to predict molecular docking configurations, a central problem for pharmaceutical drug design. We develop an approach where the problem is reduced to finding the maximum weighted clique in a graph, and show that Gaussian Boson Samplers can be programmed to sample large-weight cliques, i.e., stable docking configurations, with high probability, even with photon losses. We also describe how outputs from the device can be used to enhance the performance of classical algorithms. To benchmark our approach, we predict the binding mode of a ligand to the tumor\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "29\n", "authors": ["854"]}
{"title": "A quantum alternating operator ansatz with hard and soft constraints for lattice protein folding\n", "abstract": " Gate-based universal quantum computers form a rapidly evolving field of quantum computing hardware technology. In previous work, we presented a quantum algorithm for lattice protein folding on a cubic lattice, tailored for quantum annealers. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for solving the lattice protein folding problem on universal gate-based quantum computing architectures. Lattice protein models are coarse-grained representations of proteins that have been used extensively over the past thirty years to examine the principles of protein folding and design.These models can be used to explore a vast number of possible protein conformations and to infer structural properties of more complex atomistic protein structures. We formulate the problem as a quantum alternating operator ansatz, a member of the wider class of variational quantum/classical hybrid algorithms. To increase the probability of sampling the ground state, we propose splitting the optimization problem into hard and soft constraints. This enables us to use a previously under-utilised component of the variational algorithm to constrain the search to the subspace of solutions that satisfy the hard constraints.", "num_citations": "26\n", "authors": ["854"]}
{"title": "Coarse-grained lattice protein folding on a quantum annealer\n", "abstract": " Lattice models have been used extensively over the past thirty years to examine the principles of protein folding and design. These models can be used to determine the conformation of the lowest energy fold out of a large number of possible conformations. However, due to the size of the conformational space, new algorithms are required for folding longer proteins sequences. Preliminary work was performed by Babbush et al. (2012) to fold a small peptide on a planar lattice using a quantum annealing device. We extend this work by providing improved Ising-type Hamiltonian encodings for the problem of finding the lowest energy conformation of a lattice protein. We demonstrate a decrease in quantum circuit complexity from quadratic to quasilinear in certain cases. Additionally, we generalize to three spatial dimensions in order to obtain results with higher correlation to the actual atomistic 3D structure of the protein and outline our heuristic approach for splitting large problem instances into smaller subproblems that can be directly solved with the current D-Wave 2000Q architecture. To the best of our knowledge, this work sets a new record for lattice protein folding on a quantum annealer by folding Chignolin (10 residues) on a planar lattice and Trp-Cage (8 residues) on a cubic lattice.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["854"]}
