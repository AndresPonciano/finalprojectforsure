{"title": "Software requirements triage and selection: state-of-the-art and state-of-practice\n", "abstract": " Software requirement triage and selection in market-driven requirements engineering is a crucial activity for the success of a project, product and company. This paper presents state-of-the-art and state-of-practice in requirements triage and selection through systematic literature review and an industrial survey. Industry practitioner can read solutions that have been proposed in literature and most applicable challenges and factors considered today and factors to be considered ideally to address the challenges, which have been collected through the survey. For researchers, the results show which challenges still needs to be addressed.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["1539"]}
{"title": "Systematic Review of Solutions Proposed for Product Line Economics.\n", "abstract": " This paper presents a systematic review of all the solutions addressing different economic aspect of software product lines (SPL), eg SPL adoption cost-benefits, PL architecture decisions, SPL test strategies project cost overrun and so on, presented for the years 2000 to 2007. The goal of the review is to analyze the level of empirical application and/or validation of the proposed solutions with the purpose of mapping maturity as well as to what extent proposed solutions might be proven in terms of usability and usefulness. The important finding of this review is that although many economic solutions for SPL have been proposed over the years, the absence of qualitative and quantitative results from empirical application and/or validation makes it difficult to evaluate the potential of proposed solutions with respect to their usability and/or usefulness in relation to industry adoption. Suggestions have been presented to improve the existing situation.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1539"]}
{"title": "Task coordination of automated guided vehicles in a container terminal\n", "abstract": " This paper introduces a new generation of Automated Guided Vehicles, called IPSI\u00ae AGVs, which are evaluated in the operations of a Container Terminal. The objective is to identify number of automated guided vehicles and cassettes required in order to that a number of cranes will not be idle during ship loading and unloading operations. A protocol called Contract Net is evaluated in the coordination of cassettes with automated guided vehicles, which are represented as agents in a simulator. The simulation tests show that under various scenarios a high throughput of container handling is achieved using cassettes, which act as a moving buffer while coordinating with IPSI AGVs", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1539"]}
{"title": "Innovative features selection using real options theory\n", "abstract": " Innovation enables product differentiation and supports market growth. However, determining the value of an innovative feature is a difficult task due to the number of risks and uncertainties involved. This paper proposes the use of real options theory to support software product managers to decide whether to make an investment in an innovative feature or not. This approach creates a richer decision space, allowing for more informed decision- making, leading to greater return on potential.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1539"]}
{"title": "Strategic Decision Support for Software Intensive Product Management\n", "abstract": " Context: At the core of choosing what features and level of quality to realize, and thus offer a market or customer, rests on the ability to take decisions. Decision-making is complicated by heterogeneous understanding of issues such as priority, implication of realization, and interpretations of strategy as pertaining to the short-and long-term development of software intensive systems. The complexity is further compounded by the amount of decision support material that has to be taken into account and the sheer volume of possible alternatives that have to be triaged and prioritized, thousands, or even tens of thousands of requirements can be the reality facing industry. There is a need to develop the functionality that is strategically most important while satisfying customers and being competitive, cost efficient, and minimizing risk. In order to achieve a balance between these factors, it is important that within an organization, all stakeholders agree on the strategic aspects to be considered and their corresponding relative importance.Objective: The objective of this thesis is to provide strategic decision-making support for product management of software intensive products.Method: A number of empirical studies, set in both academia and industry have been performed. The research methods used span from systematic reviews, case studies to experiments, all aligned to identify possibilities for improvement, devise solutions, and validate these solutions in several steps.Result: The methods presented in this thesis can be used to evaluate strategic alignment and identify possible root causes for misalignments.

{"title": "State of the Practice for Sustainability as an Explicit Objective.\n", "abstract": " Sustainability in its various facets has become an important aspect of engineering software. However, we have only few guidelines on how to incorporate sustainability as an overall objective from the very beginning of software systems development. In previous work, we provide a discussion on including sustainability during requirements engineering and while taking software product management decisions. To gather further information about the state of practice, we propose this questionnaire to investigate more real life examples from the experience of the survey participants. These data points will facilitate insights on the state of practice and allow us to improve the description of a systematic guidance. Both makes incorporating sustainability easier to apply for requirements engineers.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1539"]}
{"title": "A Model for Early Requirements Triage and Selection Utilizing Product Strategies\n", "abstract": " In market-driven product development, large numbers of requirements flow in continuously. It is critical for product management to select the requirements aligned with overall business goals and discard others as early as possible. It has been suggested in literature to utilize product strategies for early requirements triage and selection. However, no explicit method/model/framework has been suggested as how to do it. This thesis presents a model for early requirements triage and selection utilizing product strategies based on a literature study and interviews with people at two organizations about the requirements triage and selection processes and product strategies formulation. The model is validated statically within the same two organizations.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1539"]}
