{"title": "Nuclear power plant thermocouple sensor-fault detection and classification using deep learning and generalized likelihood ratio test\n", "abstract": " In this paper, an online fault detection and classification method is proposed for thermocouples used in nuclear power plants. In the proposed method, the fault data are detected by the classification method, which classifies the fault data from the normal data. Deep belief network (DBN), a technique for deep learning, is applied to classify the fault data. The DBN has a multilayer feature extraction scheme, which is highly sensitive to a small variation of data. Since the classification method is unable to detect the faulty sensor; therefore, a technique is proposed to identify the faulty sensor from the fault data. Finally, the composite statistical hypothesis test, namely generalized likelihood ratio test, is applied to compute the fault pattern of the faulty sensor signal based on the magnitude of the fault. The performance of the proposed method is validated by field data obtained from thermocouple sensors of the fast breeder test\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "50\n", "authors": ["1254"]}

Group communication system plays a major part in MANET environment which are implemented by multicasting method which provides delivery of packets to a group of destination. But there are many difficulties in implementing scalable, optimized and efficient multicasting network in mobile ad-hoc network because managing a dynamic environment with group membership is a challenging process. Efficient Geographic Multicast Protocol (EGMP) is proposed which uses a virtual zone base structure. The geographic region is divided into many virtual zones. The Distance between the source and other nodes in the group are found and the one closest to source is chosen as cluster head or zone leader. Zone leader communicates with its group members. Only zone leader transmits data and hence the node does not receive the same packets again and again. EGMP greatly simplifies zone management and packet forwarding. EGMP uses geographic forwarding to provide reliable packet transmission. It ensures the successful transmission of the data packets, has low overhead and reduced redundant packet transmissions. Compared with Scalable Position Based Multicast (SPBM), simulation results of EGMP shows high packet delivery ratio thus packet missing while transmission are reduced hence re-transmission of packets are reduced and bandwidth is utilized efficiently.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1254"]}

Methods/Analysis: It is analyzed that the effective supervision in the telecom tower sites, is currently affected due to the problem of SIM card interchange between the GSM/GPRS modems and IP connectivity failure between the GSM/GPRS modem and the server, in the automated energy metering system. Results: The fault tolerant technique addressed, utilizes a master GSM/GPRS modem which is capable of communicating with all the GSM/GPRS modems in the client side. Whenever the IP connectivity gets lost in any particular GSM/GPRS modem, the modem automatically sends the energy meter readings through SMS to the master GSM/GPRS modem, which in turn sends the data to the server via RS232 link. The problem of SIM card interchange in the GSM/GPRS modems is taken care by assigning an ID for each energy meter and the energy meter readings are mapped against this ID instead of mapping against the phone numbers. Improvements: There is not a single fault tolerant technique addressed for GSM/GPRS modems until today. These two automated solutions reduce the manual dependency and prevent most of the human prone errors.

Web users are benefited with valuable online reviews. To utilize the reviews effectively, researchers are working on necessary methods and ideas such as classification of positive and negative sense of reviews, ranking the facet in the reviews to make the effective classification etc. This study aims to propose a novel facet identification namely Facet Based Adjective identification method (FBAI) for efficient feature selection of reviews. The next algorithm FacetRank marks facet of each opinion from review set with positive, negative and neutral polarity. To classify the ranked facets, a novel Cluster based k Nearest Neighbor (C-kNN) algorithm is proposed. Constrained single pass clustering algorithm is combined with existing kNN classification algorithm to classify the review set as positive or negative. C-kNN reduces the resemblance checking calculation and can process high dimensional data which enable dynamic classification. This analysis takes household product reviews as input data set. The ranked review set (using FBAI+ FacetRank) is given to kNN and C-kNN for classification. F1 score of C-kNN 2.43% higher than kNN. Linear time complexity of C-kNN achieved is 68% of kNN.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1254"]}

However in internet applications, lack of multicast services play a deterrent role in group communication. When live multimedia data is transferred to more than one receiver over the network, the more number of duplicate packets are transferred. Due to this duplicate packets, bandwidth and other resources are not properly utilized. When network connection is slow then clustering duplicate packets takes place in link. Due to this clustering, there is a chance for the data loss to occur. A CacheCast mechanism can be used on the router to eliminate such type of duplicate packets. Cache is placed on the router which acts independently for the sender and receiver. In single source multiple destinations, while transferring live multimedia data to more number of receivers, the duplicate packets may occur on the link. All duplicate packets are removed at the nearest router of sender and retrieved from the nearest router of receiver. This technique is used to achieve the better utilization of bandwidth. When send the live data to more than one receiver, bandwidth is efficiently used and the receiver\u2019s side original data has to be reconstructed without any discrepancies.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1254"]}
