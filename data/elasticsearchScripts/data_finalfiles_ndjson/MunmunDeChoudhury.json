{"title": "Predicting depression via social media\n", "abstract": " Major depression constitutes a serious challenge in personal and public health. Tens of millions of people each year suffer from depression and only a fraction receives adequate treatment. We explore the potential to use social media to detect and diagnose major depressive disorder in individuals. We first employ crowdsourcing to compile a set of Twitter users who report being diagnosed with clinical depression, based on a standard psychometric instrument. Through their social media postings over a year preceding the onset of depression, we measure behavioral attributes relating to social engagement, emotion, language and linguistic styles, ego network, and mentions of antidepressant medications. We leverage these behavioral cues, to build a statistical classifier that provides estimates of the risk of depression, before the reported onset. We find that social media contains useful signals for characterizing the onset of depression in individuals, as measured through decrease in social activity, raised negative affect, highly clustered egonetworks, heightened relational and medicinal concerns, and greater expression of religious involvement. We believe our findings and methods may be useful in developing tools for identifying the onset of major depression, for use by healthcare agencies; or on behalf of individuals, enabling those suffering from depression to be more proactive about their mental health.", "num_citations": "1460\n", "authors": ["1200"]}

We study mental health discourse on the popular social media: reddit. Building on findings about health information seeking and sharing practices in online forums, and social media like Twitter, we address three research challenges. First, we present a characterization of self-disclosure inmental illness communities on reddit. We observe individuals discussing a variety of concerns ranging from the daily grind to specific queries about diagnosis and treatment. Second, we build a statistical model to examine the factors that drive social support on mental health reddit communities. We also develop language models to characterize mental health social support, which are observed to bear emotional, informational, instrumental, and prescriptive information. Finally, we study disinhibition in the light of the dissociative anonymity that reddit\u2019s throwaway accounts provide. Apart from promoting open conversations, such anonymity surprisingly is found to gather feedback that is more involving and emotionally engaging. Our findings reveal, for the first time, the kind of unique information needs that a social media like reddit might be fulfilling when it comes to a stigmatic illness.

{"title": "\" Birds of a Feather\": Does User Homophily Impact Information Diffusion in Social Media?\n", "abstract": " This article investigates the impact of user homophily on the social process of information diffusion in online social media. Over several decades, social scientists have been interested in the idea that similarity breeds connection: precisely known as \"homophily\". Homophily has been extensively studied in the social sciences and refers to the idea that users in a social system tend to bond more with ones who are similar to them than to ones who are dissimilar. The key observation is that homophily structures the ego-networks of individuals and impacts their communication behavior. It is therefore likely to effect the mechanisms in which information propagates among them. To this effect, we investigate the interplay between homophily along diverse user attributes and the information diffusion process on social media. In our approach, we first extract diffusion characteristics---corresponding to the baseline social graph as well as graphs filtered on different user attributes (e.g. location, activity). Second, we propose a Dynamic Bayesian Network based framework to predict diffusion characteristics at a future time. Third, the impact of attribute homophily is quantified by the ability of the predicted characteristics in explaining actual diffusion, and external variables, including trends in search and news. Experimental results on a large Twitter dataset demonstrate that choice of the homophilous attribute can impact the prediction of information diffusion, given a specific metric and a topic. In most cases, attribute homophily is able to explain the actual diffusion and external trends by ~15-25% over cases when homophily is not considered.", "num_citations": "106\n", "authors": ["1200"]}

The problem is important because users are looking for useful feedback on their uploaded content, but finding the right community for feedback is challenging for the end user. Social media are characterized by both content and community. Hence, in our approach, we characterize images through three types of features: visual features, user generated text tags, and social interaction (user communication history in the form of comments). A recommendation framework based on learning a latent space representation of the groups is developed to recommend the most likely groups for a given image.

{"title": "Find me the right content! diversity-based sampling of social media spaces for topic-centric search\n", "abstract": " Social media and networking websites, such as Twitter and Facebook, generate large quantities of information and have become mechanisms for real-time content dissipation to users. An important question that arises is: how do we sample such social media information spaces in order to deliver relevant content on a topic to end users? Notice that these large-scale information spaces are inherently diverse, featuring a wide array of attributes such as location, recency, degree of diffusion effects in the network and so on. Naturally, for the end user, different levels of diversity in social media content can significantly impact the information consumption experience: low diversity can provide focused content that may be simpler to understand, while high diversity can increase breadth in the exposure to multiple opinions and perspectives. Hence to address our research question, we turn to diversity as a core concept in our proposed sampling methodology. Here we are motivated by ideas in the\" compressive sensing\" literature and utilize the notion of sparsity in social media information to represent such large spaces via a small number of basis components. Thereafter we use a greedy iterative clustering technique on this transformed space to construct samples matching a desired level of diversity. Based on Twitter Firehose data, we demonstrate quantitatively that our method is robust, and performs better than other baseline techniques over a variety of trending topics. In a user study, we further show that users find samples generated by our method to be more interesting and subjectively engaging compared to techniques inspired by state-of-the-art\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "33\n", "authors": ["1200"]}

On the basis of those identified needs, the HCI researchers iteratively created 3 different lo-fi prototypes. The prototypes were shared with both groups of researchers via a videoconferencing software for discussion and feedback. During the remote meetings, potential clinical utility, potential use of the different prototypes in a treatment setting, and areas of improvement were discussed.Results: Our first prototype was a card-type interface that supported treatment goal tracking.

We pursue the research question of whether naturalistic data shared on Twitter may provide a \u201clens\u201d to understand changes in psychological attributes of urban communities (1) immediately following crime incidents, as well as (2) due to long-term exposure to crime. We analyze half a million Twitter posts from the City of Atlanta in 2014, where the rate of violent crime is three times of the national average. In a first study, we develop a statistical method to detect changes in social media psychological attributes in the immediate aftermath of a crime event. Second, we develop a regression model that uses historical (yearlong) crime to predict Twitter negative emotion, anxiety, anger, and sadness. We do not find significant changes in social media affect immediately following crime in Atlanta. However we do observe significant ability of historical crime to account for heightened negative emotion and anger in the future.

{"title": "Discussion graphs: putting social media analysis in context\n", "abstract": " Much research has focused on studying complex phenomena through their reflection in social media, from drawing neighborhood boundaries to inferring relationships between medicines and diseases. While it is generally recognized in the social sciences that such studies should be conditioned on gender, time and other confounding factors, few of the studies that attempt to extract information from social media actually condition on such factors due to the difficulty in extracting these factors from naturalistic data and the added complexity of of including them in analyses. In this paper, we present a simple framework for specifying and implementing common social media analyses that makes it trivial to inspect and condition on contextual information. Our data model---discussion graphs---captures both the structural features of relationships inferred from social media as well as the context of the discussions from which they are derived, such as who is participating in the discussions, when and where the discussions are occurring, and what else is being discussed in conjunction. We implement our framework in a tool called DGT, and present case studies on its use. In particular, we show how analyses of neighborhoods and their boundaries based on geo-located social media data can have drastically varying results when conditioned on gender and time.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1200"]}

In general, wearables detect sleep through diminished movement and decreased heart rate (HR), while phone agents look for lack of user input, movement, sound or light. However, recent literature suggests that commercial-grade wearables and phone apps vary greatly in the accuracy of sleep predictions. Constant innovation in wearables and proprietary algorithms further make it difficult to evaluate their efficacy for scientific study, especially outside of the laboratory. In a longitudinal study, we find that wearables cannot detect when a person is laying still but using their phones, a common behavior, overestimating sleep when compared to self-reports.

A critical aspect of ML algorithm development is how to establish ground truth that is representative of the phenomenon of interest in the real world. Often, ground truth is determined by third-party annotators (ie,\u201coutsiders\u201d) who are removed from the situational context of the interaction; therefore, they cannot fully understand the perspective of the individuals involved (ie,\u201cinsiders\u201d). To understand the extent of this problem, we compare \u201coutsider\u201d versus \u201cinsider\u201d perspectives when annotating 2,000 posts from an online peersupport platform. We interpolate this analysis to a corpus containing over 2.3 million posts on bullying and related topics, and reveal significant gaps in ML models that use third-party annotators to detect bullying incidents. Our results indicate that models based on the insiders\u2019 perspectives yield a significantly higher recall in identifying bullying posts and are able to capture a range of explicit and implicit references and linguistic framings, including person-specific impressions of the incidents. Our study highlights the importance of incorporating the victim\u2019s point of view in establishing effective tools for cyberbullying risk detection.

However, assessing these interactions with surveys fails to capture their dynamic nature. While these behaviors can be captured with client-based passive sensing, these techniques are limited in scalability. By contrast, infrastructure-based approaches can scale to a large cohort and infer social interactions based on collocation of students. This paper investigates one such approach by leveraging WiFi association logs archived by a managed campus network. In their raw form, access point logs can approximate a student\u2019s location but with low spatio-temporal resolution. This paper first demonstrates that processing these logs can infer the collocation of 46 students in 34 lectures over 3 months, with a precision of 0.89 and a recall of 0.75. Next, we investigate how this WiFi-based coarse collocation reflects signals of social interaction. With 163 students in 54 project groups, we find that member performance shows a correlation of 0.75 with performance determined from collocation of groups through 14 weeks. Additionally, this paper presents preliminary insights for other campus-centric applications of automatically inferred social interactions.

{"title": "Person-Centered Predictions of Psychological Constructs with Social Media Contextualized by Multimodal Sensing\n", "abstract": " Personalized predictions have shown promises in various disciplines but they are fundamentally constrained in their ability to generalize across individuals. These models are often trained on limited datasets which do not represent the fluidity of human functioning. In contrast, generalized models capture normative behaviors between individuals but lack precision in predicting individual outcomes. This paper aims to balance the tradeoff between one-for-each and one-for-all models by clustering individuals on mutable behaviors and conducting cluster-specific predictions of psychological constructs in a multimodal sensing dataset of 754 individuals. Specifically, we situate our modeling on social media that has exhibited capability in inferring psychosocial attributes. We hypothesize that complementing social media data with offline sensor data can help to personalize and improve predictions.

{"title": "Understanding Side Effects of Antidepressants: Large-scale Longitudinal Study on Social Media Data\n", "abstract": " Background: Antidepressants are known to show heterogeneous effects across individuals and conditions, posing challenges to understanding their efficacy in mental health treatment. Social media platforms enable individuals to share their day-to-day concerns with others and thereby can function as unobtrusive, large-scale, and naturalistic data sources to study the longitudinal behavior of individuals taking antidepressants.Objective: We aim to understand the side effects of antidepressants from naturalistic expressions of individuals on social media.Methods: On a large-scale Twitter data set of individuals who self-reported using antidepressants, a quasi-experimental study using unsupervised language analysis was conducted to extract keywords that distinguish individuals who improved and who did not improve following the use of antidepressants. The net data set consists of over 8 million Twitter posts made by over 300,000 users in a 4-year period between January 1, 2014, and February 15, 2018.Results: Five major side effects of antidepressants were studied: sleep, weight, eating, pain, and sexual issues. Social media language revealed keywords related to these side effects. In particular, antidepressants were found to show a spectrum of effects from decrease to increase in each of these side effects.Conclusions: This work enhances the understanding of the side effects of antidepressants by identifying distinct linguistic markers in the longitudinal social media data of individuals showing the most and least improvement following the self-reported intake of antidepressants.

{"title": "Identifying emerging mental illness utilizing search engine activity: A feasibility study\n", "abstract": " Mental illness often emerges during the formative years of adolescence and young adult development and interferes with the establishment of healthy educational, vocational, and social foundations. Despite the severity of symptoms and decline in functioning, the time between illness onset and receiving appropriate care can be lengthy. A method by which to objectively identify early signs of emerging psychiatric symptoms could improve early intervention strategies. We analyzed a total of 405,523 search queries from 105 individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD, N = 36), non-psychotic mood disorders (MD, N = 38) and healthy volunteers (HV, N = 31) utilizing one year\u2019s worth of data prior to the first psychiatric hospitalization. Across 52 weeks, we found significant differences in the timing (p<0.05) and frequency (p<0.001) of searches between individuals with SSD and MD compared to HV up to a year in advance of the first psychiatric hospitalization. We additionally identified significant linguistic differences in search content among the three groups including use of words related to sadness and perception, use of first and second person pronouns, and use of punctuation (all p<0.05). In the weeks before hospitalization, both participants with SSD and MD displayed significant shifts in search timing (p<0.05), and participants with SSD displayed significant shifts in search content (p<0.05). Our findings demonstrate promise for utilizing personal patterns of online search activity to inform clinical care.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1200"]}

However, little is explored empirically about the association of social network structure and the interactions of an individual with aspects of mental health functioning, such as anxiety. In recent years, individuals have begun to appropriate social media to self-disclose about their mental illnesses, seek support, and derive therapeutic benefits. The study examines the online social network and interaction characteristics of Twitter users who self-disclose about their anxiety disorders. We analyze a sample of 200 Twitter users and their over 200,000 posts shared on the platform, who were expert-validated to have self-disclosed about suffering from an anxiety disorder.

Self-esteem has been traditionally measured using survey-based methodologies. However, surveys suffer from limitations such as retrospective recall and reporting biases, leading to a need for proactive measurement approaches. Our work uses smartphone sensors to predict self-esteem and is situated in a multimodal sensing study on college students for five weeks. We use theory-driven features, such as phone communications and physical activity to predict three dimensions, performance, social, and appearance self-esteem. We conduct statistical modeling including linear, ensemble, and neural network regression to measure self-esteem. Our best model predicts self-esteem with a high correlation (r) of 0.60 and low SMAPE of 7.26% indicating high predictive accuracy.

Such behavior involves not only when an individual is eating, but also various contextual factors such as with whom and where an individual is eating and what kind of food the individual is eating. Despite the relevance of such factors, most automated eating detection systems are not designed to capture contextual factors.Objective: The aims of this study were to (1) design and build a smartwatch-based eating detection system that can detect meal episodes based on dominant hand movements,(2) design ecological momentary assessment (EMA) questions to capture meal contexts upon detection of a meal by the eating detection system, and (3) validate the meal detection system that triggers EMA questions upon passive detection of meal episodes.Methods: The meal detection system was deployed among 28 college students at a US institution over a period of 3 weeks. The participants reported various contextual data through EMAs triggered when the eating detection system correctly detected a meal episode. The EMA questions were designed after conducting a survey study with 162 students from the same campus. Responses from EMAs were used to define exclusion criteria.Results: Among the total consumed meals, 89.8%(264/294) of breakfast, 99.0%(406/410) of lunch, and 98.0%(589/601) of dinner episodes were detected by our novel meal detection system.

In this talk I will discuss how this data may be harnessed to reason about our well-being. First, I will discuss a series of projects that examine how cues derived from social media around life-altering events (e.g., giving birth to a child, experience of abuse) and societal disruptions (e.g., urban violence, socio-political unrest) may help infer risks to mental health challenges. Second, I will discuss the emergent role of social media in providing a platform of self-disclosure and support to distressed, vulnerable, and under-privileged communities. Broadly, I will reflect on how this new line of research bears potential in informing the design of timely and tailored interventions, provisions for improved personal and societal well-being assessment, privacy and ethical considerations, and in this\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1200"]}

To mitigate this problem, research has looked into building automated systems, powered by machine learning, to detect cyberbullying incidents, or the involved actors like victims and perpetrators. In the past, systematic reviews have examined the approaches within this growing body of work, but with a focus on the computational aspects of the technical innovation, feature engineering, or performance optimization, without centering around the roles, beliefs, desires, or expectations of humans. In this paper, we present a human-centered systematic literature review of the past 10 years of research on automated cyberbullying detection.

Comment on \u201cMachine Learning for Mental Health in Social Media: Bibliometric Study\u201d\n", "abstract": " Bibliometric studies like the recent article by Kim et al [1] in the Journal of Medical Internet Research play an essential part in understanding the evolution of emerging, fast-moving research on machine learning for mental health in social media. However, the intended value of this paper\u2019s contribution is tempered by some important lessons it teaches us about the current state of research on this topic.The first key lesson is that computationally oriented research on mental health remains highly fragmented. Notably, variants on the cover term \u201cmental health\u201d are included in the illustrative search query but, crucially,\u201cclinical psychology\u201d and \u201cpsychiatry\u201d are not. The terminological difference here reflects a prevailing technological focus often separated from clinical research and even more distant from clinical practice. Kim et al [1] do discuss a trend toward clinically validated self-report questionnaires to gather clinically relevant information. However, the review\u2019s overall approach, from the search terms to the keyword analysis, simultaneously reflects and reinforces a widespread technological disregard for basic considerations in clinical psychology and psychiatry, such as the distinction between the symptoms of the disorders versus the disorders themselves. As technologists, we are often happy just to get our hands on enough data to work with. However, real progress toward solving these important problems demands a more careful definition of the actual mental health constructs under investigation and greater attention to the question of validity [2, 3], with research questions and experimental choices guided by knowledge of the subject domain.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1200"]}

Both clinical recovery and social reintegration need to go hand-in-hand for the overall well-being of individuals. However, research exploring social media for mental health has considered narrower, disjoint conceptualizations of people with mental illness - either as a patient or as a support-seeker. In this paper, we combine medical records with social media data of 254 consented individuals who have experienced a psychiatric hospitalization to address this gap.

Current methodologies are limited in capturing subjective differences in expectations, needs, and values at work, and they do not lay emphasis on demographic differences, which may impact people's perceptions of job satisfaction. This study proposes an approach to assess job satisfaction by leveraging large-scale social media data. Starting with an initial Twitter dataset of 1.5M posts, we examine two facets of job satisfaction, pay and supervision. By adopting a theory-driven approach, we first build machine learning classifiers to assess perceived job satisfaction with an average AUC of 0.84. We then study demographic differences in perceived job satisfaction by geography, sex, and race in the U.S. For geography, we find that job satisfaction on Twitter exhibits insightful relationships with\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1200"]}

The challenge is to quantify, interpret, and situate such unstructured data streams in the broader context, which remains under-investigated in existing CSCW research. Addressing these challenges demands computational solutions to extract large volumes of data in conjunction with human intervention to transition the data streams into the offline context to render them usable and actionable. Following an iterative human-in-the-loop computational approach, we explore whether citizen reports of abductions concentrated on Facebook groups can be useful to complete official records on the ongoing crisis of disappearances in Mexico.

{"title": "WiFi mobility models for COVID-19 enable less burdensome and more localized interventions for university campuses\n", "abstract": " Infectious diseases, like COVID-19, pose serious challenges to university campuses, and they typically adopt closure as a non-pharmaceutical intervention to control spread early and ensure a gradual return to normalcy. These policies, like remote instruction (SQ), reduce potential contact but also have broad side-effects on campus by hampering local economy, students learning outcomes, and community wellbeing. In this paper, we demonstrate that university policymakers can mitigate these tradeoffs by leveraging anonymized data from their WiFi infrastructure to learn community mobility (WF) and in turn explore more granular policies like localized closures (LC). WF can construct contact networks that capture behavior in a variety of spaces, highlighting new potential transmission pathways and temporal variation in contact behavior.  Additionally, WF enables us to design LC policies that close super-spreader locations on campus. On simulating disease spread with contact networks from WF, we find that LC maintains the same reduction in cumulative infections as SQ while showing greater reduction in peak infections and internal transmission. Moreover, LC reduces campus burden by closing fewer locations, forcing fewer students into completely online schedules, and requiring no additional isolation. WF can empower universities to conceive and assess a variety of closure policies to prevent future outbreaks.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1200"]}
{"title": "Computational Support for Substance Use Disorder Prevention, Detection, Treatment, and Recovery\n", "abstract": " Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) involve the misuse of any or several of a wide array of substances, such as alcohol, opioids, marijuana, and methamphetamine. SUDs are characterized by an inability to decrease use despite severe social, economic, and health-related consequences to the individual. A 2017 national survey identified that 1 in 12 US adults have or have had a substance use disorder. The National Institute on Drug Abuse estimates that SUDs relating to alcohol, prescription opioids, and illicit drug use cost the United States over $520 billion annually due to crime, lost work productivity, and health care expenses. Most recently, the US Department of Health and Human Services has declared the national opioid crisis a public health emergency to address the growing number of opioid overdose deaths in the United States. In this interdisciplinary workshop, we explored how computational support - digital systems, algorithms, and sociotechnical approaches (which consider how technology and people interact as complex systems) - may enhance and enable innovative interventions for prevention, detection, treatment, and long-term recovery from SUDs. The Computing Community Consortium (CCC) sponsored a two-day workshop titled \"Computational Support for Substance Use Disorder Prevention, Detection, Treatment, and Recovery\" on November 14-15, 2019 in Washington, DC.
