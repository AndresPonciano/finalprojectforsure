{"title": "Discussion and review on evolving data streams and concept drift adapting\n", "abstract": " Recent advances in computational intelligent systems have focused on addressing complex problems related to the dynamicity of the environments. In increasing number of real world applications, data are presented as streams that may evolve over time and this is known by concept drift. Handling concept drift is becoming an attractive topic of research that concerns multidisciplinary domains such that machine learning, data mining, ubiquitous knowledge discovery, statistic decision theory, etc... Therefore, a rich body of the literature has been devoted to the study of methods and techniques for handling drifting data. However, this literature is fairly dispersed and it does not define guidelines for choosing an appropriate approach for a given application. Hence, the main objective of this survey is to present an ease understanding of the concept drift issues and related works, in order to help researchers from\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "149\n", "authors": ["1095"]}
{"title": "Self-adaptive windowing approach for handling complex concept drift\n", "abstract": " Detecting changes in data streams attracts major attention in cognitive computing systems. The challenging issue is how to monitor and detect these changes in order to preserve the model performance during complex drifts. By complex drift, we mean a drift that presents many characteristics in the sometime. The most challenging complex drifts are gradual continuous drifts, where changes are only noticed during a long time period. Moreover, these gradual drifts may also be local, in the sense that they may affect a little amount of data, and thus make the drift detection more complicated. For this purpose, a new drift detection mechanism, EDIST2, is proposed in order to deal with these complex drifts. EDIST2 monitors the learner performance through a self-adaptive window that is autonomously adjusted through a statistical hypothesis test. This statistical test provides theoretical guarantees, regarding the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "33\n", "authors": ["1095"]}
{"title": "Drift detection and monitoring in non-stationary environments\n", "abstract": " Detecting changes in data streams is an important area of research in many applications. The challenging issue is to know how to monitor, update and diagnose these changes so that the accuracy of the learner will be improved whatever the nature of the encountered drifts. In this paper a new error distance based approach for drift detection and monitoring, namely EDIST, is proposed. In EDIST, a difference in error distance distributions of two data-windows is monitored through a statistical hypothesis test. The proposed approach is tested using synthetic data and well known real world data sets. Encouraging results were found comparing to others similar approaches. EDIST has reached the best accuracies in most cases and shown more robustness to noise and false alarms.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["1095"]}
{"title": "Ensemble classifiers for drift detection and monitoring in dynamical environments\n", "abstract": " Detecting and monitoring changes during the learning process are important areas of research in many industrial applications. The challenging issue is how to diagnose and analyze these changes so that the accuracy of the learning model can be preserved. Recently, ensemble classifiers have achieved good results when dealing with concept drifts. This paper presents two ensembles learning algorithms BagEDIST and BoostEDIST, which respectively combine the Online Bagging and the Online Boosting with the drift detection method EDIST. EDIST is a new drift detection method which monitors the distance between two consecutive errors of classification. The idea behind this combination is to develop an ensemble learning algorithm which explicitly handles concept drifts by providing useful descriptions about location, speed and severity of drifts. Moreover, this paper presents a new drift diversity measure in order to study the diversity of base classifiers and see how they cope with concept drifts. From various experiments, this new measure has provided a clearer vision about the ensemble\u2019s behavior when dealing with concept drifts.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1095"]}

In this paper we introduce a new hyper-heuristic model, namely Ant-Q hyper-heuristic, which transliterates the significant learning ability of Ant-Q algorithm proposed by Gambardella and Dorigo, for building good sequences of low-level heuristics aimed at gradually constructing final solutions. This approach was applied to 2-dimensional Cutting Stock Problem and tested through a large set of benchmark problems. The results have shown that the Ant-Q hyper heuristic is able to outperform single heuristics, well known metaheuristics and be competitive to other hyper-heuristics from the literature.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1095"]}
{"title": "A new combination of diversity techniques in ensemble classifiers for handling complex concept drift\n", "abstract": " Recent advances in Computational Intelligent Systems have focused on addressing complex problems related to the dynamicity of the environments. Generally in dynamic environments, data are presented as streams that may evolve over time and this is known by concept drift. Handling concept drift through ensemble classifiers has received a great interest in last decades. The success of these ensemble methods relies on their diversity. Accordingly, various diversity techniques can be used like block-based data, weighting-data or filtering-data. Each of these diversity techniques is efficient to handle certain characteristics of drift. However, when the drift is complex, they fail to efficiently handle it. Complex drifts may present a mixture of several characteristics (speed, severity, influence zones in the feature space, etc.) which may vary over time.
