{"title": "Dimensions of devops\n", "abstract": " DevOps has been identified as an important aspect in the continuous deployment paradigm in practitioner communities and academic research circles. However, little has been presented to describe and formalize what it constitutes. The absence of such understanding means that the phenomenon will not be effectively communicated and its impact not understood in those two communities. This study investigates the elements that characterize the DevOps phenomenon using a literature survey and interviews with practitioners actively involved in the DevOps movement. Four main dimensions of DevOps are identified: collaboration, automation, measurement and monitoring. An initial conceptual framework is developed to communicate the phenomenon to practitioners and the scientific community as well as to facilitate input for future research.", "num_citations": "170\n", "authors": ["1939"]}
{"title": "DevOps adoption benefits and challenges in practice: a case study\n", "abstract": " DevOps is an approach in which traditional software engineering roles are merged and communication is enhanced to improve the production release frequency and maintain software quality. There seem to be benefits in adopting DevOps but practical industry experiences have seldom been reported. We conducted a qualitative multiple-case study and interviewed the representatives of three software development organizations in Finland. The responses indicate that with DevOps, practitioners can increase the frequency of releases and improve test automation practices. DevOps was seen to encourage collaboration between departments which boosts communication and employee welfare. Continuous releases enable a more experimental approach and rapid feedback collection. The challenges include communication structures that hinder cross-department collaboration and having to address the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "100\n", "authors": ["1939"]}
{"title": "An Exploratory Study of DevOps: Extending the Dimensions of DevOps with Practices\n", "abstract": " Software-intensive companies constantly try to improve their software development process for better software quality and a faster time to market. The DevOps phenomenon emerged with the promise of easing the process of putting new software changes to production at a fast rate whilst also increasing the learning and innovation cycles of their products. However, the DevOps phenomenon lacks clear definition and practices, and this makes it difficult for both researchers and practitioners to understand the phenomenon. In this paper, we focus on consolidating the understanding of DevOps and its practices as described by practitioners using multivocal literature and interviews. The study contributes to a scientific definition of DevOps and patterns of DevOps practices to help identify and adopt the phenomenon.", "num_citations": "74\n", "authors": ["1939"]}
{"title": "Relationship of DevOps to agile, lean and continuous deployment\n", "abstract": " In recent years, the DevOps phenomenon has attaracted interest amongst practitioners and researchers in software engineering, reflecting the greater emphasis on collaboration between development and IT operations. However, despite this growing interest, DevOps is often conflated with agile and continuous deployment approaches of software development. This study compares DevOps with agile, lean and continuous deployment approaches in software development from four perspectives: origin, adoption, implementation and goals. The study also reports on the claimed effects and on the metrics of DevOps used to asses those effects. The research is based on an interpretative analysis of qualitative data from documents describing DevOps and practitioner\u2019s responses in a DevOps workshop. Our findings indicate that the DevOps phenomenon originated from continuous deployment as an evolution\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "72\n", "authors": ["1939"]}
{"title": "Advances in using agile and lean processes for software development\n", "abstract": " Software development processes have evolved according to market needs. Fast changing conditions that characterize current software markets have favored methods advocating speed and flexibility. Agile and Lean software development are in the forefront of these methods. This chapter presents a unified view of Agile software development, Lean software development, and most recent advances toward rapid releases. First, we introduce the area and explain the reasons why the software development industry begun to move into this direction in the late 1990s. Section 2 characterizes the research trends on Agile software development. This section helps understand the relevance of Agile software development in the research literature. Section 3 provides a walk through the roots of Agile and Lean thinking, as they originally emerged in manufacturing. Section 4 develops into Agile and Lean for software\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "49\n", "authors": ["1939"]}
{"title": "Toward an improved understanding of agile project governance: A systematic literature review\n", "abstract": " The purpose of this study is to provide understanding of project governance practices in agile projects. A systematic review of the previous agile literature is conducted to identify and categorize agile project governance practices, which are synthesized in a six-dimensional framework. The study contributes to the literature by contrasting traditional and agile project governance practices and by identifying new practices emerging in agile projects, while also noting remaining gaps in knowledge. The implications of this study enable managers to identify and apply feasible governance practices that can support better agile project performance.", "num_citations": "41\n", "authors": ["1939"]}
{"title": "An empirical study of portfolio management and Kanban in agile and lean software companies\n", "abstract": " Traditional portfolio management tools and methods are challenging for software companies that use agile and lean approaches, because of the complex pre\u2010planning activities required. In this paper, traditional portfolio management tools and methods that have been conventionally used in industry and presented in literature are reviewed. Findings concerning their use in agile and lean software companies are investigated, on the basis of the literature review and semi\u2010structured interviews conducted in 7 agile and lean software companies in Finland. The findings indicate that the studied companies do not use traditional portfolio management tools and methods in their entirety. The software companies adapted suitable components from traditional portfolio management tools and methods into their practices. They also apply new tools and methods to manage their portfolios of offerings, to cope with the dynamics\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["1939"]}
{"title": "Empirical challenges in the implementation of IT portfolio management: a survey in three companies\n", "abstract": " The study explores the implementation challenges of Information Technology (IT) portfolio management in three companies. The portfolio approach to IT assets is significant for enabling organisations to make effective use of limited resources by prioritising IT initiatives and also for monitoring and evaluating their performance. In practice, the process facilitates the provision of necessary information for decision makers, allowing them to make rational decisions about IT investments. We found that there is a significant gap between IT portfolio management as discussed in the literature and its actual practice. The analysis showed that there was high flexibility when specifying IT projects, which caused companies to implement IT portfolios that were too broad. As a consequence, resources were not effectively utilised, and IT portfolio evaluations post implementation were rarely conducted.
