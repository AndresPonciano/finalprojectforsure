{"title": "Combining multiple functional annotation tools increases coverage of metabolic annotation\n", "abstract": " Genome-scale metabolic modeling is a cornerstone of systems biology analysis of microbial organisms and communities, yet these genome-scale modeling efforts are invariably based on incomplete functional annotations. Annotated genomes typically contain 30\u201350% of genes without functional annotation, severely limiting our knowledge of the \u201cparts lists\u201d that the organisms have at their disposal. These incomplete annotations may be sufficient to derive a model of a core set of well-studied metabolic pathways that support growth in pure culture. However, pathways important for growth on unusual metabolites exchanged in complex microbial communities are often less understood, resulting in missing functional annotations in newly sequenced genomes. Here, we present results on a comprehensive reannotation of 27 bacterial reference genomes, focusing on enzymes with EC numbers annotated by KEGG, RAST, EFICAz, and the BRENDA enzyme database, and on membrane transport annotations by TransportDB, KEGG and RAST. Our analysis shows that annotation using multiple tools can result in a drastically larger metabolic network reconstruction, adding on average 40% more EC numbers, 3\u20138 times more substrate-specific transporters, and 37% more metabolic genes. These results are even more pronounced for bacterial species that are phylogenetically distant from well-studied model organisms such as E. coli. Metabolic annotations are often incomplete and inconsistent. Combining multiple functional annotation tools can greatly improve genome coverage and metabolic network size, especially for non-model organisms and non\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["1903"]}
{"title": "BiP clustering facilitates protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum\n", "abstract": " The chaperone BiP participates in several regulatory processes within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER): translocation, protein folding, and ER-associated degradation. To facilitate protein folding, a cooperative mechanism known as entropic pulling has been proposed to demonstrate the molecular-level understanding of how multiple BiP molecules bind to nascent and unfolded proteins. Recently, experimental evidence revealed the spatial heterogeneity of BiP within the nuclear and peripheral ER of S. cerevisiae (commonly referred to as \u2018clusters\u2019). Here, we developed a model to evaluate the potential advantages of accounting for multiple BiP molecules binding to peptides, while proposing that BiP's spatial heterogeneity may enhance protein folding and maturation. Scenarios were simulated to gauge the effectiveness of binding multiple chaperone molecules to peptides. Using two metrics: folding efficiency and chaperone cost, we determined that the single binding site model achieves a higher efficiency than models characterized by multiple binding sites, in the absence of cooperativity. Due to entropic pulling, however, multiple chaperones perform in concert to facilitate the resolubilization and ultimate yield of folded proteins. As a result of cooperativity, multiple binding site models used fewer BiP molecules and maintained a higher folding efficiency than the single binding site model. These insilico investigations reveal that clusters of BiP molecules bound to unfolded proteins may enhance folding efficiency through cooperative action via entropic pulling.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["1903"]}
{"title": "Using stochastic epidemiological models to evaluate conservation strategies for endangered amphibians\n", "abstract": " Recent outbreaks of chytridiomycosis, the disease of amphibians caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), have contributed to population declines of numerous amphibian species worldwide. The devastating impacts of this disease have led researchers to attempt drastic conservation measures to prevent further extinctions and loss of biodiversity. The conservation measures can be labour-intensive or expensive, and in many cases have been unsuccessful. We developed a mathematical model of Bd outbreaks that includes the effects of demographic stochasticity and within-host fungal load dynamics. We investigated the impacts of one-time treatment conservation strategies during the disease outbreak that occurs following the initial arrival of Bd into a previously uninfected frog population. We found that for all versions of the model, for a large fraction of parameter space, none of the one\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["1903"]}
{"title": "Computational modeling of chaperone interactions in the endoplasmic reticulum of Saccharomyces cerevisiae\n", "abstract": " In eukaryotes, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) acts as a protein gatekeeper for protein folding, maturation, and transport. Molecular chaperones, of the Hsp70 family of proteins, participate in assisting these processes and are essential to cellular function and survival.

{"title": "Spatial localisation of chaperone distribution in the endoplasmic reticulum of yeast\n", "abstract": " In eukaryotes, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) serves as the first membrane-enclosed organelle in the secretory pathway, with functions including protein folding, maturation and transport. Molecular chaperones, of the Hsp70 family of proteins, participate in assisting these processes and are essential to cellular function and survival. BiP is a resident Hsp70 chaperone in the ER of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this study the authors have created a partial differential equation model to examine how BiP interacts with the membrane-bound co-chaperone Sec63 in translocation, a process in which BiP assists in guiding a nascent protein into the ER lumen. It has been found that when Sec63 participates in translocation through localisation at the membrane, the spatial distribution of BiP is inhomogeneous, with more BiP at the surface.
