{"title": "Adaptive recovery for mobile environments\n", "abstract": " Mobile computing allows ubiquitous and continuous access to computing resources while the users travel or work at a client's site. The flexibility introduced by mobile computing brings new challenges to the area of fault tolerance. Failures that were rare with fixed hosts become common, and host disconnection makes fault detection and message coordination difficult. This paper describes a new checkpoint protocol that is well adapted to mobile environments. The protocol uses time to indirectly coordinate the creation of new global states, avoiding all message exchanges. The protocol uses two different types of checkpoints to adapt to the current network characteristics, and to trade off performance with recovery time.", "num_citations": "187\n", "authors": ["349"]}

This can compromise the safety of the protocol and ultimately the safety of the system.

Despite its exponential worst-case complexity, which would make it less appealing in practice, a few experimental works have argued quite the opposite. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we analyze a well-known state-of-the-art algorithm in normal system conditions, in which crash failures may occur but no malicious attacks, proving that it is fast on average. We then leverage our analysis to improve its best-case complexity from three to two phases, by reducing the communication operations through speculative executions.

Since the effects of these faults may not be immediately perceived nor have a direct impact on the server's execution (e.g., a crash), they can remain hidden even if exercised by the test cases. Our detection approach consists in inferring a behavioral profile of a network server that models its correct execution by combining information about the implemented state machine protocol and the server's internal execution. Flaws are automatically detected if the server's behavior deviates from the profile while processing the test cases. This approach was implemented in a tool, which was used to analyze several FTP vulnerabilities, showing that it can effectively find various kinds of flaws.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["349"]}

For these, such increase can be explained by the integration of multiple software parts (e.g., various plugins and modules), often developed by different organizations, composing thus web application variants. Machine Learning has the potential to be a great ally on finding vulnerabilities, aiding experts by reducing the search space or even by classifying programs on their own. However, previous work usually does not consider SQLi or utilizes techniques hard to scale.

We present an execution protocol that breaks the dependency between the code size of the service and the identification overhead, without affecting security, and that works on different trusted components.

{"title": "A New Approach to Proactive Recovery\n", "abstract": " Recent papers propose asynchronous protocols that can tolerate any number of faults over the lifetime of the system, provided that at most f nodes become faulty during a given window of time. This is achieved through the so-called proactive recovery, which consists of periodically rejuvenating the system. Proactive recovery in asynchronous systems, though a major breakthrough, has some limitations which we identified in a recent work. In fact, proactive recovery protocols typically require stronger environment assumptions (eg, synchrony, security) than the rest of the system. In this paper, we take this in consideration and propose a new approach to proactive recovery that is based on an architecturally hybrid distributed system model. In this context, we present a secure real-time distributed component\u2014the Proactive Recovery Wormhole (PRW)\u2014that aims to execute, in a more dependable and effective way, proactive recovery protocols.

{"title": "On the Resilience of Intrusion-Tolerant Distributed Systems\n", "abstract": " The paper starts by introducing a new dimension along which distributed systems resilience may be evaluated - exhaustion-safety. A node-exhaustion-safe intrusion-tolerant distributed system is a system that assuredly does not suffer more than the assumed number of node failures (e.g., crash, Byzantine). We show that it is not possible to build this kind of systems under the asynchronous model. This result follows from the fact that in an asynchronous environment one cannot guarantee that the system terminates its execution before the occurrence of more than the assumed number of faults. After introducing exhaustion-safety, the paper proposes a new paradigm - proactive resilience - to build intrusion-tolerant distributed systems. Proactive resilience is based on architectural hybridization and hybrid distributed system modeling. The Proactive Resilience Model (PRM) is presented and shown to be a way of building node-exhaustion-safe intrusion-tolerant systems. Finally, the paper describes the design of a secret sharing system built according to the PRM.

O trabalho apresenta uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o para a concretiza\u00e7\u00e3o de servi\u00e7os replicados baseados em protocolos distribu\u00eddos, que assentam num modelo h\u00edbrido de sistema. Neste modelo, os protocolos s\u00e3o executados num ambiente com hip\u00f3teses muito fracas (e.g., quanto \u00e0 sincronia e quanto ao modelo de ataque), podendo recorrer esporadicamente a um componente especial para o processamento de opera\u00e7\u00f5es simples. A solu\u00e7\u00e3o preconizada por esta arquitectura \u00e9 atraente sob v\u00e1rios \u00e2ngulos, nomeadamente porque possibilita o projecto de protocolos tolerantes a intrus\u00f5es sem hip\u00f3teses temporais expl\u00edcitas, com um bom desempenho, e com um elevado n\u00edvel de seguran\u00e7a", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["349"]}
{"title": "How dependable are distributed f fault/intrusion-tolerant systems?\n", "abstract": " Fault-tolerant protocols, asynchronous and synchronous alike, make stationary fault assumptions: only a fraction f of the total n nodes may fail. Whilst a synchronous protocol is expected to have a bounded execution time, an asynchronous one may execute for an arbitrary amount of time, possibly sufficient for f+1 nodes to fail. This can compromise the safety of the protocol and ultimately the safety of the system. Recent papers propose asynchronous protocols that can tolerate any number of faults over the lifetime of the system, provided that at most f nodes become faulty during a given window of time. This is achieved through the so-called proactive recovery, which consists of periodically rejuvenating the system. Proactive recovery in asynchronous systems, though a major breakthrough, has some limitations which had not been identified before. In this paper, we introduce a system model expressive enough to represent these problems which remained in oblivion with the classical models. We introduce a classification of system correctness based on the predicate exhaustion-safe, meaning freedom from resource exhaustion. Based on it, we predict the extent to which fault/intrusion-tolerant distributed systems (synchronous and asynchronous) can be made to work correctly. Namely, our model predicts the impossibility of guaranteeing correct behavior of asynchronous proactive recovery systems as exist today. To prove our point, we give an example of how these problems impact an existing fault/intrusion tolerant distributed system, and having identified the problem, we suggest one (certainly not the only) way to tackle it", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["349"]}
