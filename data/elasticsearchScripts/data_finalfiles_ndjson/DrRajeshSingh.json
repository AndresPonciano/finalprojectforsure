Eta-1 encodes a highly acidic secreted product having structural features of proteins that bind to cellular adhesion receptors. The Eta-1 gene maps to a locus on murine chromosome 5 termed Ric that confers resistance to infection by Rickettsia tsutsugamushi (RT), an obligate intracellular bacterium that is the etiological agent for human scrub typhus. With one exception, inbred mouse strains that expressed the Eta-1a allele were resistant to RT infection (RicR), and inbred strains expressing the Eta-1b allele were susceptible (RicS). These findings suggest that Eta-1 is the gene inferred from previous studies of the Ric locus (5). Genetic resistance to RT infection is associated with a strong Eta-1 response in vivo and inhibition of early bacterial replication.

Previous studies have suggested that eta-1 might affect the ability of macrophages to migrate to the site of bacterial infection and/or to inhibit intracellular bacterial growth. We therefore examined the interaction of eta-1 with macrophages in vitro and in vivo. We find that macrophages express approximately 10(4) eta-1 receptors/cell and each receptor has a Kd of approximately 5 x 10(-10) M. The subsequence of eta-1 containing an RGD motif is required for binding because a synthetic peptide containing the eta-1 RGD domain inhibited protein attachment to macrophages. We also found that subcutaneous inoculation of mice with eta-1 resulted in a cellular infiltrate comprised primarily of macrophages.

Diminazene aceturate (Berenil) has been widely used as a chemotherapeutic agent for trypanosomiasis in livestock since 1955. As in livestock, treatment of infected highly susceptible BALB/c mice with Berenil leads to rapid control of parasitemia and survival from an otherwise lethal infection. The molecular and biochemical mechanisms of action of Berenil are still not very well defined and its effect on the host immune system has remained relatively unstudied. Here, we investigated whether Berenil has, in addition to its trypanolytic effect, a modulatory effect on the host immune response to Trypanosoma congolense.   Methodology/Principal Findings BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice were infected intraperitoneally with T. congolense, treated with Berenil and the expression of CD25 and FoxP3 on splenic cells was assessed directly ex vivo. In addition, serum levels and spontaneous and LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by splenic and hepatic CD11b+ cells were determined by ELISA. Berenil treatment significantly reduced the percentages of CD25+ cells, a concomitant reduction in the percentage of regulatory (CD4+Foxp3+) T cells and a striking reduction in serum levels of disease exacerbating pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-12, TNF and IFN-\u03b3.

However, Silwet L-77, when combined with a reduced rate (one-tenth the lowest label rate = LLR) of imidacloprid, killed >90% of eggs and adults in laboratory tests. In a subsequent field trial, the combination of Silwet L-77 and one-tenth the LLR of imidacloprid gave good control of nymphs, but exhibited weak residual toxicity to adults when compared to imidacloprid at the LLR.

However, paCOS generated via chemical N-acetylation or de-N-acetylation of GlcN or GlcNAc oligomers, respectively, typically display random patterns of acetylation, making it difficult to control and predict their bioactivities. In contrast, paCOS produced from chitin deacetylases (CDAs) acting on chitin oligomer substrates may have specific patterns of acetylation, as shown for some bacterial CDAs. However, compared to what we know about bacterial CDAs, we know little about the ability of fungal CDAs to produce defined paCOS with known patterns of acetylation. Therefore, we optimized the expression of a chitin deacetylase from the fungus\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "53\n", "authors": ["451"]}

{"title": "Modulation of innate immune mechanisms to enhance Leishmania vaccine-induced immunity: role of coinhibitory molecules\n", "abstract": " No licensed human vaccines are currently available against any parasitic disease including leishmaniasis. Several anti-leishmanial vaccine formulations have been tested in various animal models including genetically modified live attenuated parasite vaccines. Experimental infection studies have shown that Leishmania parasites utilize a broad range of strategies to undermine effector properties of host phagocytic cells i.e., dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages (M\uf046). Further, Leishmania parasites have evolved strategies to actively inhibit TH1 polarizing functions of DCs, and to condition the infected M\uf046 towards anti-inflammatory/alternative/M2 phenotype. The altered phenotype of phagocytic cells is characterized by decreased production of anti-microbial reactive oxygen, nitrogen molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-\uf067, IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1. These early events limit the activation of TH1 effector cells and set the stage for pathogenesis. Further, this early control of innate immunity by the virulent parasites results in substantial alteration in the adaptive immunity characterized by reduced proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and TH2 biased immunity that results in production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as TGF-\uf062, and IL-10. More recent studies have also documented the induction of co-inhibitory ligands such as CTLA-4, PD-L1, CD200 and Tim-3 that induce exhaustion and/or non-proliferation in antigen experienced T cells. Most of these studies focus on viral infections in chronic phase thus limiting the direct application of these results from these studies to parasitic infections and much less to parasitic vaccines.

Endothelial microvesicles (EMVs) are elevated in patients with traditional CV risk factors and acute coronary syndromes while platelet MVs (PMVs) are associated with atherosclerotic disease states. This study compared relative concentrations of circulating MVs from endothelial cells and platelets in two groups of dialysis patients and matched controls and investigated their relative thromboembolic risk. MVs were isolated from the blood of 20 haemodialysis (HD), 17 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients and 20 matched controls. Relative concentrations of EMVs (CD144+ ve) and PMVs (CD42b+ ve) were measured by Western blotting and total MV concentrations were measured using nanoparticle-tracking analysis. The ability to support thrombin generation was measured by reconstituting the MVs in normal plasma, using the Continuous Automated Thrombogram assay triggered with 1\u00b5M tissue factor. The total concentration of MVs as well as the measured sub-types was higher in both patient groups compared to controls (p<0.05). MVs from HD and PD patients were able to generate more thrombin than the controls, with higher peak thrombin, and endogenous thrombin potential levels (p<0.02). However there were no differences in either the relative quantity or activity of MVs between the two patient groups (p>0.3). Dialysis patients have higher levels of circulating procoagulant MVs than healthy controls.

With the absence of actual characteristic maps, performance adaptation needs to be done for good imitations of actual engine performance. A nonlinear multiple point genetic algorithm based performance adaptation developed earlier by the authors using a set of nonlinear scaling factor functions has been proven capable of making accurate performance predictions over a wide range of operating conditions. However, the success depends on searching the right range of scaling factor coefficients heuristically, in order to obtain the optimum scaling factor functions.

The soft tissue facial landmarks are known to be influenced by age, race and sex and it is imperative to identify a balance between them before reconstructive surgery. Further, with knowledge of standard facial traits, an individualized norm can be established to optimize facial attractiveness.Material & Methods: Measurements were made on 60 infants (30 males and 30 females) aged between 1-4 months and 60 newborns (30 males and 30 females) with a view to establish the criterion of facial anthropometry for this age group in North Indians. A special emphasis was given in this study to sexual dimorphism.Findings: The mean value and range for all the parameters was determined for the North Indian population. A statistically significant sexual dimorphism was noted to exist in ear length (P< 0.01) and length of the philtrum (P< 0.05). Philtral-commissural ratio was determined for North Indians, philtrum width= oral width/3.2.Conclusion: The local values derived from well defined populations should be used as reference in the evaluation of a case with dimorphic features. This study demonstrates the existence of a partial positive correlation between philtral width and oral width, ie when one increases the other also increases and vice versa.

{"title": "Forearm IVRA, using 0.5% lidocaine in a dose of 1.5 mg/kg with ketorolac 0.15 mg/kg for hand and wrist surgeries.\n", "abstract": " AIM: Local anesthetic toxicity remains one of the most dreaded complications of the intravenous regional anesthesia (IVRA) technique. It results from the sudden release of a large amount of local anesthetic (LA) into the systemic circulation. This release can occur when the tourniquet deflates accidentally during the procedure or when it is deflated intentionally at the end of the procedure to terminate the anesthesia. The forearm tourniquet IVRA technique may offer distinct advantages over the conventional upper arm tourniquet IVRA technique. Use of a forearm tourniquet allows the dosage of local anesthetic to be decreased to almost half of what is required with an upper arm tourniquet, and the incidence of tourniquet pain has been reported to be less with forearm tourniquet. In this study, authors assessed the clinical efficacy of administering IVRA with lidocaine plus ketorolac using either a forearm or upper arm tourniquet. METHODS: Upper arm IVRA was established using 0.5% lidocaine at a dose of 3 mg/kg with ketorolac at 0.3 mg/kg. Forearm IVRA was established using 0.5% lidocaine at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg with ketorolac at 0.15 mg/kg.

Emulgels has to be used as a topical drug delivery system for hydrophobic drugs. When gels and emulsions are used in combined form the dosage forms are referred as emulgels. Emulgels have emerged as one of the most interesting topical delivery system as it has dual release control system ie gel and emulsion. The major objective behind this formulation is delivery of hydrophobic drugs to systemic circulation via skin. In recent years, there has been great interest in the use of novel polymers which can function as emulsifiers and thickeners because the gelling capacity of these compounds allows the formulation of stable emulsions and creams by decreasing surface and interfacial tension and at the same time increasing the viscosity of the aqueous phase. In fact, the presence of a gelling agent in the water phase converts a classical emulsion into an emulgel. Emulgels for dermatological use have several favourable properties such as being thixotropic, greaseless, easily spreadable, easily removable, and emollient, no staining, water-soluble, longer shelf life, and bio-friendly, transparent & pleasing appearance. These emulgels are having major advantages on novel vesicular systems as well as on conventional systems in various aspects. Various permeation enhancers can potentiate the effect. So emulgel formulations can be used as better topical drug delivery systems over present conventional systems available in market.", "num_citations": "29\n", "authors": ["451"]}

In Section 2 we prove some results concerning unbiased estimation of location and scale parameters.

We show that there exists no unbiased estimator for the location parameter, and none with finite variance for the scale parameters. If the Cauchy density involves both location and scale parameters, then it is shown that neither of these parameters has an unbiased estimator.

{"title": "Structural diversity in the dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) polyphenol oxidase family results in different responses to model substrates\n", "abstract": " Polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) are ubiquitous type-3 copper enzymes that catalyze the oxygen-dependent conversion of o-diphenols to the corresponding quinones. In most plants, PPOs are present as multiple isoenzymes that probably serve distinct functions, although the precise relationship between sequence, structure and function has not been addressed in detail. We therefore compared the characteristics and activities of recombinant dandelion PPOs to gain insight into the structure\u2013function relationships within the plant PPO family. Phylogenetic analysis resolved the 11 isoenzymes of dandelion into two evolutionary groups. More detailed in silico and in vitro analyses of four representative PPOs covering both phylogenetic groups were performed. Molecular modeling and docking predicted differences in enzyme-substrate interactions, providing a structure-based explanation for grouping. One amino acid side chain positioned at the entrance to the active site (position HB2+1) potentially acts as a \u201cselector\u201d for substrate binding. In vitro activity measurements with the recombinant, purified enzymes also revealed group-specific differences in kinetic parameters when the selected PPOs were presented with five model substrates. The combination of our enzyme kinetic measurements and the in silico docking studies therefore indicate that the physiological functions of individual PPOs might be defined by their specific interactions with different natural substrates.", "num_citations": "25\n", "authors": ["451"]}

INTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE REVIEW The exploration for oil and gas in ever increasing water depths has given an impetus to research efforts on the behaviour of offshore structures under ocean environment. These structures are continuously subjected to environmental loading because of waves, wind and current. A response analysis is required to assess the safety of offshore structure under severe storm conditions as well as for estimation of damage caused by less severe but more frequently occuring sea states. A majority of the reported failures in the life time of offshore structures are in fact fatigue failures. The offshore structures are usually built in the form of welded tubular structures. The joints of these tubular members experience the fatigue damage mainly due to small defects in welding which act as crack initiators, high stress concentrations and the variable loads. The variable loads due to the ocean waves cause cyclic stress variation in the structural members and the accumu lated effect of these stresses results in the fatigue failure.", "num_citations": "23\n", "authors": ["451"]}

Applied Si seems to interact favorably with other nutrients (N, P, and K) and offers the potential to improve efficiency in terms of yield response. Silicon helps rice plants to resist biotic stresses (insect pests and fungal diseases) and tolerate abiotic stresses (Al, Fe, and Mn toxicities). It also helps reduce cuticular transpiration and, to some extent, crop lodging caused by excessive N supply (Savant et al 1997). It has been observed that rice plants in the most productive ecosystem of Varanasi region, which is identical to that of the northeastern plain zone of India, have started showing a tendency to lodge, even with the use of nonlodging, high-yielding, and short-duration varieties at the recommended fertilizer doses.

By reducing Lead Time, manufacturing companies not only can increase their efficiency and effectiveness, but also they will be responsive, committed and pioneering by bringing the new products to market quicker than their competitors. By implementing Lean/JIT (LJIT) practices within Arm and between Arms, we can reduce the lead time of the product.

The environmental concerns regarding the potential contamination of soil, surface water and ground water due to the presence of heavy metals in the ash is of serious concern. Moreover, the use of low quality coal with high ash content results in large quantities of bottom and fly ashes for disposal. This study is carried out to analyze the heavy metals concentration of fly ash and pond ash from Badarpur thermal power plant located in Delhi. The current disposal methods of fly ash by the plant management are also studied. The samples of the fly ashes were analyzed for the presence of Chromium (Cr), Nickel (Ni) and Zinc (Zn) and the detectable levels of these metals were found in both fly ash and pond ash. The concentration of Ni was higher as compared to Cr concentration. The wet disposal method is used in the thermal power plant. The ground water samples of the ash pond were also analyzed and investigated for the presence of these heavy metals. The concentration of Zn was found in higher side while Ni concentration was very less and Cr was below detectable limit. No ash pond lining is employed in the construction of the ash pond; hence leaching of heavy metals is possible. Promotion of increased use of fly ash in construction activities, proper disposal practices with better management need to be undertaken to minimize the adverse impacts of fly ash on the surrounding environment.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["451"]}

Isoproturon resistance is now common throughout the Indo-Gangetic Plains of India covering more than one million ha. Recently, some of the populations have evolved multiple resistances to 3 modes of action (Photosynthesis at photosystem II site A, ACCase and ALS inhibitor). However, these multiple resistant populations are sensitive to triazine (metribuzin and terbutryn) and dinitroaniline (pendimethalin) herbicides. The dependence on herbicides has contributed to the rapid evolution of multiple herbicide resistance and integrated weed management strategies must be developed to ensure the long term sustainability of wheat production in India. Early sowing, zero tillage and bed planting technique reduce the incidence of P. minor.

Results are also presented from tests on 5 bamboo species (B. pallida, B. vulgaris, D. giganteus, D. hamiltonii and O. abyssinica) made in split form. Studies on round bamboos in the green condition indicated that while the external diameter and wall thickness of different species decreased from bottom to top portions of the culms, no clear within species trend existed in the variation of strength properties with position in the culm, external diameter, wall thickness, or specific gravity in most of the species. For most of the properties, variations between the five sample culms of each species tested were significant. On the basis of the green condition strength data, relations between external diameter and three properties (fiber strength at elastic limit, modulus of rupture, and modulus of elasticity) under bending are suggested; equations are presented for these.

Professor Franz Halberg contributed greatly to our understanding of the importance of chronobiology in prevention, intervention, and treatment of CVD: hence this article of remembrance. Clinical and biochemical manifestations of chronic heart failure (HF) may be due to interactions of the brain and the heart. Circadian rhythms may be lost via neuro-humoral adaptations, such as activation of the renin-angiotensinaldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems in the brain, heart, and peripheral vessels in a milieu of melatonin deficiency. Methods. Internet and database searches and discussion with colleagues. Results. Experimental and clinical evidence indicates that chronic HF may be associated with autonomic imbalance with increased sympathetic nerve activity and a withdrawal of parasympathetic activity, with the target of involvement being the heart. Brain-heart interactions may result from an increased systemic and cerebral angiotensin II signaling since plasma angiotensin II is increased in humans and animals with chronic HF. The increase in angiotensin II signaling enhances sympathetic nerve activity through actions on both central and peripheral sites causing increased contractility of the heart, as an adaptation, during chronic HF. Angiotensin II signaling is enhanced in different brain sites such as the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) and area postrema (AP) via neuregulin-brain natriuretic peptide release from these sites which influences the function of cardiomyocytes and the heart.

{"title": "Performance evaluation of hybrid reconfigurable computing architecture over symmetrical FPGAs\n", "abstract": " For last few decades, reconfigurable devices have been extensively used in digital systems. Reconfigurable computing using FPGA devices provide a method to utilize the available logic resources on the chip for various computations. The basic ability of reconfigurable computing is to perform computations in hardware to increase performance, while retaining the flexibility of application software. The two main types of programmable logic devices, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) based on LUTs technology and complex programmable logic device (CPLD) based on PLAs technology. They are both widely used and each contributing particular strengths in the area of reconfigurable system design. We identified Hybrid LUTs/PLAs architectures as Hybrid Reconfigurable Computing Architectures (HRCA). The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the performance of HRCA over regular FPGA device for reconfigurable computing by mixing of Look up tables (LUTs) and Programmable logic arrays (PLAs) architecture. The basis of the HRCA is that some parts of digital circuits are well-suited for execution with LUTs, but other parts help more from the PLAs structures. For several classes of high performance applications, HRCA offers significant savings in total computational delay comparison with a symmetrical FPGA which contain only LUTs. It also offers some improvements in logical area and power consumption. Experimental results based on MCNC benchmark circuit were performed on implemented HRCA CAD and compare between HRCA and symmetrical FPGA. Initially results indicate that noteworthy saving in computational delay and logic\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["451"]}

The study indicated that irrigation at IW/CPE ratio 1.0 gave significantly higher plant height, dry matter accumulation plant-1, leaf area plant-1 and leaf area index at all the growth stages and seed, haulm and biological yields over IW/CPE ratios 0.8 and 0.6. Number of branches, number of nodules and their dry weight plant-1 were also highest with irrigation at IW/CPE ratio 1.0. Days to 50% flowering and maturity significantly increased with increasing levels of irrigation from IW/CPE ratio 0.6 to 1.0. Besides weed free treatment, higher plant height, dry matter accumulation plant-1, number of nodules and their weight plant-1, number of branches plant-1, days to 50% flowering and maturity were recorded with weed control by pre-emergence application of Pendimethalin @ 0.75 kg ha-1 + Inter-culturing at 40 days after sowing (DAS) and hand weeding at 20 and 40 DAS which were significantly superior over rest of treatments. Application of irrigation at IW/CPE ratio 1.0 along with weed control by pre-emergence application of Pendimethalin @ 0.75 kg ha-1 + Inter culturing at 40 DAS is beneficial for realising better growth and productivity of fenugreek", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["451"]}

{"title": "Effect of silicon carriers and time of application on rice productivity in a rice-wheat cropping sequence\n", "abstract": " Scientists report declining trends in productivity of the irrigated rice-wheat cropping system and this growth stagnation has been observed not only in India but in most Asian countries as well. Experiments conducted so far have failed to establish a positive correlation between declining ricewheat yield under the irrigated system and properties of available nutrients under long-term fertility experiments in intensive cropping systems. Scientists are therefore looking at another possibility. Plant-available silicon (Si) in the soil could be a possible soil-related cause of declining rice yields due to continuous higher mining by rice (Singh et al 2005). The present study aimed to find out the effect of recycling Si carriers through rice straw compost at different times of Si application on rice productivity in rice-wheat cropping systems. A field experiment was conducted at the IAS Research Farm during the rainy seasons of 1999-2000, 2000-01, 2001-02, and 2002-03.

{"title": "Optimizing seed replacement rates in Jharkhand: present scenario, challenges and opportunities\n", "abstract": " Farm saved seed (FSS) is commonly used to raise the next crop in predominantly rainfed Jharkhand. Though the organized seed sector is able to produce seed in large quantities, presently, in Jharkhand, the supply chain is unable to cope with the huge demand for seed (approximately 75 percent of the planting material used in the state is farm saved seed). Due to predominance of rainfed agriculture, poor infrastructure, monocropping, undulated topography, inadequate seed availability including seed cost and poor technology adaptation etc., the seed replacement rates of cereals, pulses and oilseeds, except rice, in the state are poor. This paper attempts to analyse the seed requirement of different crops in Jharkhand state. It discusses the constraints and strategies to enhance seed replacement rates (SRRs) including the impact of SRR on crop productivity. Due to improved varietal replacement rates (VRRs) and SRRs in Jharkhand state, the average productivity increased by 27.9 percent in rice, wheat (13.9%), pulses (18.3%), and in oilseed by 29.6 percent during 2007-08 to 2014-15, over the base year 2006-07. This signifies the critical role of both VRRs and SRRs in enhancing production, which should contribute to improving food security in Jharkhand.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["451"]}

{"title": "Agroforestry: an approach for food security\n", "abstract": " Periodic unavailability of farm inputs, degradation of natural resources and population explosion problems are the main causes of food insecurity. Intensive agricultural practices required to meet food requirements of increasing human population, led to large scale resource degradation. The unavailability of natural resources, high costs and periodic limited availability of mineral fertilizers and other farm inputs have reduced the farm production. The past approaches in agriculture production have failed to reduce food insecurity and sustainability in production. Agroforestry science, and its application by smallholders throughout the tropics, have a potential and played an important role in achieving sustainability in farm productivity. The incorporation of a diverse variety of trees into agricultural systems can increase crop productivity and incomes of smallholding farmers through diverse products viz., edible flowers, fruits and fodder. The well managed multipurpose tree species on farm benefits in the case of efficient use of natural resources enhance the overall (biomass) productivity, improvement in soil fertility, soil conservation and nutrient cycling, micro-climate amelioration, carbon sequestration, bio-drainage, bioenergy and bio-fuel production etc. Nowadays farmers, researchers, policy makers are interested in agroforestry for its ability to contribute in meeting deficit of agricultural and tree products with socio-economic and environmental benefits.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["451"]}

{"title": "Agroforestry practices for improving soil nutrient status\n", "abstract": " Agricultural production is mainly dependent on availability of natural recourses. Increasing human and livestock population creates pressure on natural resources, which limits their availability in cropping systems. Increasing crop productivity to meet increasing food requirements with resource conservation in our country is a greater challenge. High fertile soils contribute mostly in country\u2019s food production through improving soil productivity. Intensification of agriculture results in depletion of soil fertility through overutilization of recourses. The land use systems comprising of tree, crops and pastures play an important role in improving soil fertility and its quality by several ways. Agroforestry has a great potential of both restoring and maintaining soil fertility and increasing agricultural production. Perennial woody tree species are the important component of agroforestry systems. They reduce nutrient losses from the productive system through efficient nutrient cycling. Addition of nutrients through litter decomposition, dead root biomass and N2 fixation increases importance of tree species in soil nutrient status improvement. Researchers and planners are recommending agroforestry systems for increasing agricultural production with improving soil nutrient status.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["451"]}

The optimal strategies to prevent and manage such infections are still evolving as good-quality prospective data to guide such management decisions are not yet abundant within the medical literature and many recommendations are based on retrospective reviews or anecdotal evidence. We will outline a general strategy to deal with cochlear implant-related infection based on both the authors' experience and the published literature.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["451"]}

Clinical and laboratory diagnosis of scrub typhus is often difficult due to overlapping clinical signs and symptoms and lack of sensitive and specific diagnostic assays respectively. Common clinical findings include fever with variable presence of rash, eschar and lymphadenopathy. Of late, scrub typhus cases are being reported in large numbers in India and probable reasons may be attributed to expanding mite islands and/or awareness about the disease among the medical fraternity.In the present case, the patient\u2019s primary complaint was unresolved fever with a headache. As the patient was an agriculturist and had exposure to domestic animals, brucellosis was suspected, but due to the presence of lymphadenopathy and rash, the presumptive diagnosis shifted towards rickettsial diseases. The patient did not present with a pathognomonic eschar. All investigations for fever were negative except for that of scrub typhus. Based on the serological and molecular tests the patient was found to be infected with O. tsutsugamushi, and he responded dramatically to doxycycline therapy. False positive test results in Weil Felix has been observed in conditions such as leptospirosis, dengue and urinary tract infections due to Proteus species12.

The population (1210 million) pressure is increasing while, area under cultivation (143 million ha) is static or even shrinking, which demands the intensification of cropping. Agriculture provides abundant food for driving out famine. Being agriculture country, historically India has policies in various phases for the development of agriculture with the expectation that would lead to overall development of the nation and helps to eradication of poverty. Green revolution brought about technological breakthrough, which leads to the use of short duration high yielding varieties, intensive use of land, increasing irrigated area and prolific use of chemicals such as fertilizers & pesticides.

The study was conducted from 0-6 weeks comprising six dietary treatments in triplicate with 10 chickens in each replicate. The diets were formulated to supply 23% crude protein (CP) and 2800 kcal ME/kg in starter ration and 20% CP and 2900 kcal ME/kg in finisher ration. The experimental diets were offered ad libitum with free access to water throughout the entire experiment. Inclusion of aflatoxin in the feed at 0.5 mg/kg feed caused a significant reduction in the growth performance of broilers. Supplementation of melatonin (20 mg/kg in feed and 20 mg/kg body weight through ip route) or its pre-cursor (L-tryptophan at 250 mg/kg feed) in aflatoxin fed broilers resulted in numerically improved perform-ance. Aflatoxin inclusion in the feed also caused a significant reduction in haemagglutination titer against sheep RBC and cell mediated immune responses to phytohemagglutinin (PHA-P) in broilers. Melatonin or L-tryptophan inclusion in toxin incorporated feed significantly improved both humoral and cell mediated immunity. No significant (P> 0.05) differences were observed among various groups with respect to kidney and spleen weight but liver weight increased significantly (P\u2264 0.05) and weight of bursa significantly decreased upon aflatoxin inclusion.

{"title": "Studies on metallurgical properties of wire rope for safe operation in mines\n", "abstract": " This paper describes the different metallurgical properties which define the state of wire rope in mines like wear and corrosion, lubrication, micro examination, galvanization and chemical analysis. Wear and corrosion affects primarily on outer surface and sometime in may penetrate deeper and change the mechanical property. In abrasive wear, wire and strand movement is restricted, therefore the risk of failure by bending fatigue is increased and reduction of wire area can lead to failure under tensile load. Whereas lubrication retards corrosion and therefore proper lubrication helps in preventing premature failure due to abrasion, fatigue and corrosion. Micro structural study of wire rope reveals both manufacturing defects as well as service degradation. Defects like grain distortion, harmful inclusion,  decarburization,  damage of zinc coating, corrosion pits etc. is clearly visible in microstructural studies. Galvanization of wire rope protects it from corrosion as well as it has a good fatigue resistance. Chemical testing of wire rope however ensure quality and safety in mining. The importance of these metallurgical parameters has also been highlighted in a case study of failure analysis of wire rope.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["451"]}

{"title": "Environmental impacts of organic fertilizer usage in agriculture\n", "abstract": " Nowadays expansion of global population is responsible for increasing the food demand. Use of intensive farming techniques is creating not only localized ecological disasters, but in many places having impacts across countryside. Because of intensive farming, physico-chemical properties of soil are affected and that consequently results in decreased soil fertility.In order to produce more food with limited space, farmers utilize several techniques. One of the best techniques is application of different types of inorganic and organic fertilizers in soil that consequently maintain the soil nutrients level. It allows plant to grow, flourish, and deal with pests, diseases and environmental stresses. Uses of organic fertilizer along with inorganic fertilizers are recommended to maintain the integrated nutrient management (INM) systems in soil.

{"title": "Climate variability and trends in part of Brahmaputra river basin\n", "abstract": " One of the most significant consequences of global warming would be an increase in magnitude and frequency of extreme events like heat waves (IPCC 2007). The detection of trends in meteorological data, in particular rainfall and temperature is essential for the assessment of the impacts of climate variability and change on the water resources of a region. The Brahmaputra River is a trans-boundary river with its origin in southwestern Tibet going through the Himalayas in the great gorges and into Arunachal Pradesh. It flows southwest through the Assam State of India (Brahmaputra River Basin) and south through Bangladesh. This study focuses on the Subansiri sub-basin of the Brahmaputra River which is one of its principal tributaries and forms one of its largest sub-basins. This study aims to determine trends in the annual and seasonal daily rainfall and temperature (maximum, minimum and mean) over Subansiri river basin. The data used in this study consists of daily gridded rainfall data at 0.25 \u00ba\u00d7 0.25 \u00ba resolution for a period of 37 years (1970-2007) and daily gridded temperature data at 1\u00ba\u00d7 1\u00ba resolution for a period of 36 years (1969-2005). Historical trends in daily rainfall as well as maximum, minimum and mean temperature (daily) have been examined using regression analysis and Mann-Kendall (MK) statistics. The non parametric MK statistical test has been widely applied to asses the significance of trends in hydrological time series. On the basis of regression and MK test, rising and falling trend in rainfall and anamolies at various grid points have been analysed. The result shows that many of these variables demonstrate statistically\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["451"]}

{"title": "Molecular regulation of Trypanosoma congolense-induced nitric oxide production in macrophages\n", "abstract": " BALB/c mice are highly susceptible while C57BL/6 mice are relatively resistant to experimental Trypanosoma congolense infection. Several reports show that an early interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) response in infected mice is critically important for resistance via the activation of macrophages and production of nitric oxide (NO). NO is a pivotal effector molecule and possesses both cytostatic and cytolytic properties for the parasite. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to T. congolense (TC)-induced NO release from macrophages are not known. In this study, we investigated the signaling pathways induced by trypanosomes in immortalized macrophage cell lines from the highly susceptible BALB/c (BALB.BM) and relatively resistant C57Bl/6 (ANA-1) mice. We found that T. congolense whole cell extract (TC-WCE) induces significantly higher levels of NO production in IFN-\u03b3-primed ANA-1 than BALB.BM cells, which was further confirmed in primary bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) cultures. NO production was dependent on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK, including p38, Erk1/2, and JNK) phosphorylation and was significantly inhibited by specific MAPK inhibitors in BALB.BM, but not in ANA-1 cells. In addition, T. congolense- and IFN-\u03b3-induced NO production in ANA-1 and BALB.BM cells was dependent on STAT1 phosphorylation and was totally suppressed by the use of fludarabine (a specific STAT1 inhibitor).

A total of 300 day-old broiler chicks were divided into ten treatment groups (T1= control; T2= T1+ 1 ppm AF; T3= T1+ 250 ppm AA; T4= T1+ 500 ppm AA; T5= T2+ 250 ppm AA; T6= T2+ 5000 ppm BHA; T7= T1+ 1000 ppm BHA; T8= T1+ 2000 ppm BHA; T9= T2+ 1000 ppm BHA; T10= T2+ 2000 ppm BHA). The results showed that inclusion of 1 ppm of total aflatoxin in the diet resulted in a significant decrease in body weight gain (BWG). Supplementation of AA or BHA to the AF contaminated diets increased BWG of broilers (P< 0.05). Additing AA at both levels to the aflatoxin contaminated diet did not ameliorate the adverse effects of aflatoxicosis on FC. Incorporation of AA and BHA each at both levels, in aflatoxin contaminated diet could not ameliorate the ill effects of aflatoxicosis on feed efficiency in broiler chickens. The serum protein content of group T5 did not differ significantly (P< 0.05) from that of T2, however, serum protein content in T6 was significantly (P< 0.05) higher than that of T2. Indicating that inclusion of 250 ppm AA in the aflatoxin contaminated diet did not improve serum cholesterol content significantly. Inclusion of 500 ppm AA in the aflatoxin contaminated diet improved (P< 0.05) the serum cholesterol content, however, the value was lower (P< 0.05) than that of control.

Quantitative and qualitative undersupply of basic infrastructure is one of the major consequences affecting large parts of the urban population. This is particularly true for urban water systems entrusted with the task of providing safe water supply and safe disposal of waste water.There are numerous \u2018inadequacies\u2019 in urban wastewater and sanitation infrastructure. In many urban areas these basic services are either non existent or difficult to access. If existent, many times it does not fulfill its primary task of ensuring the safe disposal of wastewater due to various reasons, like ageing infrastructure and poor maintenance leading to creation of \u2018unsafe conditions\u2019. Unsafe conditions are the specific forms in which vulnerability is expressed in time and space (Blaikie et al., 1994). Watts and Bohle (1993) argued by formalizing thesocial space of vulnerability, which is constituted by exposure, capacity and potentiality. The influences of these infrastructural inadequacies, prolonged exposures to unsafe conditions and poor potentiality are finally reflected as health burden and other allied costs to people in terms of money, time and effort involved for managing their own wastes, protecting and treating themselves against various water related illnesses.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["451"]}

Molecular markers are now common tools that are applied in many aspects of breeding strategies. However, the use of molecular markers requires resources of time and funds that should not be taken for granted. The huge numbers of accessions that are stored at present in gene banks contain a wealth of genetic diversity that is largely unexplored. Identifying this variation within gene bank collections is a major challenge to make the genetic diversity for specific characters available for crop improvement. Allele mining techniques, association genetics and comparative genomics are promising developments for gene banks in order to achieve this goal. An important development in agriculture is the increasing interest in ecological farming. To meet the demands from this sector, molecular markers may play a role in providing the genetic resources of interest, such as material with a genetically broader base or material less adapted to cultivated conditions. A clear and additional challenge for molecular markers in this era is the consideration of the development of pre-breeding as part of their routine services for breeders.

The experiment was carried out during two growing seasons (2014-15 and 2015-16). The two factors (different tillage and weed management systems) were studied, with four levels of tillage systems (conventional tillage no-residue, conventional tillage with residue, zero tillage no residue, zero tillage with residue) in main plot and six levels of post-emergence weed management systems (weedy check, weed free, mesosulfuron 12 g ai. ha-1 at 30 DAS fb one hand weeding at 45 DAS, metsulfuron 4 g ai. ha-1 at 30 DAS fb one hand weeding at 45 DAS, clodinafop+ metsulfuron 60+ 4 g ai. ha-1 at 30 DAS and mesosulfuron+ iodosulfuron 12+ 2.4 g ai. ha-1 at 30 DAS) were allocated to sub plots. The conventional tillage with or without residue retention, performed for seedbed preparation recorded the emergence of a high percentage of weeds, increases the appearance of grassy weeds, especially Phalaris minor, Avena ludoviciana, and Cynodan dactylon in wheat crops, when compared to their establishment in zero-till system with or without residue retention. Among post-emergence herbicide treatment, mesosulfuron+ iodosulfuron recorded lowest population of grassy weeds followed by clodinafop+ metsulfuron. Therefore, zero tillage with residue and the mix application of mesosulfuron+ iodosulfuron can be recommended for grassy weed control in wheat in eastern part of Uttar Pradesh.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["451"]}

The process of removing the atmospheric interference from the satellite-level signal is called atmospheric correction. Atmospheric correction can be performed through various methods such as, empirical method, semi-physical method, detailed radiative transfer models. Various methods exist for atmospheric correction of available global sensors such as NOAA-AVHRR, MODIS-Terra/Aqua, MERIS, Landsat-TM/ETM etc. However, there was no method available for atmospheric correction of the IRS data sets. A new physics-based model called Scheme for Atmospheric Correction of ResourceSat-2 AWiFS data (SACRS2) has been developed at Space Applications Centre (SAC) specifically tuned for the RS2-AWiFS sensor. This model has been developed from theoretical signal simulations using the 6SV (The Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum vector version) code. A detail analysis was carried out to perform inter comparison of the results of SACRS2 model with standard atmospheric correction models such as FLAASH (Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercube) and 6SV on RS2-AWiFS data. In turn, the performance of all three models was compared to in-situ measurements carried out over an experimental site located in the Kutch desert for seven RS2-AWiFS overpasses.

The substrates required for energy production change noticeably at successive stages of testes development suggesting a significant flexibility in the expression of glycolytic enzymes. Therefore, expression of LHDA and LDHB mRNAs was examined in adult and prepubertal quail testis. The mRNA of both LDHA and LDHB were expressed and no significant difference was observed in prepubertal testes. The mRNA levels of LDHB significantly increased during testicular development. In the adult testis, LDHA mRNA was not expressed. Expression studies revealed the presence of different LDH isozymes during testicular development. In contrast, electrophoresis of both testicular samples revealed only single band at a position indicative of an extreme type of LDH isozyme in quail testes. Furthermore, nucleotide and amino acid sequence analysis revealed significant similarity to chicken, duck and rock pigeon.

Delhi, with around 15 million populations generates more than 3,987 million liters of wastewater per day, out of which only 47% gets treated, using about 63% of the total treatment capacity. About 50% of its population lives in informal settlements with precarious sewerage and sanitation provisions grappling with numerous water and wastewater related problems. In this respect certain types and degrees of vulnerability exist, particularly among the marginalized population of the informal settlement quarters. The internal and external conditions and processes responsible for increasing defenselessness develop dynamically and need to be understood from various perspectives. This study is based on comprehensive household survey and attempts to analyse wastewater problems and related social vulnerability in different residential colonies of both formal and informal settings. It further explores the community and institutional coping responses and adaptations measures against the prevailing wastewater situation in Delhi. Inadequate wastewater management, locational disadvantages and poor socio-economic conditions finally manifest into environmental and health implications. Vulnerability is higher in informal settlements which remains invisible or only mildly perceived until it strikes as a major (disease) outbreak. People`s perception also plays an important role in understanding social\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["451"]}

Against the background of a literature review, which explores the rationale for the implementation of shared school governance in England, Australia, the United States and South Africa, this study draws on a qualitative inquiry on the practices and perspectives of school principals in terms of shared school governance as they confront the challenges of school restructuring in a small sample of public primary and secondary schools in the Stanger District of Kwazulu-Natal. The findings indicated that shared school governance implies internal power devolution within schools and democratisation of management at all levels. The study suggests that shared governance requires courageous and honest leaders, who are able to develop decision-making structures and processes that promote, rather than hinder, meaningful participation and collaboration.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["451"]}
{"title": "Food security and policy perspective in India\n", "abstract": " Achievement of national food security has been a major goal of development policy in India for half a century, since the country became Independent. This was to be achieved by attaining self-sufficiency in the availability of food; raising the purchasing power of the poor through the endowment of land and non-land assets and by generating employment opportunities. In the process of ensuring availability of food, an important step is the food distribution through public intervention for stabilising consumption. In India, the achievements have been substantial in terms of reaching near self-sufficiency in food and overcoming transient food insecurity through public procurement and distribution of foodgrains. However, despite a significant decline in poverty from 51.3 per cent in 1977-78 to 36 per cent in 1993-94 and 26.1 per cent in 1999-2000, the problem of food insecurity still persists, as a large proportion of the population is still below poverty line. There has been an increase in the consumption of superior cereals like rice and wheat with a reduction in the consumption of coarse cereals. The value of monthly per capita consumption expenditure on food items has declined from 63.8 per cent to 54 per cent in rural areas and from 56 per cent to 42 per cent in urban areas in the last one and half decade. The expenditure on non-food items on the other hand has gone up. Since, in India, agriculture continues to be a tradable sector, many of the structural reform policies are now showing their effect on agricultural exports, imports, investments in new technology and on rural infrastructure, patterns of agricultural growth, income and employment in\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["451"]}

Due to the powerful singularity theorem [1, 2], it was widely believed that cosmological models must have initial singularity. However, in 1990 Senovilla [3] obtained the first singularity-free cosmological perfect-fluid (with a realistic equation of state 3p= \u03c1) solution of the Einstein equation and since then the possibility of constructing regular cosmologies was renewed. The interest for regular cosmologies had stifled for nearly 30 years due to the powerful singularity theorems, which seemed to preclude such space-times under very general requirements, such as chronology protecting, energy and generic conditions. The open way to regular cosmologies was found in the violation of some technical premises", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["451"]}

In India, statistical data indicates that about 70 per cent of mine fires heating are caused due to spontaneous heating. To deal with spontaneous heating problems in mines. Sufficient knowledge about the oxidation characteristics of coal on laboratory scale is essential Based on the above fact, present study has been carried out in the laboratory using coal samples of four different Indian coal seams. 40 gram coal sample of .40 mesh size was heated in a reaction vessel at a constant airflow rate of 90 cc/min under the temperature range from 40 to 300\u00b0C. Gas samples were collected form reaction vessel and were analysed in a microprocessor based gas chromatograph. The analysis results indicate that the emission of CO started from 40\u00b0C in all the coal samples and concentration of CO increases with increase in temperature and the O2 concentration follow the opposite trend. Emission of hydrocarbons started only after a temperature of 120\u00b0C. Emission of CI-C4 hydrocarbons may be utilized to assess the status of fire in the sealed panels. The study also revealed that CO is the best indicator for early detection of spontaneous heating of Indian coals.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["451"]}

{"title": "Chitosan perception in Arabidopsis requires the chitin receptor AtCERK1 suggesting an improved model for receptor structure and function\n", "abstract": " Chitin, a linear polymer of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, and chitosans, fully or partially deacetylated derivatives of chitin, are known to elicit defense reactions in higher plants. We compared the ability of chitin and chitosan oligomers and polymers (chitin oligomers with degree of polymerization 3 to 8; chitosan oligomers with degree of acetylation 0% to 35% and degree of polymerization 3 to 15; chitosan polymers with degree of acetylation 1% to 60% and degree of polymerization ~1300) to elicit an oxidative burst indicative of induced defense reactions in A. thaliana seedlings. Fully deacetylated chitosans were not able to trigger a response; elicitor activity increased with increasing degree of acetylation of chitosan polymers. Partially acetylated chitosan oligomers required a minimum degree of polymerization of 6 and at least four N-acetyl groups to trigger a response. Invariably, elicitation of an oxidative burst required the presence of the chitin receptor AtCERK1. Our results as well as previously published studies on chitin and chitosan perception in plants are best explained by a new general model of LysM-containing receptor complexes where two partners form a long, but off-set chitin-binding groove and are, thus, dimerized by one chitin or chitosan molecule, sharing a central GlcNAc unit with which both LysM domains interact. To verify this model and to distinguish it from earlier models, we assayed elicitor and inhibitor activities of selected partially acetylated chitosan oligomers with fully defined structures. In contrast to the initial \u201ccontinuous groove\u201d, the original \u201csandwich\u201d, or the current \u201csliding mode\u201d models for the chitin/chitosan receptor, the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["451"]}

A linear four-element array of slot antenna is preferred due to its higher immunity to spurious signals. Null steering is also demonstrated by controlling the bias voltage of PIN diodes. The proposed slot antenna array is fabricated on one side of the substrate with the microstrip feeding network on the opposite side. Two configurations of the slot array are designed, fabricated and tested. Experimental results showed good agreement with the simulated results. Broad nulls are achieved in the angular range of 30\u00b0 in the First configuration and 45\u00b0 in the second configuration with a null depth of \u2264 -20 dB from peak in the direction of \u03b8 = \u00b1 90\u00b0.

Some chronobiological investigations relevant to cholesterol\n", "abstract": " Most epidemiological studies inquiring about the relationship between cholesterol and cardiovascular disease risk and between dietary fat and cholesterol have relied on single determinations of cholesterol and other lipids, all undergoing important circadian (and other) rhythms. The circadian rhythm in cholesterol is partly endogenous, while also being influenced by meal timing. In experimental animals, all studies available for reviewpoint to maximal cholesterol synthesis during the dark (active) span. Human studies indicate that circulating cholesterol is low during the night, but times of maximum vary during the day in populations differing in terms of age and ethnicity/geographic location. Leptin, which may have a strong influence on fatty acid metabolism, was found to be elevated in cord blood in the presence of a family history of obesity on the father\u2019s side but not on the mother\u2019s side. This finding is of interest in view of leptin\u2019s central effects on appetite control. As demonstrated by Franz Halberg, appetite significantly influences body weight loss associated with a single daily meal consumed as breakfast-only, with little effect on body weight associated with dinner-only.

{"title": "Loop free multipath routing algorithm\n", "abstract": " Single path routing that is currently used in the internet routers,is easy to implement as it simplifies the routing tables and packet flow paths. However it is not optimal and has shortcomings in utilizing the network resources optimally, load balancing & fast recovery in case of faults (fault tolerance). The given algorithm resolves all these problems by using all possible multiple paths for transfer of information, while retaining loop-free property. We have proposed a new dynamic loop-free multipath routing algorithm which improves network throughput and network resource utilization, reduces average transmission delay, and is not affected by faults in the links and router nodes. The main idea of this algorithm is to maintain multiple possible next hops for a destination along with weights. At every node, the traffic to a destination is split among multiple next hops in proportion to the estimated weights. The number of multiple next hops also changes depending on the traffic conditions, but it is never less than one.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["451"]}

{"title": "Genetic structure of a segregating CSR10 x Taraori Basmati F3 population for salinity tolerance\n", "abstract": " Most of the cultivated rice varieties are susceptible to salinity but rice germplasm do have sources for salt tolerance trait (Flowers et al., 2000). Traditional breeding efforts made to introgress complex traits like salinity tolerance have met with limited success and only a few salt-tolerant varieties (~ 30 cultivars in 12 different plant species) have been developed and released for commercial cultivation. It has been even more difficult to introgress desirable traits into Basmati rice [aromatic, varietal Group V (Glaszmann, 1987)] due to the complex nature of Basmati rice grain quality traits and its poor combining ability with the other rice genotypes (Khush and dela Cruz, 1998). Application of molecular marker technology in linkage mapping and molecular dissection of the complex agronomical traits such as salinity can greatly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of breeding process. In this paper, we report the genetic and molecular structure of a F3 segregating population derived from a cross between CSR 10 X Taraori Basmati for salinity tolerance using Inter Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) markers.Crosses were made between CSR10 (semi-dwarf, salt-tolerant variety developed from cross between Damodar and Jaya) and Taraori Basmati (tall-stature, aromatic, salt-sensitive) and the hybrid nature of the F 1 plants was confirmed by morphological traits and SSR marker analysis (data not shown). A population of 272 F 2 plants was raised by single seed descent method of which 130 were used in the present study.

{"title": "In situ observation of optically and thermally induced charge depletion in chromophore-doped cyclic olefin copolymers\n", "abstract": " For a number of years, cyclic olefin copolymers (COC) have been known for their good charge-storing properties. Due to their high optical transparency, they are ideally suited to study the interaction of trapped space charges with light. Films of different COC grades were doped with various chromophores and studied using thermally stimulated discharge (TSD) and photostimulated discharge (PSD). The space charge profiles were determined in real time using the thermal pulse (TP) technique, where the low-transparency top electrode is heated with a short laser pulse. UV irradiation near 300 nm leads to an accelerated decay of the near-surface charge density, which can be explained if at least part of the space charges are released from traps with a depth of approx. 4 eV. In addition, the thermal diffusivity was determined from laser-induced temperature phase shifts.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["451"]}

{"title": "Breeding to assist control of gastrointestinal parasites of small ruminants in the Pacific Islands\n", "abstract": " Internal parasites are a major impediment to sheep and goat production in the Pacific Islands. Investigations were carried out in Fiji to determine whether host resistance was heritable for either goats or sheep. Faecal egg counts (FEe) were determined after natural infection in goats and under the conditions of this study, the trait was found to be neither heritable nor repeatable. There was no significant genetic variation detected in measures of blood haemoglobin content or packed cell volume during infection. Selectively eliminating Haemonchus contortus with closantel, leaving mainly Trichostrongylus colubriformis, did not appear to improve heritability of FEe. In contrast, FEe in sheep under these conditions was heritable (0.23\u00b10.07). There was, however, no evidence of genetic variation in eosinophilia during infection, nor was the trait correlated with FEe (-0.03). Breeding strategies involving twostage selection were investigated. One promising option involved a preliminary culling of animals based on their production, then two or three FEe measurements on those remaining.Over recent years, governments in Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Western Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu have encouraged an expansion of their sheep and goat populations in an attempt to increase domestic meat production (Banks et al. 1990). Efforts to intensify production, however, have been seriously impeded by losses due to gastrointestinal parasites, particularly Haemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis.

This aspect has not been adequately appreciated by resear chers and development workers. Ano ther significant contribution of the agroforestry systems is recycling of nutrients from lower soil horizons. The systems impart stability through production and reduce risk of total faiulre. Additional employment opportunities during the off-season are also best provided by the agro forestry systems. A very significant advantage of agroforestry systems is restoration of the required per cent area under perennial vegetative cover.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["451"]}
{"title": "SN curve vs fracture mechanics approach to fatigue analysis of steel jacket platforms\n", "abstract": " The fatigue life of a joint in an offshore structure can be estimated by either using the conventional S-N curves or the fracture mechanics approach. In this paper both procedures are applied to obtain fatigue life results for a steel jacket model subjected to random wave loading. The results are obtained using different S-N curves and a fracture mechanics approach. The effect of the choice of various S-N curves on the fatigue life estimate is found to be significant. The fracture mechanics approach is found to yield a much lower fatigue life as compared to the S-N curve approach.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["451"]}

The lowering of the relative volatility of isobutyraldehyde/ethyl ace-tate by DMF in their ternary mixture can be understood in terms of the chemical interaction between DMF and the aldehyde group. All models considered, except the van Laar model, predict the behavior of the isobutyraldehyde/ethyl acetate/DMF ternary mixture accurately with only binary information. The DMF-aldehyde group interaction in the isobutyraldehyde/DMF and DMF/benzaldehyde mixtures are significantly different as discussed above, and the UNIFAC group contribution model cannot describe both mixtures accurately with one set of DMF-aldehyde parameters.

We seek to fill this gap by proposing a measure called STRAP that allows comparison of different trajectory privacy mechanisms on a common scale.

For ANN development, daily discharge and suspended sediment concentration data of Subansiri River (an eastern Himalayan river) in India have been used. Rating curves have also been developed with similar data, and comparison of the two techniques has been carried out. It has been observed that the estimates of suspended sediment concentration obtained by ANNs compared to the rating curve technique were much closer to the observed values.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["451"]}

Most of the clinical features of neuroleptospirosis are due to capillary endothelial damage and vasculitis. Ataxia is an extremely uncommon manifestation of Leptospirosis occuring in <5% of cases. A 28\u00a0year old female from North India presented with a short febrile illness followed by an acute onset cerebellar ataxia, anemia, thrombocytopenia and transaminitis. Leptospira serology showed high titres of IgM (ELISA) and MAT (microscopic agglutination test titre >1:800) . She was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone for 14\u00a0days following which she showed marked recovery. The clinical features of neuroleptospirosis are varied, most of them resulting from endothelial damage and vasculitis. Immune mediated phenomenon with no structural damage is another possible mechanism leading to cerebellar ataxia. Cerebellar ataxia due to common tropical infections should be ruled out in the appropriate setting, as early institution of treatment can abate neurological morbidity. The case report highlights the importance of identifying a reversible cause of cerebellar ataixa due to a tropical infection, possibly due to a immune mediated phenomenon, and would be of interest to both internists and neurologists.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["451"]}

Surgery should be avoided as much as possible in unmarried and childless women where future reproductive functions are of prime concern. There are a few claims by homoeopathic physicians to have treated cases of ovarian cysts with homoeopathic medicines. Such claims, however, have neither been scientifically documented nor published. To give scientific support to such sporadic claims, a clinical study was carried out to evaluate the usefulness of homoeopathic medicines for treatment of patients suffering from ovarian cyst. Methods: A total of 73 patients suffering from ovarian cysts were enrolled, as per inclusion criteria out of which 48 completed the study according to protocol. Medicines selected on the basis of principles of homoeopathy were prescribed and changes in the size of ovarian cysts were assessed at the end of 1 year on the basis of pre and post treatment ultrasonography reports and hormonal tests. Results: After comparing pre and post treatment ultrasonography reports, the difference in mean values of maximum dimension of ovarian cyst was found to be statistically significant (p value < 0.05). Cyst was totally resolved in 8 (16.67%) patients, 10 (20.83%) patients had reduction in the size of the cysts, 21 (43.75%) patients remained status quo while 9 (18.75%) did not improve.

Adoption of zero tillage resulted in high crop yield (Nagrajan et al. 2002), lower production cost and saving in water and energy (Reifschneider 2007). It not only promotes input-use efficiency but also strengthens natural resource base (Hobbes et al. 1997, Laxmi and Mishra 2007). Of late, its importance has increased in the backdrop of continued threat to agriculture sustainability. For a long period, the wheat productivity has stagnated at a particular level (Mehla et al. 2000). Due to these reasons various organizations including international institutions are engaged in promoting this agricultural technology. The zero tillage is defined as planting crops in previously unprepared soil by opening narrow slots or trenches of the smallest width and depth needed for proper coverage of the seeds (Laxmi and Mishra 2007). Timely sowing can be ensured through the zero tillage. It has been observed that an average delay in sowing of wheat after first half of November resulted in productivity loss of 35 kg/ha/day in rice (Oryza sativa L.) wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend.

{"title": "Water mist-An emerging fire suppression system to control coal mine fire\n", "abstract": " Water mist\u2019 refers to fine water sprays in which 99% of the volume of the spray is in droplets with diameter less than 1000 \u03bcm. The paper deals with the use of \u2018water mist\u2019 as fire suppressant in coal mines. Water mist could have better suppressant in comparison with other existing fire suppressant like Halon 1211, halon 1301 as the latter have environmentally unsuitable, being ozone depletion properties. Water mist considerably reduces heat and subsequently temperature of fire as well as radiation attenuation, which resists the spreading of fire to virgin fuel. Higher latent heat of evaporation and specific heat of water mist make it better than other suppressant. Large scale model based study done by Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research (CIMFR), Dhanbad on water mist establishes its suitability to suppress coal mine fires. Water mist infusion has been proved to be safe and very effective technique for not only controlling open fire in underground mines but also reducing toxic gases, minimizing rollback and improving visibility in the fire affected areas. However further research should be carried out to determine the optimum water droplet size, air velocity, water droplet velocity according to fire size and category on field based study.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["451"]}

However the standard FAO Penman-Monteith approach for estimating ETc from reference evapotranspiration and tabulated generalized Kc values has some limitations. In this paper, we present a modified approach towards estimating Kc values from remotely sensed data. Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) model was used for estimating spatial distribution of ETc during 2005 growing season in south-central Nebraska. The alfalfa based reference evapotranspiration (ETr) was calculated using multi-automatic weather station data with geostatistical analysis. Based upon the mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination (r2), the ordinary Kriging method resulted as the best interpolation technique for determining the reference\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["451"]}
{"title": "Factors controlling groundwater recharge in the mountainous hard-rock Aravalli terrain\n", "abstract": " Recharge is one of the key hydrological parameters for assessment, budgeting, management, and modelling of groundwater resources. To have a measure of groundwater recharge, it is necessary to obtain precise information on the factors governing infiltration and loss from the groundwater system. The present study focused on the Aravalli terrain of India covering~ 25 000 km2 area in between N23\u00ba30\u2032\u2013N26\u00ba18\u2032 and E72\u00ba24\u2032\u2013E74\u00ba36\u2032. Evaluation of individual and combined influence of hydrogeological and non-geological parameters on groundwater recharge was set as the main objective, and linear multiple-regression was chosen as the technique. Groundwater recharge is manifested by seasonal fluctuations of groundwater level, and is used as the dependent variable in the regression analysis. Standardised partial regression coefficients have been used as a measure of factor-influence and as a tool for sensitivity analysis. With accumulation of temporal data, the mean value of water-table fluctuation varies, and with the variation of the responsive parameter, the partial regression-coefficients of the regressors also vary. Therefore, confidence intervals of regression coefficients have been used in the present study to check model uncertainty. The multipleregression established that frequency of \u201cdeficient rainfall\u201d ie amount of rainfall required to ensure normal aquifer-recharge (mean water-table rise) is the most important recharge-controlling parameter. Therefore, it has been interpreted that inadequacy of groundwater recharge is largely determined by the frequency of deficient-rainfall.

The set of plants with which an insect species is trophically associated is called its host-range. Thus, herbivorous insects and plants are united by intricate relationships. Insects cannot exist in the absence of green plants, which serve as the primary source of energy rich compounds for heterotrophic organisms. On the other hand, long standing exposure to animals has been a major cause in developing great diversity in the plant world. Insects, with their overwhelming variation in form and life history, may have been one of the forces in shaping the plant world. Probably no other interactions between two groups of organisms comparable in type and extent can be found elsewhere in the living world, thus rendering insect-plant interactions a unique and scientifically fruitful area of research (Schoonhoven et al., 1998). Obviously, insect-plant interactions are also of crucial importance in developing host plant resistance strategies for the management of insect pests of agricultural importance.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["451"]}

It is not just difficult to diagnose, even the severity of the disease is often underestimated. Early in the course of pancreatitis, pro-inflammatory agents can release more cytokines like TNF-a and IL-6 into the pancreatic tissue and serum, thereby amplifying the local and systemic inflammatory response. In the present study, 50 patients diagnosed on the basis of routine investigations, imaging techniques and history as having acute non-traumatic pancreatitis and falling between Ranson's criteria 2 and 6, were studied. They were divided into Groups I, II and III with Ranson's criteria of 3, 4 and 5 respectively. In addition to routine investigations, serum Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF-a) values were measured on the day of admission, after 48 hours and on the seventh day.

{"title": "Kramers problem for a dimer: Effect of noise correlations\n", "abstract": " The Kramers problem for a dimer in a bistable piecewise linear potential is studied in the presence of correlated noise processes. The effect of such a correlation is to redistribute the thermal power between the dynamical degrees of freedom, and this leads to significant deviations in the dynamics of the system from the case of independent noise processes. The distribution of first passage times from one minima to the basin of attraction of the other minima is found to have exponentially decaying tails with the parameter dependent on the amount of correlation and the coupling between the particles. The strong coupling limit of the problem is analyzed using adiabatic elimination, where it is found that the initial probability density relaxes towards a stationary value on the same time scale as the mean escape time when the noise intensity of the system is low.

{"title": "An ensemble modeling approach for estimating diffusive tortuosity for saturated soils from porosity\n", "abstract": " Apparent diffusion constants in soil are generally estimated by dividing molecular diffusion coefficient for a solute with soil tortuosity (\u03c4) values. Several models have been proposed to estimate \u03c4 from soil porosity (\u03d5) alone, but most of these models fail when the variability in observed \u03c4-\u03d5 pairs increases. Pedotransfer functions can be used to predict \u03c4 from easy-to-measure soil properties such soil texture, organic carbon contents, and \u03d5, but such an approach requires more measurements to be performed than just measuring \u03d5. Here, we show that \u03c4 may be estimated from \u03d5 alone using the ensemble averaging approach. We examined seven different analytical expressions for \u03c4-\u03d5 and seven different ensemble-modeling approaches to estimate \u03c4 for 100 pairs of \u03c4-\u03d5 collected from a wide geographical area. Modeling results showed that the Bayesian model averaging method was the best ensemble-modeling\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["451"]}

For coupling strong in comparison to the spread in frequencies, the system of oscillators synchronize and when coupling strength and spread in frequencies are large, a phenomenon similar to amplitude death is observed. The network evolution provides a mechanism to build inter-oscillator connections and once a dynamic equilibrium is achieved, oscillators evolve according to their local interactions. We also find that the steady state properties change by the presence of additional time scales. We demonstrate these results based on numerical calculations studying dynamical evolution of limit-cycle and van der Pol oscillators.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["451"]}

{"title": "Botanicals: The green pesticides\n", "abstract": " Indiscriminate use of pesticides has generated problems, like pest resistance, resurgence of pests, eco toxicity and elimination of natural enemies. These glitches attract the attention of scientific world to develop an ecofriendly and human safe alternative method of pest control. In this regard use of phytochemicals (botanicals), biopesticides and biocontrol agents (natural enemies) offer a good alternative to manage the different pests and diseases in an ecofriendly manner. Over the last four decades there many useful phytochemicals have been identified and isolated with specific and general application to pest control. Of the known about 4, 00,000 plant species only about 3,000 plant species have been screened to possess pesticidal potential. Till now more than 500 pesticidal compounds have been identified from various plant species and few have achieved the commercial status worldwide. Present day biopesticide market in the world includes pyrethrins, rotenone, nicotine, ryanodine, sabadilla and azadirachtins. During last few years\u2019 plant essential oils comprising mono and sesquiterpenoids are being developed as green pesticides. Some of these oils are well known insect toxins, repellents and deterrents. Currently, ecofriendly pest management strategies are being popular worldwide to enhance crop production while maintaining and contributing to agriculture sustainability.

Especially the below poverty line population lags far behind in terms of per capita edible oil consumption and therefore is a major reason for widespread malnutrition. Inadequate consumption of edible oils, which acts as vehicle (mainly promotes absorption in intestine) for important micronutrients like vitamin A, D, E and K, is the root cause behind this. Palm oil is an important source of carotenoids (pro-vitamin A), tocols (Vitamin E), sterols, essential fatty acid and is cost effective in comparison to other edible oils. Crude palm oil which is orange red in color is refined, bleached and deodorized to produce the universally known bright golden oil.

In this paper, we analyze the patterns and differentials of internal migration in Botswana using the 2011 census data. Both lifetime migrations and short-term migration have been analyzed. The study noted that the number of migrations has been increasing over the years. During the recent year, that is 2010-11, there were about 165 thousands in-migrations and 149 thousands out-migrations including international migrations. Among the international migrations, it was observed that, an emigration of 1203 persons and immigration of 17375 persons during 2010-11. The major destinations for immigration are Gaborone and Kweneng East. Among the immigrations, more than 50% of them were from Zimbabwe. As regards the migrations differentials, the propensity to migrate is almost same for both males and females. This is in contrast to most developing countries. The propensity to migrate is greater among adults (15-34 age), never married or living together, Christians, employed or unemployed and among students. To conclude, the flow of movements among the populations is likely to increase in the future; an appropriate policy needs to be developed to meet the demand from these migrations such as housing, water, sanitation and other infrastructural facilities.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["451"]}

{"title": "Simultaneous observation of VLF and VHF wave in the presence of ionospheric irregularities\n", "abstract": " The propagation of electromagnetic waves through the ionosphere in the presence of irregularities is differently affected in different frequency ranges. Very high frequency waves are scattered whereas very low frequency waves are guided through the ducts formed by the irregularities under suitable conditions. To study these effects, we have analyzed VLF and VHF waves recorded at Varanasi during the period January 1991 to December 1999. VLF waves from natural lightning discharges and VHF amplitude scintillations of signals at 250 MHz transmitted from FLEETSAT geostationary satellites have been used. The occurrence rate of VLF waves is low and sporadic and they are generally observed during nighttimes. The VHF scintillations at Varanasi are also generally observed during nighttimes. The whistler waves generally propagated along the magnetic field lines, which is dipolar and lies in the ionosphere for the Varanasi station. A correlation study of these two simultaneously recorded signals has been carried out. The recorded events of VLF whistlers/emissions and VHF scintillations are largely uncorrelated. However, there are a number of days when these two events are simultaneously observed. Analysis of these correlated events show that at time and under certain suitable conditions, the ionospheric irregularities may help VLF wave propagation and also cause scattering of VHF signals resulting into either weak or strong scintillations.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["451"]}

Host size had a greater effect on the reproductive success of several aphid parasitoid. In case of Upo/exis scutellaris Mackauer (very little known parasitoid) to deposit fertilised (diploid) eggs in large hosts (third instar nymph) and unfertilised(haploid) egg in small host (first and second instar nymphs). Unpreferred fourth instar nymphs and apterous aphid adults also received more haploid eggs despite being larger in size than the preferred third instar nymphs. However, the perception of host size by the mother was dependent of the extent of temporal variation in the host size distribution and on her previous experience of host size. Developmental period, longevity, mating potential, fecundity and progeny sex ratio of L. scutetletis emerging from small versus large hosts indicated that the host size affected the fitness of the daughters more than that of sons. The present study could not provide any evidence of differential mortality of either sex of L. scutellaris in small versus large hosts.

Two-phase materials have been assumed to contain cylindrical particles arranged in a regular three-dimensional cubic geometry. The arrangement has been divided into unit cells, each of which contains a cylinder. The resistor model has been applied to determine the effective thermal conductivity (ETC) of the unit cell. A porosity correction term F is introduced in order to incorporate varying individual geometries and non-linear flow of heat flux lines generated by the difference in thermal conductivities of constituent phases. Theoretical calculations of the ETC have been carried out on a large number of samples and comparisons have been made with other models and experimental values cited in the literature. The values predicted by the proposed model are in close agreement with experimental values and more accurate than those obtained from existing models.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["451"]}

Recently, efforts have been made to predict the prospects of developing superior genotype (s) from a cross by measuring genetic similarity (GS) or genetic distance (GD) between parents (Burkhamer et al., 1998; Bohn et al., 1999). Many diversity studies have been undertaken in the past using morpho-physiological and agronomic traits, but with little success, because of the limited number of traits, influence of environment and genotype x environment interaction. On the other hand, molecular markers offer a distinct advantage due to their unlimited number and independent of environmental effect. The microsatellites or Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) are abundant, ubiquitous and hypervariable in nature. They have high Polymorphic Information Content (PIC)(Gupta et al., 1996). These positive aspects of SSRs have attracted the attention of several workers to utilize them across crop species for studying genetic variability based on DNA polymorphism. It has been shown that even limited number of SSRs is adequate to discriminate the most closely related genotypes (Plaschke et al., 1995; Russell et al., 1997; Struss and Plieske, 1998).

The dynamics of the new phase transition have been explained in terms of splitting of the non-planar mode at 975cm-1 owing to strong intermolecular interaction due to close molecular packing in the low temperature phase. The spectral anomaly of the 975cm-1 band, in terms of variation of relative intensity with respect to temperature, also shows the hysterisis linked with the process of stable-metastable-stable modification in TB10A.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["451"]}

No significant correlation between the two kinds of variation was found, although the present data set is small and probably not sensitive for tests of association. Various hypotheses of association between the two types of variation are discussed and it is shown that any association between gene-structure and gene-regulation variation (positive or negative) would be sensitive to distortion by repeated bottlenecks and genetic drift. Furthermore, random forces would affect gene-structure (allozyme) variation, which is often controlled by one gene, more severely than enzyme activity variation, which is usually controlled by many genes. Measurements of activity variation would appear to provide an evolutionarily\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["451"]}

Tool marks are produced on a softer surface by a tool of harder material, while commissioning a crime. The tool is not damaged in the process of cutting or scratching the surface of the material to any appreciable extent. The marks on the surface are reproducible. Thus, a criminal can be linked to a crime through the examination of the tool recovered from the criminal and the tool marks collected from the scene. Although the marks of fairly large size (over a few microns) can be seen under an optical microscope with an optimal magnification of 2000X, the marks of smaller dimensions (below one micrometer) can not be revealed.

The green revolution as visible in the different parts of the country has generated a confidence for the attainment of self-sufficiency on food front in the very near future, but its impact has been more or less confined to the irrigated areas. A large chunk of area which is rainfed has yet to see such a transformation through develop-ment of dry land technology which is in the offing. In these areas inadequency and uncertainty of rainfall of crops are resulting in famine or near famine condition. The answer to the problem partially lies in evolving suitable farming practices including soil and crop manage-ment and conservation of moisture and to a greater extent in allocation of scarce resources in between different competing ends to obtain maximum benefits of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["451"]}

These errors occur in the FDA because it requires the knowledge of the time history of the loading at the beginning of the computations and therefore treats the structural velocity effects in an approximate way through velocity-proportional hydrodynamic damping forces and considers these forces and the added mass forces upto the still water level (SWL) neglecting the fluctuation of the water level with the passage of waves.

{"title": "Rediscovering Tapovan Basmati\n", "abstract": " In 1999, when we interacted with the farmers of village Seola-Majra, Dehradun, Uttaranchal, India, which is the home of the famous Dehradun Basmati, few farmers told us to go to the village Tapovan to look for best quality Basmati. Tapovan (district Tehri, Uttaranchal) is a small village, located on the slope of the hilly ridge between 700 and 1000 m altitude, just above the Lakshman Jhoola in Rishikesh, Uttaranchal. Agricultural lands of the village are on slopes as terraces. Farmers grow a reddish-brown husk Basmati called Tapovan Basmati on these terraces. This variety is confined to the village Tapovan.Shopkeepers at Rishikesh and Tapovan and farmers at Tapovan tell rosy stories about taste and aroma of this variety (Singh et al., 2000). However, recently its cultivation has declined and according to farmers, it is left with little scent and taste. While visiting the field it was found that the variety had become an admixture. Villagers told that earlier as per decree of King of Tehri, only Tapovan Basmati was cultivated in the entire village for consumption by the royal family. Later ownership of land was shifted to Mahant (Head Priest) of Bharat Mandir at Rishikesh. Then entire Basmati rice of the village was used for bhog (offering) at the temple. When poor farmers of the village became owners of these lands their financial problems forced them to shift from single to multiple cropping system resulting in decline in fertility of land. In absence of any seed production program farmers are using their own seed since ages which has resulted in seed admixtures leading to decline in grain quality, yield, and area under cultivation of Tapovan Basmati.

Friction affects local displacement field in the tool-workpiece interface region, thus affecting the overall material flow. Under high-temperature compression, macro-indicators like bulge radius and load displacement curves are not sensitive enough to distinguish subtle differences between various friction models. Hence, a new approach to match the experimental Lagrangian flow field with flow field obtained from FE simulation is proposed. For this uniaxial barreling, compression tests at constant temperature were conducted on Gleeble thermo-mechanical simulator. The compression tests were conducted at different strain, strain rate and friction conditions.

The identification, production and consumption of functional foods worldwide can increase health benefits for all who can access and afford such foods subject to advice from nutritionists. Recent meetings organized by the health agencies, give a crucial opportunity to make nutrition, a central part of the post-2015 sustainable human and agricultural development agenda. The aim of discussions in these meetings was to provide functional crops and foods to achieve optimal health by prevention of NCDs. It is possible that these efforts might ensure that the goals and targets set in the agenda are adequate to address the many challenges of global undernutrition as well as obesity which are major risk factors of NCDs. In many developing and middle income countries, food security provided by the governments, in one sense understandably, gave least consideration to functional foods supply and the prevention of obesity and metabolic syndrome, resulting in to emergence of NCDs. The Thailand Declaration reiterates that commitments to eradicate hunger and undernutrition as well as over-nutrition, and to increase investments in effective interventions; designers foods and designers crops.

{"title": "An introduction to UV-B research in plant science 1\n", "abstract": " About 3.8\u00d7 109years ago, during the early evolutionary phase, the young earth was receiving a very high amount of UV radiation and it is estimated that, at that time, the sun was behaving like young T\u2010Tauristars and was emitting 10,000 times greater UV than today (Canuto et al., 1982). Then, the radiance of the sun became lower than it is in the present day, thereby resulting in temperatures below freezing. On the other hand, due to high atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) level, which was 100\u20131000 times greater than that of present values, liquid water did occur and absorbed infrared (IR) radiation, and this shaped an obvious greenhouse effect (Canuto et al., 1982). Due to the photosynthesis of photosynthetic bacteria, cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae, oxygen (O2) was released for the first time into the environment, which led to an increase of atmospheric O2 and a simultaneous decrease of atmospheric CO2. About 2.7\u00d7 109years ago, due to the absence of oxygenic photosynthesis, oxygen was absent from the atmosphere. About 2.7\u00d7 109years ago, with the deposition of iron oxide (Fe2O3) in Red Beds, aerobic terrestrial weathering occurred and, at that time, O2 was approximately about 0.001% of the present level (Rozema et al., 1997). In proportion with gradual atmospheric O2 increase, the accumulation of stratospheric ozone might have been slow. Alternatively, about 3.5\u00d7 108years ago, due to a sheer rise in atmospheric oxygen, it might have reached close to the present levels of 21%(Kubitzki, 1987; Stafford, 1991).

{"title": "Ultraviolet Radiation Targets in the Cellular System: Current Status and Future Directions\n", "abstract": " The sun is the major source of energy to photosynthetic organisms. The energy reaching the earth\u2019s surface is in the form of radiation. There are basically two quantities characterising radiation, frequency (f) and wavelength (\u03bb; lambda) which are defined by the relation: f c/where c is the velocity of light (3\u00d7 108ms\u20131). The energy of a single photon is determined by the wavelength (\u03bb) of the photon, as described by the relation: photonenergy hf hc/where h= 1.24 eV nm. However, apart from constituting an important requisite for life on earth, organisms are inevitably exposed to UV radiation originating from the sun. The global UV (total solar UV reaching the earth) is divided into two components: direct and diffuse. The spectral and amount of solar UV irradiance depends on several factors, such as wavelength of UV, solar angle, source spectrum, ozone thickness, absorption and scattering by molecule, and altitude above sea level.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["451"]}

This proposed length biased exponential class model is a function of parameters namely; total number of failures \u03b8 and scale parameter \u03b8. It is assumed that very little or no information is available about both these parameters. The Bayes estimators for parameters \u03b8 and \u03b8 have been obtained using non-informative priors for each parameter under square error loss function. The Monte Carlo simulation technique is used to study the performance of proposed Bayes estimators against their corresponding maximum likelihood estimators on the basis of risk efficiencies.

These remnants RNAs may perhaps serve as a potential \u201cmarkers\u201d of spermatogenesis by virtue of their involvement, directly or indirectly, in the process of fertilization, early embryonic cleavage, and fertility. Gene expression profiling of mammalian sperm is a novel non-invasive tool to evaluate male fertility. RNA isolation from sperm is little tricky in contrast to RNA isolation from testis, and required stringent RNA quality control. The present study demonstrates a comprehensive RNA isolation protocol from crossbred Frieswal (HF X Sahiwal) bull semen, with stringent quality/purity checking, critically required for studying differential abundance of sperm transcripts. Initially, semen samples were subjected to discontinuous (45: 90) Percoll gradient centrifugation, explicitly eliminating damaged spermatozoa and contaminating somatic cells. Total RNA was extracted from sperm pellets using heated Tri reagent and an on-column DNase treatment was carried out. The cDNA was synthesized using RT-PCR. The cDNA samples were then ampli ied by PCR using speci ic intron spanning primers to rule out contamination, if any, within isolated sperm RNA by g-DNA (PRM1 and DAZL), testicular germ cells like spermatocytes (KIT), epithelial cells (E-cadherin-CDH1) and leucocyte (CD4 and CD45).

{"title": "Evaluation of zinc polyphosphate as an alternative source of zinc fertilizer for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crop cultivated in a Vertisols of central India\n", "abstract": " Soils in different bio-climatic zones of world including India suffer from zinc (Zn) deficiency (Katyal and Vlek 1985; Singh 2001; Shukla et al. 2014). Zinc deficiency is more frequently encountered in soil types like calcareous soils, sandy soils, and strongly weathered deep tropical soils, salt affected soils, Vertisols and poorly drained/waterlogged soils. Low solubility of Zn in soils and/or low total amount of Zn is the prime reason for Zn deficiency in crop plants grown across the world. Deficiency of Zn in soil results in serious yield and quality loss of different crops (Alloway 2008) and is normally ameliorated by application of Zn fertilizers. In majority of cases, application of 4.5 to 34 kg ZnSO4 ha-1 is recommended for correcting Zn deficiency in different crops (Martens and Westermann 1991). In India, soil application of Zn in the range of 2.5 to 22 kg Zn ha-1 is recommended for different crops/cropping systems and soil\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["451"]}

{"title": "Multiple complex extreme learning machine using holomorphic mapping for prediction of wind power generation system\n", "abstract": " In this paper, a wind prediction system for the wind power generation using ensemble of multiple complex extreme learning machines (C-ELM) is proposed. The extreme learning machines is a single layer feed forward neural network having a fast learning and better generalization ability than the gradient-based learning methods. C-ELM is chosen as base classifier because it is very suitable for processing of non-linear data. For using the wind data in complex domain the wind speed and direction are represented as a complex number. This paper uses the elegant theory of conformal mapping to find better transformations in the complex domain for enhancing its prediction capability. Finally, to improve the generalization ability of the prediction system and to reduce the error encountered in single model predictors, an ensemble of multiple C-ELMS is used. The individual CELM model in the ensemble has different activation functions of the hidden layer neuron. Performance analysis proves that the predictions generated through our method are effective when compared to other complex valued neural network prediction systems.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["451"]}

In the present work, the fuzzy membership functions for some of the attributes regarding air pollution from motor vehicle are proposed. To study the index of air pollution in different area of a city, the air pollution index is proposed, which takes into account the membership function for the attributes of pollution. By applying a suitable interpolation formula (in our case Lagrange\u2019s interpolation formula) a polynomial curve is obtained, which gives the measure of air pollution at any point of the city under certain assumptions.

{"title": "A sediment graph model based on SCS-CN method\n", "abstract": " Sediment is fragmented material primarily formed by the physical and chemical disintegration of rocks from the earth's crust. For example, physical disintegration means where the material is broken down by human interference or can be due to the construction or engineering works. Similarly chemical disintegration is by chemicals in fluids, wind, water or ice and/or by the force of gravity acting on the particle itself. The estimation of sediment yield is needed for studies of reservoir sedimentation, river morphology and soil and water conservation planning. However, sediment yield estimate of a watershed is difficult as it results due to a complex interaction between topographical, geological and soil characteristics. In spite of extensive studies on the erosion process and sediment transport modelling, there exists a lack of universally accepted sediment yield formulae (Bhunya et al. 2010). The conditions that will transport sediment are needed for engineering problems, for example, during canal construction, channel maintenance etc. Interpreting ancient sediments; most sediments are laid down under processes associated with flowing water like rivers, ocean currents and tides.Usually, the transport of particles by rolling, sliding and saltating is called bed-load transport, while the suspended particles are transported as suspended load transport.

Rats were administered L-methionine (1.7 g/kg/day, po) for 4 weeks to produce hyperhomocysteinemia. Isolated Langendorff's perfused normal and hyperhomocysteinemic rat hearts were subjected to global ischemia for 30 min followed by reperfusion for 120 min. Myocardial infarct size was assessed macroscopically using triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Coronary effluent was analyzed for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) release to assess the degree of myocardial injury. Moreover, the oxidative stress in heart was assessed by measuring lipid peroxidation and superoxide anion generation. The ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) was noted to produce myocardial injury in normal and hyperhomocysteinemic rat hearts as assessed in terms of increase in myocardial infarct size, LDH and CK in coronary effluent and oxidative stress. Hyperhomocysteinemic rat hearts showed enhanced I/R-induced myocardial injury with high degree of oxidative stress as compared with normal rat hearts. Six episodes of postconditioning (10 sec each) afforded cardioprotection against I/R-induced myocardial injury in normal rat hearts but postconditioning-mediated myocardial protection against I/R-injury was abolished in hyperhomocysteinemic rat hearts. Treatment with Tyrphostin AG 490 (5 \u00b5M) did not affect the cardioprotective effect of postconditioning in normal rat hearts; but its treatment\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["451"]}

{"title": "QTL mapping in crop plants: principle and methodology.\n", "abstract": " Some of the most difficult tasks of plant breeders relate to the improvement of traits that show a continuous range of values ie quantitative traits. The environmental variance resulting from differences in growing conditions further obscures the relation between phenotype and genotype. In practice, this problem is typically dealt with by evaluating large, replicated trials, which allow identification of genotypic differences through statistical analysis. Plant breeders would like to get a better grip on quantitative traits by direct selection for the genetic factors that are responsible for the observed variability in quantitative traits. This can be achieved through indirect selection: selection for other, well recognizable factors that are linked to the target genes. Since the development of molecular biology, the potential of molecular breeding contributing significantly to crop improvement has been controversial. With the identification of first QTL in 1980s, the ability of molecular markers to streamline the selection of complex traits has been oversold because scientist have largely underestimated the impact of gene networks and their interaction on plant phenotype. Some of these limitations have now been overcome, due to the development of more sophisticated statistical approaches, which allow categorizing both QTL and QTL by environment interaction (QEI), as well as the contributions made by plant models. Today, the use of markers to track transgenes or stack favorable alleles determining a significant proportion of the phenotypic variance is routine for many crops. QTL, functional genomic, and association studies are complementary approaches, which can\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["451"]}

Consequently, engineering genes that protect and maintain the function and structure of cellular components can enhance tolerance to stress. Success in improving drought tolerance will largely be dependent on the accuracy of plant phenotyping and the capacity to determine the GxE interactions. These are the two major components that affect the prediction of the allelic value on the plant phenotype in new populations. For complex traits like drought, selections based on markers alone is not highly effective. There is need to implement strategies based on integration of phenotypic selection along with marker assisted selection. No quick-fix is available, but pathways do exists. Combining genetic mapping with association studies has great potential in molecular breeding for drought tolerance in crop plants. Our limited knowledge of stress-associated metabolism remains a major gap in our understanding; therefore, comprehensive profiling of stress-associated metabolites is most relevant to the successful molecular breeding of stress-tolerant crop plants. Unraveling additional stress-associated gene resources, from both crop plants and highly tolerant model plants, will enable future molecular dissection of stress tolerance mechanisms in important crop plants.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["451"]}

The isolates of 2CPS1, D4h1, JB1, BRB2, JR2, BHJ13, and D3I showed promising insecticidal activity. Even after 24 hour of treatment the larvae exposed to some of these isolates stopped feeding and were in moribund condition. A maximum of 86.67% mortality was observed after 96h of exposure to 2CPS1 strain isolate and differed significantly from rest of the isolates. The degree of toxicity was varied among different isolates at different hours of exposure, maximum being recorded with 2CPS1, BHJ13, and D3I isolates. Biochemical assay attributing to insecticidal activity showed a significant positive result with protease and HCN production test. On the other hand, a negative result with chitinase and cellulose production test was observed indicating phytological safety. Thus, the presence of protease and HCN production in the metabolites of P. fluorescens strains could be correlated with larval mortality of H. armigera and provide an opportunity to explore as alternative effective biocontrol agent of insect pests.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["451"]}
{"title": "Permutation Polynomials and Their Applications in Cryptography\n", "abstract": " A polynomial over a finite ring R is called a permutation polynomial of R if it induces a bijection from R to R. Permutation polynomials over finite rings have several applications in combinatorics, coding theory and cryptography. For example, the RC6 block cipher uses the permutation polynomial x + 2x2 over the finite ring Z2n, where 2n is the word size of machine. In 2001, Rivest found an exact characterization of permutation polynomials over finite rings Z2n. However, using Rivest's technique it was di\u00b1cult to characterize permutation polynomials over finite rings Zm, for m = 3n; 5n. In this thesis, we present some methods to characterize all permutation polynomials over finite rings Zm for m = 2n; 3n; 5n. In addition, we produce a new class of permutation binomials over the finite fields Zp. Moreover, we show that every polynomial over finite ring Zpn can be expressed as a triangular map over Zn p . Using this representation, we obtain su\u00b1cient conditions for a polynomial over Zpn to be a permutation polynomial, for any prime p. Next, we consider permutation polynomials over finite fields. Permutation polynomials over finite fields have been the subject of study for many years. There is a considerable interest in finding new classes of permutation polynomifials over finite fields. However, only a handful of specific classes of permutation polynomials are known so far and very few of the known classes have permutation polynomials commuting with one another. We find certain new classes of permutation polynomials over finite fields. Some of these classes are commutative.

{"title": "37-Melt-Runoff Delaying Characteristics of Gangotri Glacier.\n", "abstract": " Most of the Himalayan basins have considerable snow and glacier covered areas. The melt contribution in such rivers augments their flows in the lean season, thereby reducing the variation in water availability. Depending upon the prevailing climatic conditions, the runoff contribution from the glaciers in the Himalayan rivers starts in May after depletion of accumulated seasonal snow. Usually melt contribution from these glaciers continues till October. The melt water generated in the glacierized basin appears as runoff at the snout of glacier with a time-lag. Changes in delaying characteristics of the runoff over the melt season can be understood by studying the variation in time to peak (tn) and time-lag (t1) between melt generation and its emergence as runoff. In the recent study, the runoff delaying characteristics of the Gangotri Glacier in the Garhwal Himalayas (glacierized area 286 km2; drainage area 556 km2) have been studied. For this purpose, hourly discharge and temperature data were collected near the snout of the glacier (approx 4000 m) for the entire ablation period (May\u2014October, 2004). The diurnal variations in the hydrograph and temperature observed under clear weather provided useful information for this study. In the early stages of the ablation period, poor drainage network and stronger storage characteristics of the glaciers due to the presence of seasonal snow cover resulted in a much delayed response of melt water, providing a higher t, and ti,. A comparison of runoff delaying parameters with discharge ratio clearly indicated that changes in time-lag and time to peak are inversely correlated with variations in discharge.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["451"]}

This model consists of two parameters namely, the total number of failures and the failure rate. Considering the behaviour of the parameter, total number of failure and limitation of Poisson distribution, a generalized Poisson distribution has been proposed as a prior for this parameter. Further, an inverted Gamma prior has been selected for failure rate in view of its property. The Bayes estimators have been obtained considering these priors under Squared Error Loss Function. To study the performance of obtained estimators, these estimators have been compared with corresponding maximum likelihood estimators on the basis of a Monte Carlo simulation study.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["451"]}

{"title": "Impact of Fly Ash-Soil Amendment on Vegetable Production\n", "abstract": " The present paper discusses the prospects of utilization of fly ash in agriculture sector to get enhanced yields of vegetable crops in the degraded soils.   The physico-chemical properties, such as pH, EC, porosity, bulk density (BD), water holding capacity (WHC), cation exchange capacity (CEC), dehyrogenase activity and texture of the soil, after mixing with fly ash were found to improve the soil properties greatly, making the amended soil richer in essential nutrient elements and more fertile.   Amendment of fly ash enhances the growth performance of selected vegetable viz, carrot (Daucus carota- family Umbelliferae)  and radish (Raphanus sativus \u2013 family Cruciferae).  The pot experiments were carried out with mixed soil, fly ash does being 5%, 10% and 20% by weight, in addition to the usual application of recommended dose of NPK fertilizer.  The vegetables grown in fly ash amended soil have also shown higher yield compared to non-amended soil.  The fly ash-soil amendment technology will thus go a long way in greatly enhancing and improving the agricultural production and economy of the state.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["451"]}

Here we show that CXCR5 is functionally expressed by prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP and PC3). Correspondingly, the ligand for CXCR5, CXCL13, was secreted by bone marrow (endothelial, osteoblast, and osteoclast) cells due to the host response following prostatic neoplasia and is elevated in patients with prostate cancer, compared to those with PIN or hyperplasia. Both LNCaP and PC3 cell lines express higher levels of CXCR5 than normal prostatic epithelial cells (PrEC). After CXCL13-engagement, prostate cancer cells displayed a higher migration and invasive potential in vitro, which was significantly reduced by CXCR5 blockade. CXCL13 also increased collagenases (MMP-1 and -13), stromelysins (MMP-3 and -10), and gelatinases (MMP-2 and -9) expression by both LNCaP and PC3 cell lines.

Though, growth of urban areas is higher in comparison to the rural areas, integrated development of rural areas is required to achieve the sustainable development at regional level. Development of physical infrastructure at village level is prerequisite for the overall development of the region as well as nation. In the light of this, main aim of the study is to derive the indicators to find the status of physical infrastructure ie water supply, sanitation, electricity, telephone and their interrelation with different social classes at village level. Detailed study has been carried out for Baraichpur village, Ladwa block of Kurushestra district in Haryana state, India. For this purpose, IKONOS panchromatic and multispectral merged imagery of February 2005 has been used for the preparation of large scale (1: 2000) base map. Analysis shows that this village is well served through electricity and transportation network. Public tap and hand-pump are main source of the drinking water supply. But status of sanitation is very poor as just 28% households have sanitation facility inside the house. Information at village level needs to be available widely for the planning and decision-making at different stages and thus, it has been integrated through web enabled information system.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["451"]}

Isolates of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici with virulence to Sr31 were identified from Uganda in 1999. Similar virulence was observed in Kenya in 2003 and 2004. An isolate collected from Uganda in 1999 and an isolate collected from Kenya in 2004, identified as race TTKS, were used to evaluate US and CIMMYT wheat. Cultivars and advanced breeding lines (450) in various wheat classes from US and 152 bread-wheat cultivars from CIMMYT, Mexico, were tested for resistance to these two stem rust isolates. Resistance to race TTKS was detected in all classes of wheat with the following frequencies: 16% of US hard red spring wheat, 48% of the US hard red winter wheat, 27% of US soft red winter wheat, 50% of durum wheat, and 16% of CIMMYT spring bread wheat. Resistance in the hard red winter wheat was primarily due to Sr24, and resistance in the soft red winter wheat was primarily due to Sr36. Resistance to race TTKS due to SrTmp was present but in a low frequency. Genes conferring resistance in the spring wheat are not known, but Sr24 may be present in some lines. The adult plant resistance of some selected wheat cultivars will be assessed in the field in Kenya.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["451"]}

{"title": "Model study on dynamics of open fire in Underground coal mines under varied air flow\n", "abstract": " A small scale model representing mine gallery has been designed constructed and installed at Central Mining Research Institute, Dhanbad, India. The basic purpose of the model gallery was to study the complex phenomenon of open fires in simulated underground mine condition.   The model is 19 m long having two segments. The first one is 10m long insulated rectangular segment having cross section of 45 cm x 57 cm. Insulation lining of fire bricks leaves space of 13 cm x 13 cm for air flow through the model. The second segment is 9m long 30 m diameter, circular section having a centrifugal exhaust fan installed at its end.   Two sets of experiments were carried out in the model at air velocities 1.0 m/s and 1.5 m/s using coal blocks of 5 cm thickness lined in all four inner sides of the model. The coal lining was made for a length of 3 m starting from 1 m of the model entry. After establishing the desired air flow inside the model, fire was initiated artificially at the beginning of the coal zone. Governing parameters such as gas concentration, temperature, pressure drop across fire zone, air velocity and dust concentration inside the model were continuously monitored for about 8 to 9 hours.

Expression for temporal damping, spatial damping and the time development of wave amplitude is derived from the modified theory of cyclotron damping of ion-cyclotron whistler wave including thermal effect. It is shown that the temporal damping is dominant for wave frequencies closer to the ion gyrofrequencies. The variations in plasma conditions cause variation in sudden commencement of cyclotron damping, which occurs after finite time of propagation of ion whistlers. The results have been used to explain the sudden cut-off of the amplitude of ion whistler wave observed by rockets and satellites in the terrestrial ionosphere. It is shown that the present study can be used to estimate ion temperature of the plasma.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["451"]}

Limited response repertoire of single celled organisms has been amply demonstrated (Cominglvon Burg, 1972). Behavioral repertoire (a set of discrete responses an organism is capable of emmitting) increases parallel to cellular growth in a post zygotic organism and undergoes various fonns of changes throughout life. Nature-nurture controversy has also plagued the field of behavioral ontogeny. The basic genetic individuality can be assumed to be at the starting point of development (except pure lines and identical twins).

The usar land is characterised by high pH and presence of indurated clay and hard gravels (kankar pan) in the soil at various depths. The physical and chemical properties of soil of usar land are highly deteriorated and it has excess of soluble salts and/or high exchangeable sodium percentage with poor fertility. Therefore, it is considered as unsuitable for adopting agri-cultural as well as fish culture practices. The main problems for adopting fish culture practice in this land are construction of ponds, seepage in pond and adverse conditions of soil which make pond water unfavourable for the survival and growth of the fishes. The unfavourable water characters are like high pH, high turbidity and low dissolved oxygen. All these adverse characters of pond water render the usar ponds unhospitable for survival and growth of the stocked fishes satisfactorily. Sincere efforts have been made by many workers, namely, Abrol et al.(1973), Dhankar and Abrol (1980), Dhar and Mukherji (1936), Gaul and", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["451"]}

{"title": "Philosophy of defence in plants\n", "abstract": " Plants are constantly exposed to millions of micro-organisms and many of these microbes possess the faculty to attack plants. However, in nature disease is more an exception than a rule. Most of the microbes surrounding the plant are saprophytic, incapable of attacking a healthy plant. Only a few are pathogenic, but each one of these can only attack specific plant species. Furthermore, all the individuals of a host species are not equally susceptible to a given pathogen isolate. How are most of the microbes in contact with the plant surface rendered harmless? How does a plant defend itself against non-pathogens (pathogens of other species) and pathogens? In humans and higher animals, there is a central defence system which protects the entire body against any microbial or viral attack. The role of a localized defence system is very limited. Plants, by virtue of their peculiar morphology, anatomy and physiology, have evolved their defence systems on entirely different lines from animals. Quite often we have tended to draw analogies between the two defence systems, for example phytoalexins were once considered to be a functional analogue of the immune system in animals and, recently, there has been a lot of enthusiasm about finding similarities between b proteins in plants with animal interferons (see Chapter 7). A critical analysis of defence mechanisms in plants and animals in the light of their requirements reveals that the very basic philosophy of defence in plants is altogether different from that in animals. Unlike animals, plants cannot move; they cannot side step or run away from an attacking pathogen. They are bound to stand, wait and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["451"]}

The complete standardization of such rhythms of subjects during a normal 24-h routine of sleeping, eating, working, activity, and so on is of great importance. Such references provide standards for different components of the circadian system, which are needed to compare such rhythms in health and disease. The existing knowledge on the circadian rhythm of plasma calcium does not show a consistent pattern.

{"title": "Initial dyadic social behavior in free-ranging rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta)\n", "abstract": " Initial dyadic social interactions of 13 rhesus monkeys were observed in a free-ranging group of 26 members. Each subject was observed for 900 intervals of 20 sec each by focal animal method. The obtained matrix of approach interactions was separately analyzed in relation to sex and dominance level of interacting animals. Dominance ranks were determined by approach-withdrawal scores and its validity was assessed with other submissive scores. Chi-square analysis revealed a significant preference for opposite sexed animals. High ranked animals initiated more social interactions than was expected; however, other animals approached less towards them. It is concluded that in free-ranging group situations, members do not interact at random, rather their interactions are patterned by individual characteristics, such as age, sex and relative dominance level in the group hierarchy.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["451"]}

The hypertriploid differed in morphology from its maternal trisomic-sibs, but showed comparable morphology with those of triploids. The microsporocytes showed a mean chromosome associations of 2.34 (I)+ 2.96 (II)+ 4.43 (III)+ 0.1 (IV) at metaphase I with a mean chiasmata number of 13, 40 per cell. The twenty types of observed chromosome configurations could be explained by assuming that plant was trisomic for six chromosomes and tetrasomic for one chromosome. Four chromosome associations such as 5 (II)+ 4 (III), 1+ 6 (II)+ 3 (III), 2 (I)+ 7 (II)+ 2 (III) and 8 (II)+ 2 (III) suggested the presence of displaced duplications or small interchange within the genome of pearl millet. The tetrasomic chromosome formed mostly a quadrivalent which often broke down to form 2 (II) or 1 (I)+ 1 (III) and rarely 2 (I)+ 1 (II) or 4 univalents. Most of the univalents arose from the trisomic chromosomes. Abnormal distribution of chromosomes at AI resulted in the formation of diads and tetrads with unequal chromosome numbers. The plant was highly sterile but set some seeds upon open pollination.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["451"]}

A nonlinear Schrodinger equation governing the finite amplitude wave has been derived. It has been found that the nature of axisymmetric potential is completely changed due to the presence of the magnetic field. The values of omega and k for the marginal instability increase with the increasing magnetic field. The range of the wave numbers for the instability of higher harmonics decrease due to the magnetic field. All the disturbances grow up until overtaking occurs, the growth rate being enhanced by nonlinear effects.

The varieties had considerable variation in their profiles. Some variety-specific bands were found. Bands 19 and 20, present in almost all the susceptible varieties and their F\u0131s, were suggested as codominant alleles of the single locus. Results indicated recessive gene control for resistance to powdery mildew. In general, more similarity was observed between the varieties of same height group and more genetic diversity between varieties of two different height groups. Presence of more number of bands in F1s, as compared to their respective parents, provides a basis for the greater biochemical diversity of the hybrids over pure lines. Two crosses showed partial dominance whereas two showed over dominance for the number of protein bands.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["451"]}

To study the cropping pattern of the farms of different sizes. 2. To work out the economies of different crop rotations on different size groups of farms. 3. To study the influence of the cropping pattern on net income of farms of different sizes, Methodology The study is based on an intensive inquiry of 100 cultivators, selected randomly under four size groups viz. Ol, 1-2, 2-2 and above hectares from ten villages of Sikrara Block, district Jaunpur. Three stage stratified random sampling technique was used to select the block, villages and the cultivators. The number of cultivators under each size group was kept in probable proporation to their number falling under each size group.

Besides the insuficient food articles to feed the galloping rate of increasing population, we are not in a position to produce agricultural surpluses for running industries smoothly. This low surplus is causing a cultivator's economy towards backwardness, because neither he has enough capital to invest in farming and to get more production nor is he able to save for further production. In the period of rising prices of input factors and decreasing prices of agricultural produce due to recurrent diseases and pests and untimely rain, cultivators are not getting reasonable profit.

{"title": "Comparison of Energy-Efficient Routing Protocols in Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks\n", "abstract": " Mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is an autonomous system of mobile nodes connected by wireless links. It is a self organizing and self configuring network without the need of any centralized base station. In MANETs, the nodes are mobile and battery operated. Each node operates not only as an end system, but also as a router to forward packets [2]. The main aim of MANET is to build best routing algorithms that are adapted to randomly changing network topology [1]. In Few years, number of protocols has been developed and some comparisons are done on number of routing protocols like Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV), Dynamic Source Routing (DSR). To the best of our knowledge, no published work is available in the literature, which compares as many criteria as we have done to evaluate the performance of the considered routing protocols [1]. This paper evaluates the performance of various ad hoc routing protocols such as DSDV, AODV, DSR, TORA and AOMDV in terms of energy efficiency and it also proposes a new routing algorithm that modifies AOMDV and it provides better performance compared to all the above lprotocols. Simulation is done using NS-2 (version NS-2.34)[2].", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["451"]}
{"title": "Managing Soil and Water for Enhanced Agricultural Productivity\n", "abstract": " India is blessed with rich natural resources (soil, water, climate and agro biodiversity) with a geographical area of 329 Mha. Presently it supports 17% of global human population with the share of 2.5% area and 4% water in the world. The one billion population (2001) expected to reach 1.4 billion in 2025 will need 315 million tonnes of food grain with a projected decrease in per capita land availability to 0.08 ha against 0.15 ha in 2000. Soil resource base is also shrinking at 0.25 Mha yr-1 due to industrialization and urbanization. Decrease in organic matter, deficiency and toxicity of nutrients, and declining biological activity are other problems. Per capita availability of water projected to be less than 1500 m3 by 2025 is considered as a big constraint for environment and human population. Out of 400 Mha-m rainfall in this country, 115 Mha-m is lost by run-off, causing moisture stress to crop in uplands and waterlogging in the lowlands. Harvesting of 25% of run-off water in farm ponds, creeks etc, can provide life-saving irrigation to the whole rainfed area of the country. With the availability of diversified natural resources, the farmers of different regions and states have traditionally kept on practicing multiple farming systems as per family needs, land holdings, availability of irrigation water and market demand. This paper deals with soil and water resources; constraints, issues and farming systems in the eastern states of India (Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh (eastern part), Orissa, Uttar Pradesh (eastern part) and West Bengal of eastern India to attain the high agricultural productivity.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["451"]}
{"title": "A Logistic Metrics Scorecard Based Approach to Intrusion Detection System Evaluation for Wireless Network\n", "abstract": " Logistical metrics are used to measure expense, maintainability, and manageability of a wireless IDS. Wireless IDS is used to analyze traffic specific to wireless along with scanning for external users trying to connect to the network through access points and play important role in providing security to wireless network. Design of wireless IDS is a difficult task as wireless technology is advancing every day, Logistic metrics can play an important role in the design of wireless IDS by measuring the areas concern with the logistics of a wireless IDS. In this paper we describes a set of logistic metrics that are relevant to wireless IDS. A \u201cscorecard\u201d containing the set of values is used as the centerpiece of testing and evaluating a wireless IDS. Evaluation of a wireless IDS is done by assigning score to various logistical metrics concern with wireless IDS. We apply our scorecard evaluation methodology to three popular wireless IDS Snort-wireless, AirDefense Guard, and Kismet. Finally we discuss the results and the opportunities for further work in this area.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["451"]}

A ring is said to be CS-ring if R as a right R-module is CS [9]. In this paper we study semiperfect ring in which each simple right R-module is essential in a direct summand of R. We call such ring as a extending for simple R-module. Here we find that for such rings, every simple R-module is weakly-injective if and only if R is weakly-injective if and only if R is self-injective if and only if R is weakly-semisimple. Examples are constructed for which simple R-module is essential in a direct summand.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["451"]}
{"title": "Highway Entrance Ramp Monitoring and Control using Soft Computing Techniques\n", "abstract": " Highway entrance ramp monitoring and control is used to regularize the flow of traffic entering through the highway entrance ramps. It detects the flow of traffic entering through the highway ramp monitoring system and controls the flow of traffic using ramp monitoring and control algorithm. This algorithm employs some soft computing techniques which is a suitable choice due to the imprecise information and the level of inaccuracy in the monitoring data available. The use of AI-based search algorithms to calibrate the parameters of a micro-simulation model or estimate the dynamic demand needed to run the model is an area that has received significant attention from researchers recently. Use of soft computing techniques improves the traffic flow as also increases the efficiency of the traffic system with enhanced control and safety.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["451"]}
{"title": "Tools for enabling rapid deployment of water and energy consumption and supply data services\n", "abstract": " Improving data consistency and facilitating opportunities for cross-domain urban research is important to understanding patterns of urban development and modelling urban growth for a sustainable future. Researchers and policy analysts are confronted with a number of technical challenges when comparing data in the water and energy industries both within and across these sectors. These include variability in data formats, spatio-temporal granularity, access methods and differing semantic definitions. These hinder attempts to access, analyse, interpret, compare and combine the respective water and energy datasets. The AURIN Lens 6/2 project has developed the Water and Energy Consumption and Supply (WESC) data protocol for encoding WESC datasets and tools for consolidated access via standardised geospatial web services. In addition, a number of data agreements across Australian utilities and peak body organisations have developed in order to establish a thematic data hub, called the WESC data hub. The WESC data hub currently hosts relevant datasets and uses the WESC data protocol to provide access to them via the AURIN data portal. In developing the WESC data hub, a number of tools and techniques have been developed to streamline and automate the data extract-transform-load and web service deployment process for each data provider as well as set up continuous testing frameworks to provide quality assurance and performance monitoring of the WESC data hub. In this paper, we will present the technical challenges in delivering the WESC data hub across multiple datasets and data providers, as well as the tools\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["451"]}
