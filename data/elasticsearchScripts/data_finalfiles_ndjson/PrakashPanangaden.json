{"title": "The semantic foundations of concurrent constraint programming\n", "abstract": " Concurrent constraint programming[Sar89, SR90] is a simple and powerful model of concurrent computation based on the notions of store-as-constraint and process as information transducer. The store-as-valuation conception of von Neumann computing is replaced by the notion that the store is a constraint(a finite representation of a possibly infinite set of valuations) which provides partial information about the possible values that variables can take. Instead of \u201creading\u201d and \u201cwriting\u201d the values of variables, processes may now ask (check if a constraint is entailed by the store) and tell (augment the store with a new constraint). This is a very general paradigm which subsumes(among others) nondeterminate data-flow and the (concurrent)(constraint) logic programming languages.This paper develops the basic ideas involved in giving a coherent semantic account of these languages.

{"title": "Metrics for Finite Markov Decision Processes.\n", "abstract": " Markov decision processes (MDPs) offer a popular mathematical tool for planning and learning in the presence of uncertainty (Boutilier, Dean, & Hanks 1999). MDPs are a standard formalism for describing multi-stage decision making in probabilistic environments. The objective of the decision making is to maximize a cumulative measure of longterm performance, called the return. Dynamic programming algorithms, eg, value iteration or policy iteration (Puterman 1994), allow us to compute the optimal expected return for any state, as well as the way of behaving (policy) that generates this return. However, in many practical applications the state space of an MDP is simply too large, possibly even continuous, for such standard algorithms to be applied. A typical means of overcoming such circumstances is to partition the state space in the hope of obtaining an \u201cessentially equivalent\u201d reduced system. One defines a new MDP over the partition blocks, and if it is small enough, it can be solved by classical methods. The hope is that optimal values and policies for the reduced MDP can be extended to optimal values and policies for the original MDP. The notion of equivalence for stochastic processes is problematic because it requires that the transition probabilities agree exactly. This is not a robust concept, especially considering that usually, the numbers used in probabilistic models come from experimentation or are approximate estimates; what is needed is a quantitative notion of equivalence.

Using this concept I will show how to de ne iteration in this category and give a simple treatment of Kozen's language of while loops and probabilistic choice. I will use the concept of stochastic relation to introduce some of the ongoing joint work with Edalat and Desharnais on Labeled Markov Processes. In my talk I will assume that people do not know what partially additive categories are but that they do know basic category theory and basic notions like measure and probability.

The approximation is expressed through a sequence of  types that approximate the type of infinite objects. We give two semantic  accounts of types of infinite objects.

The key idea is to start from an entangled state and then use measurements and one-qubit unitaries, which may be dependent on the outcomes of measurements, to guide the computation. The main point is that one never has to perform unitaries on more than one qubit at a time after the initial preparation of an entangled state.

{"title": "Fock space: a model of linear exponential types\n", "abstract": " It has been observed by several people that, in certain contexts, the free symmetric algebra construction can provide a model of the linear modality!. This construction arose independently in quantum physics, where it is considered as a canonical model of quantum eld theory. In this context, the construction is known as (bosonic) Fock space. Fock space is used to analyze such quantum phenomena as the annihilation and creation of particles. There is a strong intuitive connection to the principle of renewable resource, which is the philosophical interpretation of the linear modalities.In this paper, we examine Fock space in several categories of vector spaces. We rst consider vector spaces, where the Fock construction induces a model of the; &;! fragment in the category of symmetric algebras. When considering Banach spaces, the Fock construction provides a model of a weakening cotriple in the sense of Jacobs. While the models so obtained model a smaller fragment, it is closer in practice to the structures considered by physicists. In this case, Fock space has a natural interpretation as a space of holomorphic functions.

{"title": "Latent variable modelling with hyperbolic normalizing flows\n", "abstract": " The choice of approximate posterior distributions plays a central role in stochastic variational inference (SVI). One effective solution is the use of normalizing flows\\cut {defined on Euclidean spaces} to construct flexible posterior distributions. However, one key limitation of existing normalizing flows is that they are restricted to the Euclidean space and are ill-equipped to model data with an underlying hierarchical structure. To address this fundamental limitation, we present the first extension of normalizing flows to hyperbolic spaces. We first elevate normalizing flows to hyperbolic spaces using coupling transforms defined on the tangent bundle, termed Tangent Coupling (). We further introduce Wrapped Hyperboloid Coupling (), a fully invertible and learnable transformation that explicitly utilizes the geometric structure of hyperbolic spaces, allowing for expressive posteriors while being efficient to sample from. We demonstrate the efficacy of our novel normalizing flow over hyperbolic VAEs and Euclidean normalizing flows. Our approach achieves improved performance on density estimation, as well as reconstruction of real-world graph data, which exhibit a hierarchical structure. Finally, we show that our approach can be used to power a generative model over hierarchical data using hyperbolic latent variables.", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["1877"]}

From this simple intuition one can define concepts like the probability of more complex processes which might involve several steps or interaction between different observations.The typical concepts that one learns: independence, expectation value, and conditional probability are fairly clear-at least in their intuitive conception-in the \u201cdiscrete\u201d case described above. These concepts suffice to analyze much of the work in probabilistic process algebra. In some sense the relevant concepts are essentially those of Boolean algebra.

Measure theory evolved originally to make sense of integration but-essentially in Kolmogorov\u2019s hands-it became the rigourous foundation for probability theory. The need for such extensions to high-school probability theory arose from statistical mechanics and the need to explain physical phenomena like Brownian motion.

Our scheme is to use the notion of hiatons to represent delays as measured locally, and then to filter out the hiatons to obtain ordinary streams.

These results hold for systems defined on analytic state spaces and assume that there are countably many labels in the case of bisimulation and finitely many labels in the case of simulation. In this paper, we first revisit these results by giving simpler and more streamlined proofs. In particular, our proof for simulation has the same structure as the one for bisimulation, relying on a new result of a topological nature. This departs from the known proof for this result, which uses domain theory techniques and falls out of a theory of approximation of Labelled Markov processes. Both our proofs assume the presence of countably many labels. We investigate the necessity of this assumption, and show that the logical characterization of bisimulation may fail when there are uncountably many labels. However, with a stronger assumption on the transition functions (continuity instead of just measurability), we can regain the logical characterization result, for arbitrarily many labels.

More precisely we show how the usual hyperdoctrinal description of rst order logic can be functorially related to another hyperdoctrine built out of closure operators. The logical connectives map onto constructions on closure operators that turn out to model programming constructs, speci cally conjunction becomes parallel composition and existential quanti cation becomes hiding of local variables.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1877"]}
{"title": "Security by Permission in Databases.\n", "abstract": " In reasoning about database security, it is important to have a precise notion of what a user\" knows\" and what a user is\" permitted to know\". Furthermore, it is important to know how knowledge and permissions propagate to complex statements from simple ones. In this paper we present a logical approach to these questions based on a modal logic formalism. The point is that there is a well understood theory of modal logics that includes an account of how the modalities interact with the ordinary logical connectives. By casting permission and knowledge as modalities we obtain a structured framework within which we can discuss their logical and semantic properties. It also provides a framework in which we can discuss the reasoning abilities of deductive databases.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1877"]}
{"title": "Minimisation in logical form\n", "abstract": " Stone-type dualities provide a powerful mathematical framework for studying properties of logical systems. They have recently been fruitfully explored in understanding minimisation of various types of automata. In Bezhanishvili et al. (2012), a dual equivalence between a category of coalgebras and a category of algebras was used to explain minimisation. The algebraic semantics is dual to a coalgebraic semantics in which logical equivalence coincides with trace equivalence. It follows that maximal quotients of coalgebras correspond to minimal subobjects of algebras. Examples include partially observable deterministic finite automata, linear weighted automata viewed as coalgebras over finite-dimensional vector spaces, and belief automata, which are coalgebras on compact Hausdorff spaces. In Bonchi et al. (2014), Brzozowski's double-reversal minimisation algorithm for deterministic finite automata was described categorically and its correctness explained via the duality between reachability and observability. This work includes generalisations of Brzozowski's algorithm to Moore and weighted automata over commutative semirings. In this paper we propose a general categorical framework within which such minimisation algorithms can be understood. The goal is to provide a unifying perspective based on duality. Our framework consists of a stack of three interconnected adjunctions: a base dual adjunction that can be lifted to a dual adjunction between coalgebras and algebras and also to a dual adjunction between automata. The approach provides an abstract understanding of reachability and observability. We illustrate the general\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1877"]}

Intuitively, unbounded indeterminacy can be used to program a fair merge when  it is guaranteed that data will always be available. But such schemes rely on  predictive scheduling and they may fail if one of the inputs to the merge is  a finite stream. It is reasonable to expect that if one were to add a  primitive which \"knows how to avoid bottom\" (so called \"angelic merge\")  then one could use this in conjunction with unbounded choice in order to  produce a fair merge. Somewhat surprisingly, this expectation is incorrect as  we show in this paper. The method we use to prove this is to identify a  property which generalises monotonicity to indeterminate networks and then  show that this property is possessed by determinate networks and by unbounded  choice and by angelic merge but not by fair merge. It appears that there is a  hierarchy of inequivalent indeterminate primitives all of which feature some  form of unbounded indeterminacy.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1877"]}

The renormalization of the stress tensor results in a departure from naive scaling. We view the process of renormalizing the stress tensor as being equivalent to renormalizing the coupling constants in the Lagrangian for gravity (with terms quadratic in the curvature included). Thus the scaling of the stress tensor is interpreted as a nonnaive scaling of these coupling constants. In particular, we find that the cosmological constant and the gravitational constant approach UV fixed points. The constants associated with the terms which are quadratic in the curvature logarithmically diverge.

Instead of\" reading\" and \u201cwriting\u201d the values of variables, processes may now ask (check if a constraint is entailed by the store) and tell (augment the store with a new constraint).

Our first con-tribution is to give a simple and general formulation of the notion that a constraint system is a system of partial infor-mation (a la the information systems of Scott).

We propose two definitions of bisimulation on continuous-time stochastic processes where the evolution is a flow through time. We show that they are equivalent and we show that when restricted to discrete-time, our concept of bisimulation encompasses the standard discrete-time concept. The concept we introduce is not a straightforward generalization of discrete-time concepts.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1877"]}
{"title": "Temporally Extended Metrics for Markov Decision Processes\n", "abstract": " Developing safe and efficient methods for state abstraction in reinforcement learning systems is an open research problem. We propose to address it by leveraging ideas from formal verification, namely, bisimulation. Specifically, we generalize the notion of bisimulation by considering arbitrary comparisons between states instead of strict reward matching. We further develop a notion of temporally extended metrics, which extend a base metric between states of an environment so as to reflect not just the current difference but the extent to which the distance is preserved through the course of transitions. We show that this property is not satisfied by bisimulation metrics, which were previously used to compare states with respect to their longterm rewards. A temporal extension can be defined for any base metric of interest, thus making the construction very flexible. The kernel of the temporally extended metrics corresponds precisely to exact bisimulation (thus these metrics form a larger class of bisimulation metrics). We provide bounds relating bisimulation and temporally extended metrics and also examine the couplings of state distributions which are induced.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1877"]}

We also give compact representations of infinite objects that can be used by processes to simulate announcements of common knowledge and global information.Introduction. Distributed systems have changed substantially in the recent past with the advent of phenomena like social networks and cloud computing. In the previous incarnation of distributed computing [16] the emphasis was on consistency, fault-tolerance, resource management and related topics; these were all characterized by interaction between processes. Research proceeded along two lines: the algorithmic side which dominated the Principles Of Distributed Computing conferences and the more process algebraic approach epitomized by CONCUR where the emphasis was on developing compositional reasoning principles. What marks the new era of distributed systems is an emphasis on managing access to information to a much greater degree than before. Epistemic concepts were crucial in distributed computing as was realized in the mid 1980s with Halpern and Moses\u2019 groundbreaking paper on common knowledge [13]. This led to a flurry of activity in the next few years [11] with many distributed protocols being understood from an epistemic point of view.

{"title": "An algebraic approach to dynamic epistemic logic\n", "abstract": " Dynamic epistemic logic plays a key role in reasoning about multi-agent systems. Past approaches to dynamic epistemic logic have typically been focused on actions whose primary purpose is to communicate information from one agent to another. These actions are unable to alter the valuation of any proposition within the system. In fields such as security, it is easy to imagine situations in which this sort of action would be insufficient. We expand the algebraic framework presented by M. Sadrzadeh [14] to include both communication actions and dynamic actions that change the state of the system. Furthermore, we propose a new modality that captures both epistemic and propositional changes resulting from the agents\u2019 actions.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1877"]}
{"title": "Duality of State and Observations\n", "abstract": " In this paper we consider the problem of representing and reasoning about systems, especially probabilistic systems, with hidden state. We consider transition systems where the state is not completely visible to an outside observer. Instead, there are observables that partly identify the state. We show that one can interchange the notions of state and observation and obtain what we cann a dual system. The double dual gives a minimal representation of the behaviour of the original system. We extend this to nondeterministic systems and to probabilistic transition systems and finally to partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). In the case of finite automata restricted to one observable, we obtain Brzozowski\u2019s algorithm for minimizing finite-state language acceptors.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1877"]}

The well known causal anomalies associated with relational semantics of indeterminate dataflow are avoided, but still we preserve much of the intuitions of a relational model. The development fits with the view of categories of models for concurrency and the general treatment of bisimulation they provide. In particular it fits with the recent categorical formulation of feedback using traced monoidal categories. The payoffs are:(1) explicit relations to existing models and semantics, especially the usual axioms of monotone IO automata are read off from the definition of profunctors,(2) a new definition of bisimulation for dataflow, the proof of the congruence of which benefits from the preservation properties associated with open maps and (3) a treatment of higher-order dataflow as a biproduct, essentially by following the geometry of interaction programme.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1877"]}

From the point of view of concurrent automata an important class of automata called monotone automata were defined and it was shown that fair merge could not be implemented by such an automaton. In this paper we study the relationship between monotonicity properties of automata and of trace languages. We characterize the trace languages computed by monotone automata and we show that the characterization does not correspond to the existing monotonicity properties of trace languages.

{"title": "Quantitative Equational Reasoning\n", "abstract": " Equational logic is central to reasoning about programs. What is the right equational setting for reasoning about probabilistic programs? It has been understood that instead of equivalence relations one should work with (pseudo) metrics in a probabilistic setting. However, it is not clear how this relates to equational reasoning. In recent work the notion of a quantitative equational logic was introduced and developed. This retains many of the features of ordinary logic but fits naturally with metric reasoning. The present chapter is an elementry introduction to this topic. In this setting one can define analogues of algebras and free algebras. It turns out that the Kantorovich (Wasserstein) metric emerges as a free construction from a simple quantitative equational theory. We give a couple of examples of quantitative analogues of familiar effects from programming language theory. We do not assume any background in equational logic or advanced category theory.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1877"]}

Previous work emphasized the propositions-as-types part of the correspondence between LTL and FRP; here we emphasize the proofsas-programs part by employing structural proof theory. We show that this type system is expressive enough to enforce liveness properties such as the fairness of schedulers and the eventual delivery of results. We illustrate programming in this language using (co) iteration operators. We prove type preservation of our operational semantics, which guarantees that our programs are causal.

{"title": "A \u201cBook\u201d proof that parallel convergence tester cannot implement parallel or\n", "abstract": " I give a short and elementary proof that paralle convergence tester cannot implement parallel or.

These functions arise in the discussion of full abstraction of PCF [Plo77] and the lazy \u03bb-calculus [AO93]. It is now well-known that the lattice of degrees of parallelism is very rich and infinite in two directions [Buc97, PP01]: the fact that one cannot implement p with c is a tiny part of these results. There is, however, a very simple proof that PCF with c cannot implement p assuming that PCF by itself cannot implement p. Suppose that such an implementation exists so that there is some pure PCF context C [\u00b7] with C [c]= p. The functional \u03bbx. C [x] is monotone. Therefore the pure PCF 1 term C [\u03bbu.\u22a4] is extensionally above p, but p is maximal so the pure PCF term C [\u03bbu.\u22a4]= p, a contradiction.
