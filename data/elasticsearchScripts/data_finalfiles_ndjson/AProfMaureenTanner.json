{"title": "Can mobile internet help alleviate social exclusion in developing countries?\n", "abstract": " Research has shown that traditional Internet has not been successful in alleviating social exclusion in developing country. Since a significant number of the population in developing countries use mobile phones, others have suggested that mobile internet may be the solution to the problem. However, to date there has not been empirical studies in developing countries to explore that possibility. This study aims therefore to explore whether the mobile internet may be a viable option for addressing social exclusion in a developing country context. Data for the study was gathered using semi\u2010structured interviews with socially excluded individuals and the data was analysed using thematic analysis. The findings of the study show that usage of mobile internet amongst the socially excluded is low mainly because internet\u2010capable cell phones are still beyond the reach of the socially excluded and because of limited\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "184\n", "authors": ["2232"]}
{"title": "A flipped classroom approach to teaching systems analysis, design and implementation\n", "abstract": " This paper describes a flipped classroom approach followed to teach systems analysis, design and implementation at university level. The techniques employed are described. These techniques were underpinned by a theory of coherent practice: a pedagogy that provides a framework for the design of highly structured interventions to guide students in their learning experiences. The paper also describes the students\u2019 perceived benefits and limitations of the approach. Overall, the flipped classroom approach had a positive impact on students\u2019 attitude to learning, level of understanding, ability to apply concepts and engagement. Limitations were mostly in line with a reluctance to take charge of their own learning (for some of them) and inability to engage in group discussions. A set of recommendations are proposed to address these gaps in line with what has been prescribed in literature.", "num_citations": "79\n", "authors": ["2232"]}

{"title": "Factors leading to the success and failure of agile projects implemented in traditionally waterfall environments\n", "abstract": " This qualitative study was undertaken to investigate the factors that result in agile project success and failure. The study particularly focused on software projects where agile methods were newly adopted, implying a transition from the Waterfall to a more light-weight and iterative approach. The study was exploratory and deductive in nature, and employed multiple-case studies as research strategy. The target population was Project Management Offices (PMO) that had moved, or attempted to move, from a traditionally waterfall approach, to an agile software development approach. Primary data was collected using semi-structured, observations of meetings and team engagements. Secondary data collected included project documentation, meeting minutes, and formal project communication. This research was aimed at making practitioners and academic researchers aware of the factors that may lead to project failure as well as project success, thereby encouraging them to find and devise coping and mitigating mechanisms to enhance successful agile adoption, use and implementation. The following constructs were identified as success and failure factors in agile project delivery: Culture, Customer Involvement & Mandate, Stakeholder Involvement & Buy-In, Team Structure & Team Logistics, Project Type & Project Planning, and Skill Level & Attitude of Team Members.", "num_citations": "34\n", "authors": ["2232"]}
{"title": "Investigating the characteristics needed by scrum team members to successfully transfer tacit knowledge during agile software projects\n", "abstract": " The purpose of this study is to propose a theoretical model describing what makes Scrum team members successful at transferring knowledge. Twelve semi\u2011structured interviews were conducted at two Scrum companies in Cape Town, South Africa. Participants interviewed ranged from project managers and Scrum masters to software developers, business analyst and testers. The interviews were all transcribed, then analysed using thematic analysis. Past studies have already identified factors (ie characteristics that enable people to transfer knowledge) that are known to impact knowledge transfer. This study further extends the body of knowledge by revealing how these existing factors are interrelated while impacting knowledge transfer. In addition, new factors (ie empathy and articulation skills of the source) are proposed, which were found to further impact knowledge transfer in Scrum teams. The results have shown that recipients perceive team members who are able to successfully transfer knowledge as having the following characteristics: motivation, capability, credibility, empathy, articulate and ability to communicate enough. The contribution of this study to practice is a list of team member characteristics, that HR managers could foster through appropriate training, to help improve the knowledge transfer within Scrum teams. This paper offers new contributions and a theoretical model to the under researched area of knowledge transfer within Scrum teams.", "num_citations": "33\n", "authors": ["2232"]}

{"title": "Sources of interruptions experienced during a scrum sprint\n", "abstract": " Scrum, a form of agile project management methodology, comes with many benefits derived from the iterative form of software development. Various organisations within South Africa have implemented Scrum within their development teams and are fast receiving positive benefits from it. While Scrum, in many aspects of the methodology, is highly effective and successful within different organisations, there are always going to be pitfalls and negative attributes associated with the adoption and use of a new methodology. The purpose of this research is to determine the factors leading to interruptions in the middle of a sprint while using Scrum. Case studies were conducted which included 3 companies in Johannesburg and Cape Town that have implemented Scrum. In particular, data was collected through the following methods: 12 face\u2011to\u2011face, one\u2011on\u2011one interviews with participating Scrum team members; and 1 group discussion with 8 participating Scrum team members. After analysis, five theoretical statements were formulated pertaining to: poorly understood and defined objectives from clients, managements lack of understanding of Scrum processes, high workload, ad\u2011hoc requests mid\u2011sprint, and low interdepartmental communication. Results from this study reveal the need to conduct possible future research on: ways to prevent these forms of sprint interruption from having negative effects on the Scrum team and the project; and the effect that these interruptions have on the relevant stakeholders involved.

With an increasing number of information technology (IT) investors, both countries are being recognised as IT hubs in the Southern African region; hence the need for further research on GSD in those two countries. Furthermore, due to a highly diverse cultural setting prevailing in Mauritius and South Africa, common GSD practices derived from other studies might not be fully successful when applied in these contexts. It is thus useful to explore how alternative GSD practices have been put in place to handle these cultural disparities and the resulting communication requirements.

{"title": "Cloud Computing as an Enabler of Agile Global Software Development.\n", "abstract": " Agile global software development (AGSD) is an increasingly prevalent software development strategy, as organizations hope to realize the benefits of accessing a larger resource pool of skilled labor, at a potentially reduced cost, while at the same time delivering value incrementally and iteratively. However, the distributed nature of AGSD creates geographic, temporal, socio-cultural distances that challenge collaboration between project stakeholders. The Cloud Computing (CC) service models of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) are similar to the aspirant qualities of AGSD as they provide services that are globally accessible, efficient, and stable, with lower predictable operating costs that scale to meet the computational demand. This study focused on the 12 agile principles upon which all agile methodologies are based, therein potentially increasing the potential for the findings to be generalized. Domestication Theory was used to assist in understanding how cloud technologies were appropriated in support of AGSD. The research strategy took the form of case study research. The findings suggest that some of the challenges in applying the agile principles in AGSD may be overcome by using CC.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["2232"]}
