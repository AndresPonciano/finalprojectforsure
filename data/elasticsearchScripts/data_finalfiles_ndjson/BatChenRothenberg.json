{"title": "Incremental verification using trace abstraction\n", "abstract": " Despite the increasing effectiveness of model checking tools, automatically re-verifying a program whenever a new revision of it is created is often not feasible using existing tools. Incremental verification aims at facilitating this re-verification, by reusing partial results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for incremental verification that is based on trace abstraction. Trace abstraction is an automata-based verification technique in which the program is proved correct using a sequence of automata. We present two algorithms that reuse this sequence across different revisions, one eagerly and one lazily. We demonstrate their effectiveness in an extensive experimental evaluation on a previously established benchmark set for incremental verification based on different revisions of device drivers from the Linux kernel. Our algorithm is able to achieve significant speedups on this set, compared to both stand\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["2127"]}
