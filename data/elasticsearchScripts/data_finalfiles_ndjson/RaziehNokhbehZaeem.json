{"title": "Modeling and analysis of identity threat behaviors through text mining of identity theft stories\n", "abstract": " Identity theft, fraud, and abuse are problems affecting the entire society. Identity theft is often a \u201cgateway\u201d crime, as criminals use stolen or fraudulent identities to steal money, claim eligibility for services, hack into networks without authorization, and so on. The available data describing identity crimes and their aftermath are often in the form of recorded stories and reports by the news press, fraud examiners, and law enforcement. All of these sources are unstructured. In order to analyze identity theft data, this research proposes an approach which involves the novel collection of online news stories and reports on the topic of identity theft. Our approach pre-processes the raw text and extracts semi-structured information automatically, using text mining techniques.

Prior research also suggests that users ignore privacy policies because these policies are lengthy and, on average, require 2 years of college education to comprehend. We propose a novel technique that tackles this problem by automatically extracting summaries of online privacy policies. We use data mining models to analyze the text of privacy policies and answer 10 basic questions concerning the privacy and security of user data, what information is gathered from them, and how this information is used. In order to train the data mining models, we thoroughly study privacy policies of 400 companies (considering 10% of all listings on NYSE, Nasdaq, and AMEX stock markets) across industries.
