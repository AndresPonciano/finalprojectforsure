{"title": "Prediction and analysis of Indonesia Presidential election from Twitter using sentiment analysis\n", "abstract": " Big data encompasses social networking websites including Twitter as popular micro-blogging social media platform for a political campaign. The explosive Twitter data as a respond of the political campaign can be used to predict the Presidential election as has been conducted to predict the political election in several countries such as US, UK, Spain, and French. The authors use tweets from President Candidates of Indonesia (Jokowi and Prabowo), and tweets from relevant hashtags for sentiment analysis gathered from March to July 2018 to predict Indonesian Presidential election result. The authors make an algorithm and method to count important data, top words and train the model and predict the polarity of the sentiment. The experimental result is produced by using R language and show that Jokowi leads the current election prediction.

However, the testing process is consuming activities that need to be automated to save a lot of resources. Towards automated testing, automating test cases generation as the first testing process is being highlighted. This research aims to generate test case automatically from UML diagram since model based testing that conducted on early phase of software development process show higher efficiency. UML diagrams used in this research are activity diagram, sequence diagram and SYTG as the combination graph. These three diagrams have been proved as the most compatible diagram to generate test case from previous research. Method proposed in this paper is Depth First Search algorithm that is modified to generate expected test cases.

{"title": "Social media web scraping using social media developers api and regex\n", "abstract": " Nowadays many information can be easily accessed through the internet. Some of social media web applications, such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, even provide user with an easy information sharing features. However, the information is presented in the form of a timeline or a feed, which is sometimes not relevant to the user or quite hard to accessed by user because of the redundancy of the information. This situation can be resolved with a Web Scraping method proposed in this paper, that able to search information, combine and present it in a better way according to user preferences. A system is developed to implement the proposed method by using an API that Facebook Developers and Twitter Developers provided. In addition, regular expression (or Regex) which is a language construction that can be used for matching text by using some patterns.

{"title": "Summarizing text for indonesian language by using latent dirichlet allocation and genetic algorithm\n", "abstract": " The number of documents progressively increases especially for the electronic one. This degrades effectivity and efficiency in managing them. Therefore, it is a must to manage the documents. Automatic text summarization is able to solve by producing text document summaries. The goal of the research is to produce a tool to summarize documents in Bahasa: Indonesian Language. It is aimed to satisfy the user\u2019s need of relevant and consistent summaries. The algorithm is based on sentence features scoring by using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Genetic Algorithm for determining sentence feature weights. It is evaluated by calculating summarization speed, precision, recall, F-measure, and some subjective evaluations. Extractive summaries from the original text documents can represent important information from a single document in Bahasa with faster summarization speed compared to manual process. Best F-measure value is 0, 556926 (with precision of 0.53448 and recall of 0.58134) and summary ratio of 30%.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["2003"]}

{"title": "Brainwave classification of visual stimuli based on low cost EEG spectrogram using DenseNet\n", "abstract": " The paper presents the classification of brainwave response based on low-cost Electroencephalograph (EEG) spectrogram. The low-cost EEG can record EEG data, but it performs significantly worse than the medical device. The purpose of our research is to understand the way of images are perceived by people based on their brain waves. Based on the EEG, we investigate two paradigms in mind-brain research that is: the valence-arousal plane and the universal symbol. The experiments are done using two paradigms to generate EEG data based on visual stimuli and convert it into spectrogram. For brainwave response classification based on EEG spectrogram, we use the recent deep learning architecture that is DenseNet. Furthermore, we compare the training performance between two brain-mind paradigms. The experiment results show that: (i) the EEG signal classification of visual stimuli based on valence\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["2003"]}
{"title": "Automating functional and structural software size measurement based on XML structure of UML sequence diagram\n", "abstract": " This research aims to automated software size measurement for both functional and structural view. Software size is used to estimate schedule, effort, cost and other resource in software development process. Therefore, the best method to measure software size is to derive software attributes from requirement artifacts to get early estimation. UML sequence diagram chose as source to extract software function, since this diagram provide high level granularity of function. Functional size is measured by using COSMIC method, while structural size is calculated based on control structure on sequence diagram. To automate the measurement process, XML structure of sequence diagram is analyzed to fit existing functional and structural equation. A well-known case study of rice cooker is used to depict the proposed method in this research. In addition, a simple support tool is provided.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["2003"]}
{"title": "A framework for obstacles avoidance of humanoid robot using stereo vision\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we propose a framework for multiple moving obstacles avoidance strategy using stereo vision for humanoid robot in indoor environment. We assume that this model of humanoid robot is used as a service robot to deliver a cup to customer from starting point to destination point. We have successfully developed and introduced three main modules to recognize faces, to identify multiple moving obstacles and to initiate a maneuver. A group of people who are walking will be tracked as multiple moving obstacles. Predefined maneuver to avoid obstacles is applied to robot because the limitation of view angle from stereo camera to detect multiple obstacles. The contribution of this research is a new method for multiple moving obstacles avoidance strategy with Bayesian approach using stereo vision based on the direction and speed of obstacles.

The mobile device Graphical user interfaces (GUI) are one of the main components to be tested for quality assurance. GUI testing is important since they often make up for half of the resource code of the application and GUI is used to interact with the application. Automating these tests is very useful since it saves a lot of time and money. However, the tools or frameworks that are available for automating the tests are often not suitable for developer needs, mainly because of the lack of functionality. Therefore, automated testing framework evaluation is needed. With a comparison study provided, developers will able to consider about testing framework that can fit their needs easily.
