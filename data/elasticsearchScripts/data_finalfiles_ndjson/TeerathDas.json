Clock power is reduced up to 86.11%, 87.14%, 87.10% and 87.26% and Leakage power is reduced to up to 50.39%, 66%, 82.78% and 82.78%, when the FIR filter is operated at 5GHz, 50GHz, 500GHz and 1 THz frequencies respectively and voltage is scaled down from 1.0 V to 0.2 V.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1020"]}
{"title": "Investigating performance issues in mobile apps\n", "abstract": " The world is moving at a dynamic pace, and this has led to the technological advancement of mobile applications. This rise in the advancement of the mobile application comes with critical concerns to end-users in terms of the performance, especially when implementing high intensive features. Moreover, enjoyable user experience in terms of performance is often considered as the main parameter to measure the success of any app. Poor implementation of source code, lack of developers knowledge, and time constraints on resolving performance issues are few of the major potential performance drawbacks in Android applications.To overcome these performance issues, in this dissertation, we focus on investigating the performance-related issues in open-source Android application (mainly apps from GitHub). Our thesis can be divided into four key research objectives:(i) initially we investigate on the extent to which developers consider performance issues in their commits (while maintaining their apps) and how they document it,(ii) to complement this study, we conduct an experiment to study the evolution of Android specific performance issues detected by Android Lint, and based on the obtained results,(iii) we introduce an Eclipse plugin that can be used to automatically resolve seven types of performancerelated issues detected by Android Lint; in addition to this, we performed a survey-based study to analyze the self assessed performance refactoring code of the proposed tool from the developers\u2019 perspective; and (iv) we design and conduct a measurement-based study to examine the impact of performance violations at run-time.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1020"]}
{"title": "Design of power optimized memory circuit using High Speed Transreceiver Logic IO Standard on 28nm Field Programmable Gate Array\n", "abstract": " In this work, we designed a power efficient memory circuit using family of various HSTL IO Standards on 28nm Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Nine different HSTL IO Standards are compared with each other to search the most power efficient one. We validated our circuit with different HSTL IO Standards and on Different frequency range to obtain a most power efficient circuit. In our experiment, there is 87.44% power reduction when HSTL_I is replaced with HSTL_I_DCI_18 on 1 GHz frequency and 76.32% power reduction where we use HSTL_I_12 at place of HSTL_I_DCI_12. According to this experiment, HSTL_I is proved a best energy efficient IO Standard when compared with any other family of HSTL. To design this energy efficient memory circuit we are using Verilog as HDL, Xilinx ISE14.6 simulator with kintex-7 FPGA.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1020"]}
