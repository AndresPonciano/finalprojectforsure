{"title": "Improving learning object reuse through OOD: A theory of learning objects.\n", "abstract": " The concept of a learning object (LO) has spread quickly without a very specific universal definition, and though born originally from the idea of object oriented design, with a goal of providing high levels of reusability for digital learning resources, it is being developed generally without reference to the ideals of the object oriented design paradigm. This has resulted in challenges to reusability and interoperability. We therefore present a theory of learning objects (including OOGLOM-Object Oriented Generic Learning Object Model). We develop UML models to illustrate OOGLOM as well as illustrate how it provides interoperability.", "num_citations": "60\n", "authors": ["1337"]}
{"title": "Measurement invariance of the UTAUT constructs in the Caribbean\n", "abstract": " This article employs confirmatory factor analysis to evaluate the factorial validity and the cross-national comparability of the UTAUT constructs with respect to mobile learning in higher education in four Caribbean countries. Except for the measurement of one factor, the UTAUT constructs exhibit adequate reliability and validity. Though full metric invariance is not achieved, cross-national comparisons of the regression relationships among the factors are still possible. In addition, non-invariant item intercepts also affect the comparisons of the factor means. Partial scalar invariance is required.", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["1337"]}
{"title": "A flexible taxonomy of learning objects based on content and media centric approaches to granularity\n", "abstract": " The issue of appropriate granularity for learning objects is a significant one for the learning object research community. Fine objects have high reusability but low added value. Balancing this trade off requires appropriate levels of granularity and taxonomies to inform aggregation and disaggregation models. We believe that learning objects should be categorized based on their use in a learning environment. We suggest four main categories of learning objects: curriculum, instructional, assessment and works and a limited number of granularities. Furthermore, it is our position that a learning object must fit in one category, in one granularity level and that they should be developed based on curriculum based on curriculum objectives and descriptions.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1337"]}
{"title": "A Java System that combines Optimism and Pessimism in updating Replicas\n", "abstract": " In a distributed system some or all of the data items are replicated and stored at separate sites. This increases the availability of these items and it is then possible to complete transactions faster than in a single site system. However, the concurrent processing of transactions at separate sites can generate inconsistencies in the stored information. Several replica control techniques have been proposed to deal with the processing of transactions. Some of these techniques include certain consistency checks before processing the transaction, ie they are pessimistic in nature. Other techniques process the transaction and do the consistency checking afterwards, ie they are optimistic. The system discussed here is an attempt to show how the increased processing capabilities provided by (i) multi-threaded object-oriented programming, and by (ii) powerful computing nodes in the distributed system can be used to combine optimism and pessimism into one system. The system allows a transaction to be processed immediately (optimistically) at any individual replica as long as the transaction satisfies a cost bound. All transactions are also processed in a concurrent pessimistic manner. Only the changes made to the replicas via pessimistic processing are made permanent.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1337"]}
{"title": "A space-based learning object context model: Balancing reusability and meaningfulness\n", "abstract": " We define learning object context as \u201cthe overall situation and scope in which the learning object is to be used\u201d. It is well accepted that learning object context is important for the meaningful use of learning objects but that context affects the viability of the learning object for reuse. In this paper a context model which has three layers corresponding to three context spaces\u2013Intra-Learning Object Context, Inter-Learning Object Context and Extra-Learning Object Context is proposed. Each layer represents the required contextual information based on the learning object context space. We propose that by limiting contextual information within the learning object to that which defines its invariable pedagogical significance, and by providing additional context at the time of usage that we are able to achieve an appropriate balance between reusability (less context) and reuse value or meaning (more context).", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1337"]}
{"title": "Learning objects in instructional serious game design\n", "abstract": " Learning is a crucial component of serious games (SG), and therefore, their design should be grounded in instructional principles. A descriptive research and case study approach were employed to study the structure and elements of SG's gameplay. This study was done to uncover the nature and applicability of learning objects (LOs) during the SG design. It was revealed that indeed LOs are applicable to SG design. LOs relate to the structure of meaningful serious games. In SG learning and gaming are blended through various gameplay elements that correspond to instructional elements. The results are presented as a practical model to guide designers in incorporating LOs during SG design. Employing LOs allows for effective and pedagogically informed SG design decisions. It favours modular design and results in interoperable and reusable SG artefacts. The design and implementation of an educational game\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1337"]}
{"title": "Serious games: Learner assessment in serious game design, a framework for assessment metric identification and integration in the game mechanic\n", "abstract": " Serious game design ignores the fact that learning and assessment go hand in hand. One learns by knowing he has learned and there has to be a measure to ascertain that learning has occurred and to what extent. The subjectivity of whether learning has occurred without sound measure of what has been learnt, how and when is a challenge to serious game. In this paper we argue that the design and integration of learning content in educational serious games has to consider means of communicating results. And those results should have a strong pedagogical foundation. We propose a design approach that considers incorporation of learning objects in educational serious games; we also provide clarity on educational serious game and its anatomy. We present a conceptual framework that allows us to clearly provide argument that learning in game is two-sided learning the game skills (Game specific Learning\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1337"]}
{"title": "Achieving learning object interoperability and reusability through object orientation\n", "abstract": " Throughout the literature there is significant evidence to show that in general the goals of learning object reusability and interoperability are not being met very well. In this paper we discuss how object orientation can be applied to the learning object concept to improve interoperability and reusability. In particular we show how features of object orientation such as inheritance, polymorphism, information hiding and instantiation among others play a significant role in interoperability and reusability in a theory of learning objects presented in a previous paper.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1337"]}
