{"title": "How human aspects impress Agile software development transition and adoption\n", "abstract": " Many software companies are interested in using Agile methods in their software projects. Contrary to traditional software development methods, Agile methods are people oriented. This fact shows the significant role of individuals in these methods. Increasing prevalence of Agile methods forces software companies to consider people related factors as critical issues in adoption and transition to Agile methods and practices. This article focused on human aspects of Agile transformation process by conducting a Grounded Theory study involving 32 Agile experts. The main contribution of this article is identification and classification of diverse human aspects of Agile transformation process. Analyzing collected data showed that human aspects of Agile transformation process can be classified in several categories. While some of them are impediments to change, some others act as change accelerators. At the same time people\u2019s perceptions about change process and incentive factors can shape and form human aspects during the Agile transformation process. Each of these categories encompasses its own factors which have negative or positive effect on change process.", "num_citations": "73\n", "authors": ["2163"]}

The platform of the smart home management system is built using bespoke embedded system design. An embedded control module developed by exploiting the Web Services mechanism, consist of 15 monitoring channels based on XML SOAP standards. Each channel is integrated to dedicated smart home management scheme and performs bidirectional real-time control. In the event of server unavailability, a mobile based communication module using GSM has been deployed as an alternate management mechanism.

{"title": "Exploring facilitators of transition and adoption to agile methods: a grounded theory study\n", "abstract": " Nowadays, changing development approach from traditional to Agile methods has been considered as a strategic decision for achieving Agile values by most software companies and organizations. Due to its nature, moving to Agile software development and adapting to Agile methods need a long time and enough effort. Thus, organizations are faced with a lot of challenges during the transition and adoption process. Providing facilitators can make transition process easier and faster. Conducting a Grounded Theory study on Agile transformation process, involving 33 Agile experts across 13 different countries showed that Agile transition and adoption needs to be supported by several facilitators. Thus, the main contribution of this article is providing eight major facilitators that should be used by Agile teams to support Agile transition and adoption. Some of these facilitators support team members in doing their jobs and empower them against challenges. Some others help them in dealing with challenges or prevent potential problems before occurrence in Agile transition process. Furthermore, some of these facilitators have positive effects on people and motivate them to adapt with their new behaviors. Agile transition and Adoption will be faster and easier if the more facilitators get involve.", "num_citations": "25\n", "authors": ["2163"]}

Selecting an appropriate pilot project as initial project that is going to be done through an Agile method is a critical task. Due to the impact of such a pilot project on successful Agile transformation, understanding its critical factors helps organizations choose the most suitable project to start Agile transition. Conducting a Grounded Theory, showed that organization should considered some key factors of a pilot: Criticality, Duration, Size and Required resources. Besides these factors, the results showed that organization should be aware of the risk of successful pilot project in their next Agile projects.

Usability is a clear concept that encompassing both task and user characteristics as well as functionality. Usability is an essential factor that affects user acceptance and OSS sustainability, which is considered as the key to the success of the OSS. To some extent, usability is one concern of the larger issue of system acceptability and sustainability. Therefore, usability is an important factor that needs to be considered since the software that is not usable is not going to be sustainable.

{"title": "Developing schema for open source programmers\u2019 information-seeking\n", "abstract": " Information-seeking has been recognized as a core subtask in software maintenance. While much of the research in this area attempts to identify the information sought by programmers, the work to date has been typically based on pre-defined information types limiting the potential for new information types to arise. Hence, this paper presents a small empirical study on open-source programmer mailing lists, to iteratively refine a schema of the information that programmers seek based exclusively on an analysis of these programmers\u2019 naturalistic communication. Subsequently it places this schema in the context of the existing literature in the area. The analysis was undertaken on information requests in 288 emails, taken from 2 open source project mailing lists; The Java Bean Scripting Framework (BSF)[1] and the Java Development Tool (JDT)[2].

However, there is little research reported in the literature that describes the information seeking behavior of open source (OS) programmers, even though OS contexts would seem to exacerbate information seeking problems for maintenance programmers.

Such an increased reliance and prevalence means that there is increased demand for software maintenance of OS systems and it is this area that this thesis will strive to address. This thesis reports on a series of empirical studies that classify OS programmers\u2019 information needs during maintenance. In these studies, types of information needs are identified through a Grounded Theory based analysis of the questions that appear in their developer mailing lists. Then the prevalence of these information needs, on different mailing lists, are quantified and the responses obtained are characterized.

{"title": "Open source programmers\u2019 information seeking during software maintenance\n", "abstract": " Problem statement: Several authors have proposed information seeking as an appropriate case study for studying software maintenance and evolution that have provided empirical classifications of information seeking in commercial software evolution settings. Approach: However, there is minimal research in the literature describing the information seeking behavior of Open Source programmers, even though Open Source contexts would seem to exacerbate the information seeking problems to a certain extend; where team members are typically delocalized from each other and they are often forced into asynchronous communication. Results: This study reports on an empirical study that classifies Open-Source programmers\u2019 information needs generated through open-coding of questions that appear on developers\u2019 mailing lists. Based on the generated Information Seeking Schema (ISS), details of the information sought by programmers on 6 different mailing lists over several years are analyzed and discussed. Conclusion/Recommendations: The result shows several interesting findings that describe the programmers\u2019 information needs across the mailing lists. Firstly, there are a similar pattern of information artifact and attribute across all projects. Secondly, majority of the programmers\u2019 information seeking concentrated on the systems\u2019 implementations. Thirdly, the OS programmers have also shown to be team-oriented and they tended to rely on documentation more than what have previously reported. These results suggest the applicability of the ISS in evaluating OS programmers information seeking.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["2163"]}

Processed data when given in context makes information of any knowledge. However, irresponsible use of the data or misinterpretation of data could be the reasons for false information dissemination. Many researchers from various fields, such as computer science and social science, draw their focus on assessing the veracity of information. There are many techniques to perceive this topic, for instance, social network behaviour, and semantic analysis. The common practice is using semantic analysis approach, where the syntactic structure is analysed and polarity of the texts is determined. In this paper, we approach the veracity assessment by using emotion analysis.
