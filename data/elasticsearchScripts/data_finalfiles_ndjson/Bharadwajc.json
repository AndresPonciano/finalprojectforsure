{"title": "Polarized positrons and electrons at the linear collider\n", "abstract": " The proposed International Linear Collider (ILC) is well-suited for discovering physics beyond the Standard Model and for precisely unraveling the structure of the underlying physics. The physics return can be maximized by the use of polarized beams. This report shows the paramount role of polarized beams and summarizes the benefits obtained from polarizing the positron beam, as well as the electron beam. The physics case for this option is illustrated explicitly by analyzing reference reactions in different physics scenarios. The results show that positron polarization, combined with the clean experimental environment provided by the linear collider, allows to improve strongly the potential of searches for new particles and the identification of their dynamics, which opens the road to resolve shortcomings of the Standard Model. The report also presents an overview of possible designs for polarizing both beams at\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "374\n", "authors": ["1048"]}

The photoinjector consists of a 9.3 GHz 4.5 cell standing-wave RF cavity that is constructed from 2 halves. The halves are brazed together, with the braze joint bisecting the irises and cells, greatly simplifying its construction. The cathode is brazed onto this assembly. RF power is coupled into the cavity through inline circular waveguide using a demountable TM01 mode launcher. The mode launcher feeds the power through 4 ports distributed azimuthally to eliminate both dipole and quadrupole field distortions. The brazed-in cathode and absence of complex power coupler result in a very inexpensive yet high performance device. The clean design allows the RF cavity to sit entirely within the solenoid assembly. The cathode gradient is 120 MV/m at 3 MW of input power. The cathode cell is just 0.17 RF wavelength so that laser arrival phase for peak acceleration is 70 degrees from zero crossing resulting in exit energy of 4 MeV.

The physics return can be maximized by the use of polarized beams. This report shows the paramount role of polarized beams and summarizes the benefits obtained from polarizing the positron beam, as well as the electron beam. The physics case for this option is illustrated explicitly by analyzing reference reactions in different physics scenarios. The results show that positron polarization, combined with the clean experimental environment provided by the linear collider, allows to improve strongly the potential of searches for new particles and the identification of their dynamics, which opens the road to resolve shortcomings of the Standard Model. The report also presents an overview of possible designs for polarizing both beams at the ILC, as well as for measuring their polarization", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1048"]}

{"title": "A Proposal to Investigate the Formation of Charmonium States Using the Pbar Accumulator Ring\n", "abstract": " The exclusive formation of bound cc states in pp collisions was observed in a recent experiment (l)(R704) at the CERN ISR, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of using the pp reaction as a means of measuring the mass and width of states of charmonium which are not directly accessible to electron-positron colliders. The success of the experiment was due to the use of a novel method for obtaining a high luminosity antiproton annihilation source with excellent definition of the initial state energy. This was accomplished by letting a continuously transversely and longitudinally cooled antiproton beam, stored in ring 2 of the ISR, interact with a high density H2 gas jet target crossing the ISR vacuum pipe. This setup featured both a very small interaction volume and a beam with good momentum definition and small transverse emittance, even after many hours of operation. We propose to study the properties of charmonium states in a pp formation experiment in the Fermilab Accumulator Ring using the same method that some of us used at the ISR. The Fermilab Accumulator Ring and its associated cooling systems will make it possible to do a vastly superior experiment than the exploratory experiment done at the ISR. The reasons for the improvement are:1. The stored antiproton current will be a factor of five greater than was typically achieved at the ISR. In addition, the accumulation rate of antiprotons will be-10 11 antiprotons/hour vs.-10 11 antiprotons in 12 hours. These differences will lead to a significantly higher integrated luminosity.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1048"]}

Further timing control is accomplished by shifting the phase of the bunches stored in the damping rings before extraction while leaving the phase of the PEP-II stored beam unchanged.

The electron beam producing the bremsstrahlung X-ray beam is usually directed approximately to the center of the container, concentrating the highest X-ray intensity to that area. Other parts of the container are exposed to lower radiation levels due to the large drop-off of the bremsstrahlung radiation intensity as a function of angle, especially for high energies (>6 MV).

It should be noted that the threshold displacement energy for defect production of Titanium as measured experimentally is between 21 and 30 eV [3]. We used a value of 25eV. This is a much lower value than for the case of W-alloys (90 eV) which implies a larger defect production for the same deposited energy in the case of Titanium.

Three targets are required to avoid excessive thermal stresses in the targets. Energy deposition from each beam pulse occurs over 265 nanoseconds and results in heating of the target and pressure pulses straining the material. The rapid power deposition of the electron beam and the resultant temperature profile in the target generates stress and pressure waves in the material that are considerably larger than those calculated by a static analysis. The 6.22 GeV electron beam has a spot radius size of 3 mm and results in a maximum temperature jump of 147 C.

Tune shift with intensity was observed, and there is evidence for an increase in bunch motion along an injected bunch train.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1048"]}

{"title": "Multibunch operation in the Tevatron Collider\n", "abstract": " The Tevatron Collider at Fermilab is the world's highest energy hadron collider, colliding protons with antiprotons at a center of mass energy of 1800 GeV. At present six proton bunches collide with six antiproton bunches to generate luminosities of up to 9/spl times/10/sup 30/ cm/sup -2/ s/sup -1/. It is estimated that to reach luminosities significantly greater than 10/sup 31/ cm/sup -2/ s/sup -1/ while minimizing the number of interactions per crossing, the number of bunches will have to be increased. Thirty-six bunch operation looks like the most promising plan. This paper looks at the strategies for increasing the number of particle bunches, the new hardware that needs to be designed and changes to the operating mode in filling the Tevatron. An interactive program which simulates the filling of the Tevatron collider is also presented.

{"title": "Coupled bunch dipole mode measurements of accelerating beam in the Fermilab Booster\n", "abstract": " Absfract--The dipole oscillation of a coupled bunch mode is measured using a fast single shot digitizing oscilloscope. The phase centroid of the bunches is determined from the digitized waveform. The phase error of the bunches as a function of bunch number is then Fourier analyzed which provides the coupled bunch mode spectrum. The resulting spectrum is used to determine the evolution of coupled bunch mode instabilities in the Fermilab Booster. This method can determine the coupled bunch mode spectrum in a single turn in contrast to frequency domain methods which take at least a full synchrotron period to complete the measurement.I. NI-R~ DUCTION The Fermilab Booster accelerates protons from 200 MeV to 8 GeV in 33.3 milliseconds. Coupled bunch oscillations occur when the intensity of the Booster reaches 1~ 10~~ protons. While these oscillations are not a problem under the present operating conditions, the intensity in the Booster after the Fermilab Linac upgrade is completed is expected to be 5~ 10~~ protons. With these intensities, the coherent motion of the bunches within the RF buckets causes a dilution of the longitudinal emittance. The dilution occurs primarily because of the unpredictable position of the bunches relative to the RF voltage when the beam is transfered from the Booster to the Main Ring. Presently, there is an effort to build longitudinal dampers that reduce the coupled bunch mode oscillations [11. The Booster RF frequency swings from 30 MHz to 53 Mhz. The RF frequency slew rate has a maximum of 3 MlIz/mS at the beginning of the acceleration cycle and is about 200 kHz/mS midway through the cycle.
