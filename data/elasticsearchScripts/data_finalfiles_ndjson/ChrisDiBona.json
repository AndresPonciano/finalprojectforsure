{"title": "Open sources: Voices from the open source revolution\n", "abstract": " Freely available source code, with contributions from thousands of programmers around the world: this is the spirit of the software revolution known as Open Source. Open Source has grabbed the computer industry's attention. Netscape has opened the source code to Mozilla; IBM supports Apache; major database vendors haved ported their products to Linux. As enterprises realize the power of the open-source development model, Open Source is becoming a viable mainstream alternative to commercial software. Now in Open Sources, leaders of Open Source come together for the first time to discuss the new vision of the software industry they have created. The essays in this volume offer insight into how the Open Source movement works, why it succeeds, and where it is going. For programmers who have labored on open-source projects, Open Sources is the new gospel: a powerful vision from the movement's spiritual leaders. For businesses integrating open-source software into their enterprise, Open Sources reveals the mysteries of how open development builds better software, and how businesses can leverage freely available software for a competitive business advantage. The contributors here have been the leaders in the open-source arena: Brian Behlendorf (Apache) Kirk McKusick (Berkeley Unix) Tim O'Reilly (Publisher, O'Reilly & Associates) Bruce Perens (Debian Project, Open Source Initiative) Tom Paquin and Jim Hamerly (mozilla. org, Netscape) Eric Raymond (Open Source Initiative) Richard Stallman (GNU, Free Software Foundation, Emacs) Michael Tiemann (Cygnus Solutions) Linus Torvalds (Linux) Paul Vixie (Bind) Larry\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1089\n", "authors": ["867"]}
{"title": "Open sources 2.0: The continuing evolution\n", "abstract": " Open Sources 2.0 is a collection of insightful and thought-provoking essays from today's technology leaders that continues painting the evolutionary picture that developed in the 1999 book Open Sources: Voices from the Revolution. These essays explore open source's impact on the software industry and reveal how open source concepts are infiltrating other areas of commerce and society. The essays appeal to a broad audience: the software developer will find thoughtful reflections on practices and methodology from leading open source developers like Jeremy Allison and Ben Laurie, while the business executive will find analyses of business strategies from the likes of Sleepycat co-founder and CEO Michael Olson and Open Source Business Conference founder Matt Asay. From China, Europe, India, and Brazil we get essays that describe the developing world's efforts to join the technology forefront and use open source to take control of its high tech destiny. For anyone with a strong interest in technology trends, these essays are a must-read. The enduring significance of open source goes well beyond high technology, however. At the heart of the new paradigm is network-enabled distributed collaboration: the growing impact of this model on all forms of online collaboration is fundamentally challenging our modern notion of community. What does the future hold? Veteran open source commentators Tim O'Reilly and Doc Searls offer their perspectives, as do leading open source scholars Steven Weber and Sonali Shah.

Calif\n", "abstract": " When I started working at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab in 1971, I became part of a software-sharing community that had existed for many years. Sharing of software was not limited to our particular community; it is as old as computers, just as sharing of recipes is as old as cooking. But we did it more than most.The AI Lab used a time-sharing operating system called ITS (the Incompatible Timesharing System) that the Labss staff hackers [1] had designed and written in assembler language for the Digital PDP-10, one of the large computers of the era. As a member of this community, an AI Lab staff system hacker, my job was to improve this system.", "num_citations": "25\n", "authors": ["867"]}
{"title": "Open source and proprietary software development\n", "abstract": " Before you go any further, throw off any notion that the proprietary developer is somehow a different person from the open source developer. It is uncommon for a member of the open source developer community to do only open source for a living. Only the most prominent, or loaded, members of the open source community come close to having this kind of freedom. It is indeed rare to find a developer who develops only with proprietary tools and libraries. Even Visual C++ and C# developers benefit from a great variety of code and libraries that are free for use in their programs. 1My career has focused on open source development for the last 10 years, and I\u2019m constantly pleasantly surprised by how open source development and proprietary resemble each other. I believe this is because proprietary developers are educated by the adventures of their slightly crazy open source cousins, but I also know that open source developers have learned just as much from proprietary developers.", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["867"]}
{"title": "OSS in India\n", "abstract": " Three earlier revolutions using collaboration have dramatically improved the basic infrastructure within the country. The first revolution was called the Green Revolution, which started in the 1970s and took India from being a grain deficit to a grain surplus country. The second revolution, in the 1980s, was the White Revolution, which used the power of dairy cooperatives to enable large-scale milk production. Not only could India\u2019s own population be satisfied, India also became an exporter of dairy products. The third revolution, in the 1990s, was the Gray Revolution, which used India\u2019s plethora of English-speaking engineers and scientists to capture a significant share of the world\u2019s outsourcing business in software and pharmaceuticals.", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["867"]}

{"title": "Open source biology\n", "abstract": " Open source software (OSS) has played a central role in the growth of the Internet and increases in economic importance each year. It has rapidly changed the face of computing, with server side companies like Sun Microsystems, to end-user companies such as Adobe, to full platform/service companies like IBM incorporating open source into their offerings. With this success, open source is poised to diversify its influence. One experiment is open source biology (OSB), the idea that biological products such as drugs, vaccines, or pest-resistant crops, can be developed using open intellectual property (IP) models.Academic science, like open source, supports the belief that knowledge evolves best when ideas, data, and methods are freely shared, and each contributor can build on the works of others. Universities have housed and promoted scientific thought for more than 1,000 years, creating a public commons. In contrast, alchemy is the forerunner of modern business. Today, with academic research a valuable economic good, weighing the societal benefits of freeing or protecting IP is a pressing challenge. In no scientific discipline is this more important than biology, central to all living things.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["867"]}

{"title": "When China dances with OSS\n", "abstract": " One of the key challenges for China\u2019s Information and Communication Technology (ICT) industry is to ensure that China has the right software solutions to support usage models and value requirements. The advent of open source software (OSS), along with its business model with respect to intellectual property and value proposition, brings this business force to the fast-growing software industry in China. That, in turn, will provide an opportunity for the OSS community to promote and popularize this model throughout the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). This chapter analyzes how OSS has developed in China and where it is heading.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["867"]}
