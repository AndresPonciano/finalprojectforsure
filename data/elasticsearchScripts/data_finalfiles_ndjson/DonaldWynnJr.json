{"title": "Guidelines for Conducting Critical Realist Case Study Research in Information Systems\n", "abstract": " Critical realism is emerging as a viable philosophical paradigm for conducting social science research, and has been proposed as an alternative to the more prevalent paradigms of positivism and interpretivism. Few papers, however, have offered clear guidance for applying this philosophy to actual research methodologies. Under critical realism, a causal explanation for a given phenomenon is inferred by explicitly identifying the means by which structural entities and contextual conditions interact to generate a given set of events. Consistent with this view of causality, we propose a set of methodological principles for conducting and evaluating critical realism-based explanatory case study research within the information systems field. The principles are derived directly from the ontological and epistemological assumptions of critical realism. We demonstrate the utility of each of the principles through examples drawn\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "726\n", "authors": ["910"]}

Corporations own their brands and unilaterally determine their positioning and evolution. Power and control are centralized and hierarchical: producers produce brands, which customers then consume. With OS, power and control are radically decentralized and heterarchical: producers and consumers coalesce into \u201cprosumers.\u201d The authors introduce marketers to the OS phenomenon and develop a typology of brand aspects that can be \u201copen\u201d or \u201cclosed\u201d: physical, textual, meaning, and experience. The authors elaborate new dimensions for brands and revisit the functions that brands perform and link these to the evolutionary trajectory of branding, arguing that OS represents a final phase in the evolution of corporate brands from closed to open brands.

We use partial least squares (PLS) structural equation modelling to analyse survey data from 164 US hospitals at different stages of EA maturity.

This article uses two established frameworks to describe the growth of JBoss and its associated ecosystem. It also explores the four strategic risks that face every firm: demand risk, innovation risk, inefficiency risk, and scale risk. We believe the emergence of POS has eight lessons for IS leaders:(1) the cost of running an IS unit will decline,(2) software innovation and quality should improve,(3) benign POS monopolies might emerge,(4) IS units might become less dependent on a single POS support provider,(5) POS will escalate,(6) IS leaders will experience pressures from outside the IS unit to adopt POS,(7) IS units will develop an open source strategy, and (8) traditional software companies will be forced to adapt.", "num_citations": "44\n", "authors": ["910"]}

However, security professionals will readily admit that without safe practices by users, no amount or type of technology will be effective at preventing unauthorized intrusions.

The model is tested empirically based on a sample of 237 Indian professionals. The results of the empirical study indicate general support for the model, particularly including severity, susceptibility, benefits, and a cue to action as antecedents to the intention to perform preventive information security behaviors.

This is especially salient for open source software, as the contributions are predominantly voluntary. In this study, an ecosystems metaphor is applied from the fields of ecology and human ecology to develop an understanding of the relationships and capital flows that enable the health and sustainability of these technological networks. A healthy ecosystem is defined as one in which the members are able to achieve sufficient returns to both satisfy their needs and encourage continued contributions. Using a case study of particular incidents occurring within professional open source ecosystems, this study attempts to identify the generative mechanisms, antecedent factors, and structural means by which ecosystem health evolves despite the myriad stresses they experience. The data collection via interviews, field observations, and archival data focuses on the circulation, transformation, and accumulation of capital associated with the response to these stresses. In so doing, this research develops a more complete means of assessing not only the health, but also the potential value of participating in these ecosystems.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["910"]}

Hence, it is reasonable to expect that information security would receive an equally significant emphasis in the education of future systems professionals. A variety of security standards that various entities (eg, NIST, COSO, ISACA-COBIT, ISO) have put forth emphasize the importance of information security from the very beginning of the system development lifecycle (SDLC) to avoid significant redesign in later phases. To determine the emphasis on security in typical systems analysis and design (SA&D) courses, we examine (1) to what extent security is emphasized in the core SA&D courses and (2) at what phase in the SDLC do most SA&D courses begin to emphasize security. In order to address these questions, we reviewed SA&D textbooks currently on the market to identify how extensively they cover security-related issues. Given the fairly high awareness of information security in practice, we expected to see an equally high emphasis on such matters in the textbooks. However, our review suggests that this is not the case, which suggests a gap in our preparation. To address this gap, we offer a proposal for modifying a portion of the SA&D curricula.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["910"]}
