The problem arises since decision makers (1) cannot blindly trust the service or its provider, and (2) ignore the environment within which the service is operating. The fact that no security mechanism is applicable in such a completely open environment, where identities can be easily generated and discarded makes social approaches such as trust and reputation models appealing to apply in the world of Web services. This survey classifies and compares the main findings that contributed in solving problems related to trust and reputation in the context of Web services. First, a high-level classification scheme partitions Web services into three main architectures: single, composite, and communities.

It is related to the dynamics of agent interactions and to the way of connecting individual acts while building complete conversations. Semantics is interested in the meaning of these acts. It lays down the foundation for a concise and unambiguous meaning of agent messages. This framework aims at solving three main problems of agent communication: 1- The absence of a link between the pragmatics and the semantics. 2- The inflexibility of current agent communication protocols. 3- The verification of agent communication mechanisms. The main contributions of this thesis are: 1- A formal pragmatic approach based on social commitments and arguments. 2- A new agent communication formalism called Commitment and Argument Network. 3- A logical model defining the semantics of the elements used in the pragmatic approach. 4- A tableau-based model checking technique for the verification of a kind of flexible protocols called dialogue game protocols. 5- A new persuasion dialogue game protocol. The main idea of our pragmatic approach is that agent communication is considered as actions that agents perform on social commitments and arguments. The dynamics of agent conversation is represented by this notion of actions and by the evolution of these commitments and arguments.

{"title": "Scheduling reputation maintenance in agent-based communities using game theory\n", "abstract": " In agent-based systems, agents can be organized within groups, called communities, where mem-bers are providing similar or complementary services. An example of such systems is agent-based communities of web services, where web services are abstracted as rational agents and empowered with decision making capabilities and can interact with each other. Managing reputation of each agent and of the whole community is a key issue towards securing this type of systems, where a con-troller agent is designed to observe and check the behavior of each member to update and maintain the system\u2019s reputation. Scheduling the check (i.e. maintenance) by deciding about the moments where the check has to be done is still an open problem. Because it is highly expensive, maintenance cannot be done every moment or based on small history of agents\u2019 behaviors. We propose in this thesis a scheduling algorithm that helps the controller agent improve the quality of the reputation mechanism, which increases the trust value of users toward the community. The proposed algorithm is based on a class of games called Bayesian Stackelberg. Our Bayesian Stackelberg game is designed between the controller agent and community members. We simulate and compare the efficiency of our algorithm with other stochastic techniques, namely uniform, normal and Poisson distributions.

These protocols are specified as transition systems in which transitions are labeled with communicative acts. Our underlying logic (SCCTL*) used to specify the properties to be verified extends CTL* by adding action formulae, the actions we deal with are actions that agents perform on social commitments when communicating. The verification method is based on the translation of SCCTL* formulae into a variant of alternating tree automata called alternating Buchi tableau automata (ABTA). Our algorithm explores the product graph of the protocol and the ABTA representing the formula to be verified. The nodes of the product graph are signed according to the type of the formula (with or without negation). We propose a set of tableau inference rules for specifying the translation\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1644"]}

In distributed systems, service consumers identify pools of service providers that offer similar functionalities. Therefore, the selection task is mostly influenced by the non-functional requirements of the consumers captured by a varied number of QoS metrics.

We compute the trustworthiness of web services based on probability theory by exploiting two statistical distributions, namely, Dirichlet and generalized Dirichlet, which represent the distributions of the outcomes of multidimensional correlated QoS metrics. We employ the Dirichlet and generalized Dirichlet when the QoS metrics are positively or negatively correlated, respectively. Experimental results endorse the advantageous capability of our model in capturing the correlation among QoS metrics and estimating the trustworthiness and reputation of service providers.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1644"]}

An original characteristic of this framework is that agents can use this strategic reasoning together with a tactic reasoning to persist in the achievement of their goals by considering alternatives depending on a set of constraints. Tactic reasoning is responsible of selecting the communicative acts to perform in order to realize the strategic goals. Some constraints are fixed when the conversation starts and others during the dialogue progress.

Our semantics differs from the previous proposals in which the operations used to manipulate commitments (eg creation, fulfillment, violation, withdrawn, etc.) have always been defined as axioms or constrains on top of the commitment semantics. The advantage of this logical model is to gather the direct semantics of these operations and the semantics of social commitments (propositional and conditional) within the same framework. Furthermore, this paper proposes a new definition of assignment and delegation operations by looking at the content of the assigned and delegated commitment that could be different from the content of the original commitment in terms of deadline.

Unlike existent approaches that address social commitments within the scope of agent to agent, our approach considers commitments among multiple agents as well. In particular, we introduce a new logic called the probabilistic logic of knowledge and commitment (PCTLkc+). The logic we introduce combines a logic of knowledge and commitment (CTLKC+) with a probabilistic branching-time logic (PCTL). We then extend the resulting logic by adding further operators for the group knowledge and group commitment so that different flavors of the interaction between the two concepts can be nicely captured and reasoned about. A major contribution of this paper is the semantics of group social commitment, which has not been considered in the literature. Target systems are modeled using a new extended version of interpreted systems, a popular formal framework that models the communication between interacting agents and accounts for the uncertainty in MASs. The advancement of the proposed logic over existing logics lies in its expressiveness power that allows one to not only express knowledge and social commitments independently, but also express combinations between them in the presence of uncertainty when the scope of interacting agents goes beyond two.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1644"]}

The aim of the workshop on Declarative Agent Languages and Technologies (DALT 2009), in its seventh edition this year, is to achieve this goal, which needs developing and using advanced declarative technologies and languages, particularly agent programming, communication languages, and reasoning and decision-making mechanisms. Developing these technologies is a particularly challenging issue from many perspectives: formal foundations, practical feasibility, degree of flexibility, etc. In this context, the declarative paradigm is arguably the most appropriate as unlike imperative approaches, the focus is on what the solution should accomplish rather than on describing how to accomplish it. This is because agent computing, as a paradigm, is about describing the logic of computation instead of describing how to accomplish it. DALT is about investigating, studying, and using the declarative paradigm as well as combining declarative and formal approaches with engineering and technology aspects of agents and multi-agent systems.This volume presents the latest developments in the area of declarative languages and technologies, which aim to provide rigorous frameworks for designing, specifying, implementing and verifying autonomous interacting agents.

To achieve this vision, we propose a novel game theoretical model, which consists of a mix of cooperative and competitive strategies. The players of the game are the big data service providers, cloud computing platform, and cloud users. The strategies of the players are modeled using the two-sided market theory that takes into consideration the network effects among involved parties, while integrating the externalities between the cloud resources and consumer demands into the design of the game.

In this paper, we address this limitation from the logical and model checking perspectives. We start by constructing a logical language to represent the quantitative aspect of trust called TCTLG. In particular, we extend the logic of trust TCTL to incorporate degrees of trust. Moreover, we develop a symbolic model checking algorithm for quantifying the relationships among the interacting agents.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1644"]}
{"title": "Model-Based Verification and Testing Methodology for Safety-Critical Airborne Systems\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we address the issue of safety-critical software verification and testing that are key requirements for achieving DO-331 and DO-178C regulatory compliance for airborne systems. Formal verification and testing are considered two different activities within the airborne standards and they belong to two different levels in avionics software development cycle. The objective is to integrate model-based verification and model-based testing within one framework and to capture the benefits of their cross-fertilization. It is achieved by proposing a methodology for the verification and testing of parallel communicating agents based on formal models. The results of formal verification and testing can be used as evidence for certification.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1644"]}
{"title": "Dynamic peer-to-peer amplifier system used in agent-based intelligent tutoring system\n", "abstract": " Peer-to-peer tutoring in high schools are increasingly used to model a dynamic learning environment where students can effectively teach and learn by improving self-regulatory skills. We propose a dynamic peer-to-peer amplifier system in the form of a mathematical framework for a recommender system that addresses the problem of formulating response phrases for the tutoring considering the underlying sequence of possible phrases. Ultimately, using the recommended phrases, the peer tutor becomes more professional in teaching math problems to peer students. The main advantage of the proposed model is that it is adaptive to the peer student's concentration level and accordingly recommends phrases to the peer tutor while considering the sequence of communication took place in the session combined with the reflection on peer student's concentration level.

{"title": "Verifiable outsourced database in the cloud using game theory\n", "abstract": " In the verifiable database (VDB) model, a computationally weak client (database owner) delegates his database management to a database service provider on the cloud, which is considered untrusted third party, while users can query the data and verify the integrity of query results. Since the process can be computationally costly and has a limited support for sophisticated query types such as aggregated queries, we propose in this paper a framework that helps bridge the gap between security and practicality trade-offs. The proposed framework remodels the verifiable database problem using Stackelberg security game. In the new model, the database owner creates and uploads to the database service provider the database and its authentication structure (AS). Next, the game is played between the defender (verifier), who is a trusted party to the database owner and runs scheduled randomized verifications using\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1644"]}
{"title": "Social Web Services Research Roadmap: Present and Future\n", "abstract": " There is a growing interest in the research and industry communities to examine the possible weaving of social elements into Web services-based applications. This interest is backed by the widespread adoption of Web 2.0 technologies and tools developed using various online means such as social networks and blogs. Social Web services incorporate the result of this weaving and are concerned with establishing relationships with their peers like people do daily. This chapter reviews the recent developments in this new topic and identifies new research opportunities and directions that are still unexplored such as security, engineering, reputation, trust, and argumentation.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1644"]}
{"title": "Online monitoring for sustainable communities of web services\n", "abstract": " Web Services are considered an attracting distributed approach of application/services integration over the Internet. As the number of Web Services is exponentially growing and expected to do so for the next decade, the need for categorizing and/or classifying Web Services is very crucial for their success and the success of the underlying SOA. Categorization aims at systematizing Web Services according to their functionalities and their Quality of Service attributes. Communities of Web Services have been used to connect Web Services based on their functionalities. In this paper, we augment the community approach by defining a new community to monitor Web Services operating in any Web Services community. This will be of prime importance for communities' creators/managers willing to protect and sustain their communities.

{"title": "An agent communication protocol for resolving conflicts.\n", "abstract": " This paper proposes an agent communication protocol specifie as a set of dialogue rules for resolving conflict using assumptionY based argumentation. Arguments are built from a set of rules and assumptions using bacNward deduction. Beyond arguments agents can handle, we propose the notion of partial arguments along with partial acceptability. This protocol merges inquiry and persuaY sion stages and by building and reasoning about partial arguments, agents can jointly fin arguments supporting a new solution for their conflict which is not Nnown by any of them individually.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1644"]}
{"title": "Microscopic analysis of edge creation process in trust-based social networks\n", "abstract": " In last years, online social networks are enjoying drastic increase in their population and connectivity. Meanwhile, trust is known as essential factor in quality of the connections between diverse nodes in the network. To address the efficiency in the interactions of nodes, we propose in this paper a trust-based architecture applicable to maintain interactions in multi-agent-based social network. We provide a detailed discussion over the network formation by taking into account the edge creation factors classified as homophily, confounding and influence. We systematically inspire different involving factors to observe evolution of the network of trust-based interconnections in a microscopic manner. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed model assessment and discuss the system implementation, along with simulations obtained from a number of executions compared with the broadly known frameworks.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1644"]}
{"title": "A Formal Framework of Conversational Goals Based on Strategic Reasoning\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we propose a formal framework of strategic reasoning that agents use when interacting in a dialogue and trying to achieve their conversational goals. Such argumentation-based reasoning enables agents to generate a set of strategic goals depending on a set of constraints. Strategic goals are sub-goals, which are necessary to achieve a conversational goal. Some of these sub-goals are generated at the beginning of the interaction and they can be canceled or substituted by alternatives during the dialogue. An original characteristic of this framework is that it enables agents to persist in the achievement of their goals by considering alternatives and calculating the feasibility of each sub-goal. The set of constraints as well as sub-goals can be set at the beginning or during the dialogue.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1644"]}
