{"title": "Disappearing cryptography: information hiding: steganography and watermarking\n", "abstract": " Cryptology is the practice of hiding digital information by means of various obfuscatory and steganographic techniques. The application of said techniques facilitates message confidentiality and sender/receiver identity authentication, and helps to ensure the integrity and security of computer passwords, ATM card information, digital signatures, DVD and HDDVD content, and electronic commerce. Cryptography is also central to digital rights management (DRM), a group of techniques for technologically controlling the use of copyrighted material that is being widely implemented and deployed at the behest of corporations that own and create revenue from the hundreds of thousands of mini-transactions that take place daily on programs like iTunes. This new edition of our best-selling book on cryptography and information hiding delineates a number of different methods to hide information in all types of digital media files. These methods include encryption, compression, data embedding and watermarking, data mimicry, and scrambling. During the last 5 years, the continued advancement and exponential increase of computer processing power have enhanced the efficacy and scope of electronic espionage and content appropriation. Therefore, this edition has amended and expanded outdated sections in accordance with new dangers, and includes 5 completely new chapters that introduce newer more sophisticated and refined cryptographic algorithms and techniques (such as fingerprinting, synchronization, and quantization) capable of withstanding the evolved forms of attack. Each chapter is divided into sections, first providing an introduction and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "633\n", "authors": ["900"]}

The question is how to create trust in a business environment\u2014the Internet\u2014where people never meet face-to-face, have no physical location or representation, and can vanish into (cyber) space by logging off. The answer, in one word, is cryptography. In order to do business online, it is necessary to identify, authenticate, guarantee against repudiation, and verify individuals and organizations along these dimensions. It is also useful to exchange tokens of value (money). Each of these goals can be approached by embedding certain intriguing algorithms (on which digital encryption is based) in business systems. The introduction reviews the many technical and political challenges faced by a project to create digital media of exchange, including digital cash.

{"title": "Finding convex edge groupings in an image\n", "abstract": " In an image, there are groups of intensity edges that are likely to have resulted from the same convex object in a scene. A new method for identifying such groups is described here. Groups of edges that form a convex polygonal chain, such as a convex polygon or a spiral, are extracted from a set of image edge fragments. A key property of the method is that its output is no more complex than the original image. The method uses a triangulation of the linear edge segments in an image to define a local neighborhood that is scale invariant. From this local neighborhood a local convexity graph is constructed; this encodes which neighboring image edges could be part of a convex group. A path in the graph corresponds to a convex polygonal chain in the image, with a cyclic path corresponding to a polygon. We have implemented the method and found that it is efficient in practice as well as in theory. Examples\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "98\n", "authors": ["900"]}
{"title": "Digital copyright protection\n", "abstract": " Wayner describes how to defend copyrighted material in an age when digital technology makes copying easy and cheap. This book is a guide to watching, tracing, and locking up copyrighted material; it is a necessity for anyone who plans to control copyrighted work in the digital era. The intended readers are publishing executives, programmers, and cryptographers. There are three kinds of chapters in this book. The chapters at the beginning of the book build a foundation of general techniques that can be used with many different algorithms. The second class of chapters deals with specific approaches for copyright protection, including encrypting the data and adding tags. The third group of chapters describes some commercial products. Chapter 1,\u201cCopyright Battles,\u201d introduces the notion of defending copyright in an ear of easy reproduction.

Distance data is produced for each of a number of starting pixels within an image. Each starting pixel meets a criterion, such as an edge pixel or a pixel inside a connected component. Each starting pixel's distance data indicates the distance in each of a number of directions from the starting pixel to another pixel at which the image meets another criterion. For example, to detect skew of lines of text, the distance data can indicate distance from a starting pixel at an edge across white pixels to another edge. To detect dominant typeface, the distance data can indicate distance from a starting pixel at an edge or inside a connected component across black pixels to another edge.

{"title": "Content-addressable search engines and DES-like systems\n", "abstract": " A very simple parallel architecture using a modified version of content-addressable memory (CAM) can be used to cheaply and efficiently encipher and decipher data with DES-like systems. This paper will describe how to implement DES on these modified content-addressable memories at speeds approaching some of the better specialized hardware. This implementation is often much more attractive for system designers because the CAM can be reprogrammed to encrypt the data with other DES-like systems such as Khufu or perform system tasks like data compression or graphics.               The CAM memory architecture is also easily extendable to build a large scale engine for exhaustively searching the entire keyspace. This paper estimates that it will be possible to build a machine to test 255 keys of DES in one day for $30 million.

The number of sampled locations is smaller than the number of locations in the image, but is large enough to achieve a degree of statistical significance. The sampled locations can be selected by obtaining a random or pseudorandom number indicating a candidate location and then applying a criterion to determine whether the candidate location is an appropriate starting point for the measurement.

This direction can be determined by measuring distances from selected pixels at edges of connected components across white pixels to edges of other connected components.

{"title": "Identification of artistic styles using a local statistical metric\n", "abstract": " An algorithm for identifying the artist who created a picture is described. The algorithm relies upon computing the distribution of long and short lines in the image and comparing this distribution. The algorithm is one example of algorithms which can be designed to answer questions about global characteristics. This particular example computes the averages against a precomputed set from model samples. The distribution of line lengths is a statistical characterization which can be used to distinguish between artists. The current implementation is limited to black-and-white binary images. The results of testing the implementation on the daily comics is presented. Some of the related work in both computer science and art history which provides a conceptual background for the algorithm is also discussed.< >", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["900"]}

{"title": "The browser reloaded\n", "abstract": " ONE YEAR AGO, THOMAS LACKNER DIDN'T ASK MUCH OF JavaScript. When he sketched out the architecture to a Web application, he knew he could count on the browser language for \"set-a-cookie hacks\" and for loading images, but he turned to the server side for the heavy lifting. But when Google began launching highly interactive Web sites such as Gmail and Google Suggest, the scales dropped from Lackner's eyes and he saw the opportunity. \"It all clicked in my head the middle of 2004,\" Lackner says. \"I started trying to add AJAX components to every Web app I worked on.\" AJAX is the newly minted acronym encompassing a fresh vision of empowered browsers: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. Before AJAX, Web pages displayed links, forms, and but tons. When a user clicked on a link or a button, the browser sent a message to a distant server asking what to display next. JavaScript would typically be\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["900"]}
{"title": "The be-all-that-you-can-be OS\n", "abstract": " For the first 11/2 years of its existence, BeOS ran only on the multiprocessing BeBox computers with the PowerPC architecture. Now, after an abortive courtship with Apple, Be is releasing an unbundled version of the OS that runs on most Macs with a PowerPC chip, and an Intel version is promised for next year. With the latest version of BeOS, Mac users can create a multi-OS system that makes it relatively easy to switch between operating systems at boot-up time.

{"title": "Agent-enhanced communicator\n", "abstract": " Sony has recently introduced the Magic Link Personal Intelligent Communicator, a penbased tablet which is the first device to use the Magic Cap object-oriented software environment and telescript remote programming languages. The Magic Link is a useful portable computer for managing basic E-mail and other communications. Sony has put all the capabilities that the laws of physics, battery life, and its design budget will allow in the Magic Link. Although the device is attractive and relatively rugged, it is capable of using more memory and a better screen.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["900"]}
{"title": "Automating TCP/IP in NT\n", "abstract": " Microsoft recently announced plans for creating a new set of protocols that would add much of the flexibility of small office LANs to the Internet Protocol (IP) so that companies can grow and evolve their networks quickly and easily. Microsoft will offer two open standards to the Internet community. One, DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), lets computers set up their network addresses on their own without stepping on toes. The other, WINS (Windows-Internet Naming Service), allows computers to publish their names to the world. The combination of these two protocols will allow ordinary machines to automatically establish themselves as clients on an Internet-capable network with much the same ease that they do in systems like AppleTalk.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["900"]}

{"title": "Error-free fractions.\n", "abstract": " Most computer users know their machines can't represent all fractions exactly. Many programmers even know why. Something about finite memory and infinitely repeating decimals.... However, if you're willing to depart from conventional (exponential-base) representation formats, you can store fractions exactly. You can even do exact calculations without fear of dreaded roundoff errors. A Pascal listing presented in this article demonstrates the technique. Unfortunately, rational-number math written in Pascal cannot keep up with highly optimized floating-point code: The computations done in the demonstration program aren't so fast as those done in floating point. But they are exact.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["900"]}
