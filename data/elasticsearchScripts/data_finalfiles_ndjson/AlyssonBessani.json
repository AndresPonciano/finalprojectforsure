BFT-SMART is an open-source Java-based library implementing robust BFT state machine replication. Some of the key features of this library that distinguishes it from similar works (e.g., PBFT and UpRight) are improved reliability, modularity as a first-class property, multicore-awareness, reconfiguration support and a flexible programming interface.

To overcome this limitation, we designed, implemented, and evaluated a BFT ordering service for this system on top of the BFT-SMART state machine replication/consensus library, with optimizations for wide-area deployment.

To fill this gap, we present a by-construction design of a fault-tolerant controller, and materialize it by proposing and formalizing a practical architecture for small to medium-sized networks. A central component of our design is a replicated shared database that stores all network state. Contrary to the more common primary-backup approaches, the proposed design guarantees a smooth transition in case of failures and avoids the need of an additional coordination service.

Byzantine Fault Tolerance has become increasingly appealing as services can be deployed in inexpensive hardware (e.g., cloud environments) and new applications (e.g., blockchain) become more sensitive to malicious behavior. ByzCast has two important characteristics: it was designed to use existing BFT abstractions and it scales with the number of groups, for messages addressed to a single group. We discuss the design of ByzCast and how it can be optimized for particular workloads. Besides proposing a novel atomic\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["527"]}

These systems usually comprise a static set of servers that provide a fault-tolerant read/write register accessed by a set of clients. We consider a dynamic variant of these systems and propose FreeStore, a set of fault-tolerant protocols that emulates a register in dynamic asynchronous systems in which processes are able to join/leave the servers set during the execution. These protocols use a new abstraction called view generators, that captures the agreement requirements of reconfiguration and can be implemented in different system models with different properties. Particularly interesting, we present a reconfiguration protocol that is modular, efficient, consensus-free and loosely coupled with read/write protocols, improving the overall system performance.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["527"]}

To more aptly protect themselves, organizations are moving from reactive to proactive defensive measures. They are investing in cyber threat intelligence (CTI) to provide them forewarning about the risks they face, as well as to accelerate their response times in the detection of attacks. A mean to obtain CTI is the collection of open source intelligence (OSINT) information via threat intelligence platforms and their representation as indicators of compromise (IoC). However, most of these platforms are providing threat information with little to no processing, presenting thus limitations on generating useful quality data. This work presents an approach for improving OSINT processing to generate threat intelligence of quality in the form of enriched IoCs. This improved intelligence is obtained by correlating and combining IoCs coming from different OSINT feeds\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["527"]}

This protocol, which is based on the IP multicast protocol and the MPEG standard, evaluates the necessity of retransmitting lost packets taking into account the capacity of the corresponding MPEG frames to improve the quality of the video stream. The proposed protocol relies on the neighboring receivers for retransmitting lost packets, resulting in much faster recovery, which is vital in order to receive retransmitted packets on time to be exhibited. Besides, this strategy avoids overloading the video source, making it more scalable than the traditional approach of retransmitting from the source. Simulation results presented in this paper show that the proposed protocol delivers video streams to the receivers with a better image quality.Resumo.

{"title": "MJACO: Middleware CORBA para Comunica\u00e7 ao de Grupo\n", "abstract": " Este artigo apresenta um middleware CORBA com suporte para comunica\u00e7ao de grupo baseado nas especifica\u00e7oes UMIOP, padronizada pela OMG [OMG, 2001]. Este middleware permite a difusao de mensagem (ou requisi\u00e7ao) de forma nao confi\u00e1vel ou confi\u00e1vel, implementados pelos protocolos UMIOP e ReMIOP, respectivamente, ambos baseados no protocolo de baixo nivel Multicast IP. O modelo integra\u00e7ao permite que ambos protocolos sejam inseridos no ORB sem alterar as propriedades de portabilidade e interoperabilidade. Al\u00e9m disso, o modelo de programa\u00e7ao segue sem grandes diferen\u00e7as em rela\u00e7 ao ao modelo convencional.Abstract. This paper presents a CORBA middleware that supports group communication based on UMIOP specifications standardized by OMG [OMG, 2001]. This middleware allows multicast message (or request) in a unreliable or reliable manner, implemented by UMIOP and ReMIOP protocols, respectively, both based on low level IP Multicast protocol. The integration model allows both protocols be inserted into ORB without alter the portability and interoperability properties. Furthermore, the programming model seems to be such as the conventional model, without significative differences.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["527"]}
