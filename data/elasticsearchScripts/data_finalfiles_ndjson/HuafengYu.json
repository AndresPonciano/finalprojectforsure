Thanks to its expressive capability, the CCSL allows for the specification of static and dynamic properties, of deterministic and non-deterministic behaviors, or of systems with multiple clock domains. Code generation from such multi-clocked specifications (for the purpose of synthesizing a simulator, for instance) is known to be a difficult issue. We address it by using the approach of controller synthesis. In our framework, a timed CCSL specification is regarded as a property whose satisfaction should be enforced for any UML diagram carrying it as annotation.

Examples of such applications are found in multimedia processing and signal processing. On the one hand, safe design of DIPs is considered to be important due to the need of Quality of Service, safety criticality, etc., in these applications. However, the complexity of current embedded systems makes it difficult to meet this requirement. On the other hand, high-level safe and verifiable control, is highly demanded in order to ensure the correctness and strengthen the flexibility and adaptivity of DIPs. As an answer to this issue, we propose to take advantage of synchronous languages to assist safe DIPs design. First, a synchronous modeling bridges the gap between the Gaspard framework, which is dedicated to SoC design for DIPs, and synchronous languages that act as a model of computation enabling formal validation. The latter, together with their tools, enable high-level validation of Gaspard specifications. Secondly, a reactive extension and improvement to a previous control proposition in Gaspard, is also addressed. This extension is based on mode automata and contributes to conferring safe and verifiable features onto the previous proposition. As a result, model checking and discrete controller synthesis can be applied for the purpose of correctness verification.

This fault-intolerant program is modeled as a finite labeled transition system. We then specify formally a fault hypothesis, i.e., how many sensors can fail simultaneously. We use discrete controller synthesis to obtain automatically a program, having the same behavior as the initial fault-intolerant one, and satisfying the fault tolerance requirements under the fault hypothesis. We advocate that, thanks to the use of discrete controller synthesis, our method offers flexibility, reliability\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["2269"]}
{"title": "Assured Integration of Machine Learning-based Autonomy on Aviation Platforms\n", "abstract": " Dynamic assurance cases (DACs) are a novel concept for the provision of assurance\u2014both during development and, subsequently, continuously in operation\u2014that can be usefully applied to machine learning (ML)-based autonomous systems. We describe the application of a DAC for dependability assurance of an aviation system that integrates ML-based perception to provide an autonomous taxiing capability. Specifically, we present how we: i) formulate and capture risk-based safety and performance objectives, ii) model architectural mechanisms for risk reduction, iii) record the rationale that justifies relying upon autonomy, itself underpinned by heterogeneous items of verification and validation evidence, and iv) develop and integrate a computable notion of confidence that enables a run-time risk assessment and, in turn, dynamic assurance. We also describe our evaluation efforts, currently based on a hardware\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2269"]}
{"title": "Adaptivity in high-performance embedded systems: a reactive control model for reliable and flexible design\n", "abstract": " System adaptivity is increasingly demanded in high-performance embedded systems, particularly in multimedia system-on-chip (SoC), owing to growing quality-of-service requirements. This paper presents a reactive control model that has been introduced in Gaspard, our framework dedicated to SoC hardware/software co-design. This model aims at expressing adaptivity as well as reconfigurability in systems performing data-intensive computations. It is generic enough to be used for description in the different parts of an embedded system, for example, specification of how different data-intensive algorithms can be chosen according to some computation modes at the functional level; and expression of how hardware components can be selected via the usage of a library of intellectual properties according to execution performances. The transformation of this model toward synchronous languages is also presented\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2269"]}
