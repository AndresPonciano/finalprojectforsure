It also provides coarse tracking of body parts, identifying the direction of a pointing hand with a median of 11.2.

This population expansion will be accompanied by a marked increase in patients requiring care for disorders with high prevalence in the elderly. Since cancer incidence increases exponentially with advancing age, it is expected that there will be a surge in older cancer patients that will challenge both healthcare institutions and healthcare professionals. In anticipation of this challenge, researchers at the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio are conducting a series of investigations focused on the intersection of aging and cancer.

{"title": "GUI testing using computer vision\n", "abstract": " Testing a GUI's visual behavior typically requires human testers to interact with the GUI and to observe whether the expected results of interaction are presented. This paper presents a new approach to GUI testing using computer vision for testers to automate their tasks. Testers can write a visual test script that uses images to specify which GUI components to interact with and what visual feedback to be observed. Testers can also generate visual test scripts by demonstration. By recording both input events and screen images, it is possible to extract the images of components interacted with and the visual feedback seen by the demonstrator, and generate a visual test script automatically. We show that a variety of GUI behavior can be tested using this approach. Also, we show how this approach can facilitate good testing practices such as unit testing, regression testing, and test-driven development.", "num_citations": "266\n", "authors": ["11"]}

Patterns are presented that minimize the release of confidential information through remnant and remanent data left on hard drives, in web browsers, and in documents. These patterns are based on a study involving the purchase of 236 hard drives on the secondary market, interviews conducted with organizations whose drives had been acquired, and through a detailed examination of modern web browsers and reports of information leakage in documents. Patterns are presented that enable secure messaging through the adoption of new key management techniques.

We do this without explicitly iterating through every item in the dataset. This is important in crowd-sourced query optimization to support predicate ordering and in query evaluation, when performing a GROUP BY operation with a COUNT or AVG aggregate. We compare sampling item labels, a traditional approach, to showing workers a collection of items and asking them to estimate how many satisfy some predicate.

However, these therapies have multiple undesirable side effects. To bypass the side effects elicited by these conventional treatments, molecularly-targeted therapies are currently in use or under development. Current molecularly-targeted therapies effectively target specific biomarkers, which are commonly overexpressed in lung cancers and can cause increased tumorigenicity. Unfortunately, several molecularly-targeted therapies are associated with initial dramatic responses followed by acquired resistance due to spontaneous mutations or activation of signaling pathways. Acquired resistance to molecularly targeted therapies presents a major clinical challenge in the treatment of lung cancer. Therefore, to address this clinical challenge and to improve lung cancer patient prognosis, we need to understand the mechanism of acquired resistance to current therapies and develop additional novel therapies.

Stereophotogrammetry, defined as topographical mapping measuring volume and area, was found to be reliable and suitable for clinical trial evaluations and for monitoring healing in hospitals or clinics.

{"title": "End-user programming for the web\n", "abstract": " On the desktop, an application can specify its user interface down to the last pixel, but on the World Wide Web, a content provider has little control over how the client will view the page once it has been delivered to the browser. This creates an opportunity for end-users who want to automate and customize their web experiences, but the growing complexity of web pages and standards prevents most users from realizing this opportunity. This thesis describes a programming system named Chickenfoot that enables end-users to automate, customize, and integrate web applications without examining their source code. It accomplishes this by embedding a programming environment directly into the Firefox web browser, where end-users can interactively develop programs that manipulate the interfaces of web pages. The design and implementation of the system's language are described, as well as the results of a user study that influenced the design. A range of applications built using Chickenfoot are also presented.", "num_citations": "49\n", "authors": ["11"]}

{"title": "Localized CCR2 activation in the bone marrow niche mobilizes monocytes by desensitizing CXCR4\n", "abstract": " Inflammatory (classical) monocytes residing in the bone marrow must enter the bloodstream in order to combat microbe infection. These monocytes express high levels of CCR2, a chemokine receptor whose activation is required for them to exit the bone marrow. How CCR2 is locally activated in the bone marrow and how their activation promotes monocyte egress is not understood. Here, we have used double transgenic lines that can visualize CCR2 activation in vivo and show that its chemokine ligand CCL2 is acutely released by stromal cells in the bone marrow, which make direct contact with CCR2-expressing monocytes. These monocytes also express CXCR4, whose activation immobilizes cells in the bone marrow, and are in contact with stromal cells expressing CXCL12, the CXCR4 ligand. During the inflammatory response, CCL2 is released and activates the CCR2 on neighboring monocytes. We demonstrate that acutely isolated bone marrow cells co-express CCR2 and CXCR4, and CCR2 activation desensitizes CXCR4. Inhibiting CXCR4 by a specific receptor antagonist in mice causes CCR2-expressing cells to exit the bone marrow in absence of inflammatory insults. Taken together, these results suggest a novel mechanism whereby the local activation of CCR2 on monocytes in the bone marrow attenuates an anchoring signalling provided by CXCR4 expressed by the same cell and mobilizes the bone marrow monocyte to the blood stream. Our results also provide a generalizable model that cross-desensitization of chemokine receptors fine-tunes cell mobility by integrating multiple chemokine signals.", "num_citations": "44\n", "authors": ["11"]}

{"title": "Widespread neonatal brain damage following calcium channel blockade\n", "abstract": " An abundance of evidence exists that shows calcium channel blockade promotes injury in cultured neurons. However, few studies have addressed the in vivo toxicity of such agents. We now show that the L-type calcium channel antagonist nimodipine promotes widespread and robust injury throughout the neonatal rat brain, in an age-dependent manner. Using both isolated neuronal as well as brain slice approaches, we address mechanisms behind such injury. These expanded studies show a consistent pattern of injury using a variety of agents that lower intracellular calcium. Collectively, these observations indicate that postnatal brain development represents a transitional period for still developing neurons, from being highly sensitive to reductions in intracellular calcium to being less vulnerable to such changes. These observations directly relate to current therapeutic strategies targeting neonatal brain injury.", "num_citations": "40\n", "authors": ["11"]}
{"title": "Critical analysis of local constitutive models for slip and decohesion\n", "abstract": " Many problems in the modelling of materials call for a synthesis of approaches used at both the atomistic and the continuum levels. One notable implementation of this type of strategy is in the construction of local constitutive relations which serve to provide a microscopic underpinning for the energetics of phenomena ranging from interfacial debonding to dislocation nucleation. The need for atomistics in the formulation of such local constitutive approaches is twofold; first, atomistics can serve as the basis of the constitutive phenomenology itself; secondly, atomistics can be used to make quantitative tests of the assumptions which underlie the continuum framework. The present work demonstrates this strategy through the examples of two types of continuum models: the Peierls framework used in the analysis of dislocation nucleation in solids and the type of model used to describe interfacial debonding.

The objective of this study was to develop a model to identify and examine specific histologic changes associated with tissue expansion and irradiation. Rectangular 50-cc silicone tissue expanders were placed subcutaneously over the midline dorsum of 18 adult New Zealand white rabbits. Preoperative radiographic dosimetry demonstrated that the radiation portal was away from vital intraabdominal structures. The expanders were inflated with 10 cc of saline every other day for a total of 80 cc. Expanders were left in place for 2 to 3 weeks to allow fibrovascular capsule formation. The rabbits were then divided into three groups (six rabbits per group), each receiving one of three nonfractionated doses of radiation (20, 25, or 35 Gy). Half of the expanded skin was irradiated using a single dose, and the other half served as a nonirradiated control. Capsules and skin were harvested 6 weeks after the delivery of radiation, allowing the beginning of chronic radiation changes to occur. Using hematoxylin and eosin staining, histomorphometric analysis was performed. The data were analyzed using Student's test. Although irradiation did not affect dermal thickness, it did cause a statistically significant increase in epidermal thickness. At 20, 25, and 35 Gy the increase in epidermal thickness was 43, 90, and 130 percent, respectively.

A partially completed user interface continuation can be saved as a new command, much as currying and partially evaluating a function with a set of parameters produces a new function.

{"title": "Crown-pillar risk assessment-planning aid for cost-effective mine closure remediation\n", "abstract": " In many countries mines are now required to file closure plans and post bonds for decommissioning. Establishing whether the remediation of specific surface hazards arising from mining activity is necessary in a given situation is not always straightforward. In consequence, particularly because of the high cost of closure requirements, considerable interest is being focused on improving methods of assessing the stability of surface crown pillars. Even with such improvements, however, it is not always a simple matter to determine the most appropriate and cost-effective remediation method for a particular surface crown pillar. Some simple probabilistic approaches to the characterization of a crown-pillar rock mass are suggested to assist in determining the risk of crown-pillar failure by reference to previous experience. An outline is then given of methods for rationalizing the selection of optimum remediation solutions based on the use of risk-based decision matrices for the quantification and comparison of costs.Establishing whether remediation is necessary to ensure the long-term stability of surface crown pillars over still active or abandoned near-surface stapes in hard rock mines presents a particular challenge for mine closure planning. Decisionmaking is frequently complicated simply by the difficulty of assessing the stability of the crowns as they are usually weathered and are also often covered by overburden. An attempt to assign a single factor of safety for the unique set of dimensions and properties of a particular crown pillar is generally not valid.

{"title": "Community clustering: Leveraging an academic crowd to form coherent conference sessions\n", "abstract": " Creating sessions of related papers for a large conference is a complex and time-consuming task. Traditionally, a few conference organizers group papers into sessions manually. Organizers often fail to capture the affinities between papers beyond created sessions, making incoherent sessions difficult to fix and alternative groupings hard to discover. This paper proposes committeesourcing and authorsourcing approaches to session creation (a specific instance of clustering and constraint satisfaction) that tap into the expertise and interest of committee members and authors for identifying paper affinities. During the planning of ACM CHI'13, a large conference on human-computer interaction, we recruited committee members to group papers using two online distributed clustering methods. To refine these paper affinities\u0393\u00c7\u00f6and to evaluate the committeesourcing methods against existing manual and automated approaches\u0393\u00c7\u00f6we recruited authors to identify papers that fit well in a session with their own. Results show that authors found papers grouped by the distributed clustering methods to be as relevant as, or more relevant than, papers suggested through the existing in-person meeting. Results also demonstrate that communitysourced results capture affinities beyond sessions and provide flexibility during scheduling.", "num_citations": "32\n", "authors": ["11"]}

Whether they then become symptomatic or are an incidental finding on a chest radiograph obtained for unrelated reasons, these anomalies may appear as masses or contour abnormalities on chest radiographs. The purpose ofthis pictorial essay is to illustrate congenital anomalies that may mimic intrathoracic neoplastic disease in the adult. Familiarity with these entities is essential for proper diagnostic evaluation.Congenital Vascular Anomalies Important radiographic features that help distinguish vascular anomalies from neoplastic processes include contiguity with a known vas-cular structure, smooth margination, periph-eral calcification, and absence of adjacent parenchymal reaction [I 1. These anomalies may cause central mediastinal contour disturbances or, alternatively, may mimic intraparenchymal lesions.", "num_citations": "32\n", "authors": ["11"]}

{"title": "Fiber optic rate gyros as replacements for mechanical gyros\n", "abstract": " Fiber optic gyroscopes are beginning to replace mechanical gyroscopes in both new design and existing applications. The high reliability, absence of \u0393\u00c7\u00a3g\u0393\u00c7\u00a5 sensitivity, and high tolerance for shock and vibration make optical gyroscopes ideal for mobile and military tactical applications. Based on the Sagnac interferometer effect, as is the Ring Laser Gyroscope, the Fiber Optic Gyroscope (FOG) concept is almost 20 years old. Both closed loop and open loop configurations exist, but due to high cost of the former, only open loop configurations are currently being used to replace mechanical rate gyros. We have developed a series of inexpensive FOGs, based on an all-fiber concept using elliptical-core polarization maintaining fiber, directional coupler (s) and polarizer.Open-loop FOGs are constructed in accordance with the \u0393\u00c7\u00a3minimum configuration\u0393\u00c7\u00a5 concept, such that the laser light traverses the fiber sensing coil in opposite directions, and in a reciprocal manner. Early versions of such gyros utilized a directional coupler to isolate the laser source and photodetector, a polarizer to ensure single mode propagation, and a second coupler to interface with the coil. A piezoelectric phase modulator at one end of the coil imposes an optical modulation permitting synchronous detection of the interferometer output. The source-detector coupler is not part of the minimum configuration, and can be eliminated by employing a photodetector at the back facet of the laser. Many lasers incorporate such a detector to monitor the power output, but since the gyro rotation signal is modulated it can be separated easily from the steady state laser signal.", "num_citations": "31\n", "authors": ["11"]}

{"title": "A type-checking preprocessor for Cilk 2, a multithreaded C language\n", "abstract": " This thesis describes the type-checking, optimizing translator that translates Cilk (a C extension language for multithreaded parallel programming) into C. The Cilk-to-C translator is based on C-to-C, a tool I developed that parses, type checks, analyzes, and regenerates a C program. With a translator based on C-to-C, developers and users of C extension languages can enjoy the benefits of a type-checking, optimizing compiler without the attendant development and porting costs. Like a compiler, the Cilk-to-C translator runs quickly, does static checking, and generates efficient code, making it fit for everyday use by ordinary programmers. Unlike a compiler, however, the Cilk-to-C translator is easy to develop, extend, and port to other platforms. About 90% of the development effort was devoted to Cilk semantics (translating Cilk into C), which is where a language developer wants to focus. Only a small amount of work was spent extending C-to-C's parsing, type checking, and data-flow analysis to recognize Cilk. In return for a few weeks of full-time effort, I obtained a type-checking, optimizing translator for Cilk that targets any platform with an ANSI C compiler. With C-to-C, other C extension language developers can obtain the same benefits.C-to-C has a number of special features that make it a good framework for C extension language translators. First, its C output is human-readable, so that a language developer or programmer can read and debug it. C-to-C also provides operational transparency (reproducing nonsyntactic source features like line numbering and indentation), which contributes to the readability and portability of its C output and\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "30\n", "authors": ["11"]}

Currently, several therapeutics have been developed that directly target telomerase and telomeres, such as telomerase inhibitors and G-quadruplex stabilizing ligands. Telomere-specific oligonucleotides that reduce telomerase activity and disrupt telomere architecture are also in development as novel anticancer therapeutics. Specifically, GRN163L and T-oligos have demonstrated promising anticancer activity in multiple cancers types via induction of potent DNA damage responses. Currently, several miRNAs have been implicated in the regulation of telomerase activity and may prove to be valuable targets in the development of novel therapies by reducing expression of telomerase subunits. Targeting miRNAs that are known to increase expression of telomerase subunits may be another strategy to reduce carcinogenesis.

Our results show that the much smaller TCP ACKpackets consume channel resource comparable to the much longer data packets, over high-speed connections. Motivated by this understanding, we reformulate and enhance an existing idea for improving TCP performance by further lowering the number of control packets.

Twenty-three studies were performed in 23 patients and the results of 99Tcm-anti-granulocyte imaging were compared with the definitive microbiological or cytological diagnosis. Twenty-one patients had an infective cause of pyrexia, one patient had disseminated lymphoma and one Kaposi sarcoma. 99Tcm-anti-granulocyte antibody imaging correctly identified the sites of infection in only five (24%) patients, four of whom had infective colitis (one also had bacterial pneumonia) and one of whom had cellulitis. Sixteen foci of infection were not localized by 99Tcm-anti-granulocyte immunoscintigraphy (false-negative scans). Six of these patients had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia; other diagnoses in this group included bacterial or fungal pneumonia and bacteraemia secondary to line infections. 99Tcm-anti-granulocyte antibody did not accumulate in the patients with disseminated lymphoma and Kaposi sarcoma (true-negative scans). 99Tcm-anti-granulocyte imaging, therefore, appears useful in identifying extrathoracic infection in HIV-1 positive patients.

It is then suggestive for the many-body problem to consider analogous nonseparable problems in three dimensions, and a method for treating a rather general class of them is given. This is illustrated by a discussion of the solution of the Helmholtz equation with Dirichlet conditions for a box containing one or more hard spheres.

In a ring topology, eg, an Ethernet ring topology, there are multiple nodes connected one to another to form a ring. Subtending from the ring network are customer devices that may joined together to form networks, eg, Ethernet networks. Providing only a single connection between a subtending network and the ring network risks isolating the subtending network from the ring network if a fault occurs on the connecting link. Providing two links between a subtending network and the ring network, however, may create an undesirable traffic loop.

{"title": "Consolidation testing of oil sand fine tailings\n", "abstract": " The paper presents the results of several tests performed on a sample of Mature Fine Tailings (MFT) in which the consolidation is induced by seepage forces in the laboratory and by increased gravity level in a geotechnical centrifuge. These tests are particularly suitable for testing soft slurries. The test with seepage forces, the Seepage Induced Consolidation Test (SICT), is used to obtain compressibility and permeability characteristics of the tailings material while the centrifuge modeling test is used to independently verify the obtained properties. The analyses for both tests recognize that the void ratio (solids content) within each sample is variable and no restrictive assumptions are made on the variability of the consolidation properties of the sample.The presented results confirm that the SICT is applicable to the testing of oil sand MFT tailings, and produce repeatable datasets that are useful in building an understanding of the behaviour of these high void ratio materials. While these findings are encouraging, some peculiarities observed in the experiments suggest that more detailed studies will be required before the results could be applied to field conditions with confidence.", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["11"]}

Reptiles and amphibians are not common subjects in enrichment studies yet their demanding captive requirements suggest a need for enclosure diversity and biologically-sound enrichment programmes. As popular captive subjects, such animals are readily available for potential research projects that investigate behaviour, welfare and effects of enclosure design. Undergraduates on animal science courses that undertake a research-led dissertation or similar projects can collect data on such species that, if collected under a robust methodology, can be used to inform future husbandry decisions. This paper discusses three small-scale studies (on two reptile species and one amphibian species) that were designed to improve husbandry and welfare. The aim of the paper is to show that undergraduate projects, properly managed, can have a positive impact on overall day-to-day exhibition and management of these species. Results from these projects have shown that small changes to enclosure design can impact, in a beneficial fashion, on activity patterns and that overall enclosure design can help display the animals in a more interesting way to visitors. Potentially, the animal welfare benefits of enriched set-ups can be passed on to zoo visitors in the form of a more engaging, exciting and educationally-relevant zoo experience.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["11"]}

One member of the pair writes tests, while the other implements the system. The programmers can cooperate as needed and move between different collaboration modalities. As part of a user-centered design process, we built a prototype web-based collaborative development environment for test-driven pair programming and ran a user study with professional software developers to evaluate the idea and identify research challenges. We used existing vocabularies and developed two novel visualizations to analyze the data, and found that the approach is feasible.", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["11"]}

{"title": "Physical illness in the family\n", "abstract": " Although any physical illness can assume a bewildering variety of forms, the usual context in which illness occurs and is resolved is the family. Since the family is an interdependent system, change in one member of the system is followed by change in other members. The family system therefore influences the course of illness in a variety of ways, just as the onset of illness alters the interdependent structures and functions of the family system. It is through the relationships of family life that processes such as making decisions, determining policies, acknowledging feelings, and providing support are implemented (Sedgwick, 1974). There is evidence that high levels of family transactions and interactions contribute to favorable prognosis and to the rehabilitation of the patient (Litman, 1966, 1974). The established patterns of behavior within a family are disrupted by illness. The illness represents a change in one part of the family system which is followed by compensatory change in other parts. Flexibility and adaptability are essential to the maintenance of the system, and this is par-ticularly true when illness intrudes. The interdependence of organizational structures and the nature of family functioning mean that no illness can be seen as an isolated event.", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["11"]}

Our analysis and simulations show that the smaller TCP ACK packets consume channel resource comparable to the much longer TCP DATA packets, over high-speed connections. Motivated by this observation, we propose a new approach to improve TCP performance by further lowering the number of control packets compared with the known methods.

Seaweed measurements, used as a marker of the ambient seawater concentrations, allowed comparison of the environmental behaviour of different radionuclides on entering the marine environment. The nuclides could be divided into two categories: (a) 137Cs, 134Cs, 238Pu, 239 + 240Pu and 241Am and (b) 106Ru, 95Nb, 95Zr and 144Ce, dependent on their concentration distribution amongst the samples.

Acute changes in arterial carbon dioxide tension were produced experimentally by having the patients breathe various mixtures of carbon dioxide in air and by hyperventilation. Acute changes in arterial carbon dioxide tension occurred clinically during oxygen-induced hypoventilation, followed by ventilator therapy. The acute acid-base response was expressed as the ratio of change in arterial hydrogen ion concentration to change in arterial carbon dioxide tension. This ratio was inversely and linearly related to chronic values of arterial carbon dioxide tension and plasma bicarbonate concentration.

Chlordane, a chlorinated hydrocarbon structurally similar to chlorinated naphthalene, was reported by Moore et al. (1954) to be quite toxic to poults when used in a mixture of equal parts of a 2% chlordane and 0.4% lindane spray to control ants and flies in a room housing poults. They found lindane to be nontoxic to poults when used alone as a spray. Aldrin, a chlorinated naphthalene derivative, when fed at levels of 12.5 and 25 p.p.m. to 76-day old Broad Breasted Bronze turkeys in a 42-day feeding experiment, caused mortalities of 15 and 100%, respectively, the latter occurring in 14 days (Anderson et al., 1952).

{"title": "Dostoevsky and the Epileptic Mode of Being\n", "abstract": " For Fyodor Dostoevsky (1821-81), who lived with epileptic seizures for more than thirty years, illness is an ineradicable part of existence. Epilepsy in his writings denotes both a set of physical symptoms and a state of survival in which the protagonists incessantly try to articulate, theorize, or master what is ungraspable in their everyday experience. Their attempts to deal with what they cannot control or comprehend results in disappointment, or what Dostoevsky called a mystical terror. Dostoevsky's heroes are unable fully to understand this state, and their existence becomes' epileptic'in so far as self-knowledge and self-coincidence are never achieved. Fung explores new critical pathways by reexamining five of Dostoevsky's post-Siberian novels. Drawing on insights from writers including Benjamin, Blanchot, Freud, Lacan and Nietzsche, the book takes epilepsy as a trope for discussing the unspeakable moments in the texts, and is intended for students and scholars who are interested in the subject of modernity, critique of the visual, and dialogues between philosophy and literature.

In this paper, we present a horizontally constrained layout management algorithm that automates the display of structured hierarchical data using the traditional visual idioms of hand-designed database UIs: tables, multi-column forms, and outline-style indented lists. We compare our system with pure outline and nested table layouts with respect to space efficiency and readability, the latter with an online user study on 27 subjects.

METHODOLOGY: All patients who underwent EUS prior to elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy were analyzed at the Gastroenterology Unit, Kaplan Medical Center, following acute admission with cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, cholangitis, acute pancreatitis and obstructive jaundice. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy four patients met the inclusion criteria. EUS showed choledocholithiasis in 37 (21.3%) with 35/37 undergoing a preoperative ERCP (24/35 cases-64.9% positive yield). Twenty seven of the positive EUS studies (73%) were performed during the acute illness, with 50 of the 137 negative studies (36.4%) performed during the acute phase of the illness (p= 0.0001). On multivariate analysis, a positive EUS was more commonly found during the acute phase of the illness [OR: 3.445; 95% CI: 1.48-8.008, p= 0.004] or if there was transient jaundice [OR: 1.167; 95% CI: 1.002-1.36, p= 0.047].

We propose a methodology to authenticate channel estimation by leveraging physical layer properties of the wireless channel without any coherence time dependence or overhead. Our methods inherently provide data authentication, work in any environment, and provide error inference.

Nitrification of ammoniated peat prepared at 180 degrees and at 300 degrees arrived at approximately the same maximum value in one series, of about 24% conversion to nitrates. In another series with different samples the 180 degrees sample showed 31% conversion and the 300 degrees sample give only 13.4%. In both cases the nitrification of the 300 degrees material was longer in starting and the rate was slower than with the 180 degrees material, indicating that the higher temperature had produced some effect that retarded the action of the bacteria. Separation of the ammoniated peat into water-soluble and water insoluble portions and subsequent nitrification tests showed that the water-soluble nitrogen compounds in both the 180 degrees and 300 degrees material were quite easily nitrified. The nitrification curve for this portion follows very closely that for ammonium sulfate, and the limit number of experiments indicates that the extent of nitrification is about the same as with ammonium sulfate. The soluble portion from ammoniated dextrose gave a maximum conversion Of 40% after 18 weeks. The leached residues from ammoniated peat left after extracting the water-soluble portion gave somewhat varying results, from 6 to 17% conversion to nitrate.

We describe a platform for logging the actions taken by Turkers, and a questionnaire we conducted to assess search self-efficacy of average Turkers. Our results indicate Turkers have a similar range of search self-efficacy scores to undergraduate students, as measured by Kelly [8]. We were able to reach a large number of searchers in a short time and demonstrated we can effectively log interactions for rigorous log-based evaluation studies.

CD8+ encephalitis is a severe but treatable form of HIV-related acute encephalopathy, characterised by diffuse perivascular and intraparenchymal CD8+ lymphocytic infiltration.

Treatment, including high-dose corticosteroids, can give an excellent neurological outcome, even in people with severe encephalopathy and a very poor initial neurological status.

{"title": "In situ depth maps based feature extraction and tracking\n", "abstract": " Parallel numerical simulation is a powerful tool used by scientists to study complex problems. It has been a common practice to save the simulation output to disk and then conduct post-hoc in-depth analyses of the saved data. System I/O capabilities have not kept pace as simulations have scaled up over time, so a common approach has been to output only subsets of the data to reduce I/O. However, as we are entering the era of peta- and exa-scale computing, this sub-sampling approach is no longer acceptable because too much valuable information is lost. In situ visualization has been shown a promising approach to the data problem at extreme-scale. We present a novel in situ solution using depth maps to enable post-hoc image-based visualization and feature extraction and tracking.

{"title": "Flaws and Ceilings: Price Controls and the Damage they Cause\n", "abstract": " Price controls across many sectors are currently being hotly debated. New controls in the housing market, more onerous minimum wages, minimum prices for alcohol, and freezes on energy prices are very high up the agenda of most politicians at the moment. Even without any further controls, wages, university fees, railway fares and many financial products already have their prices at least partly determined by politicians rather than by supply and demand in the market. Indeed, barely a sector of the UK economy is unaffected in one way or another by government controls on prices. This book demonstrates why economists do not like price controls and shows why they are widely regarded as being amongst the most damaging political interventions in markets. The authors analyse, in a very readable fashion, the damage they cause. Crucially, the authors also explain why, despite universal criticism from economists, price controls are so popular amongst politicians.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["11"]}

Before there was a Ground Zero in New York City, Block 37 was a giant hole in the heart of a great American city. In 1990, Chicago's Block 37 (as a key part of a 27 acre urban renewal project) was razed to the ground. After the expenditure of nearly $250 million of public and private capital, nothing has been built on this once vital and densely-occupied city block. This stubborn vacancy at the center of Chicago's historic downtown eerily presaged the post 9/11 wasteland in Lower Manhattan. In a new critical introduction, Ross Miller makes the historical and political connections necessary to understand how modern city planning and redevelopment really works. By exploring one American urban block in meticulous detail, Miller clarifies the opaque process that continually breaks and remakes our most vital cities.

From this layout, the user can navigate to visualizations for moments in time or for individual entities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the visualization on an existing evolutionary simulation called EVE\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["11"]}

During the 1980s, both provinces successfully contained the growth of public expenditures on nursing homes, and one province successfully contained the growth of public expenditures on home support services, adjusting for population growth. Because provincial cost-control methods are similar to those that some States already use, it is likely that managers could contain the growth of public expenditures once a publicly insured US LTC program was implemented.

{"title": "Programming with human computation\n", "abstract": " Amazon's Mechanical Turk provides a programmatically accessible micro-task market, allowing a program to hire human workers. This has opened the door to a rich field of research in human computation where programs orchestrate the efforts of humans to help solve problems. This thesis explores challenges that programmers face in this space: both technical challenges like managing high-latency, as well as psychological challenges like designing effective interfaces for human workers. We offer tools and experiments to overcome these challenges in an effort to help future researchers better understand and harness the power of human computation. The main tool this thesis offers is the crash-and-rerun programming model for managing high-latency tasks on MTurk, along with the TurKit toolkit which implements crash-and-rerun. TurKit provides a straightforward imperative programming environment where MTurk is abstracted as a function call. Based on our experience using TurKit, we propose a simple model of human computation algorithms involving creation and decision tasks. These tasks suggest two natural workflows: iterative and parallel, where iterative tasks build on each other and parallel tasks do not. We run a series of experiments comparing the merits of each workflow, where iteration appears to increase quality, but has limitations like reducing the variety of responses and getting stuck in local maxima. Next we build a larger system composed of several iterative and parallel workflows to solve a real world problem, that of transcribing medical forms, and report our experience.

{"title": "User interfaces supporting casual data-centric interactions on the Web\n", "abstract": " Today's Web is full of structured data, but much of it is transmitted in natural language text or binary images that are not conducive to further machine processing by the time it reaches the user's web browser. Consequently, casual users-those without programming skills-are limited to whatever features that web sites offer. Encountering a few dozens of addresses of public schools listed in a table on one web site and a few dozens of private schools on another web site, a casual user would have to painstakingly copy and paste each and every address into an online map service, copy and paste the schools' names, to get a unified view of where the schools are relative to her home. Any more sophisticated operations on data encountered on the Web-such as re-plotting the results of a scientific experiment found online just because the user wants to test a different theory-would be tremendously difficult. Conversely, to publish structured data to the Web, a casual user settles for static data files or HTML pages that offer none of the features provided by commercial sites such as searching, filtering, maps, timelines, etc., or even as basic a feature as sorting. To offer a rich experience on her site, the casual user must single-handedly build a three-tier web application that normally takes a team of engineers several months. This thesis explores user interfaces for casual users-those without programming skills-to extract and reuse data from today's Web as well as publish data into the Web in richly browsable and reusable form.

{"title": "Enhancing web page skimmability\n", "abstract": " Information overload on the Web and limited reading time force users to skim read web pages. For non-native English readers, it is challenging to understand first-hand information written in English under time constraints. Traditional readability enhancement research has focused on enhancing reading comprehension and user satisfaction, but average reading times for non-native readers have remained the same or even worse. In this paper, we investigate useful techniques for readers when reading web pages under time constraints, ie, having skim reading capability. We propose two techniques to help non-native readers to skim read web pages:(1) content spotlight, masking and filtering; and (2) semantic data extraction and in-place translation. Froggy GX is a prototype system that implements proposed techniques to provide skim-reading support for non-native readers.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["11"]}
{"title": "The accuracy-obtrusiveness tradeoff for wearable vision platforms\n", "abstract": " We present our ongoing efforts to develop an open wearable platform for egocentric vision research. Our primary goal is to build a physically and socially comfortable wearable suit that still provides useful data on everyday activities for egocentric vision algorithms. Unfortunately, we have found that visibly-worn cameras are not socially acceptable. While mounting fast, wide-angle lenses to the head is ideal for vision algorithms, our results indicate that this will cause the wearer to be ostracized even though performance gains are limited.In response, we present a simple, inconspicuous wearable platform (shown in Fig. 1) that balances the performance of vision algorithms with a discreet design that allows the operator to blend into everyday life. We motivate and describe its design in the next three sections: Effects of Cameras and Lenses on Vision Algorithms: While it is obvious that having cameras with fast, wideangle lenses would be ideal for wearable vision, it is less clear to what degree they are beneficial. In section 2, we take a first step at quantifying this. In particular, we demonstrate how variations in camera resolution, shutter type, shutter speed, and lens speed affect the performance of Viola-Jones face detection [4] when applied to unconstrained wearable data. Our results suggest that although performance is improved by using cameras with fast lenses and shutter speeds, the extra bulk may not be justifiable. Social Acceptability of Wearable Cameras: We have found that building a socially acceptable wearable platform is crucial to broadly explore applications of egocentric vision in daily life.

We compared the measurement of sleep quality with the Fitbit\u252c\u00ab Charge compared to PSG in children presenting for sleep studies. METHODS: Children ages 3 to 18 years, presenting for PSG with persistent SDB symptoms were enrolled. During PSG, the Fitbit\u252c\u00ab Charge was placed on the wrist and timesynchronized with sleep laboratory devices, which were worn while a single-night PSG was performed. Bias and concordance in measurements of total sleep time (TST), total wake time (TWT), and number of awakenings were assessed using paired t-tests, sign-rank tests, and Lin's concordance coefficient. RESULTS: The study cohort included 22 patients (9 boys and 13 girls; 9\u252c\u25923 years). TST was significantly overestimated using the Fitbit\u252c\u00ab Charge (difference in means= 30 min; 95% confidence interval [CI] of difference: 3, 58; p= 0.031), while TWT was underestimated (difference= 23 min; 95% CI: 4, 42; p= 0.018). All measures showed a lack of concordance between the Fitbit\u252c\u00ab Charge and PSG. CONCLUSIONS: The current prospective study confirms that the Fitbit\u252c\u00ab Charg\u251c\u2310 overestimates time spent asleep compared to PSG in children with OSA/SDB symptoms, limiting the validity of sleep monitoring with wearable activity trackers appears in these patients.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["11"]}

By annually removing 5-10 of these high priority objects, it may be possible to stabilize the medium sized debris population. Instead of deorbiting objects, REMORA would use COTS CubeSat components and secondary payload launches as a cost-effective solution for mitigating large debris collisions. The REMORA CubeSat could rendezvous with a piece of debris and use the robotic manipulator to anchor itself to the target object.

Media Independent Handover (MIH, IEEE 802.21) is an ongoing, evolving effort to provide a generic solution for mobility across access networks. Collaborating with Layer 3 Mobility Management protocol, MIH makes it possible to achieve better performance with respect to latency and packet loss rate than the existing mechanisms. Currently, Mobile IPv4 (MIPv4) is the dominant mechanism and is expected to persist into the future. However, MIPv4 and its existing improvements do not perform well when the current active interface goes down unexpectedly and the second interface is connected via the same foreign agent (FA). To achieve better performance, we first introduce a new concept of Interface Simultaneous/Backup FA Binding between a mobile node (MN) and a single FA. Based on this, we propose a novel mobile IP extension that realizes fast handover.

It is not a marine reserve, but fishing restrictions there create a conservation area and a partially protected area. In the conservation area, a circular area 500 m radius, all fishing is prohibited except for trolling and spearfishing for kingfish (Seriola lalandi) and kahawai (Arripis trutta). Within the remaining area, all commercial fishing (except trolling for kingfish and kahawai), recreational set netting, and longlining are prohibited. During 2001\u0393\u00c7\u00f403, reef fish species were surveyed by underwater visual census inside SLIMPA and at adjacent, similar reference sites. More reef fish, and a greater diversity of reef fishes, were found inside SLIMPA than at the reference sites. The greater abundance and variety of species that are not targeted either by commercial or recreational fishers inside SLIMPA indicates that habitat complexity rather than the fisheries restrictions is probably responsible for this difference. Species with small home ranges such as blue cod (Parapercis colias) were more abundant in the no-take conservation area than in either the partially protected sites in SLIMPA or the no-protection sites outside SLIMPA.

Cows fed urea-fertilised herbage had elevated milk urea levels (-N= 5.4 mmol/l,+ N= 8.3 mmol/l, P< 0.001). A feed conversion efficiency (FCE) index was calculated as the ratio between theoretical daily metabolic energy (ME) requirement based on measured live weight and milksolids (MS) production data, and the observed mean daily ME intake over a 74 day observation period. Using this index, the apparent FCE was approximately 10% lower for the+ N than for the\u0393\u00c7\u00f4N group of cows. A survey of 16 farms indicated an association between elevated milk urea and decreased MS production per cow per day, consistent with the experimental result.

As part of their protective function, telomeres preserve genomic integrity and minimize chromosomal exposure, thus limiting DNA damage responses. With continued mitotic divisions in normal cells, telomeres progressively shorten until they reach a threshold at a point where they activate senescence or cell death pathways. However, the presence of the enzyme telomerase can provide functional immortality to the cells that have reached or progressed past senescence. In senescent cells that amass several oncogenic mutations, cancer formation can occur due to genomic instability and the induction of telomerase activity.

{"title": "Common DNA variants accurately rank an individual of extreme height\n", "abstract": " Polygenic scores (or genetic risk scores) quantify the aggregate of small effects from many common genetic loci that have been associated with a trait through genome-wide association. Polygenic scores were first used successfully in schizophrenia and have since been applied to multiple phenotypes including multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and height. Because human height is an easily-measured and complex polygenic trait, polygenic height scores provide exciting insights into the predictability of aggregate common variant effect on the phenotype. Shawn Bradley is an extremely tall former professional basketball player from Brigham Young University and the National Basketball Association (NBA), measuring 2.29 meters (76, 99.99999th percentile for height) tall, with no known medical conditions. Here, we present a case where a rare combination of common SNPs in one individual results in an extremely high polygenic height score that is correlated with an extreme phenotype. While polygenic scores are not clinically significant in the average case, our findings suggest that for extreme phenotypes, polygenic scores may be more successful for the prediction of individuals.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["11"]}
{"title": "Community evolution in multiplex layer aggregation\n", "abstract": " This research studies community detection in multiplex dark networks. Our method seeks to intelligently select appropriate layers for aggregation to approximate communities in the whole network, while reducing the impact of over-modeling the network. Community evolution is explored as layers of different types of information are added to the partial picture of the network. We determine the set of dominant layers needed to produce similar community partitions to the established ground truth aggregate network. The identification of dominant layers enhances the selection of which layers to choose for aggregation purposes. This reduces redundancy and noise, and increases the optimization of the available data to produce the desired network partitions. We use normalized mutual index (NMI), purity, density, and modularity for methodology evaluation and comparison metrics.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["11"]}

Understanding large-scale variation in student solutions is a hard but important problem. For teachers, this variation can be a source of pedagogically valuable examples and expose corner cases not yet covered by autograding. For students, the variation in a large class means that other students may have struggled along a similar solution path, hit the same bugs, and can offer hints based on that earned expertise. We developed three systems to take advantage of the solu-tion variation in large classes, using program analysis and learnersourcing.

{"title": "Towards semantic comparison of multi-granularity process traces\n", "abstract": " A process trace describes the steps taken in a workflow to generate a particular result. Understanding a process trace is critical to be able to verify data, enable its re-use and to make appropriate decisions. Given many process traces, each with a large amount of very low level information, it is a challenge to make process traces meaningful to different users. It is more challenging to compare two complex process traces generated by heterogeneous systems and having different levels of granularity. In this paper, we present a novel notion of multi-granularity process trace that attempts to capture the conceptual abstraction of large process traces at different levels of granularity by leveraging ontology information. Based on this notion, graph matching based algorithms with semantic filtering are developed to efficiently and effectively compute the similarity between two process traces by considering both structural\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["11"]}

Service members participating in each conflict experienced a variety of inhalational exposures. Some exposures such as dust storms were related to climate and location. Other exposures such as battlefield smoke, burn pits, oil fires, diesel exhaust and more were common to all who were deployed. There were still other exposures that were unique to specific countries, regions and events. These unique exposures may have been limited in duration and scope but in some cases affected large numbers of service members.Inhalational exposures in Iraq and Afghanistan have received a lot of attention due to the number of troops involved and a high incidence of respiratory complaints linked to service. Respiratory complaints were common among service members deployed to Iraq as part of Operation Desert Storm in the 1990s and more recently in soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. Epidemiologic studies in the United States, England and Australia have documented an increased incidence of respiratory disorders in soldiers who served in the Middle East as compared with soldiers who were deployed elsewhere and an increase in respiratory symptoms associated with service inland versus sea.(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["11"]}

Two major cannabinoid receptor subtypes exist: CB1 is predominantly expressed in the brain, and CB2 is primarily found on the cells of the immune system (23, 37\u0393\u00c7\u00f439). Both receptors are G protein-coupled, 7-segment transmembrane proteins, similar to the receptors of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine (39, 40). Dense cannabinoid receptor concentrations are found in the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and hippocampus, likely accounting for the effect of exogenously administered cannabinoids on motor tone and coordination as well as mood state (41\u0393\u00c7\u00f443). Low concentrations are found in the brainstem, perhaps accounting for the low potential for lethal overdose with cannabinoid-based medicines (44\u0393\u00c7\u00f447).

{"title": "Writing SIMD algorithms\n", "abstract": " Tightly coupled multiprocessor systems are currently being considered as a cost-effective means to efficiently solve computationally time-intensive problems in fields such as image processing, graph theory, and computational geometry. Much effort is being put into the development of high level parallel languages and fundamental parallel algorithms for these machines, many of which are SIMD (single instruction stream-multiple data stream) models of computation. In this paper we discuss features of an SIMD language that are necessary In order to make these architectural advancements more accessible to the general problem solving community. Two of the criteria upon which the suitability of a programming language is based are 1) its ability to allow for human communication and 2) its ability to act as a vehicle for instructing a computer. This paper examines the possibility of meeting the first criteria by expressing parallel algorithms in a pseudo Parallel Pascal. In an effort to better meet the second criteria, we discuss the possibility of augmenting current high level parallel languages with a few fundamental operations that will make these languages not only more inviting to SIMD programmers, but to problem solvers in general.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["11"]}

Personalized human computation has the potential to go beyond existing techniques like collaborative filtering to provide personalized results on demand, over personal data, and for complex tasks. This work-in-progress compares two approaches to personalized human computation. In both, users annotate a small set of training examples which are then used by the crowd to annotate unseen items. In the first approach, which we call taste-matching, crowd members are asked to annotate the same set of training examples, and the ratings of similar users on other items are then used to infer personalized ratings. In the second approach, taste-grokking, the crowd is presented with the training examples and asked to use them predict the ratings of the target user on other items.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["11"]}

Workers on Mechanical Turk can search for answers using their desktop browsers, free from the numerous shortcomings of browsing the internet on a small mobile device while in a potentially distracting situation. Sinch contributes an URL-rewriting proxy browser that can be embedded in Mechanical Turk tasks to track browsing history, text selections, and other user events. It also introduces two ways to improve the credibility of human-generated answers: providing multiple answers to the same question and including a browsing history with each answer. The Sinch application also allows users to view answers in their original context on a web page, using a custom mobile browser to highlight the answer text on the web page and zoom into it. Evaluations demonstrate that Sinch is capable of delivering correct answers in a timely manner and investigate the effectiveness of providing multiple answers and a browsing history for each answer.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["11"]}

The two studies reported similar sensitivities (88 and 91%, respectively) but discordant specificities (88 and 10%, respectively). In order to assess the uptake of Tc-GH in bronchial carcinomas we performed lung imaging on patients with an abnormal chest radiograph who were undergoing routine investigations for bronchial carcinoma. 108 patients (85 carcinoma, 23 non-carcinoma) were given 555 MBq (15 mCi) Tc-GH intravenously and scanned 5 h later. Images were assessed by one investigator (JAL) without knowledge of the patient's clinical details or other results. Localized uptake of Tc-GH was seen in 71 out of 85 patients who proved to have bronchial carcinoma. Uptake was also seen in 16 out of 23 patients with a variety of non-malignant lung conditions. Sensitivity for bronchial carcinoma was 84%, and specificity 30%. Uptake did not vary significantly with histology. Eleven out of 12 patients with proven tuberculosis had increased uptake of Tc-GH; two of those patients also had inactive lesions which did not concentrate the tracer. In conclusion, Tc-GH is of limited value in the diagnosis of bronchial carcinoma, because of its low specificity.

We are building an online tool that will help students who already know Python learn the syntax and semantics of Java. Our system will differ from existing online tutors and tools for learning Java in two main aspects. First, our tutor will focus on the transition from Python to Java. Using this basis will allow us to gloss over basic concepts of programming which students are already familiar with and focus on the specifics of Java. Second, our tutor will crowdsource writing test cases for problems to the learners themselves. This will give students practice writing tests, and will also reduce the burden on instructors, who would otherwise need to implement test suites for every problem in the tutor.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["11"]}

In particular, according to the system and method, novel techniques reduce a volume of cavities in the liquid flow system and limit a cross-sectional area of the liquid flow system to a maximum cross-sectional area of tolerably sized bubbles. In this manner, by reducing the cavity volumes and limiting cross-sectional areas, the formation of intolerably sized bubbles and the aggregation of tolerably sized bubbles into intolerably sized bubbles are each substantially prevented. Also, bubbles may be removed from the system to reduce the quantity of bubbles that are to be managed.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["11"]}

However, with increasing durability of the minimally invasive procedure and longer survival of patients, there is concern over the expense of CT and its associated risks. For this reason, many now believe that ultrasound (US) may be an adequate substitute for surveillance of patients after EVR. The aim of this study was to compare ultrasound and CT scan in our practice to ascertain whether ultrasound alone would be sufficient for follow-up of AAA patients after EVR.Materials and MethodsA total of 121 patients underwent EVR of AAAs during a 6-year period.

The windshield of a vehicle can be cleaned by liquid sprayed thereon and squeegeed by the windshield wipers. The side windows in the main are protected from dust accumulation by the air stream created by the vehicle movement. The substantially vertically rear window of a station wagon, however, is in a low pressure area. Even if wind deflectors are used on the rear of the vehicle, the window has a particular affinity for collecting dirt.It has been proposed to mount fluid spray nozzles directed toward the rear window and to provide conventional type windshield wiper blade mechanisms for removing the liquid and therefore the dirt accumulated on the window.

{"title": "Genotypic variation in\n", "abstract": " The reemergence of pertussis has been reported in several countries despite high vaccination coverage. Studies in The Netherlands and Finland have investigated polymorphism in the genes coding for two important virulence factors of Bordetella pertussis, pertactin and pertussis toxin, and identified the emergence and subsequent dominance in circulating strains of pertactin and toxin variants not found in the whole-cell vaccine (WCV). The study described here investigated whether such variation had occurred in the United Kingdom, which presently has low levels of pertussis. Sequence analysis of the genes for pertactin (prnA) and the pertussis toxin S1 subunit (ptxA) among isolates of B. pertussis from 285 United Kingdom patients, from 1920 to 1999, revealed three prnA variants, prnA (1), prnA (2), and prnA (3), and two ptxA variants, ptxA (1) and ptxA (2), showing differences in nucleic acid sequence. The proportion of pertactin gene types not included in the United Kingdom WCV, ie, prnA (2) and prnA (3), has increased in recent years and was found in 21 of 86 (24%) strains from the 1980s and 56 of 105 (53%) strains from the 1990s. To date, the presence of these nonvaccine prnA types has not been associated with a resurgence of pertussis in the United Kingdom. The distribution of prnA and ptxA types in The Netherlands, Finland, and the United Kingdom in the 1990s is distinct. The most striking difference in the United Kingdom isolates is that all 105 of the most recent circulating strains (from 1998 to 1999) are of a pertussis toxin type found in the United Kingdom WCV, ie, ptxA (1).Within the last decade, several countries have reported\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["11"]}

For many medical students and junior doctors writing a case report is their first experience of publishing (Carleton and Webb, 2012).Case reports have been around for a long time. The Provincial Medical and Surgical Journal (now called the BMJ) was the first journal to publish case reports. Two articles appeared in the inaugural edition of 3rd October 1840 (Greenhow, 1840; No author, 1840). These cases were well described, to the extent that the patients were named! However, they were little more than a litany of events, there were no explicit learning points and no attempt was made to generalise the findings.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["11"]}

{"title": "Operational characteristics and plasma measurements in a low-energy FARAD thruster\n", "abstract": " Pulsed inductive plasma accelerators are spacecraft propulsion devices in which energy is stored in a capacitor and then discharged through an inductive coil. The device is electrodeless, inducing a plasma current sheet in propellant located near the face of the coil. The propellant is accelerated and expelled at a high exhaust velocity (order of 10 km/s) through the interaction of the plasma current with an induced magnetic field. The Faraday Accelerator with RF-Assisted Discharge (FARAD) thruster is a type of pulsed inductive plasma accelerator in which the plasma is preionized by a mechanism separate from that used to form the current sheet and accelerate the gas. Employing a separate preionization mechanism in this manner allows for the formation of an inductive current sheet at much lower discharge energies and voltages than those found in previous pulsed inductive accelerators like the Pulsed Inductive Thruster (PIT). In this paper, we present measurements aimed at quantifying the thruster's overall operational characteristics and providing additional insight into the nature of operation. Measurements of the terminal current and voltage characteristics during the pulse help quantify the output of the pulsed power train driving the acceleration coil. A fast ionization gauge is used to measure the evolution of the neutral gas distribution in the accelerator prior to a pulse. The preionization process is diagnosed by monitoring light emission from the gas using a photodiode, and a time-resolved global view of the evolving, accelerating current sheet is obtained using a fast-framing camera.

{"title": "Programming with keywords\n", "abstract": " Modern applications provide interfaces for scripting, but many users do not know how to write script commands. However, many users are familiar with the idea of entering keywords into a web search engine. Hence, if a user is familiar with the vocabulary of an application domain, they may be able to write a set of keywords expressing a command in that domain. For instance, in the web browsing domain, a user might enter the keywords click search button. This thesis presents several algorithms for translating keyword queries such as this directly into code. A prototype of this system in the web browsing domain translates click search button into the code click(findButton(\"search\")). This code may then be executed in the context of a web browser to carry out the effect. Another prototype in the Java domain translates append message to log into log.append(message), given an appropriate context of local variables and imported classes. The algorithms and prototypes are evaluated with several studies, suggesting that users can write keyword queries with little or no instructions, and that the resulting translations are often accurate. This is especially true in small domains like the web, whereas in a large domain like Java, the accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of writing syntactically correct Java code without assistance.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["11"]}

FireViz visually displays activities of a personal firewall in real time. The primary goal of FireViz is to educate typical computer users of the security threats their computers are exposed to when connected to a network and expose any potential loop holes in the firewall's security policies. To this end, FireViz presents a novel visualization paradigm that provides users with an informative yet non-intrusive interface to their network and firewall. FireViz achieves this by incorporating a peripheral mapping of the network on the user's screen and displaying network events along this periphery. Information about network events is encoded visually to help users develop a more intuitive model of the network at a low cost. The peripheral nature of FireViz along with the use of non-modal visual displays allows users to easily understand network events without obstructing their primary tasks. The visualization is also capable of highlighting exceptional events that may represent potential threats without relying on the end user to understand ally threat model. Thus, FireViz aims to provide users with a superior framework for understanding the network security model and achieving improved system security in the process.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["11"]}

{"title": "MASW-An Easy Seismic Method to Map Shear-Velocity (Vs) of the Ground\n", "abstract": " The multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) method is briefly described in its normal field procedure, data processing, and common applications to the engineering geology. It is a non-destructive seismic method utilizing the dispersion properties of Rayleigh-type surface w* aves to evaluate vertical and horizontal variation of shear-wave velocity (Vs) of ground materials down to a few tens of meters. Because of the strong nature of surface waves, therefore commonly treated as the strongest noise in the traditional seismic body-wave (e.g., reflection and refraction) surveys, the MASW data acquisition is almost always guaranteed to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), making the method easiest and simplest among all other seismic methods currently used. The high S/N also enables the subsequent data processing steps simple and reliable enough to be implemented by those who may not have\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["11"]}

Instead of bookmarking webpages by their URL, this process is based on addressing pages by their Google URL, which is a short sequence of words that, when queried in Google, locates the desired webpage as the top search result. Good GoogleURLs are memorable and easily communicable, even by speech, and avoid the portability and scalability problems of traditional bookmarks. The GoogleURL Generator-a tool to automatically generate GoogleURLs-is presented, and is complemented with a Google Reordering tool that automatically reorders Google search results based on user browsing history.

The epidemic is, after all, one of fractures, not of limb lengthening. Central to the argument that an increase of 5-5 mm in the hip axis, or length of the femoral neck, is associated with an increased rate of fracture is the physics of trauma: the longer the axis the less force is needed to produce a fracture in a bone of given strength. This itself suggests prevention based on (a) the prevention of falls23 (that is, by identifying those at risk, removing hazards, improving mobility, providing aids, or modifying medical management) or (b) a reduction in the impact of trauma associated with falls (by designing\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["11"]}

The switches and their magnets are inexpensive, very reliable, and do not touch the moving object. Typically, in physics experiments the switch is fixed and the magnet moves past it (see Fig. 1). The switch closes when the pole of a magnet gets within about 1 cm and opens when the pole leaves. Acomputer or other sensing instrument records the times for switch openings and closings. Here are three motion experiments in which we have used magnetic switches.(a)", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["11"]}
{"title": "Development of a special nuclear materials monitoring sensor pack for Project Straight-Line\n", "abstract": " [en] With the end of the Cold War and the accelerated dismantlement of nuclear weapons, the nuclear material inventory of the United States is growing. In addition, the United States has offered these excess weapons-grade nuclear material assets for international inspections with the intent of encouraging reciprocal action by other nations. In support of this policy, Sandia National Laboratories has initiated a pilot effort (Project Straight-Line) to develop a flexible, site-independent system to continuously and remotely monitor stored nuclear material and integrate the collection, processing, and dissemination of information regarding this material to ensure that declared nuclear materials placed in storage remain in place, unaltered, and stable. As part of this effort, a+ 3.6 V battery powered, modular sensor pack has been developed to monitor total radiation dose, radiation dose rate, and the temperature of each nuclear material container and to provide this information using a standardized sensor interface. This paper will discuss the development of the sensors, the engineering and production of the sensor pack units, and their installation and operation at sites in New Mexico, California, and the Pantex plant in Amarillo", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["11"]}

This report represents the data and describes the effects of operation of the Millstone 3 cycle 2 core at an elevated hot coolant pH of 7.0--7.5 on Zircaloy cladding corrosion, and on the buildup of core crud and excore radiation fields. The following preliminary conclusion were made based on an evaluation of the data obtained after one cycle of Millstone 3 elevated coolant pH operation. Although some of the measured zirconium dioxide thicknesses are greater than expected, the data does not indicate a significant lithium effect on the corrosion rate of the fuel cladding because of the relatively high variability of thickness measurements on rods of similar duty.

Prior to 1950, the major plant damaging pollutants arose from isolated stationary sources, however, as of today, damage from these stationary sources has been far surpassed by damage due to ozone, PAN, and nitrogen dioxide which are formed as the result of photochemical reactions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides emitted primarily by movable sources, automobiles, however, this is not to say that the stationary sources, industrial plants, home furnaces, etc. do not also emit their share of those pollutants. Some gross estimates have been made of economic losses but no attempt has been made to distribute these losses among farm crops, ornamental plantings, forests, etc., or to ascribe the losses to emissions from manufacturing industries, auto exhausts, commercial and residential activities.

Although the Ferguson and like systems involve a measure of weight transfer between the implement and tractor so as to vary the tractive ability of the tractor, the problems in trailing or drawn implements are somewhat different because little if any of the implement weight is initially borne by the tractor and vertical adjustment of the tractor draft links usually merely raises\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["11"]}

PACE4 is broadly expressed throughout the body, including high expression in the central nervous system. PACE4 reportedly removes the prodomain of pro-ADAMTS-4 and pro-ADAMTS-5 in osteoarthritic (OA) cartilage, thus activating these aggrecanases.

Even if a spread is orientated in the direction of maximum source energy and the energy is stacked over the optimal azimuth, background noise especially in the lower frequency ranges, induces a shift to a higher phase velocity on the phase -velocity frequency diagram and a deformation across the phase velocity.

Since the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the incidence of previously encountered OIs and tumours has declined significantly.

This occurs in a subgroup of patients despite low or negligible viral load in the blood. Patients on cART now present with problems due to drug side effects (eg efavirenz causing headaches, drowsiness, agitation, insomnia and cognitive dysfunction), neurological immune reconstitution syndromes and the so-called compartmentalization syndrome with negligible plasma HIV viral loads but high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) viral loads. Assessment of the impact of HIV and cART on the brain is further complicated by non-HIV-related co-pathology associated with ageing (such as cerebrovascular disease), mental health and alcohol problems associated with persons living with a long-term chronic disease, use of pain control due to complications of HIV disease (eg peripheral neuropathy), use of illicit drugs in a subgroup of patients and co-infection with eg Hepatitis C.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["11"]}

{"title": "12 Intensive care\n", "abstract": " 12.1 BackgroundFrom the start of the HIV epidemic, respiratory failure has been the most common indication for patients with HIV infection to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), bacterial pneumonia and tuberculosis continue to be significant causes of respiratory failure; however, admission to the ICU with non-HIV-associated respiratory causes, including emphysema and asthma, is increasingly encountered [1\u0393\u00c7\u00f43]. An emerging cause of respiratory failure requiring admission to the ICU is immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)[4]. Non-respiratory causes, including renal and hepatic failure, cardiac disease, drug overdose and severe toxicity from HIV therapy are increasingly recognised [1\u0393\u00c7\u00f44].Early in the HIV epidemic, HIV-seropositive patients with critical illnesses were deemed incurable. ICU mortality rates were high and long-term survival rates were low [5\u0393\u00c7\u00f47]. The majority of admissions to the ICU were patients with severe PCP. As a direct result of HAART, there has been a sustained reduction in HIV-associated morbidity and mortality. Several studies report improved outcomes for HIV-seropositive patients requiring admission to the ICU in the HAART era [1\u0393\u00c7\u00f43, 8, 9]. One recent study suggests that outcomes from ICU admission for HIV-seropositive patients are equivalent to those for the general medical (non-HIV-infected) population [3].", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["11"]}

We identify challenges to build such a framework. We also develop and evaluate two new algorithms for detecting text at arbitrary places on the screen, and for segmenting a text image into individual word blobs. Finally, we validate our framework in implementations of three applications. We enhance an existing pixel-based system, Sikuli Script, and preserve the readability of its script code at the same time. Further, we create two novel applications, Screen Search and Screen Copy, to demonstrate how PAX can be applied to developing desktop-level interactive systems.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["11"]}

{"title": "Automatic generation of XSLT by simultaneous editing\n", "abstract": " The proliferation of XML during recent years has been aided by an array of powerful companion tools. One such tool, XSL Transformations (XSLTs), has played an important role in XML's adoption, facilitating interoperability by defining general transformations on XML documents. However, despite XSLT's power and flexibility, the transformations can be hard to define, often requiring recursion to perform simple operations. Further, writing XSLTs requires learning its transformation language, distracting from the primary focuses of the input and output. This thesis focuses on streamlining the generation of XSLTs through the use of a programming-by-demonstration (PBD) interface. Instead of directly defining an XSLT, a user begins with the input XML document, converting it to the desired output through text editing. Based on the input XML document, the resulting output document, and the sequence of user edits, an XSLT definition will then be automatically generated. To overcome the hindrance of repetitive editing this thesis relies heavily on simultaneous editing as implemented in LAPIS, defined as the editing of text with multiple simultaneous cursors inferred from positive and negative examples. In addition to reducing redundant actions, simultaneous editing provides critical hints into the structure of the desired transformation. Models that have attempted to generate XSLTs based solely on input and output examples have met challenges, but aided with the simultaneous editing information, successful XSLT generation is possible.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["11"]}

Marie, Forest Research Information Paper 124, 32 p.Growth and yield projections aid foresters in assessing timber management opportunities and in making management decisions. With these uses, questions arise about the reliability and limits of growth and yield simulators. Using long-term studies of hardwood stands in Ontario the growth simulator FIBER 3.0 has been tested, Short-term (5years) projections ofstand growth are reliable (modelling efficiency from 70% to 90%). Errors for individual stand projections, however, range from-30% to 40%. The mag_fitude oferror in individual stand projections isinfluenced by species composition and size of sample plots. Small sample sizes do not fully account for the variation in stand structure, The best results (prediction errors below 20%) occur when projecting stands that have 50% to 70% sugar maple and are sampled using plots> 0.2 ha. When the length of the projection period increases, the reliability of FIBER3. 0 decreases and errors increase. Long-term (15-and 20-year) projections underestimate key stand characteristics and the performance of the model is less satisfactory.

The task, as formulated in the minimal principle, is to ascertain a set of phases which minimizes an objective (the minimal function) for a given molecular structure and which corresponds to its true atomic arrangement. The magnitude (0 (103)) and non-linearity of the numerical problem is prohibitive for higher-order (gradient) methods. Conventional iterative methods have provided solutions, but fail to provide a strategic approach for solution. The method of simulated annealing (SA) as implemented with a Fourier filtering scheme called Shake-and-Bake, is formulated using a methodical parameterization procedure, and compared to results from the conventional approach. SA is shown to yield considerable improvement in solubility and computational efficiency for a 28-atom test case.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["11"]}

Partly this was due to a rather broad molecular weight distribution in the starting material and a deliberate removal of material of low molecular weight. There also seemed to be an incomplete replacement of hydroxyl groups by chlorine using the method reported here. A published method for a quantitative reaction with SOBr2 gave considerable discoloration of the polymer. An incomplete conversion with subsequent hydrolysis of any camphorquinonesulfonyl groups attached to polymer through sul-fonate ester bonds was preferred. Release of guanidino groups from the polymer with hydroxylamine at pH 7, as is possible with cyclohexanedione adducts of arginine, would have been more acceptable than the treatment with o-phenylenediamine at pH 8-9, but camphorquinonesulfonyl derivatives are resistant to that treatment. 2 The foregoing reservations aside, the camphorquinonesulfonyl polymer derivative described has properties which strongly recommend it as a carrier in the synthesis and semisynthesis of peptides in aqueous solution.
