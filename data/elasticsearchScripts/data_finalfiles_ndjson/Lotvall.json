These vesicles can mediate communication between cells, facilitating processes such as antigen presentation. Here, we show that exosomes from a mouse and a human mast cell line (MC/9 and HMC-1, respectively), as well as primary bone marrow-derived mouse mast cells, contain RNA. Microarray assessments revealed the presence of mRNA from approximately 1300 genes, many of which are not present in the cytoplasm of the donor cell. In vitro translation proved that the exosome mRNAs were functional. Quality control RNA analysis of total RNA derived from exosomes also revealed presence of small RNAs, including microRNAs. The RNA from mast cell exosomes is transferable to other mouse and human mast cells.

They can mediate diverse biological functions, including antigen presentation. Exosomes have recently been shown to contain functional RNA, which can be delivered to other cells. Exosomes may thus mediate biological functions either by surface-to-surface interactions with cells, or by the delivery of functional RNA to cells. Our aim was therefore to determine the presence of RNA in exosomes from human saliva, plasma and breast milk and whether these exosomes can be taken up by macrophages. Exosomes were purified from human saliva, plasma and breast milk using ultracentrifugation and filtration steps. Exosomes were detected by electron microscopy and examined by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry was performed by capturing the exosomes on anti-MHC class II coated beads, and further stain with anti-CD9, anti-CD63 or anti-CD81. Breast milk exosomes were further analysed for the presence of Hsc70, CD81 and calnexin by Western blot. Total RNA was detected with a Bioanalyzer and mRNA was identified by the synthesis of cDNA using an oligo (dT) primer and analysed with a Bioanalyzer. The uptake of PKH67-labelled saliva and breast milk exosomes by macrophages was examined by measuring fluorescence using flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. RNA was detected in exosomes from all three body fluids. A portion of the detected RNA in plasma exosomes was characterised as mRNA.

These small vesicles (30-100 nm) of endocytic origin were first proposed to function as a way for reticulocytes to eradicate the transferrin receptor while maturing into erythrocytes1, and were later named exosomes. Exosomes are formed by inward budding of late endosomes, producing multivesicular bodies (MVBs), and are released into the environment by fusion of the MVBs with the plasma membrane2. Since the first discovery of exosomes, a wide range of cells have been shown to release these vesicles. Exosomes have also been detected in several biological fluids, including plasma, nasal lavage fluid, saliva and breast milk3-6. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the content and function of exosomes depends on the originating cell and the conditions under which they are produced. A variety of functions have been demonstrated for exosomes, such as induction of tolerance against allergen7,8, eradication of established tumors in mice9, inhibition and activation of natural killer cells10-12, promotion of differentiation into T regulatory cells13, stimulation of T cell proliferation14 and induction of T cell apoptosis15.

Exosomes are released by many cells including mast cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, epithelial cells and tumour cells. Exosomes differ compared to their donor cells, not only in size, but also in their RNA, protein and lipid composition.   Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we show that exosomes, released by mouse mast cells exposed to oxidative stress, differ in their mRNA content. Also, we show that these exosomes can influence the response of other cells to oxidative stress by providing recipient cells with a resistance against oxidative stress, observed as an attenuated loss of cell viability. Furthermore, Affymetrix microarray analysis revealed that the exosomal mRNA content not only differs between exosomes and donor cells, but also between exosomes derived from cells grown under different conditions; oxidative stress and normal conditions. Finally, we also show that exposure to UV-light affects the biological functions associated with exosomes released under oxidative stress.

Since non-adherence is a major obstacle in treating prevalent chronic diseases the aim was to determine whether personality traits are related to reported adherence to medication in individuals with chronic disease.   Methodology/Principal Findings Individuals with chronic disease (n = 749) were identified in a random population sample of 5000 inhabitants aged 30\u201370 in two municipalities in West Sweden. Data on five personality traits, Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to experiences, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness, and medication adherence behaviour was collected by questionnaires. Statistical analyses resulted in a negative relationship between Neuroticism and medication adherence (P<0.001), while both Agreeableness (P<0.001) and Conscientiousness (P<0.001) were positively related to adherence. At high levels of Conscientiousness, low adherence was related to higher scores in Neuroticism. At high levels of Agreeableness, low adherence was related to low scores in Conscientiousness and high scores in Openness to experiences.   Conclusions This study demonstrated that multiple personality traits are of significant importance for adherence behaviour in individuals with chronic disease. The findings suggest that several personality traits may interact in influencing adherence behaviour.

In several in vitro and in vivo models, EVs have been observed to have supportive functions in modulating the immune system, mainly mediated by EV-associated proteins and nucleic acids.

These mediators are therefore thought to be important in the pathogenesis of asthma. Airway microvascular leakage with plasma protein exudation is a cardinal feature of inflammation, and the cysteinylleukotrienes are potent inducers of microvascular leakage in a number of tissues (4), including the airways (5, 6).

IL-31 is a key trigger of atopic dermatitis. Recent studies also suggest a role of IL-31 in the pathogenesis of other allergic diseases including allergic rhinitis. In the present study we studied the release of IL-31 and IL-13 in allergen-challenged allergic rhinitis patients. Seven seasonal allergic volunteers underwent unilateral nasal provocation with allergen (and a control challenge) with the disc method out of the allergy season. Nasal symptom scores (rhinorrhea, itching, sneezing, obstruction) and bilateral nasal secretions were quantified before and after allergen provocation. IL-13 and IL-31 in nasal secretions and serum were measured by electrochemiluminescent immunoassay or ELISA, respectively. Nasal allergen challenge induced the typical clinical symptoms and physiological changes. IL-31 and IL-13 in nasal secretions increased in four and five, respectively, volunteers at 5 h after allergen but not after control challenge. We observed correlation trends between nasal IL-31 concentrations and IL-13 concentrations (r\u2009=\u20090.9, p\u2009=\u20090.002), and IL-31 contents and symptom scores (r\u2009=\u20090.9, p\u2009=\u20090.013) 5 h after allergen provocation.

Encouragingly, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and their produced extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been shown to elicit anti-inflammatory effects in multiple inflammatory conditions including sepsis. However, EVs are generally released from mammalian cells in relatively low amounts, and high-yield isolation of EVs is still challenging due to a complicated procedure. To get over these limitations, vesicles very similar to EVs can be produced by serial extrusions of cells, after which they are called nanovesicles (NVs). We hypothesized that MSC-derived NVs can attenuate the cytokine storm induced by bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) in mice, and we aimed to elucidate the mechanism involved. NVs were produced from MSCs by the breakdown of cells through serial extrusions and were subsequently floated in a density gradient. Morphology and the number of NVs were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis.

The present study was designed to examine the effect of chronic allergen exposure on bronchial responsiveness, eosinophil infiltration, and airway remodelling. We sensitized brown Norway rats with the occupational allergen trimellitic anhydride (TMA) and exposed the animals to TMA conjugated to rat serum albumin (TMA-RSA) on 5 consecutive days each week for 9 weeks, starting 4 weeks after sensitization. IgE and IgG anti-TMA antibodies in serum and bronchial responsiveness to acetylcholine were evaluated before and at weeks 3, 6, and 9 of allergen exposure. Thickness of the airway wall, airway luminal narrowing, and the number of goblet cells and eosinophils in the airway wall were evaluated with an image analysis system in lungs resected after the last assessment of bronchial responsiveness, at the end of the 9-week allergen exposure. All rats developed IgE and IgG anti-TMA antibodies after sensitization. The levels of antibodies increased with allergen exposure until week 6, and then declined. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness to acetylcholine was induced in allergen-exposed rats without ongoing airway eosinophilia. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness induced by chronic allergen exposure via inhalation was accompanied by significantly increased thickness of smooth muscle and airway narrowing in the small airways, and goblet cell hyperplasia in the large airways.

Another dilemma is that there seems to be a small range of functional interventions that enhance adherence to long-term medication treatments. The aim was to review the last five years of published educational interventions for improving adherence to asthma medication. Through systematic database searches 20 articles were identified, which matched the inclusion criteria and described educational interventions to improve asthma self-management including adherence. The current review showed that addressing unintentional non-adherence in terms of incorrect inhaler technique by recurrent education improved the technique among many patients, but not among all. Phoning patients, as a means to remove medication beliefs as adherence barriers, seemed to be an effective educational strategy, shown as increased adherence. Involving patients in treatment decisions and individualising or tailoring educational support also seemed to have favourable effect on adherence. To conclude, addressing specific adherence barriers such as poor inhaler technique or medication beliefs could favour adherence. To change adherence behavior, the current review proposes that educational adherence support should be a collaborative effort between the patient and the health-care professional based on each individual patient's needs and patient factors, including elements such as personality traits.", "num_citations": "30\n", "authors": ["2064"]}

We here ask whether feces contain EVs of mammalian and/or bacterial origin, and whether these EVs induce systemic inflammation. Fecal extracellular vesicles (fEVs) were isolated from mice and humans. The presence of EVs from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using anti-lipid A and anti-lipoteichoic acid antibodies, whereas Western blot using anti-beta-actin antibody was employed to detect host-derived EVs in the fEVs. Further, fEVs were administered into mice by intraperitoneal injection, and inflammatory responses were investigated in the peritoneum, blood, and lungs. The role of TLR2 and TLR4 were studied using knockout mice. Significant quantities of EVs were present in feces from mice as well as humans, and derived from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, as well as the host. Bacteria-free fEVs introduced into the peritoneum induced local and systemic inflammation (including in the lungs), but fEVs from germ-free animals had weaker effects. This pronounced local and systemic inflammatory responses seemed to be induced by EVs from both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, and was attenuated in mice lacking TLR2 or TLR4.

T cells express transcription factors T-bet, GATA-3, ROR\u03b3t and Foxp3, representing Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg cells respectively. No study has directly determined the relative presence of each of these T cell subsets concomitantly in a model of allergic airway inflammation. In this study we determined the degree of expansion of these T cell subsets, in the lungs of allergen challenged mice. Cell proliferation was determined by incorporation of 5-bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (BrdU) together with 7-aminoactnomycin (7-AAD). The immunohistochemical localisation of T cells in the lung microenvironments was also quantified. Local expression of cytokines, chemokines and receptor genes was measured using real-time RT-PCR array analysis in tissue sections isolated by laser microdissection and pressure catapulting technology. Allergen exposure increased the numbers of T-bet+, GATA-3+, ROR\u03b3t+ and Foxp3+ cells in CD4+CD25+ and CD4+CD25- T cells, with the greatest expansion of GATA-3+ cells.

Dengue begins as a febrile condition, and in certain patients, it can evolve severe clinical outcomes, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). The reasons why certain patients develop DHF or DSS have not been thoroughly elucidated to date, and both patient and viral factors have been implicated. Previous work has shown that a severe immune dysfunction involving dendritic cells and T cells plays a key role in increasing the disease severity, especially in secondary heterologous infections. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membranous particles that are secreted by several cell types involved in homeostatic and pathological processes. Secretion of EVs by infected cells can enhance immune responses or favor viral evasion. In this study, we compare the molecular content of EVs that are secreted by human primary dendritic cells under different conditions: uninfected or infected with DENV3 strains isolated from patients with different infection phenotypes (a severe case involving DSS and a mild case). Human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mdDCs) were infected with the dengue virus strains DENV3 5532 (severe) or DENV3 290 (mild), and the EVs were isolated. The presence of cup-shaped EVs was confirmed by electron microscopy and immunostaining with CD9, CD81 and CD83.

The airflow obstruction was evaluated by measurement of airway insufflation pressure (P1) and plasma extravasation by quantification of Evans Blue dye (EBD) in airways. U46619, given as a single dose to each animal (1 pmol-10 nmol), caused a dose-dependent increase in P1 and extravasation of EBD. The threshold dose required to induce an increase in P1 was 30 times lower than the threshold dose necessary to evoke EBD extravasation. The role of inflammatory mediators was studied when 10 pmol (inducing only the increase in P1) or 10 nmol (inducing the increase in both P1 and EBD extravasation) of U46619 was administered.

Deviating from a medication prescription could be regarded as fairly irrational, but with respect to patients' goals and/or concerns it could be seen as understandable. Thus, the aim was to elucidate adherence reasoning in relation to asthma medication. This was a qualitative study; data collection and analysis procedures were conducted according to Grounded Theory methodology. Eighteen persons, aged 22 with asthma and regular asthma medication treatment, were interviewed. The emerged theoretical model illustrated that adherence to asthma medication was motivated by three foci, all directed towards a desired outcome in terms of a functional day as desired by the patient. A promotive focus was associated with the ambition to achieve a positive asthma outcome by being adherent either to the received prescription or to a self-adjusted dosage. A preventive focus was intended to ensure avoidance of a negative asthma outcome either by sticking to the prescription or by preventively overusing the medication. A permissive focus was associated with unstructured adherence behaviour in which medication intake was primarily triggered by asthma symptoms. As all participants had consciously adopted functioning medication tactics that directed them towards the desired goal of a functional day. In an effort to bridge the gap between a patient- and a medical adherence perspective, patients need support in defining their desired functionality and guidance in developing a person-based medication tactic.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["2064"]}

The expression of OPN in allergic rhinitis (AR) is currently unknown, as is the effect of intranasal glucocorticosteroids (GCs) on that expression. Subjects with AR were randomised to receive treatment with fluticasone propionate (FP) (n = 12) or a placebo (n = 16) over the grass pollen season and nasal biopsies were taken prior to, and during the season. OPN expression in the nasal mucosa was examined with immunohistochemistry. Healthy non-AR controls (n = 5) were used as a comparator. OPN expression was detected in epithelial cells, subepithelial infiltrating/inflammatory cells and cells lining the vessels and glands of all subjects. Comparison of the pre- and peak-pollen season biopsy sections in placebo treated patients revealed no increase in OPN expression during the grass pollen season (5.7% vs 6.4%). Treatment with a local glucocorticosteroid did not alter the expression of OPN during pollen exposure (6.2% vs 6.7%). OPN has been increasingly associated with the pathogenesis of various Th2-mediated diseases. However, our finding that the OPN expression in the nasal mucosa of AR patients is not significantly affected by allergen exposure and is comparable to that of the healthy controls, suggests that intracellular OPN is not directly involved in the pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["2064"]}

{"title": "Relationship between systemic blood pressure, airway blood flow and plasma exudation in guinea-pig.\n", "abstract": " Plasma exudation in the airways is mainly dependent on microvascular permeability of the tracheobronchial circulation and may be affected by local blood flow. Aortic blood pressure provides the major inflow pressure to tracheobronchial circulation. Therefore, systemically administered vasoconstrictors, in doses enough to increase systemic blood pressure, may theoretically increase the blood flow in the tracheobronchial circulation by enhancing inflow pressure. Consequently, this may influence plasma exudation induced by inflammatory mediators in the airways. To test this hypothesis, we used guinea-pigs to study:(1) the effects of iv vasoconstrictors (methoxamine and angiotensin II) on blood flow in the tracheal mucosa and in the leg skeletal muscle (Laser-Doppler flowmetry);(2) the effects of iv vasoconstrictors on plasma exudation induced by tracheal administration of the inflammatory mediator bradykinin (150 nmol). We found that iv methoxamine and angiotensin II significantly increase tracheal mucosa blood flow and systemic blood pressure. The increase in tracheal mucosa blood flow was, in the case of angiotensin II, found to be significantly related to the increase in systemic blood pressure. In separate experiments, pre-treatment with iv methoxamine and angiotensin II significantly potentiates Evan's Blue dye exudation induced by bradykinin in the trachea and main bronchi. We conclude that iv methoxamine and angiotensin II potentiate bradykinin-induced plasma exudation in the guinea-pig airways, possibly by increasing the local blood flow. The increase in the local blood flow is most likely induced by enhanced systemic blood\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["2064"]}

We have studied the effects of parainfluenza Type I (Sendai) virus infection of the upper respiratory tract on the airway responsiveness to acetylcholine (ACh) and substance P administered by either the inhaled or intravenous route in the anesthetized guinea pig. Airway responses to electrical stimulation of the vagus nerves in the presence of atropine (1 mg. kg-1 iv) were also studied. After four to five days following virus infection, mean pulmonary insufflation pressure increased significantly in response to inhaled ACh compared to that in control animals. Responses to intravenous ACh were not enhanced. By contrast, responses to both intravenous and inhaled substance P were increased. In addition, mean pulmonary insufflation pressure after electrical stimulation of the vagus nerves for 30 seconds at 5 V, 5 msec (frequencies of 3, 10, and 30 Hz) were all enhanced after virus infection. We conclude that the increased airway responsiveness observed to the exogenous administration of the neurotransmitters ACh and substance P after viral respiratory infection may be due to different mechanisms possibly associated with an interference with the epithelium.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["2064"]}

However, the diversity of EV subpopulations are only beginning to be explored. Since EVs have been implicated in tumor microenvironmental communication, we started to determine the diversity of EVs specifically in this tissue. To do this, we isolated EVs directly from patient melanoma metastatic tissues. Using EV membrane isolation and mass spectrometry analysis, we discovered enrichment of mitochondrial membrane proteins in the melanoma tissue-derived EVs, compared to non-melanoma-derived EVs. Specifically, EVs positive for a combination of the two mitochondrial inner membrane proteins MT-CO2 (mitochondrial genome) and COX6c (nuclear genome) were detected in the plasma of melanoma patients, and in ovarian and breast cancer patients. Furthermore, this subpopulation of EVs, contains active mitochondrial enzymes. Our findings show that tumor tissues are enriched in EVs with mitochondrial proteins and enzymatic activity, and these EVs can be detected in blood.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["2064"]}

We previously showed that adipose tissue Tregs express the adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1); however, the expression in lung Tregs is still unknown. Here, we aimed to determine whether Helios+ and Helios\u2212 Treg subsets expressed AdipoR1 in the lungs of obese mice and whether different obesity grades affected the expression upon allergic lung inflammation. For diet-induced obesity (DIO), mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for up to 15 weeks (overweight), 21 weeks (obesity), and 26 weeks (morbid obesity). Overweight and morbidly obese mice were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA) to induce allergic lung inflammation. The AdipoR1 expression was reduced significantly in the lung Helios+ and Helios\u2212 Tregs of obese mice compared with lean mice. Airway allergic inflammation showed reduced AdipoR1 expression in lung Foxp3+ Tregs. Obesity significantly exacerbated the eosinophilic airway inflammation and reduced the number of Helios+ Tregs in lung and adipose tissue in the obesity-associated asthma model. Upon further weight gain, AdipoR1-expressing Tregs in the lungs of allergic mice were increased, whereas AdipoR1-expressing Tregs in adipose tissue were reduced. These data suggest that obesity-associated adipose tissue inflammation may exacerbate allergic inflammation by downregulating the AdipoR1+ Tregs in the lungs.

{"title": "Extracellular vesicles in motion\n", "abstract": " By secreting extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles, into the extracellular milieu, cells can convey complex biological messages between each other. These vesicles are generally thought to be static packages lacking the flexibility of their parental cells in terms of motility and the ability to change shape. However, cryo-electron micrographs reveal the presence of actinlike filaments in a subpopulation of EVs, raising the question if these vesicles could possess motile capabilities similar to that produced by actin in cells. We here show that fluorescently labeled EVs change their shape in a matter of minutes, regardless of whether they are isolated from human body fluids, mouse tissue or cell culture of human cells or yeast. Our findings therefore cast doubt on movement being confined to cells, suggesting that some EVs indeed have an intrinsic capacity to move. This novel observation showing morphological plasticity among EVs adds another level of complexity to the already multifaceted vesicular secretome, and may lead to new ways in which we perceive these nano-carriers of intercellular signals.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["2064"]}

This increase in e-cigagette use contrasts to a major and continuing decrease in cigarette smoking seen in most westernized countries for some decades [1]. It seems that the marketing of e-cigarettes is less active in middle and low level income countries, as exemplified in a paper from Egypt in this issue of Respiratory Research [2]. Are e-cigs safe, or safe enough, is a controversy also in the medical society. Particularly the public health community seems to be divided, and safety and efficacy aspects of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation have been unclear. Among public health professionals, particularly in the UK [3], there is an opinion favoring the use of ecigarettes as a smoking cessation tool among smokers, while others strongly believe the contrary [4]. So, who are those who use e-cigarettes? Is it middle aged or elderly smokers that want to quit smoking? According to the 2012 Eurobarometer survey, about 30 million adults in the 27 EU countries that year used or had used e-cigarettes [6], and the greatest proportion of ever users of e-cigarettes was found among subjects aged 15\u201324 years followed by those aged 25\u201339 years, further, this proportion was considerably greater among heavy smokers compared to light smokers.

Exosomes play a role in one of the most recently discovered and versatile cell-to-cell communications, which do not require cell contact and that can act over long distances. The RNA content, mRNA and microRNA, is protected by the exosomes rigid membranes, which makes it possible for cells to communicate long-distance RNA messages via the circulation system. Their mRNA content differs substantially from their mother cell mRNA content, whereas their microRNA content seems to reflect their cellular origin more. This chapter reviews the role of exosomes in cell-to-cell communication and in particular the role of exosomal shuttle RNA (esRNA).

As five actuations of salbutamol were put into the spacer, however, the dose inhaled, and particularly the dose of respirable particles, was probably considerably less owing to electrostatic deposition of the drug on the spacer wall. Everard et al have shown that when sodium cromoglycate is put into a spacer the percentage delivered decreases with increasing dose. 2 Others have shown that the percentage recovery of respirable particles (< 5, um) decreased precipitously with increasing number of actuations into a spacer (C O\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["2064"]}

Here we show that EVs released by human primary mast cells or transformed human mast cells (HMC1), carry TGF\u03b2-1 on their surface. EV-associated TGF\u03b2-1 enhance the migratory activity of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) compared to free TGF\u03b2-1, as both knockdown of TGF\u03b2, or a TGF\u03b2-antibody, attenuate the effect. The MSCs respond by increasing matrix metalloproteinase-2 and \u22129 (MMP) activity. Further, EVs given to MSCs are retained in the endosomal compartments at a time of biological function, prolonging EV-associated TGF\u03b2-1 signaling vs free TGF\u03b2-1. When exposed to EVs, MSCs home more toward allergen-exposed lung in a mouse allergen model, resulting in attenuated allergic inflammation.

{"title": "Exosomes purified from a single cell type have diverse morphology and composition\n", "abstract": " Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are produced by all known organisms and have important roles in cell communication and physiology. Exosomes are known in the literature to be small round EVs (40 to 100 nm in diameter) and are commonly purified with a serial ultracentrifugation protocol followed by density gradient floatation. Great morphological diversity has been described before regarding EVs found in body fluids such as blood plasma, breast milk and ejaculate. However, a detailed morphological analysis has never been performed on exosomes purified from a single cell type.Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze and quantify via multiple electron microscopy techniques the morphology of exosomes purified from the human mast cell line HMC-1. The results revealed a novel spectrum of diversity in exosomes, which suggests that subpopulations of exosomes with different and specific functions might also exist. Our findings therefore argue that a new and more efficient way of defining exosome subpopulations is necessary. A system was proposed where exosomes were classified into nine different categories according to their size and shape. Three additional morphological features could also be found in exosomes regardless of their classification.These findings show that morphological diversity is found among exosomes purified from a single cell line, similarly to what was previously observed for EVs in body fluids. This knowledge can help improving the interpretation of experimental results and widening our general understanding of the biological functions of exosomes.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["2064"]}

Therefore, making \u201ccold\u201d tumors \u201chot\u201d is required to increase the response rate to immunooncology therapies in general. Bacteria and bacterial products have been utilized for cancer immunotherapy for more than 100 years, but currently no such treatment is available because of the severe side effects that are observed. In this study, we produced artificial outer membrane vesicles (aOMVs) from Escherichia coli outer membrane, and injected them together with cancer tissue-derived exosomes to booster an immune response to the malignancy. Firstly, outer membranes were obtained from E. coli by chemical means, followed by ionic stress and applied mild energy to generate aOMVs. The yield and purity of aOMVs were analyzed by nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2064"]}
{"title": "mi RNA profiling of uveal melanoma exosomes as a metastatic risk biomarker\n", "abstract": " Purpose Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults. It is a highly aggressive cancer in which nearly 50% of patients die from liver metastasis. UM patients can be divided into 3 groups based on their genetic profile and disease free survival; the low risk, intermediate risk and high risk tumours. Recently, we have shown that high risk patients can be identified based on the expression of five miRNAs. Since tumour tissue is not always available and biopsies are not without risk, it is important to develop a method that can identify high risk patients in a non\u2010invasive manner. Exosomal miRNAs are an excellent candidate for this application.   Methods Exosomes were isolated from the cell culture medium of a non\u2010metastatic and high risk metastatic UM cell line by ultracentrifugation and were characterized by western blot, electron microscopy and Nanosight Tracking Analysis (NTA\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2064"]}
{"title": "Cancer stem cell targeted exosomes for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer\n", "abstract": " Introduction: Therapy resistance and metastasis remain the two biggest challenges of breast cancer that result in a majority of cancer deaths. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subpopulation of cancer cells that can initiate new tumors, remain refractory to conventional therapies, and spread throughout the body. In order to effectively block metastasis, the present study aims to develop novel therapeutics that specifically target breast CSCs and spare normal cells. While nanomedicine represents one of the promising future directions, it is necessary to overcome the shortcomings of synthetic nanoparticles, including bio-instability and off-target toxicity. Here, we aim to bio-engineer the naturally produced cell-secreted small vesicles, exosomes (~100 nm diameter), for a novel therapeutic delivery system.Methods: Exosomes from the human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were isolated by differential ultracentrifugation\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2064"]}

{"title": "Multi-symptom asthma as an indication of disease severity in epidemiology\n", "abstract": " Epidemiological questionnaires have failed to identify individuals with severe asthma. The extent of symptoms of asthma can, however, easily be established in epidemiological studies by identification of multiple symptoms. We hypothesized that reporting of multiple symptoms of asthma reflects uncontrolled disease and can be a sign of more severe asthma.

{"title": "Welcome to Clinical and Translational Allergy\n", "abstract": " Over many years, EAACI have focused on publishing two major journals, Allergy as well as Pediatric Allergy and Immunology (PAI). However, these two excellent journals alone are limited in their ability to publish a considerable number of articles despite their quality, and therefore are insufficient to provide the required platform for communication of many high quality scientific papers for the EAACI community. Consequently, in the last years it has become evident that new journals need to be established by the Academy. It was also felt that Open Access was crucial for any new EAACI journal, as many funding bodies today require the research to be published in this way, and open access makes published research available to the general public, without any need for subscriptions. A key principle for CTA will be to provide a very rapid and fair review process for all submission, and we hope the journal becomes a\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2064"]}
{"title": "Coagulation pathway identified by proteomics in asthmatic bronchial biopsies: effects of treatment\n", "abstract": " Background: Asthma is a complex disease involving many intertwined processes. Many studies have determined the involvement of many individual molecules and pathways, but few have examined the global proteome of bronchial tissue in asthma, which can provide an improved understanding of ongoing biological processes. iTRAQ (isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation) with an LC-LTQ- Orbitrap is a sensitive, quantitative proteomics method. The aim was to determine if network analysis of quantitative proteomics of bronchial biopsies from asthmatics can reveal significant biological pathways, and whether these pathways are changed by inhaled glucocorticoid treatment. Method: Endobronchial biopsies were taken from untreated asthmatic patients (n=13) or non-smoking healthy controls (n=3).
