This overhead makes instrumentation difficult to perform at runtime, often preventing many known offline feedback-directed optimizations from being used in online systems.

The framework is simple and effective, using code-duplication and counter-based sampling to allow switching between instrumented and non-instrumented code.", "num_citations": "449\n", "authors": ["711"]}

{"title": "Software bloat analysis: Finding, removing, and preventing performance problems in modern large-scale object-oriented applications\n", "abstract": " Generally believed to be a problem belonging to the compiler and architecture communities, performance optimization has rarely gained attention in mainstream software engineering research. However, due to the proliferation of large-scale object-oriented software designed to solve increasingly complex problems, performance issues stand out, preventing applications from meeting their performance requirements. Many such issues result from design principles adopted widely in the software research community, such as the idea of software reuse and design patterns. We argue that, in the modern era when Moore's dividend becomes less obvious, performance optimization is more of a software engineering problem than ever and should receive much more attention in the future.

{"title": "Collecting and exploiting high-accuracy call graph profiles in virtual machines\n", "abstract": " Due to the high dynamic frequency of virtual method calls in typical object-oriented programs, feedback-directed devirtualization and inlining is one of the most important optimizations performed by high-performance virtual machines. A critical input to effective feedback-directed inlining is an accurate dynamic call graph. In a virtual machine, the dynamic call graph is computed online during program execution. Therefore, to maximize overall system performance, the profiling mechanism must strike a balance between profile accuracy, the speed at which the profile becomes available to the optimizer, and profiling overhead. This paper introduces a new low-overhead sampling-based technique that rapidly converges on a high-accuracy dynamic call graph. We have implemented the technique in two high-performance virtual machines: Jikes RVM and J9.

Nevertheless, halting production systems until the bug is tracked and fixed is often impossible. Thus, developers have to try to reproduce the bug in laboratory conditions. Often, the reproduction of the bug takes most of the debugging effort. In this paper we suggest an approach to address this problem by using a specialized runtime environment called Quality Virtual Machine (QVM).

{"title": "Measuring bone stiffness using spherical indentation\n", "abstract": " Objectives Bone material properties are a major determinant of bone health in older age, both in terms of fracture risk and implant fixation, in orthopaedics and dentistry. Bone is an anisotropic and hierarchical material so its measured material properties depend upon the scale of metric used. The scale used should reflect the clinical problem, whether it is fracture risk, a whole bone problem, or implant stability, at the millimetre-scale. Indentation, an engineering technique involving pressing a hard-tipped material into another material with a known force, may be able to assess bone stiffness at the millimetre-scale (the apparent elastic modulus). We aimed to investigate whether spherical-tip indentation could reliably measure the apparent elastic modulus of human cortical bone.   Materials and methods Cortical bone samples were retrieved from the femoral necks of nineteen patients undergoing total hip replacement surgery (10 females, 9 males, mean age: 69 years). The samples underwent indentation using a 1.5 mm diameter, ruby, spherical indenter tip, with sixty indentations per patient sample, across six locations on the bone surfaces, with ten repeated indentations at each of the six locations. The samples then underwent mechanical compression testing. The repeatability of indentation measurements of elastic modulus was assessed using the co-efficient of repeatability and the correlation between the bone elastic modulus measured by indentation and compression testing was analysed by least-squares regression.

{"title": "Integrative analysis of the plasma proteome and polygenic risk of cardiometabolic diseases\n", "abstract": " Cardiometabolic diseases are frequently polygenic in architecture, comprising a large number of risk alleles with small effects spread across the genome 1, 2, 3. Polygenic scores (PGS) aggregate these into a metric representing an individual\u2019s genetic predisposition to disease. PGS have shown promise for early risk prediction 4, 5, 6, 7 and there is an open question as to whether PGS can also be used to understand disease biology 8. Here, we demonstrate that cardiometabolic disease PGS can be used to elucidate the proteins underlying disease pathogenesis. In 3,087 healthy individuals, we found that PGS for coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease and ischaemic stroke are associated with the levels of 49 plasma proteins. Associations were polygenic in architecture, largely independent of cis and trans protein quantitative trait loci and present for proteins without quantitative trait loci\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["711"]}

However, these models are usually derived from individuals who may initiate statins during follow-up. We present a simple approach to address statin-initiation to predict \u201cstatin-na\u00efve\u201d CVD risk. We analyzed primary care data (2004-2017) from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink for 1,678,727 individuals (40-85 years) without CVD or statin treatment history at study entry. We derived age- and sex-specific prediction models including conventional risk factors and a time-dependent effect of statin-initiation constrained to 25% risk reduction (from trial results). We compared predictive performance and measures of public-health impact (e.g., numbers-needed-to-screen to prevent one case) against models ignoring statin-initiation.

We then modelled implications of initiating guideline-recommended statin therapy after the assessment of molecular markers for a UK primary-care setting.Findings The C-index was 0.710 (95% CI, 0.703-0.717) for a CVD prediction model containing conventional risk predictors alone. The C-index increased by similar amounts when adding information on PRS or biochemistry markers (0.011 and 0.014, respectively; P<0.001), and it increased still further (0.022; P<0.001) when information on both was combined. Among cases and controls, continuous net reclassification improvements were about 12% and 19%, respectively, when both PRS and biochemistry markers were added. If PRS and biochemistry markers were to be assessed in the entire primary care population aged 40-75, then it could help prevent one additional CVD event for every 893 individuals screened. By contrast, targeted assessment only among people at intermediate (i.e., 5-10%) 10-year CVD risk could help prevent one additional CVD event for every 233 individuals screened.

Previous experimental studies in autoimmune-prone MRL+/+ mice have focused on responses in females. However, it is important to include both males and females in order to better understand sex-disparity in autoimmune disease.

A biological age formed from biomarkers may be a stronger risk factor than chronological age and understanding what factors contribute to it could provide insight into new opportunities for disease prevention.  Methods and findings: Among 480,019 UK Biobank participants aged 40-70 recruited in 2006-2010 and followed up for 6-12 years via linked death registry and secondary care records, a subpopulation of 141,254 (29.4%) non-smoking adults in good health and with no medication use or disease history at baseline were identified. Independent components of 72 biomarkers measured at baseline were characterised by principal component analysis. The Klemera Doubal method (KDM), which derived a weighted sum of biomarker principal components based on the strengths of their linear associations with chronological age, was used to derive sex-specific biological ages in this healthy subpopulation. The proportions of the overall biological and chronological age effects on mortality, coronary heart disease and age-related non-fatal hospital admissions (based on a hospital frailty index) that were explained by biological age were assessed using log-likelihoods of proportional hazards models.  Reduced lung function, reduced kidney function, slower reaction time, lower insulin-like-growth factor 1, lower hand grip strength and higher blood pressure were key contributors to biological age (explaining the highest percentages of its variance) in both men and women, while lower albumin, higher sex hormone-binding\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["711"]}
