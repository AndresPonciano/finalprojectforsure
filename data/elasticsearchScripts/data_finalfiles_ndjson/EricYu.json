While understanding the proper ways of addressing privacy has been growing, systematic approaches are needed to guide software engineers to elicit, model and reason about these requirements. In an each more day networked world, multi-agent systems has been emerging as a new approach. Each agent may have his own goals and beliefs that might lead to different perspectives concerning privacy. Perspectives from different agents may conflict with each other. Moreover, they may conflict with other requirements as availability and performance. In this paper we present a framework to model the way agents interact with each other to achieve their goals. The framework uses a catalogue to guide the software engineer through several alternatives for achieving privacy. Each alternative will be modeled showing how it contributes to privacy as well as to other requirements within this agent or even within another agent.

The more actors trust each other, the less stringent the security requirements are likely to be. Trust always involves the risk of mistrust; hence, trust implies a trade-off: gaining some benefits from depending on a second party in trade for getting exposed to security and privacy risks. When trust assumptions are implicit, these trust trade-offs are made implicitly and in an ad-hoc way. By taking advantage of agent- and goal-oriented analysis, we propose a method for discovering trade-offs that trust relationships bring. This method aims to help the analyst select among alternative dependency relationships by making explicit trust trade-offs.

Thus, it is necessary to show not only where object orientation might fail, but also where agent/goal orientation still needs improvement. A practical approach that uses a well defined and complex problem producing specifications using agent/goal orientation and object orientation could guide us to understand better the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

Using data from a case of academic research and development service as a type of KIBS, we present a modeling technique that can support the design of successful service engagements in this domain. This work is guided by the understanding of service as a process of collaborative value creation, or value cocreation. Beyond the contribution of the modeling technique to KIBS design, our work shows the strength of using a Design Science Research methodology in creating design artifacts that are strongly aligned\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1445"]}

We advocate methods for early domain exploration which provoke iteration over captured knowledge, prompting analysts and stakeholders to review what is known, helping to guide elicitation, and facilitating early scoping and decision making. Specifically, we provide a framework to support interactive, iterative analysis over goal-and agentoriented (agent-goal) models. The framework will allow for multiple types of analysis questions, manage alternative evaluations over a model, manage interactive results, capture model assumptions and arguments, and support iteration over all constructs. Initial case study experience shows that interactive evaluation provokes model iteration and domain exploration. Further case studies will be developed to test the benefits of framework expansions.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1445"]}

By focusing on lower-level objectives an organization can potentially overlook or neglect better ways of achieving higher-level goals. Shifting from a short-term to a long-run orientation can be considered a type of pivoting, as the structure and relationships of an organization are substantially reconfigured. The Larger Goal pivot is essential when lower-level options for achieving a higher-level organizational goal are either unavailable or insufficient. It entails shifting focus to a larger or higher goal and exploring strategic alternatives to satisfy that goal.

{"title": "Using i* to Reason about Employee Behavior on Public Social Media.\n", "abstract": " The use of social media by employees can be both beneficial and detrimental for their employer. Favorable posts by employees can bolster an organization\u2019s respectability while criticism can undermine its reputation. Many employers adopt policies to influence social media activities of their employees. Such policies encourage behavior that is favorable to the organization and discourage conduct that is damaging. Employees must make tradeoffs between their professional objectives and personal aspirations while using social media because the two sets of goals may conflict. This paper demonstrates the application of i* modeling to develop an understanding of employee behavior on public social media. A hypothetical industrial scenario drawn from scholarly literature and professional press is used to explain this approach. i* modeling can be used to support employers in formulating effective policies for influencing employee behaviors on public social media. It can also be used to promote a shared understanding that can help to guide employee participation on public social media in a manner that balances their professional and personal objectives.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1445"]}
{"title": "Towards a framework for shaping & forming enterprise capabilities\n", "abstract": " In this era of rapid change and major technology-enabled transformations, information systems design needs to take into account the specific context of the organizational setting and the strategic direction of the enterprise. To this end, researchers and practitioners have built on the concept of capability to analyze what a business can and should do to manage its strategic trajectories. This paper describes four categories of modeling and analysis requirements to deal with capability formation. The requirements are identified through a review of the origins of the capability concept in the strategic management literature. A set of guidelines is proposed as part of a modeling framework based on the i* language. Enterprise Capabilities are modeled as a specialized type of intentional actor so that their socio-technical characteristics can be specified and analyzed.

{"title": "CEO-employee pay ratio and bond yield spreads\n", "abstract": " This study explores the effect of CEO-employee pay ratio on bond yield spreads. We find that there exists a positive relation between CEO-employee pay ratio and bond yield spreads. Since bond yield spread has been used as a proxy for a corporation\u2019s cost of debt, our finding suggests that bondholders tend to perceive a higher CEO-employee pay ratio as a risk factor, therefore requiring a higher return from the debt, thus the higher cost of debt. We further analyze how industrial homogeneity and labor unionization, which proxies for employee\u2019s bargaining power, affects such a relation and find that employee\u2019s bargaining power plays a mitigating role on the effect of CEO-employee pay ratio on bond yield spreads. Finally, we investigate how such a relation is affected by a firm\u2019s financial constraints. The result shows that the effect of CEO-employee pay ratio on bond yield spreads tends to be more pronounced when the firm has a higher level of financial constraints.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1445"]}

These successful businesses began as start-ups and matured into enterprises with multi-billion dollar valuations even though most start-ups fail or are abandoned within a few years of founding. A notable reason for the failure or abandonment of many start-ups is erroneous logic and faulty assumptions underpinning their products, business models, and engines of growth. The lean start-up approach encourages decision makers to test their fundamental hypotheses and effect strategic pivots to identify new and superior fundamental hypotheses. This paper outlines exploratory research into the modeling of strategic pivoting using i*. It discusses the key concepts that are relevant for developing a framework for analyzing strategic pivoting in a structured and systematic manner using i*.

{"title": "Towards Variability Design as Decision Boundary Placement.\n", "abstract": " Complex information systems have numerous design variables that are systematically decided upon during the design process. In high-variability systems, some of these decisions are left open and deferred to later stages. For example, in product line architectures, some decision variables are used to generate families of products with variations in features. In user-adaptive systems, the behavior of the system is determined at runtime, based on user characteristics and preferences. In this paper, we propose to characterize variability in terms of boundaries in design decision graphs which depict the space of alternatives. A design decision about variability, such as what choices should be left to the user and which ones should be fixed at which stage in the design process, is then a question of where to place that decision boundary along some path in the relevant decision graph.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1445"]}

{"title": "From indicators to predictive analytics: A conceptual modelling framework\n", "abstract": " Predictive analytics provides organisations with insights about future outcomes. Despite the hype around it, not many organizations are using it. Organisations still rely on the descriptive insights provided by the traditional business intelligence (BI) solutions. The barriers to adopt predictive analytics solutions are that businesses struggle to understand how such analytics could enhance their existing BI capabilities, and also businesses lack a clear understanding of how to systematically design the predictive analytics. This paper presents a conceptual modelling framework to overcome these barriers. The framework consists of two modelling components and a set of analysis that systematically (1) justify the needs for predictive analytics within the organisational context, and (2) identify the predictive analytics design requirements.

{"title": "Resolving Artifact Description Ambiguities During Software Design using Semiotic Agent Modelling.\n", "abstract": " For software designers to effectively collaborate, they must share an understanding of how software design artifacts contribute to the execution of software processes (the artifact\u2019s operational meaning). However, during design, artifact descriptions often lack sufficient detail to unequivocally establish operational meaning. This is because during design, artifact descriptions are initially usually first-cut, and are then successively refined to include additional design details, until the operational meaning of artifacts can be unequivocally demonstrated. Ensuring shared meaning in larger projects is particularly difficult because of the plethora of interrelated artifacts designers deal with, and because the design details in descriptions of different artifacts can vary greatly. In this paper we argue that a semiotic meaning analysis supports clarifying the operational meaning of artifacts during software design, and can help in identifying whether and in what way artifact descriptions must be further elaborated. We further argue that clarifying the operational meaning of artifacts is closely intertwined with design decision-making. Adapting an existing semiotic agent modelling approach, we propose an approach to capturing the evolving operational meaning of artifacts during software design and decision processes, and illustrate the approach with examples taken from a large design project at an insurance company.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1445"]}

This paper outlines a conceptual modelling framework which attempts to provide a systematic way for organizing and using knowledge from multiple organizational analysis perspectives. The framework is made up of three types of models. The rst represents an organizational con guration as a network of interdependencies among actors. The second models the make-up of social actors in terms of roles, positions, and concrete agents. The third uses a network of arguments to express the concerns that actors have about the current and potential organizational con gurations from various perspectives.

{"title": "Automated Generation of Attack Routes for Service Security Analysis-A Preliminary Report.\n", "abstract": " i* modeling has been used to characterize service-oriented computing in terms of intentional concepts such as agents, goals, dependencies, as well as services they provide or consume. The intentional models provide a rich basis for various security related reasoning, such as vulnerability analysis, attack and countermeasure evaluation, risk assessment, etc. In this work, we aim to explore a reasoning method over the i* models that goes beyond evaluating the satisfaction of security properties. We propose a service security modeling approach for automated generation of attack routes against a specific service. We analyze the security level for each service by using the resulting models. We aim to discover countermeasures and incorporate them into the security analysis process.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1445"]}
{"title": "Conceiving e3-value Business Plans\n", "abstract": " This paper advocates using the e3-value models for the construction of business plans as they integrate the calculation of financial projections for business plans with visual business models, using the business view that is also taken by investors. Additionally, this paper distinguishes typical business plan content that can and cannot be represented in e3value models and their related spreadsheets. Furthermore, this paper identifies a feature (ie the best, base and worst case scenario volatility analysis) of cumulative cashflow analyses, which are characteristic for business plans, that is not yet supported by the e3value architecture and advocates that this feature is vital to make e3value a fully-fledged business conceptualization that supports a set of e3finance patterns that is equivalent to the existing set of e3control patterns, and complementary to Coplien\u2019s \u2018A Development Process Generative Pattern Language\u2019.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1445"]}
{"title": "Modeling identity management architecture within a social setting\n", "abstract": " Managing digital identity is about intelligently using the identity management solutions to achieve business goals. There is a pressing need for frameworks and models to support the analysis and design of complex social relationships with regard to identity in order to ensure the effective use of existing protection technologies and control mechanisms. This paper explores how the GRL/i* approach could be used in the design of a more integrated and comprehensive identity management solutions for organizations. Using this modeling approach, we may explicitly relate the different strategic rationales of stakeholders to the alternative design choices in the context of identity management. We argue that different actor configurations and vendor-based identity management components may be evaluated and selectively combined to achieve the best requirements satisfaction level based on strategic analysis\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1445"]}

{"title": "Modelling Trust for System Design Using th, ei* Strategic, Actors Framework\n", "abstract": " Thei* framework was developed to support requirement analysis and high-level design in an agent-oriented system development paradigm. It models intentional dependency relationships among strategic actors and their rationales. As actors depend on each other for goals to be achieved, tasks to be performed, and resources to be furnished, the trust relationships amongthese actors needtobe considered to reason about the opportunities and vulnerabilities these dependencies bring. The concept of softgoal is used to model quality attributes for which there are no a priori, clear-cut criteria for satisfaction, but are judged by actors as being sufficiently met (\u226a satisficed\u226b) on a case-by-case basis. In this paper, trustworthiness is treated as a softgoal to be satisficed from the viewpoint of each stakeholder. Contributions to trustworthiness are considered using a qualitative reasoning approach. Examples from the smart card domain are used to illustrate.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1445"]}
{"title": "Centralize or Decentralize? A Requirements Engineering Perspective on Internet-Scale Architectures\n", "abstract": " Large-scale systems are hard to design because of tensions among many interacting forces. For example, in considering whether to centralize or decentralize a function or resource, the designer has to make tough tradeoffs among competing requirements such as performance, cost, usability, reliability, security, time-to-market, maintainability, evolvability, etc. In the area of Requirements Engineering, techniques have been developed to support the managing of large numbers of requirements (functional and non-functional), detecting and analyzing their interactions, using requirements to guide the exploration, pruning and evaluation of design alternatives, and to support change. Such techniques typically emphasize the need to find suitable ways to represent knowledge, and to build tools that manipulate that knowledge in support of human design activities [MBY97]. A knowledge-based approach to software engineering thus may include the following components:1. a representational framework (notations, models, languages, ontologies) that is expressive enough to deal with the subject matter: domain concepts, requirements, elaboration steps, design techniques, design configurations, design steps and process, alternatives, relationships, etc., 2. analysis and design techniques that make use of the semantics of the modelling constructs to support the engineering activities, eg, analyzing interactions among requirements, generating design options, evaluating implications of design alternatives, etc., 3. collections of reusable knowledge (knowledge bases), ranging from case studies to generic knowledge such as common types of requirements\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1445"]}
