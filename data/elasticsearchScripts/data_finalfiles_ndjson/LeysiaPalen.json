{"title": "Unpacking\" privacy\" for a networked world\n", "abstract": " Although privacy is broadly recognized as a dominant concern for the development of novel interactive technologies, our ability to reason analytically about privacy in real settings is limited. A lack of conceptual interpretive frameworks makes it difficult to unpack interrelated privacy issues in settings where information technology is also present. Building on theory developed by social psychologist Irwin Altman, we outline a model of privacy as a dynamic, dialectic process. We discuss three tensions that govern interpersonal privacy management in everyday life, and use these to explore select technology case studies drawn from the research literature. These suggest new ways for thinking about privacy in socio-technical environments as a practical matter.", "num_citations": "1307\n", "authors": ["1178"]}

We statistically examine how Twitter is being used surrounding these events, and compare and contrast how that behaviour is different from more general Twitter use. Our findings suggest that Twitter messages sent during these types of events contain more displays of information broadcasting and brokerage, and we observe that general Twitter use seems to have evolved over time to offer more of an information-sharing purpose. We also provide preliminary evidence that Twitter users who join during and in apparent relation to a mass convergence or emergency event are more likely to become long-term adopters of the technology.", "num_citations": "1268\n", "authors": ["1178"]}

This paper investigates the work of mapmakers working on the response to the 2015 Nepal earthquakes. In comparison to prior events, we found significantly more collaboration and spatial data sharing took place between map producers working across humanitarian organizations and parts of the Nepal government. Collaboration between mapping practitioners was supported by a complex and emergent information infrastructure composed of social and technical elements, some of which were brought through experience with prior disaster events, and some which were shaped anew\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "51\n", "authors": ["1178"]}
{"title": "Visual representations of disaster\n", "abstract": " Nepal was struck by two major earthquakes in April and May 2015 which gave rise to much media attention. Because of photographs' power to influence how people perceive significant events, we investigate how these disasters are represented visually through Twitter-shared images in three ways. First, we compare how geotagged image tweets are distributed vis-\u00e0-vis the reported damage, to see if a seemingly\" objective\" method of representation stands up. Second, with an iteratively developed coding scheme, we examine how images are differently produced and shared within global versus local populations and after each earthquake, with the idea that amplification\" collectively instructs\" what features of the event are most important. Third, we analyze how images from other locations, disasters, and time periods are appropriated as part of the\" story\" of the disaster event.

The discourse about participation in the OSM community largely focuses on the motivations for why members contribute map data and the resulting data quality. Recently, large corporations including Apple, Microsoft, and Facebook have been hiring editors to contribute to the OSM database. In this article, we explore the influence these corporate editors are having on the map by first considering the history of corporate involvement in the community and then analyzing historical quarterly-snapshot OSM-QA-Tiles to show where and what these corporate editors are mapping. Cumulatively, millions of corporate edits have a global footprint, but corporations vary in geographic reach, edit types, and quantity. While corporations currently have a major impact on road networks, non-corporate mappers edit more buildings and points-of-interest: representing the majority of all edits, on average. Since corporate editing represents the latest stage in the evolution of corporate involvement, we raise questions about how the OSM community\u2014and researchers\u2014might proceed as corporate editing grows and evolves as a mechanism for expanding the map for multiple uses.

We show that in order to meet the requirements of the NFIP, this standard acts as a closure that conveys a certainty that the underlying science does not warrant and foreshortens dialogue on disaster risk and public understanding of flood hazard. Engaging with literature in science and technology studies and human-centered computing, we investigate design opportunities for resisting closure and supporting public formation through encounters with the uncertainty and complexities of risk information.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["1178"]}

{"title": "Research agenda in intelligent infrastructure to enhance disaster management, community resilience and public safety\n", "abstract": " Modern societies can be understood as the intersection of four interdependent systems: (1) the natural environment of geography, climate and weather; (2) the built environment of cities, engineered systems, and physical infrastructure; (3) the social environment of human populations, communities and socio-economic activities; and (4) an information ecosystem that overlays the other three domains and provides the means for understanding, interacting with, and managing the relationships between the natural, built, and human environments. As the nation and its communities become more connected, networked and technologically sophisticated, new challenges and opportunities arise that demand a rethinking of current approaches to public safety and emergency management. Addressing the current and future challenges requires an equally sophisticated program of research, technology development, and strategic planning. The design and integration of intelligent infrastructure-including embedded sensors, the Internet of Things (IoT), advanced wireless information technologies, real-time data capture and analysis, and machine-learning-based decision support-holds the potential to greatly enhance public safety, emergency management, disaster recovery, and overall community resilience, while addressing new and emerging threats to public safety and security.

Approaches by emergency response organisations and other stakeholders to the use of social media in crisis communication continue to vary widely, however: while some such organisations are actively exploring a variety of models for incorporating tools such as Facebook and Twitter into their overall emergency media mix, others have been taking a much more cautious approach and continue to see social media as a potential disruption and source of rumours and misinformation. At the same time, the practice of social media analysis as applied to crisis informatics is growing at an extraordinary rate across the humanities and social sciences-as well as computer science and informatics. This panel brings together a number of recognised experts in the study of social media and crisis communication in order to explore the current state of play across a range of disciplines, organisational contexts and international jurisdictions.

The data include the analysis of the calls made during this time period. It examines the propensity to contact others during times of sudden and great uncertainty, with consideration of the relationship between strong ties and weak ties in this mass emergency situation. The analysis shows that people generally made calls to their strongest tie but they were also active in calling people with whom they had weaker connections. The analysis shows that the sequencing of the calls broadly follows the order of decreasing link strength. In addition, the analysis shows how the mobile phone supports the immediate communication needs of people in the affected region as well as those in the concerned periphery. The victims of disasters are interested in receiving information direct from their loved ones as well as information provided by authorities. Emergency management should understand the high importance that people place on immediately interacting with their closest family and friends in the wake of disasters perhaps before making other decisions.

{"title": "Lifelong learning and self-directed learning\n", "abstract": " Sennett explores the disorienting effects of the new capitalism. He reveals the vivid and illuminating contrast between two worlds of work: the vanished world of rigid, hierarchical organizations, where what mattered was a sense of personal character, and the brave new world of corporate re-engineering, risk, flexibility, networking, and short-term teamwork, where what matters is being able to reinvent yourself on a dime.In some ways the changes characterizing the new capitalism are positive; they make for a dynamic economy. But they can also be destructive, eroding the sense of sustained purpose, integrity of self, and trust in others that an earlier generation understood as essential to personal character. In this timely and essential essay, Sennett enables us to understand the social and political context for our contemporary confusions, and he suggests how we need to re-imagine both community and individual\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1178"]}
{"title": "Data that matter: opportunities in crisis informatics research\n", "abstract": " In an increasingly global society and on a planet experiencing effects of climate change, large-scale emergencies both instigated by humans and arising from nature can devastate human life and our tightly-woven social fabric. With a promise of improved warning and coordination, a prevailing hope is that information and communication technology (ICT) can help reduce the impacts of large-scale disruptions, including political crises, natural disasters, pandemics, and terrorist threats. Much of the focus of development has been on the formal emergency response effort.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1178"]}
{"title": "About time: schedules & sociotemporality\n", "abstract": " The temporal dimension is an often overlooked aspect of human interaction. The treatment and valuation of our own time and others' time is dependent on the social context. The representation of time and time intervals are socially constructed concepts, strongly influencing our behavior. Time's technologies\u2014clocks and calendrical systems\u2014arose from social requirements; they in turn enforce social function. In particular, the institution of the schedule\u2014made possible by the ubiquity of clocks and calendars\u2014has been called a \"cornerstone of social life\" (Zerubavel, 1981). This paper examines the sociotemporal order in the context of public and personal schedules, with an emphasis on time and human interaction in the workplace. Sociotemporal theory is used to explore what role an emerging time-management technology will have in the workplace: networked, on-line scheduling software.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1178"]}
