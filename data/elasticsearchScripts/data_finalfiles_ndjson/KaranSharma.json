{"title": "Receptor-independent, direct membrane binding leads to cell-surface lipid sorting and Syk kinase activation in dendritic cells\n", "abstract": " Binding of particulate antigens by antigen-presenting cells is a critical step in immune activation. Previously, we demonstrated that uric acid crystals are potent adjuvants, initiating a robust adaptive immune response. However, the mechanisms of activation are unknown. By using atomic force microscopy as a tool for real-time single-cell activation analysis, we report that uric acid crystals could directly engage cellular membranes, particularly the cholesterol components, with a force substantially stronger than protein-based cellular contacts. Binding of particulate substances activated Syk kinase-dependent signaling in dendritic cells. These observations suggest a mechanism whereby immune cell activation can be triggered by solid structures via membrane lipid alteration without the requirement for specific cell-surface receptors, and a testable hypothesis for crystal-associated arthropathies, inflammation, and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "278\n", "authors": ["1936"]}
{"title": "Vision for road inspection\n", "abstract": " Road surface inspection in cities is for the most part, a task performed manually. Being a subjective and labor intensive process, it is an ideal candidate for automation. We propose a solution based on computer vision and data-driven methods to detect distress on the road surface. Our method works on images collected from a camera mounted on the windshield of a vehicle. We use an automatic procedure to select images suitable for inspection based on lighting and weather conditions. From the selected data we segment the ground plane and use texture, color and location information to detect the presence of pavement distress. We describe an over-segmentation algorithm that identifies coherent image regions not just in terms of color, but also texture. We also discuss the problem of learning from unreliable human-annotations and propose using a weakly supervised learning algorithm (Multiple Instance\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "85\n", "authors": ["1936"]}
{"title": "A role of IgM antibodies in monosodium urate crystal formation and associated adjuvanticity\n", "abstract": " Uric acid is released from injured cells and can act as an adjuvant signal to the immune system. Uric acid crystals invoke strong inflammatory responses in tissues. Although their biological effects are evident and the associated signaling mechanisms are becoming clear, it remains unexplained as to why uric acid precipitates rapidly in vivo, in sharp contrast to the minimal crystallization in vitro. We report in this study that a group of IgM Abs is able to bind to these crystals, which is interesting in light that B cell-deficient mice do not sense the proinflammatory adjuvant effect of uric acid. The titers of these Abs increase upon immunization with uric acid crystals. We have produced large quantities of such mAbs. The purified IgM Abs can significantly facilitate uric acid precipitation to form the inflammatory crystals in vitro. Infusion of these Abs into B cell-deficient mice significantly increases the basal level of inflammation in\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "65\n", "authors": ["1936"]}

Increasing evidence indicates that AML relapse is driven by the inability to eradicate leukemia stem cells (LSC). Thus, it is imperative to identify novel therapies that can ablate LSCs. Using an in silico gene expression\u2013based screen for compounds evoking transcriptional effects similar to the previously described anti-LSC agent parthenolide, we identified AR-42 (OSU-HDAC42), a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor that is structurally similar to phenylbutyrate, but with improved activity at submicromolar concentrations. Here, we report that AR-42 induces NF-\u03baB inhibition, disrupts the ability of Hsp90 to stabilize its oncogenic clients, and causes potent and specific cell death of LSCs but not normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.

In research, a direct and real-time inspection in realistic settings is not possible. Discrete, indirect, post-hoc recordings are therefore the norm. As a result, proper emotion assessment remains a problematic issue. The Continuously Annotated Signals of Emotion (CASE) dataset provides a solution as it focusses on real-time continuous annotation of emotions, as experienced by the participants, while watching various videos. For this purpose, a novel, intuitive joystick-based annotation interface was developed, that allowed for simultaneous reporting of valence and arousal, that are instead often annotated independently. In parallel, eight high quality, synchronized physiological recordings (1000 Hz, 16-bit ADC) were obtained from ECG, BVP, EMG (3x), GSR (or EDA), respiration and skin temperature sensors.

{"title": "Re-evaluating one-step generation of mice carrying conditional alleles by CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing technology\n", "abstract": " CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology has considerably facilitated the generation of mouse knockout alleles, relieving many of the cumbersome and time-consuming steps of traditional mouse embryonic stem cell technology. However, the generation of conditional knockout alleles remains an important challenge. An earlier study reported up to 16% efficiency in generating conditional knockout alleles in mice using 2 single guide RNAs (sgRNA) and 2 single-stranded oligonucleotides (ssODN) (2sgRNA-2ssODN). We re-evaluated this method from a large data set generated from a consortium consisting of 17 transgenic core facilities or laboratories or programs across the world. The dataset constituted 17,887 microinjected or electroporated zygotes and 1,718 live born mice, of which only 15 (0.87%) mice harbored 2 correct LoxP insertions in cis configuration indicating a very low efficiency of the method. To determine the factors required to successfully generate conditional alleles using the 2sgRNA-2ssODN approach, we performed a generalized linear regression model. We show that factors such as the concentration of the sgRNA, Cas9 protein or the distance between the placement of LoxP insertions were not predictive for the success of this technique. The major predictor affecting the method\u2019s success was the probability of simultaneously inserting intact proximal and distal LoxP sequences, without the loss of the DNA segment between the two sgRNA cleavage sites. Our analysis of a large data set indicates that the 2sgRNA\u20132ssODN method generates a large number of undesired alleles (>99%), and a very small number of desired alleles\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1936"]}

The Robocoaster employs a 6-DoF industrial robot (KUKA KR-500) equipped with 2 seats at its tool centre point (TCP). Since 2001, the Robocoaster (and derived systems) has been a subject of active research and has been successfully transferred to the amusement industry. DLR has developed various iterations of the Robocoaster: In 2004-05, we presented the \u2018KUKA Mars Mission\u2019; this was the first time visual cues were incorporated with the Robocoaster system. Next, we developed the \u2018RoboSim 4-D\u2019 simulator that addressed the shortcomings of the earlier efforts, was lower in cost and had improved safety features. This version is in-use (as an offline simulator) at several amusement parks. The latest version, called the \u2018DLR Robot Motion Simulator\u2019 (DLRRMS) includes an additional linear axis at the base of the robot; which makes the setup a 7 DoF simulator.

In addition, overexpression of TMEM16A has been associated with cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Suppression of upregulated TMEM16A has been proposed as an effective anti-cancer strategy. While searching for a potential TMEM16A inhibitor, components of rice bran attracted our attention due to their anti-cancer potential in colon cancer cells, a type of cells known to overexpressing TMEM16A. Here, it was tested whether rice bran extract exhibits anti-TMEM16A activity.

In addition, they may also occur in the minor salivary glands of the hard and soft palate. Intranasal pleomorphic adenomas are unusual. We report a rare case of large sized pleomorphic adenoma arising from the nasal septum. A 42-year-old man presented with a 3 month history of multiple episodes of nasal bleeding and obstruction on right side of nose. On examination we found a non-tender firm mass extending upto the nasal vestibule which bled on probing. Computed tomographic scans revealed a mass in the right anterior nasal cavity and spur on left side. Paranasal sinuses, posterior choanae and nasopharynx were normal. An intranasal endoscopic approach was used to achieve a wide local resection along with coagulation of base and spurectomy on the left side. The mass was 2.5\u00d7 2.0 cm with a broad based attachement of 1.0 cm on the nasal septum. The microscopic finding showed a lobular and duct-like structures consisting of a loose chondromyxoid stroma suggestive of a pleomorphic adenoma. Large sized nasal cavity mass with history of epistaxis and which bleeds on probing should be finally assessed under general anaesthesia. It should be excised endoscopically and subjected to histopathological examination.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1936"]}

However, from the observation of the plots indicate unhealthy (lanky trees) under closer spacings. It is, therefore, likely that in the years to come the growth in plots with closer spacing may fa1l whereas under wider spacing the crop may continue to be healthier.

Altered T-cell responses marked by exhaustion of T-cell count with hyperaggressive remaining T-cells and presence of cross-reactive antibodies render infected humans as fertile grounds for development of multisystem disorders. In addition, Vitamin D deficiency in COVID-19 patients can further modify the T cell mediated immunity. Increased circulating cytokines and hyperactive CD8+ T cells can alter the oral immune barriers rendering them susceptible to oral disorders.

Theossicular chain damage is found in both mucosal and squamosal types of COM. We aim to evaluate relationship between preoperative otologic features, pure tone audiometric findings and intraoperative ossicular chain status in patients with chronic otitis media. Material and Methods: 100 patients of either sex aged between 12 to 60 years operated for active or inactive, squamosal or mucosal chronic otitis media attending Ram Lal Eye and ENT Hospital, Government Medical College Amritsar were taken. The preoperative ossicular chain status based on set parameters was compared with the intraoperative ossicular chain status. Results: The ossicular chain integrity is more commonly compromised in squamosal COM and the most common ossicle eroded is Incus. Pure tone audiogram has got a very important role in determining the ossicular chain integrity preoperatively and must be done in all cases with accuracy. Conclusion: It is concluded that on the basis of otoscopic examination and pure tone audiometry values, we can accurately classify the COM as mucosal or squamosal type and get an idea of the ossicular chain integrity preoperatively hence planning the extent of surgery.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1936"]}
