{"title": "Verification of compressible and incompressible computational fluid dynamics codes and residual-based mesh adaptation\n", "abstract": " Code verifition is the process of ensuring, to the degree possible, that there are no algorithm deficiencies and coding mistakes (bugs) in a scientific computing simulation. In this work, techniques are presented for performing code verifition of boundary conditions commonly used in compressible and incompressible Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes. Using a compressible CFD code, this study assesses the subsonic in flow (isentropic and fixed-mass), subsonic out ow, supersonic out ow, no-slip wall (adiabatic and isothermal), and inviscid slip-wall. The use of simplified curved surfaces is proposed for easier generation of manufactured solutions during the verifition of certain boundary conditions involving many constraints. To perform rigorous code verifition, general grids with mixed cell types at the verified boundary are used. A novel approach is introduced to determine manufactured solutions for\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1438"]}
