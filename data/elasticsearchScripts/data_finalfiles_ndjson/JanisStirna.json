BSC are commonly IT-supported and found a conceptual basis for management information systems. They are often applied to IT-Controlling, and they are also repeatedly applied to specify requirements towards the corporate IT architecture. However, BSC implementation often struggles when it comes to discovering and documenting organisational knowledge that is not easily accessible or not of sufficient quality. On the other hand, Enterprise modelling (EM) seeks to solve organisational design problems in, for instance, business process reengineering, strategy planning, enterprise integration, and information systems development. Here, participative EM methods lead to improved quality as well as to consensus and to increased acceptance of the business decisions. At this juncture, participative EM can support BSC implementation projects that comprise activities requiring the discovery and documentation of organisational knowledge that is not easily accessible or not of sufficient quality. For that reason, the aim of this paper is to integrate participative EM approaches, taking Enterprise Knowledge Development (EKD) as an example, and BSC implementation. In order to operationalise this conceptual improvement, we will perform a stepwise analysis of BSC implementation processes and identify shortcomings that are able to be addressed with the help of participative enterprise modelling.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["587"]}

This is due to the fact that insufficient efforts are devoted to elaborating effective solutions for eliciting and documenting patterns, evaluating them, tracing IS designs back to the applied patterns, and assisting the designer in choosing the right pattern in a given contextual situation. These tasks need to be supported by advanced pattern repositories that are able to manage patterns at runtime. The article presents the usage of a Capability Pattern Repository (CPR) in support of an approach for design and delivery of context dependent IS, namely, Capability Driven Development (CDD). The CPR together with CDD provides a tool and a method that support pattern governance for addressing both the design and run-time of IS. The described approach is not bound to CDD and can be adapted to support different types of patterns and development methodologies.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["587"]}

Hence, it is a common practice for malicious actors to target the ICT product supply chain assuming that some members have lax security practices or lag behind in terms of using the latest solutions and protocols. A single company cannot assure the security of complex ICT systems and cannot evaluate risks and therefore, to be successful it needs to tap into a wider network of ICT product developers and suppliers, which in essence leads to forming an ecosystem. We propose in this study that such an ecosystem should be established and managed on the bases of its members capabilities, which in this means capacity to meet desired goals, ie, security and privacy requirements in a dynamic business context.

At its core is the need to connect physical devices with their digital representations which essentially means establishing a digital twin. Currently, the technological development of digital twins has gathered much attention while the organizational and business aspects are less investigated. In response, the suitability of enterprise modeling and capability management for the purpose of developing and management of business-driven digital twins has been analyzed. A number of requirements from literature are summarized and two industrial cases have been analyzed for the purpose of investigating how the digital twin initiatives emerge and what forces drive the start of their implementation projects. The findings are discussed with respect to how Enterprise Modeling and the Capability-Driven Development\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["587"]}
{"title": "A Capability Based Method for Development of Resilient Digital Services\n", "abstract": " Capability Driven Development (CDD) is a capability-based method for developing context-aware and adaptive systems. This paper proposes to extend CDD to address security and resilience concerns in organizational networks. A method extension defining modeling concepts and development procedure is elaborated. It includes development of a data-driven digital twin, which represents the security and resilience concerns of the network and is used to diagnose security incidents and to formulate a resilient response to these incidents. Application of the proposed method extension is illustrated using examples of secure computer network governance and secure supplier onboarding.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["587"]}

{"title": "An Example of an Enterprise Modeling Method: 4EM\n", "abstract": " This chapter gives an overview of the 4EM method for Enterprise Modeling (EM). The purpose of including 4EM in this book is to illustrate the concepts of EM method with an example method. 4EM is a representative of the Scandinavian strand of EM methods. It shares many underlying principles of the so-called multi-perspective approaches that recommend the analysis of organizational problems from several perspectives, such as vision (goals, objective), data (concepts, attributes), business processes (processes, tasks, activities), organizational structure (actors, roles, organizational units), etc.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["587"]}
{"title": "Enterprise Modelling: Establishing the Fundament for Capability Management\n", "abstract": " Enterprise Modelling (EM) is an activity where an integrated model describing different aspects of an enterprise is created. An enterprise model consists of a number of related \u201csub-models\u201d or perspectives, each describing the enterprise from a particular view, for example, processes, business rules, goals, actors, and concepts/information/data. The purpose of using EM in the context of capability management is to capture and document the existing organizational design. The overall vision of capability management approaches, such as Capability-Driven Development (CDD), is to use (and update if necessary) the enterprise models that the organization already has for capability design. However, if an organization does not have existing models or their use is deemed impractical (e.g., they are severely out of date or the quality of models is below acceptable), new models need to be created.

{"title": "A Quality-Driven Methodology for Information Systems Integration\n", "abstract": " Information systems integration is an essential instrument for organizations to attain advantage in today\u2019s growing and fast changing business and technology landscapes. Integration solutions generate added value by combining the functionality and services of heterogeneous and diverse systems. Existing integration environments tend to rely heavily on technical, platform-dependent skills. Consequently, the solutions that they enable are not optimally aligned with the envisioned business goals of the organization. Furthermore, the gap between the goals and the solutions complicates the task of evaluating the quality of integration solutions. To address these challenges, we propose a quality-driven, model-driven methodology for designing and developing integration solutions. The methodology spans organizational and systems design details, providing a holistic view of the integration solution and its underlying business goals. A multi-view meta-model provides the basis for the integration design. Quality factors that affect various aspects of the integration solution guide and inform the progress of the methodology. An example business case is presented to demonstrate the application of the methodology.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["587"]}

{"title": "Quality of Enterprise Models\n", "abstract": " EM usually leads to organizational change and/or development. In some cases this change can be implemented without initiating bigger change projects or the introduction of IT support. In these cases the different models developed might be used only for documentation purposes. In the majority of the EM projects, the models created will be continuously refined, improved, and transformed and, hence, they need to be of high quality. This chapter discusses the notion of model quality and introduces selected techniques for model refinement.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["587"]}

{"title": "Supporting energy efficiency decisions with IT: initial experiences from the EnRiMa project\n", "abstract": " IT solutions can aid decision makers in making informed decisions that lower the energy consumption in buildings. However, in order to design and implement an IT solution there are a number of issues that need to be resolved, for example, adequately handling sometimes contradicting goals of the decision makers and integrating the Decision Support System with the existing building IT infrastructure in the form of building management systems. In this paper we report on our initial experiences from implementing a decision support system for the management of energy consumption in public buildings. The experiences are based on our work with the EnRiMa project that aims to develop a state-of art decision support system for lowering the energy consumption and CO2 emissions of public buildings.

In the year 2004 the conference was hosted by the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Riga Technical University, Latvia. Since the late 1980s, the CAiSE conferences have provided a forum for the presentation and exchange of research results and practical experiences within the? eld of Information Systems Engineering. The conference theme of CAiSE 2004 was Knowledge and Model Driven Information Systems Engineering for Networked Organizations. Modern businesses and IT systems are facing an ever more complex en-ronment characterized by openness, variety, and change. Organizations are-coming less self-su? cient and increasingly dependent on business partners and other actors. These trends call for openness of business as well as IT systems, ie the ability to connect and interoperate with other systems. Furthermore, organizations are experiencing ever more variety in their business, in all c-ceivable dimensions. The di? erent competencies required by the workforce are multiplying. In the same way, the variety in technology is overwhelming with a multitude of languages, platforms, devices, standards, and products. Moreover, organizations need to manage an environment that is constantly changing and where lead times, product life cycles, and partner relationships are shortening. ThedemandofhavingtoconstantlyadaptITtochangingtechnologiesandbu-ness practices has resulted in the birth of new ideas which may have a profound impact on the information systems engineering practices\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["587"]}
