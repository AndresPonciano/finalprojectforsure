{"title": "Anonymous on-demand position-based routing in mobile ad-hoc networks\n", "abstract": " Due to the infrastructure-less, dynamic, and broadcast nature of radio transmissions, communications in mobile ad-hoc networks, MANETs, are susceptible to malicious traffic analysis. After performing traffic analysis, an attacker conducts an intensive attack (ie, a targetoriented attack) against a target node specified by the traffic analysis. Because of the degradation of both throughput and security of routing, traffic analysis and its subsequent targetoriented attack are known as serious problems in regards to MANETs. Basically, position information of routing nodes is very sensitive data in MANETs, where even nodes not knowing each other establish a network temporarily. It is desirable that position information is kept secret. All of these problems are especially prominent in position-based routing protocols of MANETs. Therefore a new position-based routing protocol, which keeps routing nodes anonymous, thereby preventing possible traffic analysis, is proposed. The proposed scheme uses a time-variant temporary identifier, Temp ID, which is computed from the time and position of a node and used for keeping the node anonymous. Only the position of a destination node is required for the route discovery, and the Temp ID is used for establishing a route for sending data. A receiver dynamic-handshake scheme is designed for determining the next hop on-demand by using the Temp ID. The level of anonymity and the performance of this scheme were evaluated. The evaluation results show that the proposed scheme ensures the anonymity of both route and nodes and robustness against a target-oriented attack and other attacks.

However, most identify fake accounts using only the structure of social graphs, leading to poor performance. In this paper, we propose a new and scalable defense scheme, SybilTrap. SybilTrap uses a semi\u2010supervised technique that automatically integrates the underlying features of user activities with the social structure into one system. Unlike other machine learning\u2013based approaches, the proposed defense scheme works on unlabeled data, and it is effective in detecting targeted attacks, because it manipulates different levels of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["339"]}

Most existing key management schemes try to establish shared keys for all pairs of neighbor sensors, no matter whether these nodes communicate with each other or not, and causes large overhead. Recent trend of research mainly consider homogeneous sensor network and a few consider heterogeneous sensor network for key management. In this paper, we consider heterogeneous sensor network (HSN) as a model for our proposed novel key agreement protocol based on pairing identity based encryption (IBE). The proposed scheme reduces the key spaces of the nodes, in fact nodes do not need to store any key of the other nodes rather it computes secret sharing key by using pairing and IBE properties.

Due to the potential of exposing a user's private information while accessing a system, many studies have focused on analyzing existing protocols to develop new methods based on biometrics or additional devices to add new layers of security to the authentication process. For a few years, the idea of utilizing the combination of something you know with something you have and a personal authentication device (PAD) has become common in verification protocols. Very recently, a more secure PAD, namely the Offline Personal Authentication Device (OffPAD), was invented to improve the authentication process.

After emergence of symbiotic network, industrial clusters followed different approaches and faced different difficulties at their uncovering stages. Some successful symbiotic network showed great promise in reducing usage of raw materials. Policy regarding IS has a tremendous impact on the genesis, emergence, and development of it. In this study authors tried to review already followed approaches, benefit obtained and problem faced by the industrial owner along with generalized policy framework they needed at the very early stages of IS network. However, two approaches are followed by industries\u2013planned approach and spontaneous approach though there are factors that helped to initiate symbiotic network. Obtained benefits from IS network can be classified into three categories and these are-environmental benefit, social benefit and economic benefit. On the contrary industrial networks also faced some barriers ie technological barrier, economic barrier, informational barrier, organizational barrier, regulatory barrier, uncertainty and risk of initiating IS network. Thus policies were formulated to ensure sustainability of projects and to overcome barrier. Policy initiatives helps to bring the cooperatives under same industrial symbiotic network, shape a symbiotic network and patronize the symbiotic networks by providing incentives.

Responding to the issue, this paper focuses on development of an elevator group controller based on fuzzy algorithm. By introducing a fuzzy controller in an elevator system, this system is developed to manage the required passenger traffic density keeping passenger waiting times within reasonable limits. To increase the performance of the elevator group three major linguistic variables are introduced within a set of fuzzy rules. These include the average waiting time (AWT), power consumption (PC), and floor traffic (FT). When the passenger traffic is high, the low fuzzy control values reduce the importance of priority of floors rather the estimated arrival time is to be minimized.

Finally, the Sybil accounts led to many malicious activities in the online social network. To detect these kinds of fake accounts in online social network is a big challenge. In this paper, we propose a prevention mechanism for Sybil attack in OSN based on pairing and identity-based cryptography. During the formation of a group when any user wants to join the group, a user needs to pass a trapdoor which is built based on pairing-based cryptography and consists of a challenge and response mechanism (process).

Experiments were conducted as a function of contact time, initial metal ion concentration, solution pH and temperature. The sorption of Pb (II) on used tea leaves increases with increase of initial pH of solution upto a certain limit which corresponds to the pH nearly 5. The sorption isotherms follow Langmuir equation better than Freundlich equation. Again the Langmuir equation is more applicable at higher temperatures compared to those at low temperature at all pH. The monolayer sorption capacity decreases with increase in processing temperature but the overall sorbed amount increased with the increase in temperature at all pH. The positive value of estimated heat of sorption suggests the activated sorption. A probable mechanism of the sorption of Pb (II) on used tea leaves was proposed based on the surface charge of used tea leaves and the change of charge of Pb (II) with the pH of solution.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["339"]}

Both city corporations (Dhaka North, DNCC and Dhaka South, DSCC) have been facing tremendous problem to maintain sustainable waste management over the last few decades. At present, the DNCC and DSCC dump 68% of the total solid waste to the sanitary landfill site at Matuail. Decomposed solid waste is a potential source of heavy metals and toxic chemicals that pollute the soil as well as the surrounding water body. For environmental sustainability, it is now essential to reduce the load of decomposed solid waste at landfill site through the conversion of waste into re-usable product. Proper characterization of solid wastes is pre-requisite for efficient management and solid waste stabilization. In this paper, it is therefore aimed to investigate the physical and chemical characteristics of decomposed solid waste and leachate collected from Matuail landfill sites. The average concentrations of Fe, Cu, and Ni in leachate samples collected from treated pond were found to be 19.11 mg/l, 0.71 mg/l, and 2.5 mg/l respectively exceeding Bangladesh standards. The presence of heavy metals in decomposed solid waste was also found to be significant.

Their traditional medicinal practice, which is generally referred to as folk medicinal practice, is different from other forms of traditional medicine in Bangladesh like Ayurveda and Unani forms of traditional medicine. Kavirajes use simple formulations of medicinal plants, and their practice is often confined to the immediate family and passed on through successive generations. Thus over the centuries, Kavirajes have gained not only extensive knowledge on medicinal plants but also each Kaviraj has his or her own unique list of plants, which he or she uses in formulations. Bangladesh has over 86,000 villages with each village containing one or two practicing Kavirajes.

{"title": "Earthquake and Dhaka City-An Approach to Manage the Impact\n", "abstract": " Dhaka city, the soul of Bangladesh is highly vulnerable to the earthquake disaster due to high density of population, unplanned infrastructure and close proximity with India and Myanmars active seismic area, poor economic condition, poor emergency preparation and recovery capability. A major earthquake might kill about 88,000 people and demolish 72,000 buildings and damage 86,000 others and economic loss due to damage of structures will be from US $650 million to US $1,075 million in the capital Dhaka [9]. The government organizations and strategies and community based organizations is important for the management of devastating impact of earthquake in Dhaka city. By introducing proper policy and planning for disaster management, community awareness build up and training, proper implementation of national building code, well coordination among government organizations and infrastructures and nongovernment organizations, enrichment of well equipped rescue team can limit the impact in a manageable boundary. The policy issues regarding disaster like earthquake could be handled mostly at the national level but planning and implementation issues are to be handled at the local community level. The earthquake hazards can never be resisted but the severe damages of earthquake disaster in Dhaka city can be reduced by increasing capacity as it reduces the risk and vulnerability.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["339"]}

Heads and hulls of black tiger (Penaeus monodon)(BT), white leg (Litopenaeus vannamei)(WL) and argentine red (Pleoticus muelleri)(AR) shrimps were prepared: 2 sizes of specimen were used in BT. Their inedible parts, such as heads and abdominal exoskeleton with tails (hulls) were removed, dried at 55 C and ground to pass through 1.0 mm aperture and then used as SM. Compared with hulls, heads were significantly rich in crude protein (CP) and ether extract (EE), and poor in crude fibre (CF), crude ash (CA) and chitin. Among head groups, CP level was the greatest in WL, EE level in AR, CF level in large and small BT, CA level in 3 species other than WL, chitin level in large BT. Among hull groups, CP level was the greatest in WL, CF level in large and small BT and chitin level in large BT: EE level in hulls were extremely low in all group. Overall, in vitro dry matter (DM) and CP digestibilities were significantly greater in heads than in hulls, which is reasonable because the level of chitin, non-digestible amino polysaccharide, was greater in hulls than heads in all species. There is no great difference in parameters measured between heads and heads+ hulls. The results obtained here suggest that the heads of WL can be a more nutritious source of SM in poultry diets.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["339"]}
{"title": "On the selection of samples in probability proportional to size sampling: cumulative relative frequency method\n", "abstract": " Generally in the sense that, the unit with large size contain more ancillary information than the unit with smaller size. So when samples from different sized subgroups or units are used and sampling is taken with the same probability, the chances of selecting a member from a large group are less than selecting a member from a smaller group although here the chances of selecting a member from a large group will be greater than selecting a member from a smaller group. That is it is clear that, the probability of selecting a unit is positively proportional to its size. The aim of this paper is to propose a method of selecting samples in probability proportional to size. This method uses relative frequency to select samples in probability proportional to size.

A total of 64 irrigation equipment owners and 100 water buyers were selected for this empirical study. The majority (55 percent) of the STW owners run their management activities through partnership arrangements. The management of STW operation by joint owners was found to be more efficient compared to management by single owners. Also a majority (66 percent) of the owners was found to possess higher social statuses who actively engage in local social institutions. These indigenous social institutions have played an important role in solving conflicts for settling and resettling command areas, for resolving conflict among owners and between water buyers and sellers; and finally for sustaining command area management for groundwater irrigation during the last three decades. The indigenous social institutions also contribute to preserving common interest particularly for settling land use and cropping patterns in the study areas.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["339"]}

The disease is endemic in Bangladesh and causes considerable economic losses due to its high morbidity and mortality. The study was undertaken to detect and characterize the PPR virus (PPRV) circulating in Bangladesh. Twelve local isolates of Bangladeshi PPRV were successfully detected from post mortem samples (lymph node, spleen and trachea) of goats and a sheep during the year 2008-2012. The partial N gene of ten isolates and partial F gene of eight isolates were amplified by RT-PCR, and were sequenced. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that PPRVs circulating in Bangladesh belonged to Lineage IV and they formed a separate sub-cluster along with recent isolates from Nepal, Bhutan and China. On genetic analyses, it appeared that the N gene of PPRV is less conserved as compared to the F gene. Two unique amino acid substitutions (K423Q and E426G) were observed in Bangladeshi and Chinese isolates in the partial sequence of N protein. The recent Bangladeshi isolates are somewhat divergent from the earlier Bangladeshi isolate, indicating that the PPRV strains in Bangladesh are continuously changing their genetic character.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["339"]}

{"title": "Secure privacy vault design for distributed multimedia surveillance system\n", "abstract": " Distributed multimedia surveillance systems utilize heterogeneous sensors such as cameras, motion sensors, sound sensors, and RFID in order to provide safety and security to people. However, due to the potential of exposing privacy by these systems, many people are reluctant to be electronically monitored and suffer from privacy loss. In order to overcome this dilemma, the current surveillance systems should adopt improved privacy preservation (i.e. hiding people\u2019s face) mechanism while they are used for typical surveillance tasks. This paper takes a holistic approach to identify the different privacy leakage channels in the distributed video surveillance context and proposes the design of a secure privacy vault to conceal privacy-sensitive data obtained from distributed visual sensors. It also shows how the proposed solution helps to mitigate the potential privacy leakage problems at different levels of the leakage\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["339"]}

The first strategy is a combination of pay-for-performance for providers and subsidized coupons for poor pregnant women, newborns, and under-five children, while the second strategy employs only the pay-for-performance incentives for the providers. Both strategies performed well relative to the comparison site, however strategy II with incentives for providers alone can be introduced at the low-performing but poorer regions; while the poorest areas with greater geographical draw back will benefit from a combination of a demand plus supply side P4P approach.

Forty-two male broiler chicks (8 days old, Ross 308) were randomly divided into 7 dietary groups (control, 5% BT, 10% BT, 15% BT, 5% WL, 10% WL and 15% WL) having similar body weight (6 birds per diet). Metabolisable energy and CP were adjusted to about 3,180 kcal/kg and about 235 g/kg, respectively, and other nutrients were formulated to meet or slightly exceed the requirements. Diet and water were provided ad libitum during the experimental period (8 to 21 days old). The results revealed that body weight gain decreased in BT groups with increasing level of SM (P< 0.05), and feed intake decreased slightly with increasing level of SM in diets. As the result, feed conversion ratio also deteriorated with increasing level of SM. Similar trend was observed in WL groups, but the adverse effects of SM were milder comparing with BT groups. Nitrogen retention in both BT and WL groups tended to decrease with increasing level of SM. Chitin digestibilities in WL groups were greater than the corresponding values in BT groups. In conclusion, it is suggested that WL heads can be more nutritious SM for broiler diets than BT heads.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["339"]}

The interactions between GNR (both pristine and defective) and three gas molecules (Ammonia, Mithane and Water) are deeply studied. A summary of some recent studies is presented so as to show that all GNRs, especially all sub-10 nm GNRs, exhibit semiconducting behavior with finite bandgap which is good to be used as a sensor. A sub-10 nm armchair-edged GNR is selected here to be used as sensing element for these three gases. All three gas molecules showed much stronger adsorption on the defective GNR than that on the pristine GNR. The change in density of state DOS diagram of pristine GNR before and after contacting gas molecules was found to be almost negligible near Fermi level. Change in GNR band feature due to donor type gas molecules was observed to be completely opposite of that for acceptor type gas molecules. The simulation result was compared with previous theoretical and experimental works so as to confirm that the observations from this work are consistent with relevant earlier works. Effect of distance and number of interacting gas molecules on Density of states of GNR was also shown. This work reveals that GNR can be a better sensor than graphene and the sensitivity of GNR-based chemical gas sensors could be drastically improved by introducing the appropriate defect.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["339"]}

ABSTRACT: Cloud computing is one of the most emerging networking technology, which has been considered as significantly effective among different types of users. Using cloud computing can be cost effective and organisation can focus more on their unique business idea instead of IT infrastructure or developing software, if they use IaaS or SaaS according to the business needs. However, there are issues with security of critical business data that is stored on cloud service provider\u2019s server. There are many concerns in regards to cloud computing security, which have many vulnerabilities and threats. In our previous paper, we have investigated security issues for cloud computing environment, where we have revealed the lack of awareness of cloud service providers to ensure the security. In this paper we have discussed about more threats and vulnerabilities of cloud computing, which cover some of the technical aspects of this burning issue. We would like to propose a cost effective and efficient security model for cloud computing environment after identifying the security risks involved in this sector of modern computing.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["339"]}

A structural modeling of the lower arm suspension was developed using Solid Works and aluminum alloys (AA7075-T6) are selected as a suspension arm materials. The linear static stress distribution is investigated using the commercial FEA package, and dynamic analysis was performed using NASTRAN software. Two types of nodes, 4 nodes tetrahedral (TET4) and 10 nodes tetrahedral (TET10) has been used in the finite element modeling. According to the results TET10 are able to capture the higher stresses than TET4 for the same global length. In addition TET10 mesh size 0.1 mm (54178 elements) has been chosen for dynamic analysis because of predicted higher maximum stresses.

Understanding of the spatiotemporal distribution of pollutants and identification of the sources in the river systems is a prerequisite for the protection and sustainable utilization of the water resources. Multivariate statistical techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Factor Analysis (FA) were applied in this study to investigate the temporal and spatial variations of water quality and appoint the major factors of pollution in the Shailmari River system. Water quality data for 14 physicochemical parameters from 11 monitoring sites over the year of 2014 in three sampling seasons were collected and analyzed for this study. Kruskal-Wallis test showed significant (p < 0.01) temporal and spatial variations in all of the water quality parameters of the river water. Principal component analysis (PCA) allowed extracting the contributing parameters affecting the seasonal water quality in the river system. Scatter plots of the PCs showed the tidal and spatial variation within river system and identified parameters controlling the behavior in each case. Factor analysis (FA) further reduced the data and extracted factors which are significantly responsible for water quality variation in the river. The results indicate that the parameters controlling the water quality in different seasons are related with salinity, anthropogenic pollution (sewage disposal, effluents) and agricultural runoff in pre-monsoon; precipitation induced surface runoff in monsoon; and erosion, oxidation or organic pollution (point and non-point\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["339"]}

However, when rendering datasets with ultra-high spatial resolutions, which occupy massive (out-of-core) storage space, some traditional in-core volume rendering algorithms cannot function because the large input data can hardly be handled in the main memory. Simple modifications based on disk cache I/O do not perform well because of the overheads associated with external memory access. To solve this problem, this paper describes a semi-adaptive partitioning strategy and an efficient out-of-core visualization framework with improved volume rendering algorithms.

Shrimp meal (SM) was treated with 3% formic acid (w/v) at room temperature for 20 minutes, sun-dried, ground through a 1.0 mm mesh screen, and then ready to use as the treated SM (TSM). Forty-two male broiler chicks (8 d old, Ross 308) were randomly divided into 7 dietary groups (6 birds each), namely control diet, diets containing 5, 10, and 15% of SM, and diets containing 5, 10, and 15% of TSM and offered diets till 35 d old. Final body weight, body weight gain and feed intake decreased significantly with increasing levels of SM in diets. Feed conversion ratio also decreased with increasing levels of the SM (P< 0.05). Similar trend was observed in the TSM group, but the adverse effects of the TSM were milder in comparison to the SM group (P< 0.05). Dry matter digestibility tended to decrease (P< 0.05) with increasing levels of the SM but unchanged with increasing level of the TSM. Availability of ash decreased with increasing levels of the SM and TSM in diets (P< 0.05). Although N retention decreased (P< 0.05) with increasing level of the SM and TSM in diets but the decreasing trend was milder in the TSM groups than the SM groups. Moreover, chitin digestibility was significantly greater in the TSM groups than the SM groups. In conclusion, broilers received diets containing the TSM showed better growth performance along with improved nutrient digestibility and N retention which suggests that formic acid-treated SM can be used as a potential protein source in\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["339"]}

The environmental factors (water temperature, DO, pH, NO3-N, NH4-N, PO4-P, Fe, Zn, Mn and Cu), soil organic matter, and algal community and density were examined monthly by using standard methods. There was no significant difference in water temperature among BP-R, BP-Y and NBP but significantly lower DO and pH, higher concentrations of NO3-N, NH4-N, PO4-P, Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu and soil organic matter and higher density of euglenophytes were recorded in BP-R and BP-Y as compared to NBP (P< 0.05). The euglenophytes were composed of three genera, Euglena, Phacus and Trachelomonas among which Euglena (E. sanguinea) was highly dominant. The density of euglenophytes in BP-R and BP-Y showed an increasing trend from September (early autumn) and peaked in November (late autumn) and December (early winter). The density of these algae was negatively correlated with water temperature, DO and pH while positively correlated with NO3-N, NH4-N, PO4-P, Fe, Zn, Mn and Cu concentrations (P< 0.05).", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["339"]}

Western countries have experienced dramatic reductions in the incidence of and mortality from invasive cervical cancer (Day, 1984; Hristova & Hakama, 1997; Duguid, Duncan, & Currie, 1985; Taylor et al., 2001). In developed countries, incidence rates of cervi\u2010-cal cancer are generally low and accounts for only 3.6%(Bray et al., 2005). The dispropor\u2010-tionate burden of cervical cancer in developing countries and elsewhere in medically underserved populations is mainly due to lack of effective screening program (Hristova & Hakama, 1997; Duguid, Duncan, & Currie, 1985; Taylor et al., 2001).Cervical cancer is almost completely preventable, because unlike many cancers, which are caused by a number of physical, genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors, almost all cer\u2010-vical cancer is caused by a sexually transmitted virus, the human papillomavirus (HPV)(Kari & Mark, 2008). Over the past decades, scientists, public health researchers, clinicians, policymakers, women\u2019s health and cancer advocates and private sector partners have worked tirelessly to raise global awareness of cervical cancer.

{"title": "Thorny issues of stakeholder identification and prioritization in requirement engineering process\n", "abstract": " Identifying the stakeholder in requirement engineering process is one of the critical issues. It performs a remarkable part for successful project completion. The software project largely depends on several stakeholders. Stakeholder identification and prioritization is still a challenging part in the software development life cycle. Most of the time, the stakeholders are treated with less importance during the software deployment. Additionally, there is a lack of attempt to think about the right project stakeholder by the development team. In maximum cases, the stakeholder identification technique is performed incorrectly and there is a lack of attempt to mark out them with priority. Besides, there are so many limitations on the existing processes which are used for identifying stakeholders and setting their priority. These limitations pose a negative impact on the development of software project, which should be pointed out by giving deep concern on it. We are aiming to focus on this typical fact, so that we can figure out the actual problem and current work on identifying stakeholders and setting their priority.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["339"]}
{"title": "Comparison between design event and joint probability hydrological modelling\n", "abstract": " The Design Event Approach (DEA) is a well-established method amongst practitioners, whilst the Joint Probability Approach (JPA) is still in developmental stages. An initial assessment indicates that as yet, there are no clear industry standards for applying the JPA to hydrological modelling.

They are named TPT (Total Probability Theorem) and CRC-CH (Cooperative Research Centre\u2013Catchment Hydrology) JPA methodologies in this paper. This study briefly describes the technical differences between the abovementioned approaches, applying both approaches to eight catchments of the Gold Coast and comparing their results with DEA estimates. The selected catchments cover a wide range of hydrological and physiographical features and therefore highlight the differences between these methodologies more sharply. The contribution of this study to the body of knowledge is to provide more insight into the JPA methodologies and to generate a better understanding of their differences with the DEA methodology.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["339"]}

These studies served to identify analogue states as standing well above the background of numerous fine resonances (normal states) that are not easily amenable to other methods and thus offer a powerful means of extracting information of interest in nuclear spectroscopy. Analogue states in 52Cr have been studied as proton resonances in~ IV up to ED~ 2.7 MeV (3-4); there appears some discrepancy amongst these measurements as shown in Table I and a few well-established states in s~ V do not seem to have any analogues in s'-Cr. This motivated us to undertake the present experiment and we have extended the proton energy to 3 MeV.The experiment was performed with a proton\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["339"]}
{"title": "Remediation of heavy metal polluted soil through organic amendments\n", "abstract": " This study was conducted to determine the effects of organic materials to remediate contaminated soil with heavy metals. A pot study was performed by growing maize (Zea mays) in metal contaminated soil (10 kg pot-1) and soils amendments with cow manure dust, poultry manure dust, vermicompost dust, fern dust, water hyacinth dust, mustard stover dust and barnyard grass dust each at 5 g kg-1 soil. The results showed that Pb, Cd, Ni, Cr and Co uptake by maize depended on the organic materials type. Water hyacinth dust, fern dust, mustard stover dust, and barnyard grass dust addition led to decreased metal content in maize, and this decrease was better expressed with 20.5 to 33.3% for fern dust, 17.3 to 22.0% for water hyacinth, 18.6 to 21.3% for mustard stover dust, 17.33 to 20.5% for barnyard grass dust. Cow manure dust, poultry manure dust and vermicompost dust led to increased metal content in the maize, and this increase was 6.80 to 18.7% for cow manure, 18.9 to 86.7% for poultry manure and 17.4 to 16.0% for vermicompost. The different effectiveness of organic amendment on metal uptake by maize plant could be due to the nature of organic matter where water hyacinth dust, fern dust, mustard stover dust, and barnyard grass dust were mainly originated from plant. On the other hand, cow manure, poultry manure and vermicompost were mainly the excreta collected from cattle, poultry and earthworms.

{"title": "Detection of arsenic in animal feed chain: broken rice and water hyacinth\n", "abstract": " Currently arsenic contamination in Bangladesh is considered to be the biggest natural calamity in the world in the terms of total population affected in an area. Arsenic is spreading in various ways in the environment and significantly threatening the public health as well as animal health of Bangladesh. With a view to detect the level of arsenic concentration in animal feed chain this study was performed by using the FI-HG-AAS (Flow Injection Hydride Generator Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer) method. Broken rice and water hyacinth samples, two commonly used animal feeds, were collected from arsenic contaminated areas of Comilla district. After collection, the samples were prepared by a series of steps such as, washing, drying and digestion; finally arsenic was detected by atomic absorption spectrophotometric method. Atomic absorption measures the amount of energy absorbed by the samples. Through this method the type of metal absorbed by the sample can be determined. The mean arsenic concentration in broken rice and water hyacinth were 0.213\u00b10.125 ppm (n= 35) and 0.487\u00b10.172 ppm (n= 29), respectively. In this study it is found that the level of arsenic both in broken rice and water hyacinth is greater than that of the maximum permissible level in drinking water (0.05 ppm). From the findings of the present study, it can be concluded that in the same arsenic contaminated area, the level of arsenic in water hyacinth is nearly the double of that found in rice due to arsenic accumulating nature of water hyacinth.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["339"]}

Grammar translation method is a very traditional method, and i think in more or less in all medium schools it is mainly used. I also use Grammar translation method for teaching the students. From my point view in our Bangladeshi culture especially beginner level of students need appropriate use of both native language (L1) and target language (L2). And for that reason grammar translation method is suitable. Also in Asian part of the world the parents are very conscious about their child's results. And GTM method also helps students to get good grades in English. Also students need to know the meaning of different words and GTM helps to fulfill that. I taught the students by GTM method which included some more activities and i think those techniques helped them a lot. So by a good feedback, well guidance from a teacher, effective error correction could give a student's progression and fluency. From my internship result I found that by GTM method and with my other efforts students developed a lot in their academic results and also in speaking fluency by target language (L2) where both are equally important.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["339"]}

Uncertainty and doubt dominate all aspects of CNS tuberculosis. Diagnosis is mainly based on clinical features, cerebrospinal fluid changes, and imaging characteristics. Few studies have shown that corticosteroids improve the clinical outcome, although the precise mechanism of action remains tentative. All the cases were selected on strong clinical suspicion of CNS tuberculosis. They were graded according to tuberculous meningitis (TM) severity grades. In this connection, we studied 13 patients in one medicine unit over 12 month's period to see the effect of corticosteroid as part of the outcome. Nine patients (69.23%) were in grade II, three (23.08%) patients were in grade III, and one (7.69%) was in grade I. Seven patients (53.85%) had tuberculous meningitis and six (46.15%) had tuberculoma (CT or MRI). Out of 13 cases 3 patients (23%) died in the hospital and 10 patients (77%) improved, of whom 2 patients (20%) recovered completely and 8 patients (80%) had residual neurological deficit. Our study suggests that the early detection of CNS tuberculosis is the most important prognostic factor.

Cows calving during the monsoon had a shorter (P< 0.05) mean calving interval (479 days) and also had a shorter (P< 0.05) calving to conception interval (187\u00b123 days) than those calving in other seasons (197\u00b122 days). UMMB supplementation increased body weight from 49.6\u00b110.2 to 149\u00b112 kg in heifers and induced ovarian cyclicity between 26 and 34 months of age. Supplementation of UMMB in pre-partum cows increased live weight gain from 186 to 220 kg after parturition. Suckling suppressed cyclic ovarian activity for 175 to 196 days, whereas partially suckled cows had a shorter interval to onset of ovarian cyclicity (84-147 days). However, signs of oestrus were observed earlier in UMMB supplementation with partial suckling (34-84 days). Based on plasma and milk progesterone concentration on the day of service, 42 (91%) and 52 (89.6%) cows were confirmed as in true oestrus, respectively. Thirty two (76%) and 30 (71%) cows were diagnosed pregnant by plasma progesterone assay at days 20 and 24, respectively. At the same time 40 (77%) and 36 (71%) cases were diagnosed pregnant by milk progesterone assay. Assuming 100% accuracy for rectal diagnosis of pregnancy between days 60-65 post service, the progesterone assay was found to be 84% and 90% accurate for plasma samples obtained at day 20 and 24, respectively.

The broad inference from the present study is that the employees of Crescent Jute Mills, Khulna, have not yet achieved a high level of job satisfaction. A fully-structured questionnaire-based study of the attitudes of 50 workers and 20 management personnel of Crescent Jute Mills revealed that the vast majority of the employees are dissatisfied with various job aspects, directly affecting job satisfaction levels. Thus, it can be said that labour-management relations that exist in this mill are far from satisfactory. There are several reasons for this' state of affairs. The important reasons are the presence of dissatisfaction with salary and benefits, certain maldistribution of facilities by the authorities, bad factory working conditions, lack of recognition for good performance, unsatisfactory state of housing and recreation, inadequate training facilities, and inadequate supervision.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["339"]}

Yield of 4 varieties significantly varied among the locations. The highest mean yield was obtained from Rangpur region (4275.15 kg ha-1) followed by Jessore region (4266 kg ha-1). Yield of these two regions were statistically similar but significantly higher than other regions. In AMMI analysis, AMMI-1 biplot showed that Rangpur and Rajshahi were favorable environments; Sylhet and Comilla were unfavorable environments. Considering varieties, BARI Gom 26 and BARI Gom 25 were more stable and can be recommended for all environmental condition of Bangladesh. On the other hand, BARI Gom 27 was the most sensitive to changing environments. In AMMI-2 biplot, Comilla, Sylhet and Dhaka were the most discriminating environments for all tested varieties, while BARI Gom 26 and BARI Gom 25 were more stable varieties. The most suitable varieties for Rangpur, Rajshahi and Mymensingh was BARI Gom 26; BARI Gom 25 for Sylhet; BARI Gom 27 for Comilla, Jessore and Barishal while BARI Gom 28 was suitable for Dhaka. Among the varieties, BARI Gom 26 and BARI Gom 25 had higher mean grain yield values\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["339"]}

{"title": "Towards secure data exchange in peer-to-peer data management systems\n", "abstract": " In a peer-to-peer data management system (P2PDMS) peers exchange data in a pair-wise fashion on-the-fly in response to user queries without any centralized control. When peers exchange highly confidential data over an insecure communication channel, the data might be intercepted and read by intruders. As there is no centralized control for data exchange among peers in a P2PDMS, we cannot assume any central third party security infrastructure (eg PKI) to protect confidential data. This paper proposes a security protocol for data exchange in P2PDMSs based on pairing-based cryptography and data exchange policy. The protocol allows the peers to compute their secret session keys dynamically during data exchange session by computing a pairing on an elliptic curve, that is based on the policies between them. We show using a formal verification tool that the proposed protocol is safe, and is robust against different attacks including man-in-the middle, the masquerade, and the reply. Furthermore, the computational and communication overhead of the protocol are analyzed.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["339"]}

Analysis of Omp31 of Brucella melitensis M28 with NetMHCII 2.2, SYFPEITHI, ProPred and NetCTL 1.2 servers for identification of T cell epitope predicted an epitope 125-VRARLGYTATERLMV-139. These four servers also predicted that the epitope could bind with at least 6 major histocompatibility complex class-II (MHC II) and 5 MHC I molecules. The epitope shared~ 86.93% identity with Omp31 of all human antigenic Brucella spp. Analysis with different bioinformatics tools revealed that this epitope was highly stable and capable to induce T cell-mediated immunity. Finally, molecular docking simulation showed that it could bind with the binding groove of MHC II and MHC I molecules with numerous significant hydrogen bonds.

The success of the sector, therefore, has important implications for food security and as a source of income for a growing number of producers. Consequently, any potential direct or indirect effects of climate change on aquaculture must be taken seriously.The major consequences of climate change include ice melting, sea-level rise, irregular drought and rain, cyclonic storms, coastal erosion, inundation of low-lying areas, salinity intrusion and groundwater contamination. Sea-level rise will have gradual impacts because of the loss of land from inundation and erosion. Salinization of groundwater may reduce the availability of freshwater for aquaculture, agriculture, domestic and industrial uses. Similar problems may arise with increasing the frequency of droughts. Severe droughts may lead to water shortages and massive forest fires. Forest fires release millions of tons of carbon into the atmosphere, creating a dangerous feedback loop that further accelerates global warming. The severity and frequency of storm surges increase from the effects of mean sea-level rise and the loss of natural defenses, such as mangrove forests. High winds and waves destroy structures used for coastal aquaculture such as embankments, pond dikes, sluice gates, hatcheries, electricity poles and cage materials, resulting in loss of stock and damage to equipment and facilities. Damage to farm infrastructure can also cause saline water intrusion in the culture pond (FAO 2008). The financial impacts of cyclonic storms\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["339"]}

{"title": "Correlation between non-conventional plants consumed during food scarcity and their folk medicinal usages: a case study in two villages of Kurigram district, Bangladesh\n", "abstract": " Since the advent of human beings, they have probably suffered from food scarcity at various times or other as a result of a number of factors, including seasonal non-availability of food, failure of crops, and lack of game or domesticated animals. During those times, it appears to be the universal practice for humans to resort to consuming non-conventional foods, most of which are plant derived. This is more so in modern times, when the human race as a whole has become dependent on a few species of plants to serve as their staple diet. Any crop failure due to adverse weather or soil conditions lead to large-scale non-availability of food, which in its severest form is known as famine. In addition, a huge segment of the world population suffers from poverty and thus is unable to procure enough food to satisfy their hunger and nutritional requirements. This is the case also for Bangladesh where even at present, surveys indicates that around 32% of the population have incomes below the poverty level of US $1 per day. Additionally, the northern districts of Bangladesh suffer from a seasonal famine known as Monga during two periods every year. During these periods, the population, particularly the poorest sections of the population rely on various edible non-conventional plants to serve as their nutritional sources. We hypothesize that this choice of plants to be consumed during times of food scarcity has been a result of trial and error not only on the nutritional values of the plants, but also on their medicinal values. Diseases in a multitude of forms are present in the human population, and most of these diseases are exacerbated during malnutrition\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["339"]}

Such discharges may originate from the vagina, ovaries, fallopian tubes, or, most commonly, the cervix. In our ongoing ethnomedicinal surveys among the various tribes and regions of Bangladesh, it was observed that leukorrhea due to infections were common among the tribal women as evidenced by the number of plants used by the tribal medicinal practitioners to treat this infective condition. The objective of the present survey was to learn more about the medicinal plants used for treatment of leukorrhea by the tribal medicinal practitioners of the Chakma, Murong and Tonchonga tribes. All three tribes reside in the southeastern forested region of Bangladesh known as the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Informed consent was obtained from the tribal medicinal practitioners and interviews were conducted with the help of a semi-structured questionnaire and the guided field-walk method. It was observed that the tribal medicinal practitioners of the Chakma, Murong, and Tonchonga tribes used 13 plant species distributed into 12 families for treatment of leukorrhea.

{"title": "An investigation of overturning moments of portal frames at elevated temperatures\n", "abstract": " In the UK, single-storey steel buildings account for over half of the constructional steelwork due to its ease of fabrication and cost-efficiency. The most common of these are portal frames. One of the major disadvantages of constructional steel is its sensitivity to fire, as steel looses strength and stiffness rapidly. For this reason, fire protection is often required, which can add to the expense of structure. In fire, the rafter often loses stability through a snap-through-buckling mechanism (see Fig. 1.). This, however, can be capable of restabilising at high deflections, when the roof has inverted. In static analysis methods, only the initial loss of stability can be determined. In fire conditions it is imperative that boundary walls stay close to vertical, so that fire is not allowed to spread to adjacent property. The current UK fire design guide (Ref.1) provided by Steel Construction Institute (SCI) provides a method for the determination of the overturning moment at the column base that must be resisted in order to prevent stability of walls. However, the method makes a number of arbitrary assumptions and does not attempt to model the true behaviour of the frame during fire.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["339"]}

Homeopathic physicians seek to cure their patients on the physical, mental and emotional levels, and each treatment is tailored to a patient's individual needs. Considering these ideas a cross sectional study was conducted in Dhaka city from March to July, 2008 to determine the characteristics of patients seeking homeopathic treatment. A sample of 250 patients was selected for interview for the study. About one third (31%) of the patients prefer homeopathic treatment and the rest also take other treatments like Allopathic, Ayurbedic and Unani. Majority of the patients chose homeopathic treatment as it has long lasting cure (54%), low cost (27%) and no side effect (25%). The common diseases for which homeopathic treatment was sought were skin diseases (16%), gastrointestinal diseases (15%), genital diseases (14%), ENT diseases (13%) and musculo-skeletal diseases (12%). About 76% patients had previous experience of homeopathic treatment, while 24% received it for the first time.

The crab cavity is a beam-deflecting cavity excited with the 508 MHz, TM110-like mode. To extract unwanted parasitic modes, the cavity has a squashed cell shape and a coaxial coupler along the beam pipe. The prototype cavities were tested in a vertical cryostat with/without the coaxial coupler. We observed multipacting at the first RF excitation. To study this event in detail, we measured temperatures of the coupler and cavity during RF tests. Temperature measurement showed that multipacting occurred at the tip of coaxial coupler at low RF fields, and then along the coaxial line. These events were processed in an hour. We observed another type of temperature rise around the iris. Temperature rise began at low fields, continued to rise up to a surface peak field of 18 MV/m, and then, disappeared above 20 MV/m. The excitation mode of the crab cavity has a maximum magnetic field and zero electric field on the same iris position. Temperature rise near this region suggests the multipacting events. A model simulation shows a stable two-point multipacting can exist at this position. We will present temperature measurement results and discuss multipacting near the iris.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["339"]}

{"title": "Novel remote authentication protocol using heart-signals with chaos cryptography\n", "abstract": " Entity authentication is one of the fundamental information security properties for secure transactions and communications. The combination of biometrics with cryptography is an emerging topic for authentication protocol design. Among the existing biometrics (e.g., fingerprint, face, iris, voice, heart), the heart-signal contains liveness property of biometric samples. In this paper, a remote entity authentication protocol has been proposed based on the randomness of heart biometrics combined with chaos cryptography. To this end, initial keys are generated for chaotic logistic maps based on the heart-signal. The authentication parameters are generated from the initial keys that can be used for claimants and verifiers to authenticate and verify each other, respectively. In this proposed technique, as each session of communication is different from others, therefore many session-oriented attacks are prevented.

Male Swiss albino mice were divided into four groups as normal control, diabetic control, EEAS-treated and glibenclamide-treated diabetic mice. Diabetes was induced in mice by intraperitoneal administration of streptozotocin (50mg/kg of body weight) and treatment was started 14 days after diabetes induction. In extract-treated mice, EEAS was orally given at a dose of 200mg/kg for 28 days and its effect on blood glucose level and body weight was determined on a weekly basis. On completion of the treatment, fasting blood sample was collected to estimate a range of indicators including blood lipid profile, serum glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT) and serum glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (SGPT). Oral administration of EEAS in diabetic mice resulted in significant (P< 0.01 to P< 0.001) reduction in blood glucose level which was accompanied by an increase in body weight. EEAS treatment significantly (P< 0.05 to P< 0.01) reversed abnormal status of lipid profile towards near normal levels compared to diabetic control mice. In addition, there was a significant (P< 0.001) decrease in the activities of SGOT and SGPT in extract-treated diabetic mice compared to untreated diabetic mice indicating the protective role of the extract against liver damage. The findings of this study suggest that ethanol extract of garlic grown in Bangladesh possesses the capability of managing hyperglycemia and complications of diabetes in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice.

Tannery generates huge amount of solid and liquid wastes. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a potential treatment to stabilize waste and produce biogas for renewable energy. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of AD of tannery solid waste (TSW) generated from the pretanning operation and to compare the effect of cow dung as the substrate to TSW. For the reaction with TSW by mixing with different substrates, biogas production was observed starting on 4th day with a steady increase. The cumulative gas production from each of the test reactors operating at the various organic loading of tannery solid waste, domestic sewage, and cow dung were different. This study shows an optimal AD process of TSW by mixing with different substrates for the obtained optimum C/N ratio and also for the high volatile solids (VS). The COD removal rates for the series of 5 reactors (R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5) were 48.75, 50.84, 46.07, 45.94 and 47.78% respectively.

The experiment was laid out in a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with three replications. Sucrose, aluminium sulphate and their combinations had significant influence on most of the parameters studied. Transpiration loss and water uptake ratio decreased significantly with the increased sugar levels and aluminium sulphate upto 0.75 mM beyond which they were increased. Transpiration loss and water uptake ratio was found minimum in the vase solution containing 4% sucrose (0.78) and 0.75 mM aluminium sulphate (0.80), which ultimately resulted in an enhanced vase life (9.2 days for sucrose and 9.11 days for aluminium sulphate) of cut Hippeastrum flower. A linear relationship between water uptake and vase life of flowers was found (y= 0.056 x+ 5.791). Sucrose 4% and aluminium sulphate 0.75 mM in combination gave maximum total water uptake, maximum days to onset of deterioration, the highest average fresh weight of single scape at 6 th and 10 th day after setting the trial.

{"title": "A conceptual analysis and understanding of press freedom from Bangladesh perspective\n", "abstract": " Press freedom is a much debated topic in the world today. It is getting much attention and space in academia, civil liberties debates, political discourse and aid programming decisions. Sometimes a press freedom index is used as a lobbying tool facilitating international aid, fund disbursement, international relations, trade and business in developing countries. This article explores the conceptual dynamics of the phenomenon from Bangladesh perspective. Indicators of press freedom, developed by Freedom House and Reporters Without Borders, have been analyzed to understand the phenomenon. A multi-method approach has been used to collect relevant data through email questionnaire survey, interviews of journalists and journalism academics and from group discussions of journalism students. The article concludes that press freedom in Bangladesh is largely the freedom of media owners, not of the working journalists.

{"title": "A data mining approach to improve military demand forecasting\n", "abstract": " Accurately forecasting the demand of critical stocks is a vital step in the planning of a military operation. Demand prediction techniques, particularly autocorrelated models, have been adopted in the military planning process because a large number of stocks in the military inventory do not have consumption and usage rates per platform (eg, ship). However, if an impending military operation is (significantly) different from prior campaigns then these prediction models may under or over estimate the demand of critical stocks leading to undesired operational impacts. To address this, we propose an approach to improve the accuracy of demand predictions by combining autocorrelated predictions with cross-correlated demands of items having known per-platform usage rates. We adopt a data mining approach using sequence rule mining to automatically determine crosscorrelated demands by assessing frequently co-occurring usage patterns. Our experiments using a military operational planning system indicate a considerable reduction in the prediction errors across several categories of military supplies. 1", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["339"]}

Solution of governing equations of momentum and energy has been made by finite element technique. Above mentioned parameters such as an aspect ratio which is cavity height to cavity length change from Ar= 0.5 to 2 for different Rayleigh numbers and Hartmann numbers which change from Ra= 10 3 to 10 5 and Ha= 0 to 50 respectively. Prandtl number Pr= 7 and Reynolds number Re= 100 is fixed in this simulation. It is found that variation of the aspect ratio makes an important effect for higher values of Rayleigh numbers. Heat transfer enhances with increasing of aspect ratio. Increasing of Hartmann number decreases the heat transfer inside the cavity.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["339"]}

We prospectively reviewed the records of all the patients who developed rectourethral fistula. Total 18 patients were included and in all cases faecal and urinary diversion was done preoperatively. In 4 patients fistulas size was< 1cm where spontaneous closure of RUF occured after 6 months of diversion. In 8 patients repair of fistula was done through the perineal approach where excision of fistulas tract with anastomotic urethroplasty and repair of rectal wound was done. Out of these 8 patients tunica vaginalis flap was applied in 3 and dartos pedicle flap in 5 cases, in the remaining 6 patients transrectal York-Mason repair was done. Out of 6 patients of York-Mason repair, one developed recurrent fistula-which underwent repair with a graft through the perineal approach later on with good result. No patient developed urinary or faecal incontinence. In 2 patients leakage of urine was noted in post operative days in the perineal wound and catheter was kept for 3 weeks more. No one had erectile dysfunction. Both faecal & urinary diversion adds benefit to the outcome of the rectourethral fistula. Transrectal York-Mason repair is easier to do with less morbidity and complication while perineal approach with graft interposition may be done in cases where anastomotic urethroplasty is needed along with fistula repair.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["339"]}

Annual flooding, cyclones and other natural hazards cause huge fluctuation in rice yields, the country\u2019s most important crop, are subject to huge fluctuations. Climate change is already happening in Bangladesh and the associated adversities are expected to increase the unpredictability of smallholder farming. This is pushing Bangladesh\u2019s smallholder farmers away from cereal cultivation or out of agriculture altogether. Eighty percent of Bangladesh\u2019s food is produced by smallholders, and this shift threatens the food security of the country. Increases in net production of rice as well as resilience of rice crops to the effects of climate change have thus become urgent and pivotal issues and challenging for the continued progress towards Bangladesh\u2019s goal of food self-sufficiency.In the above backdrop, this article aims, firstly, to proffer a critical overview of rice production, small holder farms and agriculture in Bangladesh in the context of climate change; and secondly, to furnish selected policy suggestions towards greater climatic and social resilience of agriculture and rice production. The study makes several suggestions to policy makers for improving and expanding agricultural extension services, including (a) the provision of saltresistant rice varieties to coastal areas, and (b) improvement of extension services with a focus on smallholder and women farmers-which may be relevant not only for Bangladesh, but also for similar territories in South Asia.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["339"]}

In Bangladesh, these could not be ensured earlier due to a lack of proper rules and regulation. To streamline the public procurement activities, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh has enacted Public Procurement Act (PPA) 2006 and thereafter issued Public Procurement Rules (PPR) 2008. Since then government agencies are bound to abide by the Act and Rules very strictly in their procurement activities. The Central Procurement Technical Unit (CPTU) of the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED) is continually monitoring the compliance of PPA 2006 and PPR 2008 by the target agencies in the light of 45 predetermined Key Performance Indicators (KPI). Among the four target agencies, LGED is the largest in terms of budget allocation against the projects in the Annual Development Programme (ADP). It is generally said that a total of 80% of ADP allocation are spent for procurement of goods, works and services which are administered by PPR 2008. Thus, it seems to be a good consideration to have a look at the compliance issues of PPR 2008 in LGED\u2019s procurement activities. The research has been designed under the questions if LGED is following PPR 2008 completely or not; and if not, then the causes behind that.

{"title": "Effects of lubrication in warm powder compaction process\n", "abstract": " Warm compaction is an advanced manufacturing technique which consists of two consecutive steps, ie powder compaction at above ambient temperature and sintering in a controlled environment. Due to the relative movement between the powder mass and die wall as well as sliding among powder particles, frictional force is generated during the compaction stage. Admixed lubricant is used during the compaction step in order to minimize friction and hence improve the uniformity of the density of distribution inside the component. However, during the sintering process, trapped lubricant is often found to be burnt out hence leaving pores or voids which result in the lower strength of the final products. Warm compaction was initiated in the nineties, however not much information has been published about the effects of lubrication on the quality of the components produced through this route. Therefore, this paper presents the outcome of an experimental investigation about the effects of lubrication on manufacturing near-net shape components through the warm compaction route. Iron powder ASC 100.29 was mixed mechanically with zinc stearate to prepare the feedstock. Mixing time, weight percentage of lubricant content and compaction temperature were varied during green compact generation while sintering temperature, heating rate and holding time were manipulated during sintering. The relative densities and strengths of the final products were investigated at every compaction as well as sintering parameter.

The seedlings were grown in green house condition for three months in nutrient solution with 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3 mg . This study showed that Cr led to the change of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) and activities at different concentrations. The activity of antioxidant enzymes in leaves of K. candel seedlings indicates that enzymes engaged in antioxidant defense in certain level especially in low concentration of Cr treatments. The activities of SOD and POD were activated by Cr in the root level, while CAT activity was inhibited. CAT activity decreased in response to high concentrations of Cr. In the present study indicated that SOD in root was active in scavenging the superoxide produced by Cr. Both in roots and leaves, an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) content was observed with increase in metal concentration and exposure periods.

Mortality rate has increased 40%-50% in advanced cardiac failure and 15%-25% in mild to moderate cardiac failure within one year of diagnosis. There is no established biochemical marker for the diagnosis, prognosis and staging of heart failure. Cardiac Troponin I may be a novel useful tool in identifying patients with Heart failure who are at increased risk for progressive ventricular dysfunction and death. Thirty six congestive heart failure cases and thirty six healthy controls were included in this study and serum cardiac troponin I and Ejection fraction were measured. All the study subjects were grouped according to the NYHA class they belong. Cardiac troponin I was significantly higher in CHF cases than the controls. Troponin I also significantly differed among groups. EF of cases was significantly lower than the controls and also differed among groups. A significant negative correlation between cardiac troponin I and progressive decline of ejection fraction was evident in this study. Cardiac troponin I increased progressively with progression of heart failure. Thus, Cardiac troponin I could be used to stratify patients undergoing heart failure in to high and low risk groups for future cardiac events.

Significantly (p<0.05) higher cell density of euglenophytes was observed in the ponds treated with chicken manure followed by the ponds treated with both cow dung and chicken manures and the ponds treated with only cow dung. The higher cell density of euglenophytes was explained by acidic pH (around 6.5) and higher phosphate-phosphorus (1.37 mg/1) and nitrate-nitrogen (1.47 mg/I) concentrations. The population size of euglenophytes showed positive correlation with phosphate-phosphorus and nitrate-nitrogen concentration while negative with pH. Nutrient enrichment and acidic pH enhanced the growth of euglenophytes but reduced the growth of chlorophytes and bacillariophytes.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["339"]}

{"title": "Depth preference of fish species in seasonally inundated floodplain habitats: an attempt at habitat-based assessment of fish yield and biodiversity\n", "abstract": " A study in three floodplain beels within the Bangshi-Dhaleswari floodplain in northcentral Bangladesh during April-October 1996 demonstrated a depth-based floodplain fisheries assessment methodology. Fish species, numbers and length data were sampled from five flood depth classes. Presence of fish species, fish concentration (no./100 cu m) and biomass (g/100 cu m) were analyzed by depth classes. The highest fish concentration and biomass occurred in the shallowest depth class and declined through the deeper depth classes. A total of 96 species were sampled and categorized into 16 similar groups (guilds). Ranking of concentration by guild resulted in: prawn 44%, perch and gourami 17%, glassfish 12%, barb 11%, cyprineid 6%, snakehead 4%, gobie 3%, eel 2% and cyprinidone 1%. More species were found in deeper waters (depth90cm) than in shallower depth classes. Depth classes where guilds were concentrated were mapped throughout the flood cycle. Household surveys carried out as a part of the study indicated that the landless poor obtain about 50% of their fish from markets and 50% from fishing. More than 90% of fishing effort by subsistence fishers occurred in water less than 120 cm deep. Quantifying the depth preferences of fish in terms of concentration of fish at various depths could be used to assess the potentially serious negative fishery impacts of loss of shallow flooded areas caused by flood control and drainage infrastructure and associated agricultural development", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["339"]}

{"title": "Study of Possible Contamination of Jute Fibre with Petroleum Based Toxic Hydrocarbons Processed with Vegetable Based Oil\n", "abstract": " ABSTRACT A systematic study of the possible contamination of jute products with normal hydrocarbons treated with vegetable based oil such as palm oil and castor oil has been carried out. The results indicate that such types of oils and raw jute do not contain any normal hydrocarbons. If the oils and the jute processing containers are contaminated with normal hydrocarbons then it may consequently contaminate the jute products. The concentration of such toxic hydrocarbons in jute products depends on the extent of contamination of oil and the processing system. Palm oil may be used for jute processing in view of obtaining hydrocarbon-free jute products. In the present study, hydrocarbons from different types of jute fibres treated with palm oil and castor oil were extracted in n-hexane, concentrated, separated from polar compounds and further concentrated and analysed by GLC equipped with FID using two different types of column ie Megabore Column I (SE-54) and Packed Column II (OV-101). The results thus obtained are discussed on the basis of possible contamination of jute products with petroleum based toxic hydrocarbons processed with vegetable oil.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["339"]}

{"title": "Generic Construction of Dual-Server Public Key Encryption With Keyword Search on Cloud Computing\n", "abstract": " Chen  et al.  indicated the inner keyword guessing attack coming from the low entropy of keywords, which eliminates the semantic security of most keyword search schemes. Then, they accordingly propose the first dual-server PEKS scheme (abbreviated as DS-PEKS) and its related security models to prevent such attacks. In the DS-PEKS architecture, two non-collusive servers must corporate to execute the keyword search procedure. No individual server has the capability of determining the equivalence between keywords alone, and thus the inner keyword guessing attacks can be avoided. In this article, we found that the security models are lack of soundness and strength, so our first result is to define new stronger and sounder security models which implies all security aspects of original models. Secondly, we also propose a generic construction of DS-PEKS schemes based on IND-CCA2 secure PKE schemes\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["339"]}

The chiral chromatographic separation was achieved with ammonium acetate/ethanol/2-propanol/methylene dichloride (100: 150: 70: 30, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using a chiral CD-PH column. The HPLC analyses were monitored at 254 nm. The method showed a good linearity with regression coefficient (r 2) of 0.998 in the range of 20.0-70.0 \u03bcg/ml for escitalopram. The detection limit (LOD), quantitation limit (LOQ) and average percentage of recovery for escitalopram were found to be 2.54, 7.68 \u03bcg/ml and 100.28% to 102.86%, respectively. The percentage of relative standard deviation (% RSD) for intra-and inter-day precision were found as 0.16% and 0.09%, respectively. The established method proved as reproducible with a% RSD value of less than 2 and having the robustness within specified limit. The present study also showed the enantiomeric purity or excess (% ee) of seven pharmaceutical preparations of escitalopram.

{"title": "Speaker Independent Speech Recognition of Isolated Words in Room Environment\n", "abstract": " In this paper, the process of recognizing some important words from a large set of vocabularies is demonstrated based on the combination of dynamic and instantaneous features of the speech spectrum. There are many procedures to recognize a word by its vowel, but this paper presents the highly effective speaker independent speech recognition in a typical room environment noise cases. To distinguish several isolated words of the sound of different vowels, two important features such as Pitch and Formant are extracted from the speech signals collected from a number of random male and female speakers. The extracted features are then analyzed for the particular utterances to train the system. The specific objectives of this work are to implement an isolated and automatic word speech recognizer, which is capable of recognizing as well as responding to speech and an audio interfacing system between human and machine for an effective human-machine interaction. The whole system has been tested using computer codes, and the result was satisfactory in almost 90% of cases.

In Bangladesh, normally four types of flood, expressly river flood, flash flood, tidal flood and storm surge flood appear. The Jamuna River is the most vulnerable to river flood. As a low lying country, flood occurs repeatedly in Bangladesh and causes tremendous losses in terms of property and life. Therefore, a study is carried out to develop flood extend map and flood inundation depth map of the Jamuna River. One dimensional hydraulic model HEC-RAS with HEC-GeoRAS interface in coordination with ArcView-GIS is applied for the analysis. The Nash-Sutcliffe Coefficient (NSE) values have been found greater than 0.60 for both calibration and validation.

This study is basically based on the secondary data and it is a review paper. As it is a review paper so, there was less opportunity to follow any specific method in preparing this paper. Valuable information has been collected through internet browsing, journals etc. In this paper, we examine that, GPS, GIS, VRT, profitability, yield mapping etc. are most common precision agriculture techniques where, GIS can help in site-specific applications of fertilizers and soil amendments and help effectively detect and map black fly infestations, making it possible to achieve precision in pest control. Remote sensing combined with GIS and GPS can help in site-specific weed management. From the review we observed that, the global adoption of yield monitors has been predominated in North-America and Europe. The precision technologies have been used on a wider variety of crops in Denmark and UK than in the US. In Bangladesh, precision agriculture has great prospect as our country is highly natural calamity sensitive and through it we can easily take measure to prevent our agricultural products from damage caused by natural calamities. Though, precision agriculture is very costly but the benefit from it is more than its cost for most of the developing countries.

There were no significant difference in chemical composition and in vitro DM and CP digestibilities between control and autoclaved groups, except ether extract level (P< 0.05), suggesting that autoclaving affected the nutritional quality of SM little. NaOH group exhibited significantly decreased CP level and in vitro DM digestibility, increased crude ash (CA) level and unchanged in vitro CP digestibility, comparing with control group. These results suggest that NaOH treatment affected the nutritional quality of SM adversely. HCl and formic acids groups showed significantly increased CP level and in vitro digestibilities of DM and CP, and decreased CA level, showing that acid treatment can improve nutritional quality of SM: formic acid treatment may be more effective because of the greater values in CP level and digestibilities and decreased crude fibre level which was not observed in HCl group\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["339"]}

Indigenous rice is generally grown in tidal floodplain harvesting poor yield. Transplanting seedlings of optimum age on appropriate date may potentially increase rice yield. We carried out on-farm trials for evaluating growth and yield performance of two indigenous rice varieties (Sadamota and Lalmota) and a high yielding variety (BRRI dhan 44) in response to variable seedling age and transplanting dates for two years. In the first year, 45 d and 60 d old seedlings of Sadamota were transplanted on a single date either in rows at 40 cm x 40 spacing or following farmers\u2019 traditional practice of random transplanting. The second year\u2019s trial compared the performance of one indigenous variety Lalmota and one modern variety BRRI dhan 44. Two age groups (45 d and 60 d) of seedlings of Lalmota and single age group (45 d) of BRRI dhan 44 were transplanted on two different dates (August 8 and August 24). First year\u2019s trial results indicated that irrespective of seedling age, transplanting in rows produced higher yield compared with farmers\u2019 traditional practice. In the second year\u2019s trial, late transplanting of 45 d old seedlings of both the varieties gave higher yield compared with early transplanting. BRRI dhan 44 produced significantly higher yield than Lalmota. Late transplanting of 60 d old seedlings of Lalmota produced higher yield than transplanting younger seedlings. Lower yield of earlier planted rice was associated with greater hill mortality and seedling damage, and production of relatively lesser number of tillers and panicles\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["339"]}

Data were collected through FGD (Focus Group Discussion), KII (key Informant Interview) and questionnaire survey from three water logged villages of three unions of Tala upazila of south-western region. The study reaches to the conclusion that duration of water logging and peoples\u2019 response to that situation are two important factors that determine the impact of water logging in the study area. A substantial number of birds, livestock, fisheries, as well as plants and vegetation are disappearing from the flora and fauna of Tala upazila. The study also finds that water logging affects peoples\u2019 wellbeing by narrowing down the livelihood options of the people. Water logging squeezes the scope for maintaining household economy by reducing the number of livestock, fisheries, and restraining the growth of vegetation, fruit trees and timber trees. Increased salinities are also appearing as silent threat associated with the detrimental biodiversity.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["339"]}

Recent studies show that serum prolactin level is also raised in colorectal cancers. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the correlation of serum CEA and Prolactin with Dukes' staging of colorectal carcinomas. Between January 2013 and June 2013, Serum CEA and Serum Prolactin were measured by radioimmunoassay from 103 patients who were histopathologically diagnosed as colorectal carcinomas. Evaluation of the stages of the colorectal cancers was done on the basis of preoperative investigations and postoperative histopathology and correlated with Preoperative Serum CEA and Serum Prolactin. Results were presented as median value, range and percentage. Male to female ratio was 1.4: 1 with median age of 42.26 years (range 17-78 years). Most of the patients in this series presented with carcinoma rectum (42%). Most of the patients (52%) were found in Dukes' stage C and 27% and 15% cases were found as Dukes' stage B and Dukes' stage D respectively. Stage of the disease is directly proportionate to percentage of the patient with high serum prolactin except early stage (Dukes' A-50%, Dukes' B-28.6%, Dukes' C-33.3% & Dukes' D-46.7%). Similarly serum CEA level is directly proportionate to tumor stage (Dukes' A-0%, Dukes' B-32%, Dukes' C-40.7% & Dukes' D-74.7%).

{"title": "Negative refraction with high transmission in graphene-hBN hyper crystal\n", "abstract": " In this article, we have theoretically investigated the performance of graphene-hexagonal Boron Nitride hyper crystals to demonstrate all angle negative refraction.Hexagonal Boron Nitride, the latest natural hyperbolic material; can be a very strong contender to form a hyper crystal with graphene due to its excellence as a graphene-compatible substrate. Although bare hexagonal Boron Nitride can exhibit negative refraction, the transmission is generally low due to its high reflective nature. On the other hand, due to two dimensional nature and metallic characteristics of graphene in the frequency range where hexagonal Boron Nitride behaves as a type-I hyperbolic Metamaterial, we have found that graphene-hexagonal Boron Nitride hyper-crystals exhibit all angle negative refraction with superior transmission. This has been possible because of the strong suppression of reflection from the hyper-crystal without any adverse effect on the negative refraction properties. This finding can prove very useful in applications such as superlensing, routing and imaging within a particular frequency range. We have also presented an effective medium description of the hyper crystal in the low k limit and validated the proposed theory using general transfer matrix method and also full wave simulation.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["339"]}

A bacteriological study was conducted with normal intestinal isolates from healthy human subjects to get an indication on the nation-wide profile of antimicrobial resistance in Bangladesh, a country state with highest population density with a common phenomenon of indiscriminate use of antibiotics. Fifty stool samples were collected from students of Jahangirnagar University, Bangladesh who had no recent exposure to antibiotics. Stool samples were cultured directly onto McConkey plates for selective isolation of Gram-negative bacteria. Of 112 representative colonies picked up from overnight grown McConkey plates, 50 were identified as E. coli by biochemical tests while the other 62 isolates belonged to 16 different species of the genera Escherichia, Edwardsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Cedecea, Klebsiella, Salmonella, Serratia andShigella. Antibiotic susceptibility test revealed that a large number of isolates (84 of 112) were resistant to one or more antibiotics while 28 of 112 isolates were sensitive to all the antibiotics used (amoxicillin, cefixime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim).

The Bacillus spp. were identified through 16S rDNA sequence analysis and the antibacterial activity of various organic solvent extracts as well as the essential oils of C. cyminum L. determined in vitro using agar diffusion method and Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) tests. The hydrodistilled essential oil was analyzed through GC-MS. Twenty-seven compounds representing 92.61% of the total oil were identified. Oxygenated monoterpenes and scsquiterpene hydrocarbons constituted the major components of the oil. The inhibition zones of essential oil (extracted through organic solvent) against the tested bacteria were found within the range of 14.4 to 20.2 mm. Organic extracts of C. cyminum L. also revealed a great potential of antibacterial activity against Bacillus spp. Among all the extracts, ethanol extract showed the highest activity against Bacillus megaterium with an inhibition zone of 22.9 mm and MIC value of 500 m g ml-1. In most cases, the essential oil and organic extracts exhibited either similar or higher antibacterial activity in comparison with the standard drug Erythromycin. The results finally suggest that the essential oil as well as organic extracts of C. cyminum L. can act as sources of natural antimicrobial agents with potential applications in food and pharmaceutical industries.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["339"]}

To this, frequency distribution and logistic regression analysis are employed to the data extracted from 750 respondents of the Pouroshava of Chapai-Nawabganj district in Bangladesh through purposive sampling technique. The findings of this study reveal that most of the respondents are migrants (56%) with a monthly income of more than Tk. 7000 (73.6%), and belongs to single type of family (82.7%). The risk of migration to the cities increases with the increase in age of the respondents where as it also bears an inverse relation to the level of education, monthly income and numbers of family members. Also, non-muslim respondents engaged in business or other types of occupation and having place of birth in rural areas are more vulnerable to higher risk of migration to the cities as compared to their counterparts. From the broader perspective of growth, equity and distributive justice this unrestrained migration to the cities will impinge serious and far reaching socio-political and economic implications for the mass people in this country-leading ultimately to an unavoidable crisis. Hence, adoption of balanced development strategy, monotonic and stable increase in the level of income, creation of all types of urban facilities in rural areas, and ensuring a better quality of life etc. is strongly recommended for reducing migration to the cities as well as for sustainable development.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["339"]}
{"title": "Widespread occurrence of possible antibiotic efflux mechanism in multidrug resistant Intestinal E. coli strains isolated from healthy human subjects in Bangladesh\n", "abstract": " A total of 50 isolates of Escherichia coli obtained from healthy adult human subjects were studied and tested for possible presence of efflux mechanism in resistance determination and possible correlation of plasmids with resistance. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the antibiotics amoxicillin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline were determined by agar dilution method with or without the H+/K+ proton pump inhibitor omeprazole. Plasmids were extracted by rapid alkaline plasmid extraction method and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Many strains showed 5 10 fold reduction of MIC values in the presence of omeprazole; a few strains showed up to 100-fold MIC reduction. Plasmid analysis of these 50 isolates revealed the presence of both plasmidless and plasmid containing strains, the latter with plasmid number varying from one to seven. However, the plasmids apparently had no relationship with high level antibiotic tolerance as indicated by the observation that some plasmidless strains had very high MIC values, while other strains containing several plasmids had very low MIC. Decrease in MIC in the presence of omeprazole apparently indicates existence of an efflux mechanism. Evidence of the efflux of ethidium bromide was noted in some strains that had been grown in ethidium bromide containing agar plate with and without omeprazole. These results suggest that reduction of MIC caused by omeprazole may be related to possible inhibition of efflux pump activity by omeprazole in the isolates studied.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["339"]}

{"title": "Efficiency improvement of bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic solar cell through device architecture modification\n", "abstract": " Fundamentally, the overall power conversion efficiency of bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cell depends on two key parameters:(a) the introduction of diverse organic materials as well as their miscellaneous combination as donor and acceptor in the active layer, and (b) the application of ameliorated solar cell device architecture. Here, we demonstrate a different structural design of an organic solar cell device, named textured OPV cell, which offers opportunities to enrich the value of major efficiency parameters, ie, absorption efficiency, exciton diffusion efficiency, and charge collection efficiency. The proposed redesigned solar cell device structure has several advantages:(i) it absorbs more sunlight and hence creates more photoexcitons,(ii) it virtually increases the active layer thickness that amplifies absorption efficiency,(iii) it increases the distance between exciton generation site and dissociation site and therefore boosts exciton diffusion efficiency, and (iii) it partially effects charge collection efficiency by creating a percolating pathway for the hole and electron transporting phase to the corresponding electrodes. An analytical analysis shows that the proposed device model increases the absorption efficiency about 11-13%, exciton diffusion efficiency about 10% and these changes offer an increment in the overall power conversion efficiency by about 15-20%.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["339"]}

Waste plastic generated from different cities and towns is a part of municipal solid waste. It is a matter of concern that disposal of waste plastic is causing many problems such as leaching impact on land and ground water, choking of drains, making land infertile, indiscriminate burning causes environmental hazards etc. Waste plastics being nonbiodegradable it can remain as a long period of landfill. Over 48 million tons of synthetic polymer material is produced in the United States every year. Plastic are made from limited resources such as petroleum. When waste plastic come in contact with light and starts photo degrading, it starts releasing harmful such as carbon, chlorine and sulfur causing the soil around them to decay, contributing many complications for cultivation. Waste plastics also end up in the ocean, where it becomes small particles due to the reaction caused by the sun ray and salt from the ocean. Million of ocean habitants die from consuming these small plastic particles when they mistake them for food. To solve this problem countries are resorting to dumping the waste plastics, which requires a lot of effort and money yet they are only able to recycle a fraction of waste plastics. This developed a new technology which will remove these waste plastics form landfill and ocean and convert them into useful liquid fuels.

A purpose of the crab cavities is to deflect the beam-bunches with time-varying RF fields, and to provide the head-on collision at the interaction point (crab crossing scheme). The head-on collision will drastically increase the luminosity. The crab cavity is required to have high RF fields (kick voltage) to provide beam-bunch deflection. The operating mode (crab mode, 509 MHz) is not the lowest order mode (LOM) of the cavity. In order to sufficiently damp the LOM as well as the HOMs for high beam currents in KEKB, a coaxial coupler is attached along the beam pipe.

{"title": "Spot morning urine protein creatinine ratio and 24 hour urinary total protein excretion rate.\n", "abstract": " Proteinuria helps to establish the diagnosis of most renal diseases and also to predict the outcome of such diseases. Proteinuria is biochemically represented by measuring the protein concentration in timed collection of 24 hour urine. But, 24-hour timed urine collection is time consuming, cumbersome and often unreliable due to collection errors and also results in undue delay on diagnostic process. An alternate approach avoiding arduous and inaccurate timed urine collection can be the measurement of protein creatinine ratio in spot morning urine. This study was aimed to evaluate whether the spot morning urine protein creatinine ratio can be a reliable alternative to 24-hour urinary total protein (UTP) estimation. The study was carried out in the department of Biochemistry, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka on 50 (fifty) non-diabetic Chronic Renal Disease (CRD) patients with an age ranging from 18-70 years. The study subjects were grouped into mild, moderate and severe CRD on the basis of GFR. Urinary protein and creatinine concentrations were measured in spot morning urine samples and their ratios were calculated. Urinary protein measured in 24-hour timed collected urine samples gave the 24-hour UTP excretion rate. In our study, spot morning urine protein creatinine ratio significantly correlated with 24-hour UTP excretion rate in all CRD patients. Severe CRD patients gave significant positive correlation (p< 0.05), whereas mild and moderate CRD patients gave very highly significant positive correlation (p< 0.001).

{"title": "Bruchid research in Bangladesh\n", "abstract": " The use of chemical pesticides against storage pests by farmers in developing countries like Bangladesh is inadequately docummented. The holistic view of pest control technology is required to evaluate its impact on net social welfare, the simultaneous determination of optimal storage operations, consumption and production over time and optimal pest management. To make these variables operational the collaboration of biologists (especially pest management expert), economists, systems analysts, extension workers and social scientists are very much to be solicited. It is apparent that our basic understanding of bruchid pests is still far from being adequate. Therefore, intensive studies of their, biology, ecology and effects on foodstuffs are needed to be vigorously persued. Chemical pesticides are expected to play a major role in pest management programmes. However, the development of alternative pest management strategies involving non-chemical methods should vigorously pursued. There is no single answer to pest problems. The development of an integrated pest management system incorporating the principles, methods and techniques advanced by various disciplines into a coherent and comprehensive programme seems to be the answer.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["339"]}

Comparisons of hospitals visited during a 7-week period with hospitals not visited during that period indicated that the site visits were followed by a marked increase in case reports. No similar increase was observed at the comparison hospitals. The increased reporting was accompanied by an increased lag time from diagnosis to report, suggesting that the additional reports at visited hospitals were the result of the identification of previously missed cases rather than a speedup of reporting. Cases reported after the visits were more likely to have white-collar occupations or private medical insurance than were those reported before the visits.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["339"]}

At the outset introduced as veterinary drugs of commercial livestock and companion animals but it was quickly discovered to be ideal in tackling two of the world\u2019s most distressing and disfiguring diseases such as river blindness and elephantiasis which have besieged African countries for centuries. The kinetics of ivermectin is characterized in general terms by a slow absorption process, a broad distribution in the organism, low metabolism, and slow excretion. The pharmacokinetic parameters of ivermectin vary extensively and in accordance with many factors that can all influence the drug\u2019s plasma concentration. These factors, which include the animal species, route of administration, vehicle used in the commercial formulation, bodyweight, body condition, age, physiological status, and amount and type of nutrition, all of which contribute to differences in drug efficacy. Currently, ivermectin is one of the most important drugs for the control of endectoparasitic infection in human and veterinary medicine and was the joint focus of the 2015 Nobel Prize, some 3 decades after its remarkable discovery.

For instance, P300 signal can be used in BCI to translate the subject\u2019s intention from mere thoughts using brain waves into actual commands, which can eventually be used to control different electro mechanical devices and artificial human body parts. Since low Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) in P300 is one of the major challenge because concurrently ongoing heterogeneous activities and artifacts of brain creates lots of challenges for doctors to understand the human intentions. In order to address above stated challenge this research proposes a system so called Adaptive Error Detection method for P300-Based Spelling using Riemannian Geometry, the system comprises of three main steps, in first step raw signal is cleaned by preprocessing. In second step most relevant features are extracted using xDAWN spatial filtering along with covariance matrices for handling high dimensional data and in final step elastic net classification algorithm is applied after converting from Riemannian manifold to Euclidean space using tangent space\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["339"]}

The local cattle breeds from the area (North Bengal Gray and Deshi) and crosses between the local breeds and Holstein cattle were predominantly screened. In total, 192 cattle serum samples were collected in two areas of Rajshahi Division, the Rajshahi District (n= 147) and Natore District (n= 45). The samples were screened with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using T. annulata surface protein (TaSP) as the antigen. The seroprevalence was 80.0%(36/45) in Natore and 20.4%(30/147) in Rajshahi. A logistic regression analysis showed that the sampling location was significantly associated with seropositivity, whereas age, sex and breed were not. Although the logistic regression analysis did not show a linear dependence on age, we considered age-specific seroprevalence separately in the two districts. Seroprevalence did not differ significantly among age categories in the Natore District. In contrast, all the cattle< 1-year-old in the Rajshahi District were seronegative (11/11). Seroprevalence in the 1-and 2-year-old cattle was significantly lower in the Rajshahi District than in the Natore District. In the older age categories (3, 4 and> 5 years), seroprevalence did not differ significantly between the Natore and Rajshahi Districts. These results suggest that the cattle in the Rajshahi District were sporadically exposed to T. annulata, whereas most cattle in the Natore District became infected during an early phase of life.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["339"]}

Pathogenesis of Salmonellosis depends upon a large number of multi-functional factors controlled by an array of genes that synergize into the actual virulence of Salmonella. In this study the lipA gene encoding an extracellular lipase and protease specific elastase gene primer allows precise detection of lipase and elastase gene of Salmonella typhimurium by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). This is the first report of lipase gene in Salmonella typhimurium. All isolates of Salmonella typhimurium were collected from patients suffering from typhoid and urinary tract infection (UTI). A total of 14 isolates viz., ST1, ST2, ST3, ST4, ST5, ST6, ST7, ST8, ST9, ST10, ST11, ST12, ST13 and ST14 were used in present study in which lipase gene was amplified in 3 isolates viz., ST1, ST2, ST3 and ST10 with expected PCR product of 1055bp whereas elastase gene was amplified in 6 isolates viz., ST1, ST2, ST4, ST11, ST13 and ST14 and gave the expected 467bp PCR product after visualization under gel documentation system. At the same time 14 samples were examined in-vitro for their putative virulence characteristics viz. proteolytic, lipolytic and hemolytic activity. High lipolytic activity was observed for isolates containing lipase whereas high proteolytic activity was observed for isolates containing elastase.

{"title": "Performance of a five-axis machine tool as a coordinate measuring machine (CMM)\n", "abstract": " The use of machine tools for on-machine coordinate measurement on the workpiece is becoming commonplace. However, numerous errors can adversely affect the measurement accuracy. For instance, the inter-axis parameters are major contributors to the overall machine tool\u2019s inaccuracy hence estimation and compensation of such errors are prerequisite to fully exploit the machine\u2019s measurement capability. This paper presents a scheme to assess the accuracy of coordinate measurement by probing a precision sphere mounted on the machine table for different rotary axes indexations. Only the sphericity of the reference sphere is assumed and neither its size nor position. All individual probing data from all indexations are used for the assessment of the apparent out of sphericity of the reference sphere. Machine readings are processed either directly, using the machine nominal model, or using a compensated model. This provides a fast method to validate on-machine measurement before and after compensation with the exception of isotropic scale effects.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["339"]}

The global mangrove forests are declining dramatically because of the conversion of forests to shrimp farming, over-exploitation, pollution and freshwater diversion. The Bangladesh Forest Department initiated mangrove afforestation throughout the coastal belts of Bangladesh in 1966 to provide better protection for the coastal communities. Up to 1990, 120,000 ha of mangroves had been planted and it is one of the largest coastal afforestaton programs in the world. The objective of this study is to exploit the spatial extent of mangrove plantation and their dynamics of changes over the last two decades using multispectral Landsat imagery. The study area covers the coastal areas of Bangladesh that is extended over the eastern part of Sundarbans up to Teknaf, the southern tip of mainland Bangladesh. Mangrove plantations were interpreted visually on computer screen and interactive delineation of forest boundary was done. The mangrove plantation area has been estimated as 32,725, 47,636 and 43,166 ha for the year of 1989, 2000 and 2010, respectively. Mangrove deforestation by human activity has increased almost six times in the recent decade in comparison to the previous one. The mangrove forest loss due to coastal erosion has slightly declined in the 2000s. Mangroves have been lost primarily because of agricultural expansion.

A total of 125 target farmers were surveyed by using structured questionnaire during the boro season (January-May 2011). Survey data were converted into energy by using the respective energy co-efficient equivalents. The results revealed that the sequences of total energy input were S1> S5> S2> S4> S3 and medium> large> landless> small> marginal among salinity regimes and farm categories, respectively. The seedbed stage consumed the highest energy followed by growing stage, and harvesting and threshing. Inorganic fertilizers accounted for a major share (59.98%) of energy input in rice field, while the lowest share was estimated for manpower (0.75%). Among fertilizers, nitrogen category was the most dominant source (54.94%) of energy input following phosphate (3.82%) and potassium (1.22%). The total output energy was in the sequences of S1> S4> S5> S2> S3 and landless> marginal> small> medium> large. Energy from main product (rice grains) was higher than that of byproduct (straw). The study also found that total output energy decreases with increases in farm size. In case of energy efficiency (output-input ratio), S4 was found to be the most energy efficient (2.43) regime followed by S3, S1, S5 and S2, whereas marginal sized farmers were the most energy efficient (2.12) followed by landless, small, medium and large.

The structural properties and optical constants of the grown crystals have been put to test and observed that the addition of KCl results in an enhancement of properties of the crystal. Grown crystals were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction. FTIR spectra confirmed the presence of KCl in pure KAP crystal. UV- Visible spectroscopic studies revealed that addition of KCl in pure KAP crystal increased transparency from 75% to 80%. The analysis of the optical absorption data revealed the presence of both indirect and direct transitions and both of these band gaps increased with the addition of KCl.

The governing non-linear partial differential equations of the flow are transformed into a set of non-linear ordinary differential equations using similarity transformations. The resulting nondimensional equations have been solved numerically by applying Nachtsheim-Swigert shooting iteration technique along with sixth-order Runge-Kutta iteration scheme. Comparison with previously published work for the steady case of the problem is performed and the results are found to be in very good agreement. The results of the numerical solution are presented graphically in the form of velocity (ie radial, tangential as well as inward axial), temperature profiles and variable Prandtl number for various values of the model parameters. The corresponding skin friction coefficients (ie radial and tangential) and the rate of heat transfer coefficient (ie Nusselt number) are also calculated and tabulated. The obtained numerical results show that when modeling a thermal boundary layer with temperature dependent fluid properties, consideration of Prandtl number as constant within the boundary layer produces unrealistic results. Therefore, it must be treated as variable throughout the boundary layer. Results also show that the slip factor significantly controls the flow and heat transfer characteristics.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["339"]}

{"title": "Comparative study of urban and rural salts for iodine content.\n", "abstract": " From the 18th century to till now the most notorious widespread public health crisis is iodine deficiency. Using iodized salt is the most effective strategy to fight against it. This paper is all about to assess the iodine concentration in available different branded and open salts from different rural and urban areas of Bangladesh. To measure the iodine level in salt samples, iodometric titration was used. The results show positive indication towards achieving our most desired goal of eliminating iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) from the country. Almost every branded salt sample contains iodine in the accepted range (minimum 20 ppm in consumption level and 50 ppm in production level). However, all the open salt samples showed poor iodine concentration (<5ppm). This indicates a large percentage of rural people are still in the risk of IDD only because of using these poorly iodized or non-iodized open salts. Government has achieved enormous success towards their goal of eliminating IDD particularly from urban areas of Bangladesh. Rural people are needed to make aware of using adequately iodized packet salts instead of poorly iodized or non-iodized open salts. Disseminating the consequences of iodine deficiency &benefits of using adequately iodized packet salts, re-pricing of packet salts considering the economic condition of rural people can be the only and effective strategy to boost up the usage of adequately iodized salts throughout the country.

{"title": "Alteration in lipid profile levels in women with subclinical hypothyroidism\n", "abstract": " Thyroid hormones play an important role in regulating energy balance and metabolism of glucose and lipids. A relationship between dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis is well established in clinical hypothyroidism. Whether subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is associated with lipid profile alteration, is the main concept behind the study. SCH is defined as an elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH> 5mIU/l) and normal free thyroxine level (FT4 9.5-25.0 pmol/l). It is highly prevalent in elderly subjects, especially in women but it is frequently overlooked. We examined 40 women with SCH and 50 healthy controls (TSH 0.5-5.0 mIU/l and FT4 9.5-25.0 pmol/l). None of the patients had been previously treated with thyroxine. In all participants we measured blood pressure, BMI, TSH, FT4 and fasting serum lipid profile. We conclude that SCH in middle aged women is associated with hypertension and significant increase of TC (p< 0.001), LDL-C (p< 0.001), TG (p< 0.001) and decreased level of HDLC p< 0.001) in comparison to euthyroid Controls. SCH patients showed significant positive correlation between TSH and total cholesterol (r=. 492, p< 0.01), LDL-C (r=. 355, p< 0.05) and TG (r=. 274, p< 0.05) and negative but nonsignificant corelationship with HDL-C (r=-. 058, p= 0.361).

On the other hand, it is crucial that CR users efficiently exchange data with each other before the appearance of licensed primary user (PU). To design a robust routing scheme for mobile CR ad hoc networks (CRANs), the constraints on residual energy of each CR user, reliability, and the protection of PUs must additionally be taken into consideration. Moreover, multipath routing has great potential for improving the end-to-end performance of ad hoc networks.

Using Job's continuous-variation analysis and Ardon's spectrophotomeric measurement methods, the values of the stability constants of theophylline with ketotifen were determined at a fixed temperature (37 \u00baC) at various pH. The stability constants, ranging between 5.66 and 9.92, were derived from Ardon's plot, indicating that comparatively stable complexes had formed as a result of an interaction between the drugs. However, following the interaction of theophylline with ketotifen, stability constants were <1 at gastric pH (1.2) and intestinal pH (6.8). Concurrent administration of ketotifen and theophylline could result in the formation of a stable complex and this is likely to reduce the therapeutic activities of both drugs.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["339"]}

This paper proposes a simple and effective method to remove salt-and-pepper noises from different types of images. The proposed algorithm replaces a noisy pixel value by the median value in its neighborhood only if the median comes from a noise-free pixel. Otherwise, it takes some special cares so that a noisy pixel value is not replaced by a value coming from another noisy pixel. Finally, it applies robust estimator to smooth the filtered output. The proposed technique is effective even if the image is highly contaminated with noise. The simulation also proofs the superiority of the proposed method above the existing noise-removal techniques.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["339"]}

{"title": "Serum Lipid as a Risk Factor of Ischaemic Stroke in Bangladeshi People\n", "abstract": " Background: The incidence of cerebrovascular disease increases with age and the number of stroke is projected to increase as the elderly population grows. With the advancement of the health status of the Bangladeshi people gradually the segment of elderly populations is increasing and thereby inviting many diseases which are due to aging process. Stroke occurs when blood vessels that carry blood to the brain suddenly blocked or burst, preventing blood flow to the brain. The most common cause of blood vessel blockages are thrombosis (a blood clot) or an embolism (floating clot). Blood clots may form in the arteries that are damaged by atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is an aging process but some factors (risk factor) precipitate it to occur earlier. To find out the risk factors properly are of tremendous importance as risk factor change could directly influence or indirectly affect case fatality by altering the natural history of the disease. Serum lipids are thought to interact with the pathogenesis of stroke through atherosclerotic mechanism. As we the Bangladeshi people lives on rice mainly which is a carbohydrate food and we also usually do not practice regular exercise, so, though there is no clear statistical data but it can be presumed that serum lipids (cholesterol and triglyceride) of our people may be relatively in higher range and consequently we are gradually progressing to suffer from this fatal disease.Objectives: To identify the high serum lipid as an independent risk factor of stroke.Methods: This is a hospital based case-control study.

{"title": "Ultimate Load Capacity of Axially Loaded Vertical Piles from Full Scale Load Test Results Interpretations-Apllied to 20 Case Histories\n", "abstract": " Accurate evaluation of ultimate load capacity of pile is extremely complex and difficult. Capacity of pile is derived from the resistance developed by the soils surrounding the shaft and underneath the tip of the pile. Soil, by nature, inherits/exhibits non-homogeneity, anisotropy and in-elasticity. Prediction of accurate engineering properties of the surrounding particulate three-phase soil matrix becomes even more complex due to installation of piles. Thus, available semi-empirical/empirical methods for determination of ultimate resistance of pile pose unreliability and, thereby, may significantly affect safety and economy of a project. Therefore, although expensive, conduction of limited number of full-scale pile load tests becomes inevitable prior to commencement of construction. On most occasions, the results of this test do not show a distinct plunging ultimate load, therefore the results need interpretation to estimate pile capacity or ultimate load. Several techniques have been developed by different researchers for this purpose. In this paper, twenty pile load tests performed in different parts of Bangladesh were analyzed with six common interpretation methods and compared with the actual capacities evaluated from the plunging failure. The comparison uses Log-Normal distribution, cumulative probability as well as measured versus predicted figures to represent the precision of the methods. The result shows that the Davisson\u2019s method (1972) has the highest accuracy and also the lowest scatter as opposed to the Rebound Elastic (1956) approach.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["339"]}

Data are shared on-the-fly by establishing temporary data exchange session for user queries. Generally, the communication link between peers is unsecured while exchanging data. In P2P eHealth data sharing scenarios, peers may need to exchange highly confidential data among them. Hence, there are some security threats that need to be considered (eg data might be trapped and disclosed by the intruders). In a P2PDSS, we cannot assume any third party security infrastructure (eg PKI) to protect confidential data. Considering the need of secure data exchange in P2PDSS, in this paper we propose a secure data exchange model. The model is based on pairing-based cryptography and the data sharing policy between peers. Applying the model, peers compute secret session keys dynamically by computing pairing on elliptic curve, based on the data sharing policies while exchanging data. The proposed protocol is robust against the man-in-the middle attack, the masquerade attack and the replay attack.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["339"]}

It is an evolutionary approach, and used when the network size grows and the search space increases. When the destination is outside the zone, EDA is applied to find the route with minimum cost and time. The implementation of proposed method is compared with Genetic ZRP, i.e., GZRP and the result demonstrates better performance for the proposed method. Since the method provides a set of paths to the destination, it results in load balance to the network. As both EDA and GA use random search method to reach the optimal point, the searching cost reduced significantly, especially when the number of data is large.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["339"]}

The cultivable land has declined about 35 percent while the population and demand of food has doubled since country\u2019s independence in 1971. Growing demand of food entails intensifying land productivity and developing modern agriculture technology. Unfortunately, country is lagged behind compare to other developed countries regarding technological innovation and development. However, recent years an impressive success has made as overall agricultural productivity has increased and incipient diversification into value added products, such as fruits, vegetables, flower, pulses, spices, poultry, dairy and fish and almost bring self-sufficiency in food grain production. Rice is a staple food provides 96 percent of the country\u2019s food requirement and employees about 60 per cent of labor force. Hence, most of the technological advancement has attained concerning to increase food grain (rice) production. Accordingly, country has achieved at marginal self-sufficiency on food grain production with the cost of indiscriminate use of natural resources particularly the water resources. Irrigation comes from two major sources-surface and ground water. Groundwater has covered 77 percent of total irrigated area and about 80 percent of groundwater has been utilized for crop production. More importantly, 75 percent of the total irrigation water has been used for paddy (rice) production.

Renewable energy is the energy which comes from natural resources such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, and geothermal heat, which are renewable (naturally replenished). Along with the major developments in the alternative sources of energy, a major breakthrough is the solar energy. More energy from sunlight strikes Earth in one hour than all of the energy consumed by humans in an entire year. So it is very convenient to utilize this energy in our daily life. In many other countries solar energy is being used within vast area. Researches are going on to make the solar system more efficient and affordable.  So it has been necessary to bring the idea of using solar energy in our country in wide range including domestic purpose. It will be in fact a great achievement if we can minimize electricity consumption by substituting it with solar energy. This thought leads us to work on our project which is on the topic \u201cAlternative Solar Water Heater with Automated Control System\u201d.  Using solar energy to supply hot water for both industrial and domestic purpose can be a very good application of utilizing solar power and that is the target that we will be trying to achieve. Our task is to implement a solar water heater along with a backup water heater controlled by a controller to ensure the constant hot water supply in the cheapest possible way. Our thesis work also provides a solution to increase the efficiency of solar water heater by implementing high capacitive multiple hot water storage tanks.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["339"]}

By revealing the identity of nodes in the network, outside parties can setup severe targeted attacks on specific nodes. Such targeted attacks are more harmful to sensor networks as sensing nodes (sensors) have limited computing and communication power prohibiting them from using robust security mechanisms. Anonymous communication is one of the key primitives for ensuring the privacy of communicating parties in a group or network. In this paper, we propose a novel secure anonymous communication protocol based on pairing over elliptic curves for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Using this protocol, only the legitimate nodes in the sensor network can authenticate each other without disclosing their real identities.

{"title": "Correlation of the co-occurrence of arsenic and iron in groundwater of Bangladesh\n", "abstract": " Arsenic contamination in groundwater and its toxic effect on health is a major environmental concern in Bangladesh. Usually, arsenic is geologically bound in sediments and rocks with a particular affinity to iron. The greatest concentration of this mineral occurs in association with the transition metals like Cadmium (Cd), Lead (Pd), Argentum (Ag), Aurum (Au) and Molybdenum (Mo). The greatest concentration of As tend to occur in sulphide minerals, of which, pyrite is the most abundant. A number of hypotheses have been considered to explain the occurrence of arsenic in groundwater of Bangladesh; of which, Pyrite oxidation and Iron Oxyhydroxide reduction hypotheses are the most acceptable ones. Therefore, it is likely that occurrence of arsenic might be coupled with the presence of iron (Fe) in groundwater.

{"title": "Sorting Primitives and Genome Rearrangement in Bioinformatics: A Unified Perspective\n", "abstract": " Bioinformatics and computational biology involve the use of techniques including applied mathematics, informatics, statistics, computer science, artificial intelligence, chemistry, and biochemistry to solve biological problems usually on the molecular level. Research in computational biology often overlaps with systems biology. Major research efforts in the field include sequence alignment, gene finding, genome assembly, protein structure alignment, protein structure prediction, prediction of gene expression and proteinprotein interactions, and the modeling of evolution. Various global rearrangements of permutations, such as reversals and transpositions, have recently become of interest because of their applications in computational molecular biology. A reversal is an operation that reverses the order of a substring of a permutation. A transposition is an operation that swaps two adjacent substrings of a permutation. The problem of determining the smallest number of reversals required to transform a given permutation into the identity permutation is called sorting by reversals. Similar problems can be defined for transpositions and other global rearrangements. In this work we perform a study about some genome rearrangement primitives. We show how a genome is modelled by a permutation, introduce some of the existing primitives and the lower and upper bounds on them. We then provide a comparison of the introduced primitives.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["339"]}

{"title": "Application of social networking algorithms in program analysis: understanding execution frequencies\n", "abstract": " There may be some parts of a program that are more commonly used at runtime, whereas there may be other parts that are less commonly used or not used at all. In this exploratory study, we propose an approach to predict how frequently or rarely different parts of a program will get used at runtime without actually running the program. Knowledge of the most frequently executed parts can help identify the most critical and the most testable parts of a program. The portions predicted to be the less commonly executed tend to be hard to test parts of a program. Knowing the hard to test parts of a program can aid the early development of test cases. In our approach we statically analyse code or static models of code (like UML class diagrams), using quantified social networking measures and web structure mining measures. These measures assign ranks to different portions of code for use in predictions of the relative frequency that a section of code will be used. We validated these rank ordering of predictions by running the program with a common set of use cases and identifying the actual rank ordering. We compared the predictions with other measures that use direct coupling or lines of code. We found that our predictions fared better as they were statistically more correlated to the actual rank ordering than the other measures. We present a prototype tool written as an eclipse plugin, that implements and validates our approach.

The additive component (a) and the dominance component (b) were highly significant for almost all the characters studied indicating the importance of both additive and dominant gene actions. The additive gene effect D was significant for all the characters studied. The results indicated that the additive components were important in the inheritance of these traits. The significant H1 value for all characters except pod length, pod breadth, seeds per pod and pod weight suggested also involvement of non-additive type of gene action for these traits. So it can be said that both the additive and dominance variances were important in the inheritance of these characters. In the present investigation, the ratio H2/4H1 was less than 0.25 for all characters indicating that the positive and negative alleles were not in equal proportion in the parents. The ratio (h2/H2) provides estimates of genes or gene groups exhibiting dominance. The heritability in narrow sense was the highest for pod weight (77%) followed by pod yield (75%) and lowest for days to 50% flowering (54%).", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["339"]}

{"title": "Teaching Quality of the Senior Faculty Members of Bangladesh Agricultural University\n", "abstract": " One hundred senior faculty members of Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU) were selected purposively and their teaching quality was determined by trained faculty members on the basis of 20 selected quality characters. The overall teaching quality score of the sample teachers ranged from 27 to 94, with a mean of 64. Among the teachers 17, 28, 17, 13 and 25 percent scored excellent, good, fair, poor and very poor respectively. The average score of the most favourite teachers of BAU was 83, while it was only 40 for the least favourite teachers, and for trainers of the \u2018Teaching Methods and Techniques\u2019 training course it was 88. The 20 quality characters were divided in six competencies, and the highest grade-point was found in content competence (3.39), followed by ethical characters (3.34), lesson planning skill (3.27), use of teaching methods and aids (3.27), use of interactive teaching techniques (2.88), and student assessment (2.82). The GPA of each of these competency scores for TOT-trainers was above 4.1, whereas the same for the least favourite teachers was less than 2.4. All teachers need improvement of student assessment skills, and in using teaching methods and techniques. In order to improve the quality of teaching and educational environment, further study is needed and the BAU authority should take initiative in introducing faculty development training courses and workshops.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["339"]}

Many of these documents, including financial information, while papers, legal documents, and external communications, require expensive review and mark-up by internal and external workgroups. The main motivations or using PKI (public key infrastructure) in business environment (e.g., e-commerce) is to streamline workflow, by enabling human to digitally sign electronic documents, instead of manually signing paper ones. However, this approach fails if adversaries can construct electronic documents whose viewed contents can change in useful ways, without invalidating the digital signature. In this paper we have examined the space of such attacks, and have described how many popular electronic document formats and PKI packages permit them.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["339"]}
{"title": "Punch Shear Damage Behavior of Composite Laminates With and Without Pre-Defined Delaminations\n", "abstract": " Punch shear tests have been proven to simulate most of the damage mechanisms observed under ballistic impact. A phenomenological model has been developed to quantify the elastic and absorbed energies as a function of displacement during punch. This model is used to quantify the damage mechanisms of thick-section composites as a function of displacement, and number of pre-defined delamination planes. It has been identified that different damage mechanisms as a function of displacement can be correlated with the load-displacement curve of punch shear tests. Three significant damage mechanisms are identified. Energy absorbed by these damage mechanisms are partitioned and quantified for a thick-section composite made from plain-weave S-2 glass and toughened API epoxy SC15 resin.

{"title": "Finite Element Analysis of Slab and a Comparative Study with Others Analytical Solution\n", "abstract": " Slabs are one of the most widely used structural elements. The function of slabs is to resist loads normal to their plane. In many structures, in addition to support transverse load, the slab also forms an integral portion of the structural frame to resist lateral load. Inspite of their widespread use, there has never been a universally accepted method of designing all slabs systems. The paper presents finite element analysis of slabs. The finite element method is chosen as this is more powerful and versatile compared to other numerical methods. A slab element is developed on the basis of conventional slab theory expressed in terms of rectangular co-ordinates and displacement. The element incorporates 20 degree of freedom, namely, normal displacement with its first derivatives along longitudinal and transverse direction respectively and two tangential displacements. A computer program is developed for solution of finite element equations as well as to check rigid body modes and to obtain the results. The results are compared with analytical solution and previously developed finite element solution with the help of a table.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["339"]}

But those are endangered today due to lack of public awareness of the dangers of their activities to the environment and unbridled profit making activities of the commercial users of the wetlands. Comparisons of maps and Google images from 1933 to present have shown that the forest areas of the wetlands have been progressively destroyed, and these have greatly affected the biodiversity of these areas mentioned. GIS (Geographic Information System) and remote sensing techniques are used to identify the changes in the aerial extent of those wetlands. This study also tried to explore present environmental conditions by in-situ observation. This is high time; some serious steps should be taken to ensure the conservation and preservation of these areas mentioned.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["339"]}

The usefulness of US imaging is degraded by the presence of signal dependence noise known as speckle noise. Speckle degrades the target detectability in ultrasound images and reduces contrast, resolutions which affect the human ability to identify normal and pathological tissue. The proposed method is for enhancing and sharpening Ultrasound images. By using the discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) flowed by using the linear contrast stretching technique and sobel operator to obtain the enhanced image. Firstly, we use discrete wavelet transform to decompose the input image and then apply soft threshold in decomposition section that concentrates on denoising each subband (except lowest coefficient subbands) by minimizing insignificant coefficients and adapt with modified coefficients which are significant and more responsible for image reconstruction. Finally, use image sharpening model that is based on linear contrast stretching and edge detection with sobel operator to get the enhanced image. This proposed method satisfy the human visual quality and preserve its edge features effectively.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["339"]}

The aim of present study was to evaluate their cardiovascular effects in isolated perfused rabbit heart. The methanolic extract of RML was prepared by cold maceration process. The methanolic extract of RML (1 ng to 10 mg) was used to determine the percentage change in force of contraction (FC), heart rate (HR) and perfusion pressure (PP) by using Langendorff's Perfused Heart Apparatus. The PP, FC and HR of isolated rabbit heart were measured by power lab data acquisition system. Moreover, phytochemical analysis and acute toxicity study were also performed. The methanolic extract at the doses from I ng to 10 mg exhibited a significant increase in perfusion pressure and force of contraction. Moreover, the crude extract of RML revealed a significant increase in heart rate at doses from 1 ng to \u03bcg. The maximum rise in all the thee parameters was observed at 1 \u03bcg and 1 ng, respectively In another study, the melhanoliC extract was tested in the presence of propranolol and verapamil on isolated perfused rabbit heart. The study shown that the increase in HR and FC produced by the plant extracts was significantly reduced in the presence of propranolol whereas PP remained significantly raised even in the presence of propranolol. However, in the presence of verapamil, this increased PP was significantly reversed to a decrease while a significant positive inotropic and chronotropic effects were observed.

The tested rice cultivars were Poshusail, Jirasail, BRRI dhan28, NERICA-4, GSR-IRRI-1, Purple rice and BRRI dhan50 (Banglamoti), cultivated in Northwest Bangladesh where chilling cold is common in winter. A significant variation was found among the studied rice cultivars regarding the investigated parameters. This study resulted that the NERICA-4 and Jirasail (a local variety) showed comparatively better potentiality to survive at low temperature (below 15\u00baC) in the Northwest Bangladesh. Rice cultivars contained increased amount of proline, chlorophyll, protein, relative water content, starch and dry weight percentage having the highest survival potentiality in low temperature stress condition. Though the cultivars studied expressed morpho-physiological responses differently to low temperature environment, the increased leaf proline content might be a reasonable indicator for responses to sudden low temperature stress in all cultivars.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["339"]}

A total of 282 representative samples were collected constituting 206 clients, 44 community leaders, and 32 MFI staffs. Along with descriptive statistics,\u201cR package\u201d particularly \u201cfSRM\u201d package of Social Relations Model (SRM) was used for analysis. SRM estimation in two different models depicts mixed results. Estimated variance, covariance, and dyadic reciprocity covariance for clients, staffs, and leaders are found statistically significant in different combination. However, the extent of statistical significance is found highest for staffs, followed by clients and community leaders. This implies that client-staff dyadic relationship is more warmth than that of client-leader and staff-leader dyads. Leaders maintain less warmth relationship than do the clients and staffs as because leaders have comparatively less connection with microfinance program. Despite small sample size of this study, the empirical findings justify the notion that Bangladesh is the success case of microfinance program because of the strong relationship between clients and staffs. The findings might also open a window for adopting Social Relations Model in further microfinance research.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["339"]}

Among 10 active crude acetone extracts, those from Psidium guajava and Nigella sativa (100 \u03bcg/ml) suppressed zoosporogenesis relative to the control (100% zoospore release) to 60 and 40% released, respectively and inhibited motility of 100% of the zoospores within 60 min of treatment. Chelerythrine chloride also suppressed zoosporogenesis (30% released) at 0.1 \u03bcg/ml and inhibited motility of 100% zoospores at 0.2 \u03bcg/ml within 60 minutes. Among water extracts of 100 medicinal plants, 56 impaired motility of zoospores in a dose-and time-dependent manner. Diluted (20-fold) water extracts of 10 plants including Ocinum gratissimum, Terminalia bohera, and Duranta plumeri inhibited motility and subsequently caused lysis of zoospores. As the inhibition of zoosporogenesis and zoospore motility limit the possibility of infection by the peronosporomycete phytopathogen, the inhibitory crude extracts of medicinal plants identified in this study should have great potential for practical use as biopesticides against P. capsici.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["339"]}

In all the texts mentioned above the age old notion of woman\u201fs position as innately inferior to man has been put into question. The authors have exposed the social and familial traditions through which women are trained to play a subservient sacrificial role in the family. The society portrayed the image of woman as a custodian of extra-ordinary moral virtues incorporated with devotion and sacrifice. At the same time they are seen as lustful characters, naturally instinct driven and incapable of rational thoughts. Thus the society justifies its constant domineering gaze over a girl child. The women are asked to put up all sorts of repressions and suppressions in the name of family honor and modesty. From their very childhood they are given a false notion of themselves as unworthy of having autonomous individuality. There comes a time when women themselves start to believe in the man-made sexual hierarchy. They grow a tendency to live only for others which eventually lead up to self-denial.

{"title": "Electrodeposition of indium phosphide from an ionic liquid for photovoltaics\n", "abstract": " Over the last two decades, low-temperature ionic liquids have received great attention due to their wide applications in different research fields and applications such as electrodeposition, organic synthesis and chemical separations [1-6]. These ionic liquids generally demonstrate wide electrochemical window, where metals with very negative standard potentials can be deposited [7-13]. In addition, they exhibit good chemical and thermal stability, along with a good electrical conductivity. These low melting temperature (< 100 C) ionic liquids are easier to work with compared to molten salts. Moreover, ionic liquids are nonvolatile and ideal replacement for traditional organic solvents that are volatile and flammable. However, the majority of the ionic liquids exhibit high sensibility to water or degradation by oxygen and needs a complex synthesis. It has recently been found that the principle of creating an ionic fluid by complexing a halide salt can be applied to mixtures of quaternary ammonium salts with an amide, carboxylic acid or alcohol moiety [14-19]. These mixtures are called Deep Eutectic Solvent (DES). They are also known as third generation ionic liquids. Such eutectic systems are easy to manipulate, nontoxic and biodegradable compared to room temperature ionic liquids. Furthermore, they demonstrate chemical inertness towards water and the production involves low costs and environmental risks. The present study reports the suitability of one of these DES mediums (1: 2 choline chloride/urea) to synthesize InP.

The experimental period was divided into five phases, phase I (0 2 nd week), phase II (3 rd 8 th week), phase III (9 th 22 nd week), phase IV (23 rd sexual maturity), phase V (sexual maturity to peak production). The experiment was carried out in an open sided house and management practices of birds were close to the recommendation of the broiler breeder. It may be concluded that it is possible to achieve standard body weight of SHAVER Starbro broiler parent stock under Bangladesh condition even sometimes with lower amounts of feed allocations as specified by breeder. The birds reach sexual maturity at 31 st week, later than the breeders standard (23 rd week) and the persistency in peak production is shorter but egg weight ranges from 53g to 60g, suitable for hatching. Mycoplasmosis appears to be major health problem, affecting performance. Use of sand is not suitable as a litter material for the management, as the birds consume a lot of sand under restricted feeding program.

{"title": "Material Independent Long Distance Pulling, Trapping, and Rotation of Fully Immersed Multiple Objects with a Single Optical Set-up\n", "abstract": " Optical pulling with tractor beams is so far highly dependent on (i) the property of embedding background or the particle itself , (ii) the number of the particles and/or (iii) the manual ramping of beam phase. A necessary theoretical solution of these problems is proposed here. This article demonstrates a novel active tractor beam for multiple fully immersed objects with its additional abilities of yielding a controlled rotation and a desired 3D trapping. Continuous and stable long distance levitation, controlled rotation and 3D trapping are demonstrated with a single optical set-up by using two coaxial, or even non-coaxial, superimposed non-diffracting higher order Bessel beams of reverse helical nature and different frequencies. The superimposed beam has periodic intensity variations both along and around the beam-axis because of the difference in longitudinal wave-vectors and beam orders, respectively. The difference in frequencies of two laser beams makes the intensity pattern move along and around the beam-axis in a continuous way without manual ramping of phase, which allows for either linear motion (forward or backward) or angular movement (clockwise or anticlockwise) of fully immersed multiple particles. As a major contribution, the condition for increasing the target binding regions is also proposed to manipulate multiple immersed objects of different sizes and shapes.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["339"]}

Three groups of calves (10 calves in each group) of different age were randomly selected from two organized farms from Savar Upazilla of Bangladesh where the dams are routinely vaccinated with trivalent FMD vaccines. Blood samples were collected from these selected calves in six occasions five weeks apart and sera (n= 180) were tested for antibody titer against FMDV by using liquid phase blocking ELISA (LPB-ELISA) test. The test is based upon specific blocking of the FMDV antigen in liquid phase by antibodies in the test serum sample. Protective level (PI value> 50) of maternal antibody against FMDV was found in serum of calves up to the age of 22-23 wks (above five months) and decreased below protective level (PI value< 50) at 27-28 weeks (above 6 months) of age. Irrespective of vaccine types, male calves had slightly higher level of MDA than that of female calves and PI values were comparatively higher against serotype O than the other two serotypes (A and Asia 1).

{"title": "Despeckling 3D Ultrasound Images using Linear Regression\n", "abstract": " Ultrasound (US) imaging is a widely used and safe medical diagnosis technique, due to its safe noninvasive nature, low cost, capability of forming real time imaging and continuing improvement in image quality. At the current century 3D ultrasound imaging is becoming more popular day by day because 3D US is more useful way of examining many of the body\u2019s internal organs. The usefulness of 3D US imaging is degraded by the presence of signal dependence noise known as speckle noise. Spackle pattern is a form of multiplicative noise and it depends on the structure of imaged tissue and various imaging parameters. Speckle degrades the target detectibility in ultrasound images and reduces contrast, resolutions which affect the human ability to identify normal and pathological tissue. Different types of filters are used in despeckling of 3D US image. Although the existing despeckling filters are termed as edge and feature preserving filters some major limitations are exists. The more the diagnostic information can be presented in the 3D US images; it is easier to take decision about treatment plan. This thesis paper represents a noble filtering techniques to remove speckle noise from 3D ultrasound images. This new filter is compared to other existing popular filtering approach and this technique provides superior result, which will directly help the physicians in accurate diagnosis on US. Moreover, it will generate intellectual properties.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["339"]}

Data were collected through semi-structured interview, case study, frequent visit to the informants found in and between the trade channels. A total of 9 shark species belonging to 3 families (Carcharhinidae, Hemiscylliidae and Sphyrnidae) were recorded. It was found that sharks were exploited mostly at small sizes (45%) in those landing centers. The highest and lowest yield were found in the month of January and July respectively at Chittagong whereas November and July at Cox\u2019s Bazar. The highest and lowest landed number was found in November and July respectively at both the landing centers. Dog shark was the most dominant species followed by Hammerhead shark in terms of yield and landed number at Chittagong and Cox\u2019s Bazar contributed 55.794 MT (60% 90) and 17.675 MT (19%) among the total yield and 174,877 (83%) and 25,733 (12%) landed number respectively. Yield and landed number of other species contribution altogether were only 21% and 5% respectively of total. Total yield was found 6 folds in Cox\u2019s Bazar than that of Chittagong.

A total of 100 small-scale dairy farms were chosen as sample for the study taking 50 dairy farms from the urban areas of each district adopting simple random sampling technique. Data were collected through direct interview with the small dairy farm operator using pre-designed interview schedule. The findings showed that the gross cost (mean) of rearing animals was Tk. 169.91/farm/day in Dinajpur as against Tk. 262.90 in Gazipur, net return/day/animal was Tk. 51.53 for dairy farm in Dinajpur and Tk. 79.28 for dairy farm in Gazipur, average milk production/farm/year was 1435 liters in Dinajpur and that was 1775 liters in Gazipur. The Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) was found to be 1.68 for dairy farm in Dinajpur and 1.84 for dairy farm in Gazipur which implies that small-scale dairy industry is a profitable enterprise. The major constraints faced by the dairy owners were identified as paucity of green grass, high price and unavailability of feed and medicine, lack of grazing land, inadequate veterinary services, lack of training and technical know how and lack of institutional credit facilities. Small scale dairy industry could be the main sources of providing nutrition to the urban people and as a means of earning extra-income for the small farm-holders if appropriate measures are taken.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["339"]}

{"title": "Improving military demand forecasting using sequence rules\n", "abstract": " Accurately forecasting the demand of critical military stocks is a vital step in the planning of a military operation. A large number of stocks in the military inventory do not specify their consumption and usage rates per platform (e.g., ship). As a result, the demand of many critical military stocks may be under or over estimated leading to undesired operational impacts. To address this, we propose an approach to improve the platform-based military demand modelling process by deriving the demand of items with no usage models from the demands of correlated items with known per-platform usage rates. We adopt a data mining approach using sequence rule mining to automatically determine demand correlations by assessing frequently co-occurring usage patterns.

{"title": "Axial Mixing in Square Ducts\n", "abstract": " The dispersion of solutes in flow through ducts exhibits a characteristic that is counter-intuitive\u2013namely the dispersive effects are far less than those one might expect by considering the non-uniformity of velocity profiles. This phenomenon has been thoroughly investigated both theoretically and experimentally for laminar flows through circular pipes. However, flows in non-circular ducts are more problematical to analyze because the governing equations must account for the three-dimensionality of the flow. Numerical methods used to solve the advection-diffusion equation are inherently diffusive; hence, any estimates of effective diffusivity must not be compromised by false diffusion. In this work, we have estimated the effective dispersion coefficient of fluids flowing in non-circular ducts. To mitigate the effects of false diffusion a Quadratic Upwind Interpolation for Convective Kinematics with Estimated Streaming Terms (QUICKEST) scheme has been used to discretize the governing equations. This scheme exhibits a high degree of stability and very little numerical false diffusion. This third order accurate scheme has been used to validate the model of dispersion in a circular pipe against published analytical and experimental results with excellent agreement. Given the demonstrated accuracy of the approach, the evolution of concentration profiles in both circular and non-circular ducts has been elucidated in unprecedented detail. It is observed that longitudinal dispersion is greater in a square duct that in a circular duct.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["339"]}

{"title": "Numerical Computation and Optimization of Turbine Blade Film Cooling\n", "abstract": " The effect of film cooling parameters on the cooling effectiveness of an actual turbine blade is studied numerically. Film cooling parameters such as the hole shape, holes distribution, blowing ratio, streamwise angle, and spanwise angle are investigated to select the appropriate cooling parameters. Unstructured finite volume technique is used to solve the steady, three-dimensional, and compressible Navier-Stokes equations. Using one cooling holes array indicates that the average overall film cooling effectiveness is enhanced by decreasing the streamwise angle for high blowing ratio on the suction side of the turbine blade. The film cooling effectiveness is enhanced on the pressure side for a blowing ratio of unity. In addition, the cooling effectiveness increases by increasing the lateral and forward diffusion angles. The computations reveal that the efficiency of cooling is decreased at the leading edge due to the large surface curvature of the blade. The presence of compound shape (spanwise angle) enhanced the film cooling effectiveness on the two sides. Multistagger cooling hole arrays are investigated and the results indicate that five-stagger cooling arrays on the pressure side and three-stagger cooling arrays on the suction side with LFDCA-9.3-14.6 hole shape are enough to have good cooling of the two sides using 2.17% bleed air of the engine.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["339"]}

Some online auctions (such as eBay or Amazon) introduced a proxy bidding strategy that the bidder can decide a maximum bid and delegate his authority to a legal agent to automatically outbid other competitors for the last winner. In this paper, we identify some practical issues in the current bidding strategies and propose a system model of a pairing-based proxy signcryption which includes two cryptographic schemes; further, we apply the proposed schemes to the online proxy auction system for comparing two authorized online proxy auction policies (agents anonymity setting and agents accountability setting) with different applications of short message and long message. Also, we discuss some critical security issues under the online proxy auctions.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["339"]}
{"title": "Scenario of Clinical Waste Management: A Case Study in Khulna City\n", "abstract": " Urbanization and population growth enhance facilities in public and private sectors where health facility is one of the main peak point. In this focus, an immense amount of clinical waste is generated everyday in the metropolitan cities in Bangladesh. Moreover, the clinical waste management has become a critical environmental concern all over the world. The study mainly illustrates the existing clinical waste management in Khulna city, classification of different types of clinical waste, waste generation rate, contribution of public organization (KCC) and private organization involved in clinical waste management. The methodology of this project was consisted of questionnaire survey and interviews with the authorities of the different health centers and personnel involved in the management of clinical waste. There are about 150 health facilities in Khulna City Corporation and the total waste generation in Khulna city is about 520 ton/day and the amount of clinical waste generation is 2.5 ton/day. Huge amount of waste leads this study to conclude a sustainable solution for the recyclable wastes and proper scientific dispose of non-recycle able waste. The management procedure for clinical waste such as collection, transportation and disposed at dumping site is demonstrated one by one for KCC area. KCC authority and Prodipan are involved in off-site transport of clinical waste from various health centers to dispose at Rajbandh. Though Prodipan extends its hand in managing clinical waste, the condition of maximum health centers is hazardous as most of the owners of the health centers are found to be disinclined to dispose the clinic waste with\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["339"]}

The most famous biofluid is the blood which holds the properties of a magnetic fluid because of the existence of iron oxides in the hemoglobin molecule at the mature red blood cells. The influence of the magnetic field on the flow of biofluids is extensively investigated because of various applications in bioengineering and medicine (Ruuge and Rusetski 1993; Plavins and Lauva 1993; Haik et al. 1999; Tzirtzilakis and Tanoudis 2003). Modeling of bioheat transfer in arteries and other physiological systems has become a popular area of research involving the study of conduction heat transfer in tissues (Pennes 1948) and convection in blood flows (Charm et al. 1968). Charny (1992) and Rubinsky (1999) have presented excellent reviews of progress in theoretical and numerical modeling of bio-heat transfer.The afore-mentioned studies are all confined to Newtonian blood flow models. Many studies however incorporate non-Newtonian fluid models to study viscoelasticity of cells, hematocrit influence on rheological properties, shear-thinning and microrotational effects (Skalak and Chien 1982; Srivastava 2003; Anad and Rajagopal 2004; Choi and Barakat 2005). The rheological models however do not incorporate micro-structural effects ie they cannot simulate rotary motions and also gyration of fluid micro-elements which characterize suspensions in blood (eg erythrocytes).

Signs of urinary tract obstruction were identified on pre-natal ultrasound in a male fetus and the diagnosis of anterior urethral valves was made through post-natal evaluation. As an initial treatment, vesicostomy was performed in the patient. Later, the valve was fulgurated using an endoscopic procedure. During the follow-up period the patient presented normal renal function. Anterior urethral valve is a rare form of urethral anomaly that must be ruled out in boys with pre-natal ultrasound indicating infravesical obstruction. Vesicostomy used as an initial treatment rather than transurethral fulguration may prevent potential complications that can occur due to the small size of the neonatal urethra.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["339"]}

However, due to the potential of being exposed, many people are increasingly being reluctant to be electronically monitored and suffer from privacy loss. Therefore, it is desirable to have privacy preservation (i.e. hiding people's face) mechanism in the surveillance system as best as possible without compromising usual surveillance tasks. This paper proposes the design of a secure privacy vault to conceal privacy-sensitive data obtained from different visual sensors.

Extended spectrum \u03b2-lactamases (ESBLs) are rapidly evolving group of \u03b2-lactamase enzymes produced by the Gram negative bacteria. This study was undertaken to characterize ESBL producing gram negative bacilli from urine, skin wound (pus and wound infection). A total of 300 gram negative bacilli were screened for resistance to third generation Cephalosporins (3GCs) by disc diffusion test. The ESBL status was confirmed by double disc diffusion test (DDDT), minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) by agar dilution method as recommended by Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute 2010 (CLSI) and multiplex PCR for TEM, SHV and CTX-M, CTX-M-3, CTX-M-14 genes. The present study revealed a higher occurrence of multi drugs resistant ESBLs production among gram negative isolates where Klebsiella spp. were the leading bacteria 36/45 (80%), followed by Proteus spp. 40/55 (72.7%), Esch. coli 105/156 (67.3%) and others 25/35 (71.4%).

{"title": "Reducing the health effect of natural hazards in Bangladesh\n", "abstract": " Bangladesh, with a population of 151 million people, is a country that is particularly prone to natural disasters: 26% of the population are affected by cyclones and 70% live in flood-prone regions. Mortality and morbidity from these events have fallen substantially in the past 50 years, partly because of improvements in disaster management. Thousands of cyclone shelters have been built and government and civil society have mobilised strategies to provide early warning and respond quickly. Increasingly, flood and cyclone interventions have leveraged community resilience, and general activities for poverty reduction have integrated disaster management. Furthermore, overall population health has improved greatly on the basis of successful public health activities, which has helped to mitigate the effect of natural disasters. Challenges to the maintenance and reduction of the effect of cyclones and floods include rapid urbanisation and the growing effect of global warming. Although the effects of earthquakes are unknown, some efforts to prepare for this type of event are underway.

Acetate selection-heat treatment-lecithinase production and haemolytic activity were initially performed to narrow down the spectrum for selection of Btk-likeisolates. Specific biochemical tests (Es+, Sa+, Le+, Su-) were performed to differentiate Btk from other subspecies. Based on these tests, of 148 Bt isolates, 27.7%(41 Bt isolates) were confirmed as Bt kurstaki isolates. The 41 isolates were investigated for the presence of cry1, cry1A and cry2A genes by PCR identification with gene specific primers and demonstrated some level of diversity with respect to major genes content in the strains. Nine of the isolates were found to carry all three genes while another nine contained both cry1 and cry2A genes. 29, 22 and 16 of the isolates contained singly cry1, cry2A or cry1A gene respectively. Plasmid DNA was purified which ranged from 12-15 kb in most of the isolates which were very similar to the plasmid pattern of Btk HD-73. Bioassay was performed with the isolates harbouring Lepidoptera specific cry1A genes against vegetable pest Bactrocera cucurbitae. Five of the isolates having higher activity close to Btk HD-73 were considered for determination of LC50 and LC90. The\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["339"]}

{"title": "An Enhanced Filtering Approach for High Density Salt and Pepper Noise to Restore Image with the Aid of Robust Estimator\n", "abstract": " A new adaptive switching-based median filtering scheme for restoration of images that are highly corrupted by salt and pepper noise is proposed. The function of the algorithm detects the corrupted pixels first since the salt and pepper noise only affect pixels value in the image. The probable value of the noise central pixel is predicted based on noise level. Initially the algorithm adopts adaptive property for expanding the filtering window pixel by pixel until 7\u00d7 7 mask. But when all the elements in 7\u00d7 7 window are noise pixels the algorithm define probable pixel value through noise free last processed pixel or creating a filtering window with a big dimension and search for a pixel value which is more frequent. Then Robust Estimator Algorithm is applied to the proposed filter to remove discontinuity of pixel intensity and smooth the image. The algorithm is mainly implemented focussing on the removal of high-density salt and pepper noise in images. Extensive simulation and visual quality of image shows that it can provide high quality restored images.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["339"]}

In vitro study of protein (bovine albumin, fraction v) binding was carried out by equilibrium dialysis method at pH 7.4 to ascertain the influence of ketotifen on the protein binding of theophylline.Results: Stability constant, ranging between 5.07 and 6.35, were derived from Ardon\u2019s plot, indicating that complexes formed, as a result of interaction between the drugs, were comparatively stable. However, following theophylline interaction with ketotifen, stability constant was< 1 at gastric pH (0.4 and 2.0) and 4.12 at intestinal pH.(6.0) The highest degree of protein binding by ketotifen was 98% and the lowest 90%. For theophylline, the highest and lowest degrees of protein binding were 90 and 85%, respectively.Conclusion: Concurrent administration of ketotifen and theophylline would result in the formation of a stable complex and this is likely to reduce the therapeutic activities of both drugs.

The project began in 2007\u201308 with farmers in Noakhali, Barisal and Bhola, but over the following two seasons spread throughout the south into Jhalakati, Pirojpur, Patuakhali and Barguna, finally including almost 300 farmers. The study was called the seed multiplication trial (SMT) because it used the widely distributed farmers to grow the new and elite varieties of wheat and sell the seed they produced to their neighbours for further wheat expansion. The initial concern was that farmers would harvest their transplanted (T.) aman rice so late that the following wheat crop would be pushed into the hottest part of the Rabi season, so would yield poorly. Farmers grew many types of T. aman varieties including local lines and some used a bullock-powered country plough to prepare their farms for the wheat crop, but despite expected delays, almost all farmers planted wheat before mid December. There was no convincing evidence that delaying planting until mid December had any effect on yield, either positive or negative. So from that viewpoint, wheat fitted satisfactorily into the natural Rabi time window, often left fallow, within a rice\u2013rice rotation. Yields varied considerably between locations and farmers with an underlying year effect.

However, the existing approaches for finding network biomarkers are ad-hoc and they do not offer an option to search the large network space to obtain a small set of significant network biomarkers. In this work, we present a graph mining based approach for a systematic discovery of network biomarkers. Traditional graph mining algorithms fail to solve this task because of large computational complexity; whereas, the top-k discriminative graph mining approach that we adopt in this work is efficient; besides it achieves better performance. On a breast cancer dataset using Support Vector Machine (SVM), the network biomarkers discovered using our approach yield a classification accuracy of 71%, whereas a single protein based approach using identical experimental setup achieves only 51% of accuracy.

{"title": "A parametric analysis of the strength-porosity relationship of green compacts formed through powder compaction route\n", "abstract": " The strength of a green compacts formed through warm powder compaction route is strongly dependent on the forming load and temperature. As the forming load increases, the powder particles move from its initial position by sliding among them and die wall. This movement results in new arrangement and packing order of the particles. However, due to this movement, pores among the particles are generated that affects the mechanical properties of the green compacts. Having pores in green compacts lead to strain intensification at ligaments between pores during sintering at later stage, hence serve as areas for crack initiation. Therefore, as the powder forming relates directly to the load and temperature, strength to porosity relationship has to be analyzed based on those parameters. This paper presents the effect of porosity to the strength of green compacts formed at different load and temperature (70 kN to 130\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["339"]}

This was quickly revealed to be untrue in the current model of the Internet. Many subsequent protocols were proposed to address the security issues of the BGP protocol. Among them, SBGP offer secure and guaranteed means to distribute route reachability information. However, the assumption under which the protocol is built resulted in a significant computational overhead due to extensive use of cryptographic operations. Indeed, upon the reception of an update, a node has to verify the embedded signature of each node in the AS-PATH in an onion fashion. In this paper, we present a novel approach that reduces the cost of construction and verifications of BGP updates. We make the assumption that some ASes (Like Tier-1 ISPs) can be considered to be trusted by the rest of the ASes. We build a\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["339"]}

Data were recorded on fibre yield and yield contributing characters such as plant height, base diameter, number of nodes per plant, internode length, leaf area, green weight with leaves per plant, green weight without leaves per plant and stick weight per plant. Significant variation was observed among the tested genotypes for different traits except base diameter. The genotypes G7 (Acc. No. 1481), G12 (Acc. No. 1524) showed better performance in respect of fibre yield (13.48 g and 12.35 g respectively) and plant height (3.43 m and 3.28 m respectively) indicating the possibility of using them in future breeding programs. Fibre yield was significantly and positively correlated with green weight with leaves (0.920**), green weight without leaves (0.921**) and stick weight (0.898**) indicating fairly strong inherent association among the characters.

The water cover keeps on changing due to a shorter and more intense monsoon period and a decline of freshwater flow throughout the dry period. Out of the 2.22 million ha less than 30% is perennial water (according to expert judgment; hard data is not available). In addition, there is 0.53 million ha of closed water. The amount of perennial as well as seasonal water is under continuous reduction due to natural as well as anthropogenic causes that have deleterious effects on aquatic habitats and a consequent loss in fisheries productivity.Bangladesh is prone to extreme climate variability which is being aggravated by anthropogenic activities. Among the disasters, flood was found to be devastating, and occurrence of flood was higher in coastal areas than in upper riparian locations. The combined effect of these natural and manmade disasters are reducing water availability, deteriorating wetland habitats and are consequentially having a severe impact on capture fisheries and also notable effects on aquaculture. This dearth of surface water and low flow of rivers is also putting large pressure on the groundwater table as well as allowing salinity intrusion into freshwater habitat.

Besides the importance of vertical and horizontal structures for biodiversity-related aspects, structural diversity is a matter of concern within forest management. The aggregation of tree species is essential for space and growing conditions for each individual. The applicability of indicators to assess the structural diversity of Sal forests has not been evaluated at present. Therefore, a study was undertaken to assess mixed and pure Sal forests' structural diversity at Madhupur by some diversity indicators developed for species-poor systems in Europe. Based on 60 sample plots, an analysis of 173 sample trees and related 692 neighbours were done. Species mingling, diameter and height dominance, uniform angle index and diameter, and height differentiation were calculated. The results indicated that within the mixed Sal forests, 40% of the trees were Sal, and within the pure forests, 95% of the trees were Sal. The uniform angle index in mixed and pure Sal forests was 0.61 and 0.34, respectively, which indicated a tendency towards clumped dispersion of trees in pure and regular dispersion of trees in mixed Sal forests. The results revealed that diameter dominance was random in mixed and regular in pure Sal forests, but height dominance was regular in both forests. Diameter and height differentiation were smaller in pure forests than mixed forests.

The clinical application of the radial artery was not established until 1992, when Acar and colleagues reported a series of 104 patients who underwent radial artery grafting with an angiographic early radial graft patency rate of 93.5% 2. These improved results were attributed to the appropriate use of pharmacological antispasm agent such as calcium channel blocker. An arterial graft more closely approximates the diameter of the coronary artery; for an equivalent flow volume, blood velocity is greater than for vein grafts, which may reduce stasis. The elastic and collagen support of the arterial wall is suited to arterial pressures that may be injurious to vein graft structure3. The radial artery is readily available and can be removed safely. The size is ideal for a coronary artery reconstruction. Radial arteries can be combined with IMAs to produce a complete arterial reconstruction in most patients4.The number of coronary artery bypass graft surgery done at the Department of Cardiac Surgery, National Institute of Cardiovascular disease in 2003 was 170.

Classical line based recognition techniques using Hausdorff distance deals with two dimensional (2D) models and 2D images. In our proposed 3D line based matching technique, two sets of lines are extracted from a 3D model and 3D image (constructed by stereo imaging). For matching these line sets, we used multidimensional Hausdorff distance minimization technique which requires only to find the translation between the image and the model, whereas most of the model based recognition techniques require to find the rotation, scale and translation variations between the image and the models. A line based approach for model based recognition using four dimensional (4D) Hausdorff distance has been already proposed in Ref. [1].

Ricci developed this branch of mathematics from 1887 to 1896. Subsequent work in differential geometry has made it an indespensible tool for solving in mathematical physics. The idea from differential geometry is to formulate hyperbolic conservation laws of scalar field equation on curved manifolds. The finite volume method is formulated such that scalar variables are numerically conserved and vector variables have a geometric source term that is naturally incorporated into a modified Riemann solver. The orthonormalization allows one to solve Cartesian Riemann problems that are devoid of geometric terms.

{"title": "Channeling commercial fund to NGO-MFIs: a case study of Bank-NGO linkage programme of Sonali Bank\n", "abstract": " Bangladesh has the largest and most vibrant micro finance industry in the world, which is greatly appreciated for its contribution in the reduction of poverty in the country. This industry, however, is encountering funding problem, because low cost funds and donations from abroad are declining. In this situation, strong suggestions have been made to finance this operation on commercial basis through statutory banks.  Sonali Bank has such a programme called SB-NGO Linkage programme for several years. This study analyzes the performance of this programme and concludes that by using comparative advantages, both the bank and the NGO-MFI can benefit through forging an effective linkage programme. Commercial banks can substantially increase their profitability through this kind of linkage, because the cost of lending is very low while the rate of recovery is very high. On the other hand, such programme significantly increases the sustainability and outreach of NGO\u00acMFIs.  Therefore, the study strongly recommends to formulate a workable mechanism, which would facilitate mutual trust between commercial banks and NGO-MFIs, working towards an effective and sustainable linkage with necessary government and NGO collaboration. Under such a framework, both GO and NGO can work together on the basis of their comparative advantages through coordination and cooperation to effectively serve the cause of poverty reduction.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["339"]}

EPA has recently designated electrokinetic method as a viable insitu process and interested parties are attempting to apply this method at contaminated sites which have inherently low permeability soils and otherwise difficult to remediate. Electrokinetic process induces a high water flow rate in clayey soils by the mechanism known as electro-osmosis and is primarily suitable for heavy metal removal. However, chemical reactions and sorption of metal ions within the soil matrix may adversely effect the decontamination process. Presence of a significant amount of heavy molecular weight organic matter within the soil pores may reduce the mobility of the heavy metals due to the formation of insoluble organometallic compounds. There has been some research in removing heavy metals and low concentration organic matter from soil by the electrokinetic method. The effects of soil organic matter on heavy metal removal by electrokinetic method has not been adequately investigated and several unanswered questions remain about the efficiency of the process under such circumstances.

Methods: The MCH-FP Extension Project of ICDDR.B works with the Government of Bangladesh, conducting operations research to improve health and family planning service-delivery. A sample of over 6,000 married women of reproductive age in three project sites was surveyed during 1994 to examine their awareness of STDs.  Both bivariate and multivariate analyses were done to examine the effects of some socio-demographic factors associated with the awareness of STDs. Family planning workers were interviewed through focus group discussions to determine their attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge about condom use and its effect on STDs. Results: About 30% of the sample women knew about syphilis and/or gonorrhoea. Among them, about 30% stated that syphilis, and 13% stated that gonorrhoea, are transmitted through sexual activities and contact with previously infected persons. The remaining 57% were not aware of the transmission mechanisms. Although condom use was low, 37% of condom users reported that condom use can prevent STDs. Awareness and knowledge of transmission of STDs were significantly higher among educated and relatively older women than others. The focus group discussions indicated that family planning and health care service providers have some knowledge of the mechanism of transmission of STDs.

The method is suitable for pore sizes in the range 1 to 100 nm. Traditional methods involve gas adsorption/desorption or mercury intrusion porosimetry. These methods are time-consuming and require elaborate procedures and the latter method is thought to damage delicate pore structures. NMR methods employing relaxation time measurement are well established and although rapid they rely on knowledge of surface relaxation interactions which can vary widely from sample to sample.

{"title": "Culture of rotifers with reference to some physico-chemical properties of water in nursery pond\n", "abstract": " Rotifers were cultured with five different organic and inorganic fertilizers in nursery ponds. Of the fertilizers used, mustard oil cake gave significantly (p < 0.01) higher production of rotifers than that of mohua oil cake followed by cow-dung, wheat bran, mixture of NPK and control. The higher production of rotifers was directly related with the higher doses of fertilizers. Among the rotifer species identified, the abundance of Brachionus caudatus and B. forficula were significantly (p < 0.01) higher than others. Available N, available P, exchangeable K and exchangeable Ca and exchangeable Mg were generally higher in ponds where organic fertilizers were used. Proximate composition of rotifers varied depending on the kinds of fertilizers. The multiple correlations of physico-chemical properties were highly significant (p < 0.01) with the growth and production of B. caudatus (R = 0.995), B. forficula (R = 0.932\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["339"]}

Recent study (1) shows that the leakage reactances may be reduced by 12-25 percent under severe fault conditions. This paper deals with the effects of this reduction in the machine's behavior during transient conditions. A technique has been developed to characterize the way in which the leakage reactances change with current. This paper also describes the formulation of a mathematical representation for leakage saturation to be included in conventional state space model of synchronous generator. The method has been developed and verified using the tests performed on a 3 kVA laboratory machine and on a 685 MW generator.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["339"]}

This project is sponsored by the University of Michigan, the Malaysian National Family Planning Board (NFPB), and the Ministry of Health of Malaysia. It is supported by the Office of Population of the US Agency for International Development through the University's Service Agreement grant. An important problem presently facing the Malaysia national family planning program is to determine how rapidly and effectively the program can be extended to the rural areas. The rural deployment of the program has been delayed because of the problems of recruiting and assigning personnel. The National Family Planning Board is directly under the Prime Minister's Department and is separated from the Ministry of Health. For this reason an effort was initiated to integrate family planning into rural maternal and child health services. At about the same time a project was planned to utilize traditional birth attendants (kampong bidans) for family planning services in rural areas where health facilities hardly exist. Kampong bidans are influential in the rural communities, since they still attend about 40 percent of the total deliveries in Malaysia.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["339"]}

Approximately 3500-4000 metric tons of solid wastes at the rate of 0.50 kg/cap/day are generated in Dhaka City. Nearly 50% of generated solid wastes are collected and dumped as crude landfill by the municipal authority. The rest of the generated wastes remain uncollected and produce serious environmental hazard in Dhaka City and uninhabitable situation/dismal for its dwellers. However, a little research works have been conducted to find the appropriate solution of the problem. Recently, Waste Concern (Non Government Organization) takes initiative to tackle the problem employing composting technique in a small community such as Dhalpur in Dhaka as an experimental basis. Wastes are collected as house-to-house basis by rickshaw van. Subsequently, the inorganic parts are removed by sorting out from the waste and organic parts are converted into compost (organic fertilizer) using windrow (box) type aerator. In this study work, the applicability of composting operation is studied in terms of technical, economical, social and environmental aspects as an alternative option of solid waste management. Also, a thorough investigation has been conducted among the dwellers on neighboring environmental conditions due to application of such method.

It saved land preparation costs ranging from 16.98 to 30.67% and seed cost 15.06 to 25.37%. CT ensured 16, 15, 18, and 18% higher yield for wheat, jute, onion, and mungbean respectively, compared to traditional tillage (TT) through the power tiller. This also increased farmers' net income 30, 23, 46, and 45% in aforesaid crops, respectively. Farmers those used CT technology received 17.9% higher gross return per hectare than TT using farmers. It was also found that PTOS is environment friendly since it could save 40% of fuel per hectare reducing 43% less emission of CO2 into the atmosphere. However, some problems such as lack of ridding facility, roller jam, and shallow tilling were observed in PTOS operation. Anyway, immediate initiative may be taken to disseminate this device throughout the country for making agriculture sustainable.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["339"]}
