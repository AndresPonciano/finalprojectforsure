{"title": "Conversational Assistants: Investigating Privacy Concerns, Trust, and Self-Disclosure\n", "abstract": " By the end of 2017 more than 33 million voice-based devices will be in circulation, many of which will include conversational assistants such as Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Apple\u2019s Siri. These devices require a significant amount of personal information from users to learn their preferences and provide them with personalized responses. This creates an interesting and important tension: the more information users disclose, the greater the value they receive from these devices; however, due to concerns for the privacy of personal information, users tend to disclose less information. In this study, we examine the role of reciprocal self-disclosure and trust within the novel and emerging context of conversational assistants. Specifically, we investigate the effect of conversational assistants\u2019 self-disclosure on the relationship between users\u2019 privacy concerns and their self-disclosure. Further, we explore the mechanism through which self-disclosure by conversational assistants influences this relationship, namely, the role of cognitive trust and emotional trust.", "num_citations": "53\n", "authors": ["1341"]}
{"title": "Job growth expectations among young entrepreneurs in Caribbean small-island states\n", "abstract": " This paper examines job growth expectations of young entrepreneurs in two small-island Caribbean states, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, using data from the 2013 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor's Adult Population Survey. Results from regression analyses reveal that job growth expectations of young Jamaican entrepreneurs were lower compared to their counterparts in Trinidad and Tobago. Young male entrepreneurs are more likely to increase job growth compared to young female entrepreneurs in both islands. Moreover, the analysis indicated a positive relationship between educational levels of young entrepreneurs and projected job growth in both countries. However, the benefits of education were different in these countries: if the level of education is increased by the same degree in both countries, job growth is expected to be relatively higher in Jamaica versus Trinidad and Tobago.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1341"]}
{"title": "Leveraging the Planning Fallacy to Manage Technical Debt in Agile Software Development Projects\n", "abstract": " One of the primary reasons for using agile software development (ASD) methods is to be agile\u2013to deliver working software quickly. Unfortunately, this pressure often encourages ASD practitioners to make long-term trade-offs for short-term gains (ie, to accumulate technical debt). Technical debt is a real and significant business challenge. Indeed, a recent study provides a conservative estimate of $361,000 of technical debt for every 100,000 lines of code. In this study, I examine the impact of the planning fallacy\u2013people\u2019s tendency to underestimate the time required to complete a project, even when they have considerable experience of past failures to live up to planned schedules\u2013on the accumulation of technical debt in ASD projects. Using an experiment, I seek to establish a causal relationship between the planning fallacy and technical debt and to demonstrate that solutions to the planning fallacy can be leveraged to manage technical debt in ASD projects.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1341"]}
{"title": "Managing Code Debt in Open Source Software Development Projects: A Digital Options Perspective\n", "abstract": " In this study, we examine the impact of three commonly used digital options on the accumulation of code debt in open source software development (OSSD) projects. Further, we examine the impact of code debt on three measures of OSSD project performance. Specifically, we hypothesize that increased use of defer options and abandon options is negatively related to the accumulation of code debt, while increased use of growth options is positively related to the accumulation of code debt. Further, we hypothesize that while the accumulation of code debt is negatively related to a project\u2019s market success and the engagement of peripheral developers, it is positively related to the engagement of core developers. To test our hypotheses, we plan to collect and analyze project data from a leading OSSD platform. We expect our findings to provide new theoretical perspectives for researchers and actionable insights for software practitioners.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1341"]}
{"title": "Decision-Making Under Uncertainty: A Study of Behavioral Similarity and Decision Support Systems\n", "abstract": " Despite the many advantages that decision support systems (DSS) provide to decision-makers, acceptance of advice from these systems has remained relatively low. This is particularly problematic in the investment management area, where modest downside variances can compromise the performance of an entire investment portfolio. In this study, we leverage theoretical insights from the literature to build a DSS that is behaviorally similar to its user, with the aim of increasing acceptance of DSS advice. To accomplish this, we developed a DSS using an adaptive feedforward artificial neural network to model a decision maker's preferences. To test whether users would be more accepting of advice from a behaviorally-similar DSS, we conducted a field experiment in a complex semi-structured decision context, namely the call options trading department of a large investment management firm.
