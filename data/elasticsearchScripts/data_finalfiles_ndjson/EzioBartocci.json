In recent years, a number of theoretical computer science developments have enabled modeling methodology to keep pace.

To answer to this question, we develop a multiaffine hybrid automaton (MHA) cardiac-cell model, and restate the original question as one of identification of the parameter ranges under which the MHA model accurately reproduces the disorder. The MHA model is obtained from the minimal cardiac model of one of the authors (Fenton) by first bringing it into the form of a canonical, genetic regulatory network, and then linearizing its sigmoidal switches, in an optimal way. By leveraging the Rovergene tool for genetic regulatory networks, we are then able to successfully identify the parameter ranges of interest.", "num_citations": "115\n", "authors": ["1649"]}

A workflow has the advantage to be reproducible, traceable and compositional by reusing other workflows. In order to support the daily work of a bioscientist, several Workflow Management Systems (WMSs) have been proposed in bioinformatics. Generally, these systems centralize the workflow enactment and do not exploit standard process definition languages to describe, in order to be reusable, workflows. While almost all WMSs require heavy stand-alone applications to specify new workflows, only few of them provide a web-based process definition tool. We have developed BioWMS, a Workflow Management System that supports, through a web-based interface, the definition, the execution and the results management of an in-silico experiment. BioWMS has been implemented over an agent-based middleware. It dynamically generates, from a user workflow specification, a domain-specific, agent-based workflow engine. Our approach exploits the proactiveness and mobility of the agent-based technology to embed, inside agents behaviour, the application domain features. Agents are workflow executors and the resulting workflow engine is a multiagent system \u2013 a distributed, concurrent system \u2013 typically open, flexible, and adaptative.

Many Web Services are already available and some WMS have been proposed. They assume that researchers know which bioinformatics resources can be reached through a programmatic interface and that they are skilled in programming and building workflows.

A classical question in formal modelling with clear relevance to biological modelling is the model checking problem. i.e. calculate the probability that a behaviour, expressed for instance in terms of a certain temporal logic formula, may occur in a given stochastic process. However, one may not only be interested in the notion of satisfiability, but also in the capacity of a system to mantain a particular emergent behaviour unaffected by the perturbations, caused e.g. from extrinsic noise, or by possible small changes in the model parameters. To address this issue, researchers from the verification community have recently proposed several notions of robustness for temporal logic providing suitable definitions of distance between a trajectory of a (deterministic) dynamical system and the boundaries of the set of trajectories satisfying the property of interest. The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, we extend the notion of robustness to stochastic systems, showing that this naturally leads to a distribution of robustness scores. By discussing two examples, we show how to approximate the distribution of the robustness score and its key indicators: the average robustness and the conditional average robustness. Secondly, we show how to combine these indicators with the satisfaction probability to address the system design problem, where the goal is to optimize some control\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "62\n", "authors": ["1649"]}

The key problem to solve for these models is to efficiently compute an optimal policy to control the system in order to maximise the probability of satisfying a set of temporal logic specifications. Here we introduce a novel method based on statistical model checking and an unbiased estimation of a functional gradient in the space of possible policies. Our approach presents several advantages over the classical methods based on discretisation techniques, as it does not assume the a-priori knowledge of a model that can be replaced by a black-box, and does not suffer from state-space explosion.

{"title": "Automated Termination Analysis of Polynomial Probabilistic Programs\n", "abstract": " The termination behavior of probabilistic programs depends on the outcomes of random assignments. Almost sure termination (AST) is concerned with the question whether a program terminates with probability one on all possible inputs. Positive almost sure termination (PAST) focuses on termination in a finite expected number of steps. This paper presents a fully automated approach to the termination analysis of probabilistic while-programs whose guards and expressions are polynomial expressions. As proving (positive) AST is undecidable in general, existing proof rules typically provide sufficient conditions. These conditions mostly involve constraints on supermartingales. We consider four proof rules from the literature and extend these with generalizations of existing proof rules for (P) AST. We automate the resulting set of proof rules by effectively computing asymptotic bounds on polynomials over the program variables. These bounds are used to decide the sufficient conditions\u2013including the constraints on supermartingales\u2013of a proof rule. Our software tool AMBER can thus check AST, PAST, as well as their negations for a large class of polynomial probabilistic programs, while carrying out the termination reasoning fully with polynomial witnesses. Experimental results show the merits of our generalized proof rules and demonstrate that AMBER can handle probabilistic programs that are out of reach for other state-of-the-art tools.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1649"]}

Due to the nonlinearity of multiaffine systems, it is difficult to verify their properties of interest directly. A common strategy to tackle this problem is to construct and analyze a discrete overapproximation of the original system. However, the conservativeness of a discrete abstraction significantly determines the level of confidence we can have in the properties of the original system. In this paper, in order to reduce the conservativeness of a discrete abstraction, we propose a new method based on a sufficient and necessary decision condition for computing discrete transitions between states in the abstract system.

Self-healing is an increasingly popular approach for ensuring resilience, that is, a proper monitoring and recovery, in CPSs. This work encodes and searches an adaptive knowledge base in Prolog/ProbLog that models relations among system variables given that certain implicit redundancy exists in the system.

This not only makes CPS analysis decidable and CPS design tractable, but also allows to write robust and adaptive CPS code. In DNP the connection between the sigmoidal guards of the nif and nwhile statements has to be given as a Gaussian Bayesian network, which reflects the partial knowledge, the CPS program has about its environment. To the best of our knowledge, DNP are the first approach linking neural networks to programs, in a way that makes explicit the meaning of the network.
