However, it is a vague concept covering many approaches. This study first clarifies the nature of user involvement and its expected benefits, and secondly reviews three streams of research, to evaluate the benefits and problems of varied user involvement approaches in practice. The particular focus of this study is on the early activities in the development process. An analysis of the literature suggests that user involvement has generally positive effects, especially on user satisfaction, and some evidence exists to suggest that taking users as a primary information source is an effective means of requirements capture. However, the role of users must be carefully considered and more cost-efficient practices are needed for gathering users' implicit needs and requirements in real product development contexts.", "num_citations": "1149\n", "authors": ["1479"]}
{"title": "UX Curve: A method for evaluating long-term user experience\n", "abstract": " The goal of user experience design in industry is to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty through the utility, ease of use, and pleasure provided in the interaction with a product. So far, user experience studies have mostly focused on short-term evaluations and consequently on aspects relating to the initial adoption of new product designs. Nevertheless, the relationship between the user and the product evolves over long periods of time and the relevance of prolonged use for market success has been recently highlighted. In this paper, we argue for the cost-effective elicitation of longitudinal user experience data. We propose a method called the \u201cUX Curve\u201d which aims at assisting users in retrospectively reporting how and why their experience with a product has changed over time.

It is generally believed that usability and more accurate user requirements are achieved through the involvement of potential users in product development. First, the benefits and challenges of user involvement identified in the literature were reviewed. It was discovered that early user involvement has positive effects on user and customer satisfaction and requirements quality, but it may additionally have negative effects on product development time and cost.  A practical approach to early user involvement referred to as 'user study' was synthesised to find a way to apply cost-effectively early user involvement to real product development contexts. The goal of the user study is cost-effectively to gather data on users and their needs and to translate them to user requirements that support the development of useful and usable products.  The user study approach was then evaluated in four case studies in five different product development companies. The first and second study focused on the usefulness of user studies. The third study investigated introducing the user study approach to a real product development context. The fourth study concerned representing the results of user studies: bridging the gap between user needs and user requirements.

{"title": "The Cross-Sequential Approach: A Short-Term Method for Studying Long-Term User Experience.\n", "abstract": " We propose a novel cross-sequential approach to accelerating the collection of user feedback while providing a broad perspective by analyzing samples of users at various stages of service and product experience. User experience changes over time as the relationship between user and product evolves. Understanding temporal changes is important for designing positive long-term user experience and supporting customer loyalty. However, companies and researchers face time and cost constraints, which is why longitudinal studies tracking user experience over an extended period of time are extremely rare. The crosssequential approach we propose reduces these barriers without compromising user-feedback quality. We tested the cross-sequential approach in evaluating the user experience of a commercial Internet security service and identified user experience spanning seven months in only seven weeks with two online surveys. We compared the cross-sequential approach to the cross-sectional approach commonly used in the industry. The cross-sectional approach identified differences between cohorts of 252 users. The crosssequential approach, on the other hand, allowed us to identify changes in individual users\u2019 user experience. These changes could also be tracked to different usage phases. This information could guide the design of better long-term user experience for the service. The positive and negative changes in user enjoyment over time are relevant as they were reflected in users\u2019 loyalty to the service, replicating results from longitudinal studies.

{"title": "Assessing requirements engineering processes with the REAIMs model: lessons learned\n", "abstract": " Organizations are becoming increasingly interested in improving their requirements engineering processes. The assessment of the current situation is the first step towards systematic process improvement. The REAIMS model (Sommerville et al. 1997) has been developed to evaluate the status of existing requirements practices. This paper describes an assessment process and two assessment instruments that can help organizations to use the REAIMS model. We evaluated the model, the process and the instruments by performing an assessment in three organizations. The results of the study indicate that the REAIMS model provides useful information for communication, motivation and process improvement planning. REAIMS assessment results are dependent on assessors, and are therefore not reliable for longterm monitoring and benchmarking as such. A systematic assessment process such as the one described in this paper can improve reliability of assessment results.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1479"]}

In this study, we evaluated the long-term UX of a multi-component product from the sports domain. We present a comparison of two remote UX evaluation methods: a weekly filled-in electronic diary and the UX Curve method for retrospective evaluation. The cost-effectiveness of the methods was evaluated using two factors: the amount of time required by 1) the researchers in employing the methods and 2) the participants to report their experiences with the method. Also, to determine the quality of the reported experiences, their content was compared between the methods. The results show that the electronic diary was more effective in revealing the experiences related to utility, missing functionalities, technical faults, dissatisfaction, and effectiveness.

However, this is unfortunately often the case in HCI research. The goal of this workshop is to deepen and expand available knowledge with respect to temporal dynamics of UX. Relevant aspects will be the understanding of how UX is evolving over time, in particular across products and contexts, as well as the exploration of methods that can evaluate long-term UX in practice. For this, the organizers will prepare a booklet that introduces existing models and methods for long-term UX as a mutual basis for discussing critical experience phases that should be taken into consideration in product development. The booklet also summarizes pre-notes from participants which will be collected prior to the workshop. In addition, during an interactive group activity, participants will reflect on the diversity of longterm UX of different product types. Participants from academia as well as from industry are invited in order to tackle the question of how to make research results and methods applicable in practice.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1479"]}

In this study, the goal was to identify health professionals\u2019 experiences of the benefits and challenges of new symptom checkers providing triage advice. Data was collected through an online survey of 61 health professionals who were target users of the online symptom checkers implemented in six public health organizations and one private occupational health clinic. Most of the health professionals supported the use of online symptom checkers and found services useful to patients because they provided patients quick contact with health professionals and referral to care or self-management instructions regardless of time and place. Health professionals were less confident that most of the patients were capable and willing to use the symptom checkers. Health professionals were satisfied with symptom checkers providing them with more useful information before meeting patients. By contrast, symptom checkers were seen as disrupting clinical work and time-consuming. The results imply that the clinical work processes should be redesigned to guide patients in an efficient manner, avoid work overlap, and provide work motivation for professionals.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1479"]}
