{"title": "Active workspaces: distributed collaborative systems based on guarded attribute grammars\n", "abstract": " This paper presents a purely declarative approach to artifact-centric collaborative systems, a model which we introduce in two stages. First, we assume that the workspace of a user is given by a mindmap, shortened to a map, which is a tree used to visualize and organize tasks in which he or she is involved, with the information used for the resolution of these tasks. We introduce a model of guarded attribute grammar, or GAG, to help the automation of updating such a map. A GAG consists of an underlying grammar, that specifies the logical structure of the map, with semantic rules which are used both to govern the evolution of the tree structure (how an open node may be refined to a subtree) and to compute the value of some of its attributes (which derives from contextual information). The map enriched with this extra information is termed an active workspace. Second, we define collaborative systems by making the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["2217"]}
{"title": "A Software Architecture for Data Mining Environment\n", "abstract": " Data Mining also called Knowledge Discovery consists in analyzing a large set of raw data in order to extract hidden predictive information. It is a discipline which is at the confluence of artificial intelligence, data bases, statistics, and machine learning. The questions related to the knowledge discovery present several facets whose principal ones are: classification, clustering and association. Several models of algorithms are used for each aspect: Neural Networks, Lattice, Statistics, Decision trees, Genetic Algorithms (Mephu, 2001). Technically, data mining is the process of analyzing data from many different dimensions or angles, and summarizing the relationships identified. For example, analysis of retail point of sale transaction data can give information on which products are selling and when. The summary of this information on retail can be analyzed in the perspective of promotional efforts to provide knowledge of consumer buying behavior. Based on the acquired knowledge, a manufacturer or retailer could determine which items are most susceptible to promotional efforts. Although several tools were developed for this purpose, we note the lack of software environments which are able to support the user activities in a coherent way during the process of data mining.A software environment can be seen as a set of components which are able to work in cooperation. Each component offers services to other components and it can require some services from them. The role of the environment consists in coordinating the execution of the components which it incorporates, in order to complete the tasks which are assigned to him.

An open question that remains in the design of these types of systems is to build a method, or to choose one among those existing, capable to cover the life cycle of a project, and particularly the development phases. This article contributes to answer the question, by proposing an approach based on a multi-criteria comparative study, of few languages and methods dedicated to the design of real time and embedded systems. The underlying objective of this work is to present to designers a wide range of approaches, and elements that can guide their choices. In order to reach this goal, we propose different comparison criteria. Each criterion is divided into sub-criteria, so that the designers can refine their choices according to the qualities they prefer and wish to have in the method or language. We also define a rating scale which is used to assess the retained languages and methods. The scores obtained from this assessment are presented in tables, one table per criterion, followed by a summary table giving the overall scores. Graphics built from these tables are provided and intend to facilitate the judgement and thus the choice of the designers.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["2217"]}

{"title": "A rule-based language and verification framework of dynamic service composition\n", "abstract": " The emergence of BPML (Business Process Modeling Language) has favored the development of languages for the composition of services. Process-oriented approaches produce imperative languages, which are rigid to change at run-time because they focus on how the processes should be built. Despite the fact that semantics is introduced in languages to increase their flexibility, dynamism is limited to find services that have disappeared or become defective. They do not offer the possibility to adapt the composite service to execution. Although rules-based languages were introduced, they remain very much dependent on the BPML which is the underlying technology. This article proposes the specification of a rule-based declarative language for the composition of services. It consists of the syntactic categories which make up the concepts of the language and a formal description of the operational semantics that highlights the dynamism, the flexibility and the adaptability of the language thus defined. This paper also presents a verification framework made of a formal aspect and a toolset. The verification framework translates service specifications into Promela for model checking. Then, a validation framework is proposed that translates the verified specifications to the operational system. Finally, a case study is presented.

The research question is to combine the two approaches to facilitate the work of developers. The proposal resulting from this study is based on a set of concepts defined using the UML profiles. These concepts include services, business components, and data persistence. Then the Kruchten model is adopted to represent the development cycle according to several views, each view being represented by UML diagrams derived from the previously defined profiles. Finally, rules are available for checking inter-view consistency, from refinement to code generation.
