{"title": "Knowledge Management: An organizational capabilities perspective\n", "abstract": " A hallmark of the new economy is the ability of organizations to realize economic value from their collection of knowledge assets as well as their assets of information, production distribution, and affiliation. Despite the competitive necessity of becoming a knowledge-based organization, senior managers have found it difficult to transform their firms through programs of knowledge management. This is particularly true if their organizations have long histories of process and a tradition of business success. This research examines the issue of effective knowledge management from the perspective of organizational capabilities. This perspective suggests that a knowledge infrastructure consisting of technology, structure, and culture along with a knowledge process architecture of acquisition, conversion, application, and protection are essential organizational capabilities or \"preconditions\" for effective knowledge\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6574\n", "authors": ["2066"]}

Since face-to-face meetings are increasingly less common among distributed teams, team members are more frequently sharing their knowledge through the use of \u201cvirtual workspaces\u201d\u2013an integrated set of tools that offer a variety of communication support capabilities including a common team repository organized for easy search and retrieval, application sharing, electronic whiteboards and group discussion forums. Current literature suggests that group and contextual factors in general and a group\u2019s transactive memory in particular may shape how virtual workspaces are used to enhance the effectiveness of knowledge sharing within distributed teams. However, no empirical study has demonstrated the influence of transactive memory in shaping the relationship between virtual workspace usage and knowledge sharing effectiveness. Moreover, research on information technology support for distributed teams has not proposed theoretically-derived dimensions of communication support that can be provided by virtual workspaces. Based on common ground theory (Clark and Brennan 1991), we identify two dimensions of communication support required to create common ground among team members, as well as the role of transactive memory in influencing the value of each dimension in making knowledge sharing more effective. We studied 53 distributed teams and found that teams with low transactive memory reported higher satisfaction with the effectiveness of knowledge sharing in their teams when they used virtual\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "31\n", "authors": ["2066"]}

Organizations are increasingly relying on online crowds to innovate through mechanisms such as crowdsourcing, open innovation, innovation challenges and tournaments. To leverage the \"wisdom of crowds\", crowdsourcing platforms that enable heterogeneous knowledge sharing in crowds lead to novel solution generation by individuals in the crowd. Based on the associative variety memory model of creativity, the authors hypothesize that when a crowd contributes a heterogeneous knowledge in form of a variety of knowledge associations, individual crowd members tend to generate solutions that are more novel.

Organizations, governments, and cross-national bodies are turning their attention to the question of how we can create a sustainable society. Sustainability is a complex term that can encompass environmental, economic, and societal issues. In essence, sustainability is conservation, deployment, and reuse of resources in responsible ways\u2014a responsibility that is geared toward the triple bottom line. The triple bottom line\u2014people, planet, and profit\u2014view of value creation balances commercial and societal goals in a way that all three Ps are addressed simultaneously rather than being seen as trade-offs or with one goal overriding the other two. Although consultants, vendors, and others have posited that information systems can play a significant role in sustainability, there is a dearth of rigorous research into these issues, which also motivates this special issue.Several perspectives might be adopted by researchers in guiding their work. First, there is the viewpoint that sustainability issues can be prioritized into three categories: generic, value chain, and competitive context (Porter and Kramer 2006). For example, the competitive context calls for a proactive strategic approach and may offer opportunities to illustrate the transformative power of IS. Second, the four dimensions of the sustainability portfolio (pollution prevention, product stewardship, clean technology, and sustainability vision)(Hart 1997) provide another angle for investigating the role of IS\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["2066"]}

CEOs and CIOs are facing new competitive challenges. The emerging electronic economy is bringing with it new forms of IT-enabled intermediation, virtual supply chains, rapidly changing internet-based technologies, and unprecedented sensitivity for time-to-market by customers. Customers are demanding more value, customized to their exact needs, at less cost, and as quickly as possible. The companies that will survive in such a demanding environment will need to innovate and invent new ways of creating value that take advantage of the ubiquity and power of networked information technologies.This paper describes the experience of Marshall Industries, an electronics distribution company that ventured to change the rules in order to take advantage of IT-enabled ways to quickly create value for its network of present and future partners. The paper examines the challenges that faced Marshall Industries in 1991 and how the company transformed itself through the CEO\u2019s vision of a collaborative organization fueled by IT-enabled value innovation and its rapid deployment. The paper describes how the IT infrastructure and its evolution supported and helped to shape the corporate strategy. It provides lessons about the new rules of building and managing an extended enterprise in the electronic economy and guidelines for building the requisite IT infrastructure.

Using the lens of creative synthesis (Harvey 2014), the research seeks to address the question of how sequences of knowledge contributions independently offered by different participants affect the emergence of innovative solutions. Through an analysis of time-stamped contributions made in seven collaborative crowdsourcing events, the findings show that certain exemplar sequences have a positive impact on the emergence of innovative solutions in the crowd. On the other hand, some other sequences can negatively impact the emergence of innovative solutions. Specifically, the findings show that the emergence of innovative solutions are more likely after sequences from different contributors in which: 1) one contributor offers an early idea seed after others offer problem facts and analogies (rather than the inverse in which idea seeds followed by problem facts and analogies), and 2) one contributor describes a paradox which is followed by others adding more problem facts (rather than the inverse in which paradoxes are posted after facts). Additionally, innovative solutions are more likely to emerge subsequent to a single contribution of a paradox.
