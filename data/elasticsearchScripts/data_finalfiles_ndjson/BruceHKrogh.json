The authors develop a Petri net (PN) model of concurrent job flow and dynamic resource allocation in an FMS and define deadlock in terms of transition enabling in the PN model. The problem of deadlock avoidance is addressed by introducing the notion of a restriction policy, which is a feedback policy for excluding some enabled transitions from the current resource allocation alternatives. The authors then present their deadlock avoidance algorithm (DAA) and prove that restricted deadlock can never occur for any resource allocation policy implemented under the DAA restriction policy. The DAA can be implemented easily in real time and is much less restrictive for FMS applications than existing algorithms for deadlock avoidance in computer systems.

Methods based on forward reachability have proven to be inefficient and in some cases inadequate in constructing these invariant sets. In this paper, we propose a novel approach combining forward- and backward-reachability while iteratively refining partitions at each step. The technique can yield dramatic memory and runtime reductions. We illustrate the effectiveness by verifying, for the first time, the limit cycle oscillation behavior of a third-order model of a differential VCO circuit", "num_citations": "123\n", "authors": ["1865"]}

{"title": "Multiple source detection and localization in advection-diffusion processes using wireless sensor networks\n", "abstract": " This paper concerns the use of large-scale wireless sensor networks to detect and locate leaks of specified gases in the presence of time-varying advection (air currents) and diffusion. We show that when leaks are rare but constant for long periods, Kalman filtering combined with binary hypothesis testing provides an effective alternative to full-scale hypothesis testing covering all possible combinations of leaks and leak intensities. To reduce energy consumption and use of communication bandwidth, a two-tiered strategy is proposed in which a reduced number of sensors (Tier 1) provides coarse-grid sensing. When a leak is detected by the Tier 1 strategy, fine-grained grids of sensors (Tier 2) are activated around the vicinities of the detected leak areas to provide more precise detection and localization. Energy consumption is further reduced by applying an information versus energy-based dynamic sensor selection\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "42\n", "authors": ["1865"]}

Dynamic constraints refer to limits on force/torque inputs and frictional force constraints which must be satisfied for a trajectory to be feasible.

When deadlock occurs there is a chain of active processes, or jobs, in the system in which each job is waiting for the resource held by the next job in the chain. The deadlock avoidance problem is to find a policy for restricting resource allocation so that such a circular wait condition Qever occurs. More precisely, the restriction policy must guarantee that there always exists some resource allocation policy under the restriction which will allow any job to advance through the system to completion. A generalization of the circular wait condition is shown to be a necessary condition for deadlock under a restriction policy.

{"title": "Recent advances in discrete analysis and control of hybrid systems\n", "abstract": " A standard approach to the formal analysis of hybrid systems (that is, systems with both continuous and discrete state variables) is to first construct purely discrete-state models, usually by building transition systems based on finite partitions of the continuous state space. Analysis and synthesis techniques for discrete-state systems are then applied to the discrete model to verify properties of the hybrid system and to synthesize supervisory controllers. This brief paper reviews the theory for discrete analysis of hybrid systems.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1865"]}
{"title": "Adaptive control of Markov chains with average cost\n", "abstract": " We present an adaptive control scheme for the control of Markov chains to minimize long-run average cost when the system transition and reward structures are unknown. Q-factors are estimated along a single sample path of the system and control actions are applied based on the latest estimates. We prove that an optimal policy is obtained asymptotically with probability one. More importantly, we prove that optimal system performance is achieved as well, which means that the performance of the system can not be bettered even if the system transition and reward structures are known. An example is given to illustrate our adaptive control scheme.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1865"]}
{"title": "Synthesizing supervisory controllers for hybrid systems\n", "abstract": " This paper presents the basic theory for developing such procedures. The general problem formulation reflects many practical situations in which the continuous control modes are known, discrete sensors are in place to detect transitions in the continuous system operating regime, and the purpose of the supervisory control logic is to select the discrete control modes to achieve the desired system behavior over the entire range of operation. The approach is based on the construction of finite-state approximations to the inputoutput behavior of the hybrid dynamic system. This enables us to use results from the theory of discrete event systems to construct the supervisor for the hybrid system.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1865"]}
{"title": "A new approach to guaranteed stability for receding horizon control\n", "abstract": " A new approach to guarantee asymptotic stability for receding horizon control (RHC) algorithms is proposed. In contrast to other approaches which impose constraints on the terminal state of the predicted trajectory or append an infinite-horizon cost to the objective function, stability is achieved by imposing a stability constraint on the magnitude of the state along the entire predicted trajectory, and (if possible) reducing the constraint at each stage. It is shown that asymptotic stability is guaranteed for the case of multi-input linear time invariant (LTI) systems with full state information. Stability is achieved for any prediction horizon and any cost function. Features of the algorithm are illustrated for two simulation examples. Relationships to other approaches are discussed and several directions for extending the method are identified in the concluding section.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1865"]}
{"title": "Stochastic simulator for smart microgrid planning\n", "abstract": " Developing world microgrids often balance insufficient supply with growing, unpredictable demand. Deterministic and probabilistic simulators exist to model these microgrids, and each focuses on different technical aspects. With the addition of smart meters into microgrids, monitoring and control is now available at high granularity, which enriches microgrid planning and operation. This research is designing a new simulator that incorporates models of smart meters that allow real-time power clipping for demand side management, effectively smoothing the system load curve as needed to represent inherent uncertainty. Individual supplies and demands are modeled as discrete probability mass functions (PMFs). To compare clipping schemes for grid operation and generation mixes for planning, we aggregate the probabilistic inputs by convolution and then compute expected energy sold and probability of avoiding\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1865"]}
{"title": "A unified thermal-computational approach to data center energy management\n", "abstract": " This paper presents a unified, coordinated, thermal-computational approach to the data center energy management problem. A data center is modeled as two coupled networks: a computational and a thermal network. The first network describes the computation performance of the data center, while the latter describes temperature evolution of the devices housed in the data center, based on their electrical power consumption and cooling. Server power states influence both networks. We formulate the energy control problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and compare through an example, the performance of a controller derived using the proposed unified thermal-computational approach against a controller that disregard the coupling between the two networks. Simulation results suggest further research directions.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1865"]}
{"title": "Estimation in virtual sensor-actuator arrays using reduced-order physical models\n", "abstract": " In many applications envisioned for wireless sensors, physical variables governed by continuous, distributed dynamics need to be monitored and controlled. Spatial and temporal irregularities in sampling available from the wireless nodes are usually inconsistent with the application requirements. In this paper we propose virtual sensor-actuator arrays to address this problem and consider the problem of estimating values of physical variables at points other than the wireless node locations. We use reduced-order models of the physical dynamics to generate these estimates. Model parameters are estimated using parametric system identification techniques. The concepts are illustrated for the problem of estimating temperatures based on circuit models of thermal dynamics. Results are presented from experiments using actual data collected by a wireless sensor network.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1865"]}
{"title": "Stability constrained model predictive control for nonlinear systems\n", "abstract": " A new method for nonlinear model predictive control with guaranteed stability is proposed as an extension to the stability constrained model predictive control (SCMPC) for linear time-invariant systems. The method applies to a class of nonlinear systems that can be transformed to a controllable companion form and depends on the existence of a nonlinear deadbeat control (although this is not necessarily the control that is used). Asymptotic stability is proved for the case when all state variables are measurable.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1865"]}

{"title": "Saturation-induced frequency instability in electric power systems\n", "abstract": " This paper concerns the effects of generator controller limits on long-term power system stability. It is shown through an example that when the system operates near its limits, saturation in the turbine/governor controllers can lead to frequency instability that would not be evident from load-flow analysis. A linearized model with controller saturation nonlinearity is obtained that preserves the saturation-induced instability phenomenon. A linear matrix inequalities (LMI) technique is used to find a region of attraction for the saturated linear system that gives an estimate of the maximum load disturbance that can be tolerated when the saturation effect is taken into account. Simulation also shows a power system stabilizer (PSS) providing frequency feedback to the automatic voltage regulator (AVR) significantly enhances the system robustness to large disturbances, while reducing the AVR gain has little effect.

{"title": "Efficient synthesis of control logic for a class of discrete event systems\n", "abstract": " Real-world applications of the emerging theory of controlled discrete event systems (DESs) will not be realized until the obstacle of computational complexity is overcome. This paper presents a step in that direction by developing a computationally efficient solution for a class of forbidden state problems. We consider DESs which can be modeled as cyclic controlled marked graphs (CMGs), a class of controlled Petri nets (CPNs). The distributed representation of the DES state in terms of the CMG marking permits an efficient specification of the forbidden states in terms of individual place markings. More importantly, we show that the graphical representation of the state transition logic in a CMG can be used to synthesize state feedback logic which is maximally permissive while guaranteeing the forbidden states will not occur. The practical application of the theoretical results is illustrated for an example of automated\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1865"]}
