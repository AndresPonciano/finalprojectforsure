{"title": "Weight-length and Condition Factor Relationship of Thaila, Catla catla\n", "abstract": " Twenty-five fresh water \u201cThaila\u201d, Catla catla of various sizes were sampled from Korang River Islamabad, to study the parameters of weight-length and condition factor. Log transformed regression were used to test the allometric growth. It was observed that growth in weight is almost proportional to the cube of its length. The value of slope b= 305 coincides with the slope of that of an ideal fish. Condition factor remains fairly constant with increasing length or weight. The predictive equation can be used to estimate parameters investigated with a fair amount of accuracy with in the size range studies.", "num_citations": "39\n", "authors": ["1269"]}
{"title": "Secure DNS from amplification attack by using modified bloom filters\n", "abstract": " Domain Name System (DNS) is the vital part of the internet world. One of the attacks on DNS is an amplification attack, in which IP is spoofed by the eavesdropper in order to launch a bandwidth consumption attack. In this attack Bulk of responses are received by the victim server in a response to a single query. In this paper the structure of the Bloom Filter is modified and its defense against the amplification attack is proposed. In this proposed solution, we used a modified bloom filter in which we have added one more property that is, we can edit its membership, such as newcomer, old one and black listed old member. Through this when old members come after a specific interval of time, they are going to register themselves as newcomers in bloom filter and this bloom filter will be placed near the victim ISP or it organization router. So when the attacker initiates a query, after a certain check it can be put on the black list.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1269"]}
{"title": "Emergence of vancomycin resistant enterococci in paediatric patients\n", "abstract": " Aim: To determine the frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility profile of vancomycin resistant Enterococci in paediatric patients.Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted at The Children\u2019s Hospital and Institute of Child Health, Lahore, Pakistan from June 2012 to December 2012. A total number of 2,980 urine samples were collected from suspected cases of urinary tract infections and processed for microbiological analysis. The organisms were identified by routine microbiological techniques and biochemical tests. Antimicrobial susceptibility profile was determined by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method.Results: From 2,980 urine samples, 830 (27.8%) samples were positive for bacterial growth. Enterococcus species were isolated in 93 (11.2%) cases. Out of 93 Enterococci, 15 (16.2%) were vancomycin resistant Enterococci (VRE). All of the VRE were susceptible to linezolid.

{"title": "Pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies for volume overload in acute decompensated congestive heart failure: a review article\n", "abstract": " The epithet of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is volume overload. ADHF is associated with a rising number of hospital admission for volume overload. Medication non-compliance, excessive salt intake, comorbidities, and/or disease progression can attribute to volume overload. Heart failure (HF) therapy has innovated during the past few decades, but diuretics have been the mainstay of treatment. Diuretics are vital even though these drugs stimulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and lead to adaptive responses like diuretic resistance, neurohormonal activation, and worsening renal function that may be inimical. There has been a thriving interest in cutting-edge strategies to manage volume overload in ADHF. The American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) and the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines advocate pharmacological and non-pharmacological\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1269"]}
{"title": "Population dynamics of the ribbon fish, Lepturacanthus savala (Cuvier 1829) from the north-eastern part of the Bay of Bengal\n", "abstract": " Population parameters of Lepturacanthus savala from the trawl catches in the north-eastern part of the Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh were investigated based on length frequency data, using complete ELEFAN computer program. The asymptotic length (L\u03b1) and growth constant (K) were estimated to be 106.50 cm (total length) and 0.80/year respectively. Based on these growth parameters, the total mortality (Z) was estimated to be 1.89. The estimated values for natural mortality (M) and fishing mortality (F) were 1.08 and 0.81 respectively. The estimated value for the exploitation rate (E) using the length converted catch curve was 0.43. The recruitment pattern showed two peaks per year. The estimated sizes of L. savala at 25, 50 and 75% probabilities of capture were 57.49, 60.39 and 63.28 cm respectively. The estimated length weight relationship for combined sex was W=0.00093 TL(super)2.97", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1269"]}

It is a critical issue in current IT infrastructure that cannot be neglected in any future planning of business management. The structured and un-structured data are necessary to recognize and consolidate its nature with respect to data management. In this paper we have discussed the characteristics of data volumes, velocity, variety, value, legitimacy and complexity of the basic infrastructure of big data with respect to business analytics to understand its need for big companies to compete them with their competitors with efficient decision making and data handling within an appropriate time period.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1269"]}
