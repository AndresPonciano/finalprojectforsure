{"title": "Hardware Trojan detection using path delay fingerprint\n", "abstract": " Trusted IC design is a recently emerged topic since fabrication factories are moving worldwide in order to reduce cost. In order to get a low-cost but effective hardware trojan detection method to complement traditional testing methods, a new behavior-oriented category method is proposed to divide trojans into two categories: explicit payload trojan and implicit payload trojan. This categorization method makes it possible to construct trojan models and then lower the cost of testing. Path delays of nominal chips are collected to construct a series of fingerprints, each one representing one aspect of the total characteristics of a genuine design. Chips are validated by comparing their delay parameters to the fingerprints. The comparison of path delays makes small trojan circuits significant from a delay point of view.

We propose Resilient Distributed Kalman Filter (RDKF), a novel distributed algorithm that estimates states within an error bound and does not depend on the number of agents that can be compromised by an attack. Our method is based on convex optimization and performs well in practice, which we demonstrate with the help of a simulation example.

While all circuit components are potential power side channels, D-flip-flops (DFFs) are often the primary source of information leakage to an SCA. This paper proposes a DFF design based on the three-independent-gate field-effect transistor (TIGFET) that reduces side-channel vulnerabilities of sequential circuits. Notably, we find that the IV characteristics of the TIGFET itself leads to inherent side-channel resilience, which in turn enables simpler and more efficient cryptographic hardware. Our proposed design is based on a prior TIGFET-based true single-phase clock (TSPC) DFF design, which offers high performance and reduced area. More specifically, our modified TSPC (mTSPC) design exploits the symmetric IV characteristics of TIGFETs, which results in pull-up and pull-down currents that are nearly identical. When combined with additional circuit modifications (made possible by the unique characteristics of the TIGFET), the mTSPC circuit draws almost the same amount of supply currents under all possible input transitions (less than 1% variation for different transitions), which can in turn mask information leakage. Using a 10nm TIGFET technology model, simulation results show that the proposed TIGFET-based DFF circuit leads to decreased power consumption (up to 96.9% when compared to the prior secured designs), has a low delay (15.2 ps), and employs only 12 TIGFET devices.

The tool optimizes clock networks for both traditional design requirements and security constraints. To achieve this goal, we first\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1803"]}
{"title": "CHIMERA: A Hybrid Estimation Approach to Limit the Effects of False Data Injection Attacks\n", "abstract": " The reliable operation of the electric power systems is supported by energy management systems (EMS) that provide monitoring and control functionalities. Contingency analysis is a critical application of EMS to evaluate the impacts of outage events based on the grid state variables, and allow system operators to prepare for potential system failures. However, false data injection attacks (FDIAs) against state estimation have demonstrated the possibility of compromising sensor measurements and consequently falsifying the estimated power system states. As a result, FDIAs may mislead the system operations and other EMS applications including contingency analysis and optimal power flow routines. In this paper, we assess the effect of FDIAs on contingency analysis and demonstrate that such attacks can affect the resulted number of contingencies in power systems. In order to mitigate the FDIA impact on contingency analysis algorithms, we propose CHIMERA, a hybrid attack-resilient state estimation approach that integrates model-based and data-driven methods. CHIMERA combines the physical grid information with a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based deep learning model by considering a static loss of weighted least square errors and a dynamic loss of the difference between the temporal variations of the actual and the estimated active power. Our simulation experiments based on the load data from New York state demonstrate that CHIMERA can effectively mitigate 91.74% of the attack cases in which FDIAs can maliciously modify the contingency results.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1803"]}

In order to achieve a high level of economy of scale, the global supply chain of electronic systems has evolved into disparate segments for the design, fabrication, assembly, and testing of PCB boards and their various associated components. As a consequence, the modern PCB supply chain exposes many vulnerabilities along its different stages, allowing adversaries to introduce malicious alterations to facilitate board-level attacks.As an emerging hardware threat, the attack and defense techniques at the board level have not yet been systemically explored and thus require a thorough and comprehensive investigation.

{"title": "PowerScout: A Security-Oriented Power Delivery Network Modeling Framework for Cross-Domain Side-Channel Analysis\n", "abstract": " The growing complexity of modern electronic systems often leads to the design of more sophisticated power delivery networks (PDNs). Similar to other system-level shared resources, the on-board PDN unintentionally introduces side channels across design layers and voltage domains, despite the fact that PDNs are not part of the functional design. Recent work have demonstrated that exploitation of the side channel can compromise the system security (i.e. information leakage and fault injection). In this work, we systematically investigate the PDN-based side channel as well as the countermeasures. To facilitate our goal, we develop PowerScout, a security-oriented PDN simulation framework that unifies the modeling of different PDN-based side-channel attacks. PowerScout performs fast nodal analysis of complex PDNs at the system level to quantitatively evaluate the severity of side-channel vulnerabilities.

Thus, securing sensor data of these vehicles from DoS or FDI attacks is essential to avoid unwanted consequences.

{"title": "RTL-PSC: automated power side-channel leakage assessment at register-transfer level\n", "abstract": " Power side-channel attacks (SCAs) have become a major concern to the security community due to their non-invasive feature, low-cost, and effectiveness in extracting secret information from hardware implementation of cryto algorithms. Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate if the hardware is vulnerable to SCAs during its design and validation stages. Currently, however, there is little-known effort in evaluating the vulnerability of a hardware to SCAs at early design stage. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, an automated framework, named RTL-PSC, for power side-channel leakage assessment of hardware crypto designs at register-transfer level (RTL) with built-in evaluation metrics. RTL-PSC first estimates power profile of a hardware design using functional simulation at RTL. Then it utilizes the evaluation metrics, comprising of KL divergence metric and the success rate (SR) metric based on maximum likelihood estimation to perform power side-channel leakage (PSC) vulnerability assessment at RTL. We analyze Galois-Field (GF) and Look-up Table (LUT) based AES designs using RTL-PSC and validate its effectiveness and accuracy through both gate-level simulation and FPGA results. RTL-PSC is also capable of identifying blocks inside the design that contribute the most to the PSC vulnerability which can be used for efficient countermeasure implementation.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1803"]}
