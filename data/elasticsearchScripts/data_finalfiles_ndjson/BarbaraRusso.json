However, existing studies evidence traces of collinearity between some of the metrics and low ranges of other metrics, two facts which may endanger the validity of models based on the CK suite. As high correlation may be an indicator of collinearity, in this paper, we empirically determine to what extent high correlations and low ranges might be expected among CK metrics.               To draw as much general conclusions as possible, we extract the CK metrics from a large data set (200 public domain projects) and we apply statistical meta-analysis techniques to strengthen the validity of our results.

For each integer r'<r, associate to E the invariant s_{r'}(E)=r'deg(E)-rdeg(E') where E'is a subbundle of E of rank r' and maximal degree. For every r', one can stratify the moduli space of stable vector bundles according to the value of the invariant. Lange's conjecture says that this strata are non-empty and of the right dimension if s_{r'}>0. The conjecture has recently been solved thanks to work of Lange- Narasimhan, Lange-Brambila-Paz, Ballico and the authors. The purpose of this paper is to give a simpler proof of the result valid without further assumptions. The method of proof provides additional information on the geometry of the strata. We can prove that each strata (which is irreducible) is contained in the closure of the following one. We also show the unicity of the maximal subbundle when s\\le r'(r-r')(g-1). Our methods can be used to study twisted Brill-Noether loci and to give a new proof of Hirschowitz Theorem about the non-speciality of the tensor product of generic vector bundles.", "num_citations": "84\n", "authors": ["474"]}

In a nutshell, knowledge transfer is about forming ways on how a source of knowledge (namely, an existing model) can be used in presence of new, very limited experimental evidence. In virtue of the nature of the problem at hand (a situation encountered quite commonly, e.g. in project cost estimation), new data could be very limited and this scarcity of data makes it insufficient to construct a new model. At the same time, the new data originate from a similar (but not the same) phenomenon (process) for which the original model has been constructed so the existing model, even though it could applied, has to be treated with a certain level of reservation. Such situations can be encountered, e.g. in software engineering where in spite existing similarities, each project, process, or product exhibits its own unique characteristics\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "68\n", "authors": ["474"]}

Our new approach inverts this perspective and constructs graphs of ordered commits coupled by common changed classes. These graphs, thus, represent the co-evolution of commits, structured by the change patterns among classes. We believe that co-evolutionary graphs are a promising new instrument for detecting defective software structures.

We analyze five industrial projects written in C++ and belonging to the telecommunication domain. We find a significant positive correlation between the number of compiler warnings and the number of source files changes. We use such correlation to conclude that compiler warnings may be used as an indicator for the presence of software defects in source code. The result of this research is useful for finding defect-prone modules in newer projects, which lack change history.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["474"]}

Here we will study the stability properties of the rank n vector bundle h*(TPM). Since stability is an open condition and one expects that h*(TPn) may be stable only for a general degree d embedding, it is natural to try to use degeneration techniques. Here the main idea of the first two sections is to degenerate the bundle h*(TPn), not the embedding. In this way we will obtain proofs of stability (in a very restricted range) and bounds on the failure of stability for a fixed curve X, not only for the general X. Furthermore, we will even be able to fix the hyperplane section determinant. We will use that TP^(-1) is the universal rank n quotient bundle of Pn and that det (TP (-1)) is the hyperplane line bundle. The main tool will be the standard notion and heavy use of elementary transformations of bundles on X. For simplicity we will work in characteristic 0, except in the first part of section 4. In the first section we give the main definitions and prove the key deformation results Proposition 1.4 and Remark 1.5. Then in section 2 we consider the linearly normal case d= g+ n with n> g (ie bundles with slope< 2). In this case we prove the stability of the restricted tangent bundle (see Theorem 2.3 and Proposition 2.4). In section 3 we will use the linearly normal case to prove in the range d Zg+ n2 2g+ 1 a bound for the instability degree of the restricted tangent bundle. On this topic, see also 1.9 which shows the power of our degeneration techniques. In section 4 we consider again the stability properties of spanned bundles with small slope, say slope< 3.

{"title": "A proposed method to evaluate and compare fault predictions across studies\n", "abstract": " Studies on fault prediction often pay little attention to empirical rigor and presentation. Researchers might not have full command over the statistical method they use, full understanding of the data they have, or tend not to report key details about their work. What does it happen when we want to compare such studies for building a theory on fault prediction? There are two issues that if not addressed, we believe, prevent building such theory. The first concerns how to compare and report prediction performance across studies on different data sets. The second regards fitting performance of prediction models. Studies tend not to control and report the performance of predictors on historical data underestimating the risk that good predictors may poorly perform on past data. The degree of both fitting and prediction performance determines the risk managers are requested to take when they use such predictors.

This paper presents an application-specific, layer-based approach to an offline security analysis inspired by design science that merges preceding expertise from relevant domains. With the example of a Smart-lighting system, we create a dedicated unified taxonomy for the use case and analyze its distributed Smart-* architecture by multiple layer-based models. We derive potential attacks from the system specifications in an iterative and incremental process and discuss resulting threats and vulnerabilities.

These data include the code and how it was changed over time, and information about the changes from version control systems. Each of these can be considered at different levels of granularity. The level of granularity can substantially influence the estimated fault-proneness of a code artifact. Typically, the level of detail oscillates between releases and commits on the one hand, and single lines of code and whole files on the other hand. Not every information may be readily available or feasible to collect at every level, though, nor does more detail necessarily improve the results.
