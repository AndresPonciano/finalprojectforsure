{"title": "Experimental comparison of navigation in a Galois lattice with conventional information retrieval methods\n", "abstract": " A controlled experiment was conducted comparing information retrieval using a Galois lattice structure with two more conventional retrieval methods: navigating in a manually built hierarchical classification and Boolean querying with index terms. No significant performance difference was found between Boolean querying and the Galois lattice retrieval method for subject searching with the three measures used for the experiment: user searching time, recall and precision. However, hierarchical classification retrieval did show significantly lower recall compared to the other two methods. This experiment suggests that retrieval using a Galois lattice structure may be an attractive alternative since it combines a good performance for subject searching along with browsing potential.", "num_citations": "215\n", "authors": ["74"]}

In this paper, we present REquirements TRacing On-target (RETRO), a special- purpose requirements tracing tool. We discuss how RETRO automates the generation of RTMs and present the results of a study comparing manual RTM generation to RTM generation using RETRO. The study showed that RETRO found significantly more correct links than manual tracing and took only one third of the time to do so.", "num_citations": "140\n", "authors": ["74"]}
{"title": "Method to enable LCA analysis through each level of development of a BIM model\n", "abstract": " Whole Building life cycle assessment (LCA) calculations are increasingly done using building information modeling (BIM) data exports, but some challenges need to be overcome. BIM models lack data for a whole building LCA analysis. To counter this lack of detailed information, manual inputs are often required when using a static BIM model and cannot easily consider recalculations over the duration of the project. This paper presents a method to automatically perform LCA calculations early, at the first level of a BIM model's development (i.e. the LOD100 level), and to allow for easier updates of the calculation throughout the evolution of the BIM model. To achieve this goal, a novel data layer and format is proposed. This data layer fills the information gap between extracted BIM data and existing LCA data provided by common LCA databases such as ecoinvent.", "num_citations": "34\n", "authors": ["74"]}

Some even argue this is the most important fraction of the cost. The added value of software maintenance and evolution is often not fully understood by the customer leading to a perception that software maintenance organizations are costly and inefficient. A common view of maintenance and evolution is that it merely fixes bugs. However, studies over the years have indicated that in many organizations the majority of the maintenance effort is devoted to value-added activities. To improve customer perceptions it is important to provide them with better insight into the activities performed by the maintenance organization and to document such performance with objective measures of software maintenance activities.

The problem of scheduling multiple tasks for multiple users on a given number of resources is considered NP-Complete problem, and therefore, several heuristic based research methods were proposed, yet, there are still many improvements can be done, since the problem has several optimization parameters. In addition, most proposed solutions are built on top of several assumptions and simplifications by applying computational methods such as game theory, fuzzy logic, or evolutionary computing. This paper presents an algorithm to address the problem of resource allocation across a cloud-based network, where several resources are available, and the cost of computational service depends on the amount of computation. The algorithm is applicable without restrictions on cost vector or compaction time matrix as opposed to methods in the literature. In addition, the execution of the algorithm shows better utility compared to methods applied on similar problems.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["74"]}

{"title": "Multiperspective Representation of Internal Controls in Business Processes\n", "abstract": " The internal control process, which is designed to help an organization accomplish specific control objectives, is one of the most important processes, as it can determine whether or not the organization is in compliance with its internal or external requirements. Internal controls emerge from different perspectives. Currently, experts view and act on one control perspective at a time, which creates inefficiencies and duplication. This software engineering research is aimed at proposing a multiperspective framework for representing internal controls, in order to obtain a centralized and comprehensive view of all internal control mechanisms. To carry out this research, we also needed to represent the many different stakeholder perspectives of internal controls. Based on a literature review of mathematical and psychological analysis, we searched for the most suitable multiperspective representation of internal controls, and assessed the many representation options using the AHP (analytical hierarchical process) sensitivity analysis approach. This approach has been applied to a study group which has been called to answer to a questionnaire.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["74"]}

Precision medicine treatments will be effective for individual patients based on their genomic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. This requires integrating this data to find one, or a combination of, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to a disease or treatment [1]. In 2013, the University of California Berkeley's AmpLab created the ADAM genomic format that allows the transformation, analysis and querying of large amounts of genomics data by using a columnar file format. However, while ADAM addresses the issue of processing large genomics data; it lacks the ability to link the patients' clinical and demographical data, which is crucial in precision medicine research.

It is hard to understand what cloud computing technologies are and if we are using the real thing. Many standard-developing organizations such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the International Standards Organization (ISO) are working to provide a standard definition of Cloud Computing. Unfortunately, they are already facing a big challenge due to the presence of multiple definitions and the lack of understanding of this emerging technology. The main objective of this paper is to try to characterize Cloud Computing components and concepts using a familiar object, the car. Using this analogy, we identify concepts that should not be part of the international Cloud Computing definition on our quest for an improved definition.

{"title": "A large-scale and extensible platform for precision medicine research\n", "abstract": " The massive adoption of high-throughput genomics, deep sequencing technologies and big data technologies have made possible the era of precision medicine. However, the volume of data and its complexity remain important challenges for precision medicine research, hindering development in this field. The literature on precision medicine research describes a few platforms to support specific types of studies, but none of these offer researchers the level of customization required to meet their specific needs [1]. Methods: We propose to design and develop a platform able to import and integrate a very large volume of genetics, clinical, demographical and environmental data in a cloud computing infrastructure. In our previous publication, we presented an approach that can customize existing data models to fit any precision medicine research data requirement [1] and the requirement for future large-scale\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["74"]}

{"title": "Analyzing BIM interoperability for LCA purposes\n", "abstract": " The use of building information modelling (BIM) is increasingly popular and results in the BIM model becoming the central data source in a construction project. The information available in BIM is hard to use because it lacks interoperability. This paper assesses every strategy to share data from BIM in order to support a life cycle assessment (LCA) for a whole building at every step of the BIM model design. Every open file format concerning the BIM is analyzed to determine if one file format can fulfill the data requirements of an LCA. Among all of these file formats, IFC is the best-known and most detailed format. An in-depth analysis of the IFC data schema and syntax is performed to determine whether the construction industry requires a specific file format for LCA purposes or whether one of the existing open file formats can be used as a data source.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["74"]}
{"title": "Should the cloud computing definition include a big data perspective?\n", "abstract": " Vaquero et al.(2008) list more than twenty existing Cloud Computing definitions in their paper, and conclude by proposing an additional one. At this rate, we will have a confusing number of definitions before long! This is typical of the inflated expectations of a recent technology, as the cycle of hype surrounding it reaches a peak. At this stage, it is important to step back and try to see Cloud Computing for what it really is. This is exactly what the ISO/JTC1/SC38 committee proposes to accomplish in the next few years. Working Group 3 was specifically created to look at normalizing Cloud Computing terminology. Looking at the original ideaof the term Cloud Computing, a key question was raised, why so many definitions exist for such simple words. The basic concepts expressed by the term are quite simple. The word computing refers to any activity that involves computer processing or storage (Shackelford et al., 2006\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["74"]}

{"title": "A comparative evaluation on multi-perspective representations of business controls: An experimental case study\n", "abstract": " The internal controls embedded in an organization's business processes are designed to help an organization achieve specific control objectives. These controls are generated from different perspectives, ie governance, security, and certification. Currently, experts in an organization typically act on internal controls from one perspective at a time, which creates inefficiencies and duplication from a corporate standpoint. This research proposes a multiperspective model for representing internal controls, in order to provide a comprehensive view of the organization's internal controls. In previous work [1], we suggested that the radial and linear representations were the most suitable models for this purpose, and so we developed an experimental case study to compare their usability. The results of this case study show that the linear representation enables users to browse the internal control structure faster than the radial representation. However, the radial representation can be understood more quickly by users. The study also reveals that a linear representation seems to be more familiar to users than a radial one. Using the Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) technique to assess their suitability, we conclude that the radial layout representation is the most appropriate model for viewing the internal controls of an organization from multiple perspectives.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["74"]}

To address this issue, we propose a replication mechanism that will protect the NameNode data in case of failure.
