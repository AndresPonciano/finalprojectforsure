However, the empirical findings from surveys, case studies, and experiments on the beneficial effects of their utilization are still lacking. Thus, we suggest that further research on the utilization of EPGs is required. In this study, we are interested in gaining insights on the effects of using EPGs on objective metrics (learning score, time effort) and subjective metrics (perceived usefulness, ease of use, and value), by comparing three EPG designs (a simple PDF-based EPG, a normal HTML-based EPG, and a sophisticated Java-based EPG) with different blocks of experimental subjects (practitioners, academicians, novices, and experts). To this end, we have conducted a controlled experiment with a sample of international participants in the domain of IT Service Management.

The software development process plays a crucial role in the design and development of a high-quality e-learning system. However, to date, there is no comprehensive comparative study of open source software (OSS) development process for different OS e-learning systems. This hinders the development of a generalized OSS development process, a key requisite for rapidly developing high-quality OS e-learning systems. This paper provides a full analysis of different existing and successful OS e-learning software systems and the best practices followed in the e-learning development.

SCRUM and XP in industrial settings and UPEDU in academic ones are main of them. Similarly, Software Process Improvement (SPI) initiatives promote the utilization of process frameworks and standards. However, despite both worlds (i.e. ASDMs and SPI) pursue a shared end of high-quality software, both are separated by different underlying approaches. We consider that ASDMs can get benefits from SPI through controlled enhancements (i.e. an agile-discipline balance) without elimination of agility. Thus, in this research, we report the design of SCRUM+, an enhanced SCRUM with recommendations on roles, activities-tasks and artifacts from the SPI standard ISO/IEC 29110.

However, very small entities (VSEs) avoid them by the lack of required financial and other organizational resources. In contrast, VSEs use agile software development methodologies (ASDMs), but these ASDMs do not foster adherence to best scholastic practices promoted by SPI. Furthermore, while a new ISO/IEC standard (29110) has been recently released for VSEs, it was not designed taking account the ASDM approaches. Thus, we investigate the extent of adherence of main ASDMs (two industrial and one academic type) with this new standard. Initial results provide evidence on the strong need to enhance the two industrial ASDMs (XP and SCRUM).

While that such a realization has been available to organizations via models and standards of processes, the myriad of them and their heavy conceptual density has obscured their comprehension and practitioners are confused in their correct organizational selection, evaluation, and deployment tasks. Thus, with the ultimate aim to improve the task understanding of such schemes by reducing its business process understanding complexity, in this article we use a conceptual systemic model of a generic business organization derived from the theory of systems to describe and compare two main models (CMMI/SE/SwE, 2002; ITIL V. 3, 2007) and four main standards (ISO/IEC 15288, 2002; ISO/IEC\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["367"]}
{"title": "On models and standards of processes in SE, SwE and IT&S disciplines: toward a comparative framework using the systems approach\n", "abstract": " The general aim of Systems Engineering (SE) and Software Engineering (SwE) is the definition, development and deployment of large-scale cost-effective and trustworthy integrated systems and software-intensive systems respectively. In pursuit of this aim, both disciplines have generated models and standards of processes to guide and control the engineering and managerial activities involved in the creation of such systems. Furthermore, the increasing complexity of software-intensive systems has fostered the interdisciplinary research between SwE and SE disciplines toward a joint Systems Software Engineering (SSwE). In turn, the Information Technology and Systems (IT&S) field, focused mainly in the management and evaluation of IT-intensive systems, is highly dependent on the engineering activities conducted in SwE and SE fields. Despite this linkage, IT&S has generated its own set of models and standards of processes and not explored the conceptual relationship with the SwE and SE models and standards. This paper is concerned with the integration of SE and SwE to cope with complex softwareintensive systems and explores the premise of that the incorporation of a SE-based philosophy and principles in the engineering and management of large-scale and complex IT-systems can enhance these processes. This paper first establishes the relationship between the concepts of process, system and service from a Systems Approach perspective and then develops a conceptual framework -also founded in the Systems Approach- to compare the main models and standards of processes internationally  reported for the SE, SwE and IS\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["367"]}

{"title": "Effect of Research Engagement on EFL Teachers' Motivation for and Efficacy in Teacher-Research.\n", "abstract": " In language teaching, the roots of teacher-research date back to 1980s. The concept of teacher as researcher started to be recognized as a result of the limitations of the large scale and longitudinal studies conducted with the aim of identifying the best methods and approaches in language teaching/learning which were open to doubt (Allwright & Bailey, 1991). This was probably because of their being essentially quantitative and having involved large groups of participants. In addition, they were conducted by academicians who had no or little concern about the practitioner due to the lack of collaboration between the researcher and the practitioner.Since these classroom-based studies were not conducted by the teachers themselves or at least in cooperation with them, they also failed to meet the needs and to solve the problems of the language teachers (Borg, 2010). Thus, the approach that defines the teacher as the technician who is expected to practice the findings of academic research has become the focus of the criticism.

{"title": "Applications of Fourier series and zeta functions to Genocchi polynomials\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we firstly consider the properties of Genocchi polynomials, Fourier series and Zeta functions. In the special cases, we see that the Fourier series yield Zeta functions. From here, we show that zeta functions for some special values can be computed by Genocchi polynomials. Secondly, we consider the Fourier series of periodic Genocchi functions. For odd indexes of Genocchi functions, we construct good links between Genocchi functions and Zeta function. Finally, since Genocchi functions reduce to Genocchi polynomials over the interval [0,1), we see that Zeta functions have integral representations in terms of Genocchi polynomials.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["367"]}
{"title": "How One of The World\u2019s Oldest Food Safety Standards Approaches Expiration\n", "abstract": " The paper at hand contemplates the effect of a centuries-old national food safety standard on innovation in a globalizing market. To that end, the case of the German Beer Industry is analysed to explicate the relationship between a longstanding beer purity decree and brewing innovation. Over 500 years of existence the so-called \u201cReinheitsgebot\u201d, now laid down in federal German law, has served to restrict variety and safeguard the quality of locally-produced beers. In turn, the standard prominently shaped the national image as well as consumer preferences across all regions in Germany. This research however demonstrates how this has overwhelmingly brought about adverse consequences for the international relevance of German beer in an increasingly globalised economy, which favours diversity in tastes. Due to changing consumption trends and the constricted innovative ability of German brewers, the findings inform government\u2019s responsibility in standardisation for traditional consumer goods industries at a time of urgent need for action.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["367"]}

The first one is a general and widely-used standard describing the lifecycle processes of the entire system, whereas the second one is a relatively new standard based on a reduced set of standards elements focused on lifecycle profiles for Very Small Entities (VSEs). We are especially interested in the impact that SE standards can have on teaching this discipline to engineering students. We consider the teaching of fundamental principles of systems engineering. In this paper we illustrate how our, previously developed, standard based solution for systems engineering education can be used as a framework to support these standard-based teaching paths.

Our analysis was validated by independent researchers and comparison with an existing dependency analysis shown in CMMI training materials. Our results have significance as a reference model of SP and PA dependencies for both SPI researchers and practitioners.

{"title": "A risk-based MADM model for selecting free-libre open source software tools in the domain of IT service management\n", "abstract": " The availability of free-libre open source software (FLOSS) has stimulated their organizational implementation in many countries. The main attractiveness for it is the free-cost license of usage regarding with acquisition of COTS (components of the shelf) commercial software, among other factors such as: maturity status, available technical community support, popularity, and compliance to international standards. However, not of the all FLOSS tools released from such FLOSS development projects achieve the expected qualities, and thus organizations interested in using them must conduct a careful evaluation-selection process. With this in mind, several evaluation-selection frameworks for FLOSS have been reported in the literature and some studies have identified a set of organizational factors associated to successful and failed utilizations of FLOSS tools in organizations. In this research, we elaborate a FLOSS Evaluation-Selection model by combining both sets of literature on FLOSS evaluation models and FLOSS implementation models. This model is implemented with a MADM (Multi-Attribute Decision-Making) risk-based mechanism. We illustrate this model with the evaluation-selection of a FLOSS tool in the domain of Information Technology Service Management (ITSM). Hence, this paper contributes to our body of knowledge with the provision of a simplified evaluation-selection model for FLOSS tools derived from two core sets of FLOSS literatures, under an innovative risk-based approach.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["367"]}

{"title": "Large scale agile\n", "abstract": " The Agile Manifesto was created more than 10 years ago, in February 2001, by a group of 17 interested individuals. I was fortunate to be one of those 17; witnessing and participating in the articulation and advancement of an idea that would, we hoped, change the face of software development for the better. But 10 years is a long time in the real world, and it is an eternity in the tech world.As a result, things did not quite turn out the way we expected. In 2001, when we created the manifesto and launched the agile software development movement, we fully expected to see a crowded rush of new methods, new practices, and new ways of being agile. These new ideas would follow the guidelines of the manifesto but introduce new ideas and approaches and help advance the art. That did not happen. Instead, we have seen wider-scale adoption of individual practices that agile software development favors, including formerly controversial practices such as pair-programming, and even basic hygienic practices such as version control that previously were not always followed. Overall, this seems to have had a very positive effect on many development organizations, but it is surely less than many of us had hoped for. It seems that the initial focus of the agile software development has been forgotten over time, and the goal has shifted from becoming adaptive, flexible, agile practitioners to merely following a subset of canonical, prescribed agile practices. It appears that people have forgotten why we do what we do.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["367"]}

{"title": "Open source software development process for the development of open source e-learning systems\n", "abstract": " Over the last decade, numerous educational institutions and corporate world have employed various kinds of e-learning software solutions. One of the major components of end-to-end e-learning solution is the learning management system (LMS). These LMS are either developed as open source software (OSS) or close source software (CSS) product. In this regard, CSS for e-learning systems has a major drawback of being expensive and this hinders its widespread use. On the other hand, OSS is virtually free and not restricted by the licensing costs. The benefits of OSS can be completely realized only if there is an effective contribution from OSS community towards its development.  It is clear from the literature that the OSS development community does not follow an explicitly defined and documented software development process. This in turn results in lack of detailed information in the literature about the problems arising due to the absence of a defined process. Nevertheless, some of the major issues with regard to OSS development for LMS that have been identified include software design issues, week user Interface, lack of complete and accessible documentation, lack of co-ordination between unknown developers, etc.  This research develops a generalized OSSD process that could be used for the development of an open source (OS) e-learning system. To begin, in order to understand the current development practises of the existing OS e-learning systems, a detailed analysis was carried out for three different and popular OS e-learning systems (Moodle, ILIAS and Dokeos).

Such documents contain an inherent complexity by the number of schemes, categories, activities, roles, forms, techniques, concepts, attributes, and their interrelationships. Given this problem, a research stream (in Software Engineering discipline) has been focused on the design, implementation and evaluation of electronic process guides (EPGs). EPGs are digital documents which describe organizational processes for training and guiding real execution purposes, and which contains all required documents as well as sample of them. EPGs are not intended for enacting an organizational process (like a business process manager system) but for supporting their correct execution for human participants. We believe that EPGs can be useful for ITSM management. Thus, in this research in progress, we report: (i) a review of characteristics of EPGs, (ii) an EPG evaluation framework, and (iii) a conceptual evaluation of three open access EPGs. Two for IT Service Management (ITUP, MOF 4.0) and one for Software Engineering process (OpenUP).
