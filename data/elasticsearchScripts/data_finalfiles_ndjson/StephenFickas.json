By requirements monitoring we mean the insertion of code into a running system to gather information from which it can he determined whether, and to what degree, that running system is meeting its requirements. Monitoring is a commonly applied technique in support of performance tuning, but the focus therein is primarily on computational performance requirements in short runs of systems. We wish to address systems that operate in a long lived, ongoing fashion in nonscientific enterprise applications. We argue that the results of requirements monitoring can be of benefit to the designers, maintainers and users of a system-alerting them when the system is being used in an environment for which it was not designed, and giving them the information they need to direct their redesign of the system\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "393\n", "authors": ["1455"]}

These challenges are mainly associated with characteristics that modern information systems need to demonstrate, such as openness, variety, adaptability, interoperability, and security. Although many new techniques and technologies are being developed on a regular basis, to enable developers to deal with most of these challenges, security engineering has not yet received the attention it deserves.Security engineering of information systems is concerned mainly with methods providing cost-e\u00a4 ective and operationally e\u00a4 ective protection of information systems from undesirable events (Lane, 1985). Usually the goal when developing an information system is to provide as much security as possible, sometimes trading security requirements o\u00a4 against other functional and nonfunctional requirements.

One finding of this study is that many in the population are virtual shut-ins, not having the ability or confidence that they can be safe and successful on independent trips (Sohlberg et al, 2004). That this is a significant problem can be seen by the demographics: more than one million adults in the US are diagnosed each year with cognitive impairments (CI) due to neurological disease or trauma (eg, traumatic brain injury, stroke, tumor, epilepsy, infectious disease). Currently, there are between 13.3 to 16.1 million Americans living with chronic brain disorders and associated CI.

Exemplar systems are either in the form of productivity tools for a mass population, or of one-off systems for high-assurance problems [Feather et al, 1997]. We have run into a difficulty with this model. For our particular application, delivering software tools to those with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), the one-size-fits-all model breaks down; TBI users require customized systems. It is not enough to attempt to deliver \u201cthe TBI-user system\u201d, ie, to do a large study of the TBI population and attempt to come up with a single system that meets all their needs. Instead, we must focus on each individual\u2019s needs. This requires a new approach to requirements engineering. We need a means of (1) assessing the requirements of an individual,(2) delivering a system that meets an individual\u2019s requirements, and (3) monitoring the deployed system over time to watch for a misalignment of needs and what is delivered. Our research addresses these three issues. It hypothesizes that we can define an assessment technique that deals with individual needs, that we can then use the results to produce custom software (and other system components) that meet the needs, and that we can monitor at runtime for requirements compliance.

This work will draw on findings from the social sciences to understand the difficulties faced by work groups in general and by computer-mediated groups in particular, and to design social agents that will be accepted by people as specialized members of these groups that can assist them in choosing suitable partners and interacting effectively.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1455"]}
{"title": "Desert island column\n", "abstract": " Note from editors: This is the first in a series of\" Desert Island Columns,\" a regular feature in Automated Software Engineering. The idea behind these columns is as follows. Imagine being marooned on a desert island, with only a handful of books and papers relating to Automated Software Engineering at one's disposal. Which books or papers should those be? Writing might be chosen for a number of reasons: they may be seminal, thoughtprovoking, or simply a pleasure to read. In subsequent issues we will ask various members of the Automated Software Engineering community to explain how they would face this dilemma.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1455"]}
{"title": "Scare Tactics: evaluating problem decompositions using failure scenarios\n", "abstract": " Our interest is in the design of multi-agent problem-solving systems. which we refer to as composite systems. We have proposed an approach to composite system design by decomposition of problem statements. An automated assistant called Critter provides a library of reusable design transformations which allow a human analyst to search the space of decompositions for a problem.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1455"]}
{"title": "Specification criticism via goal-directed envisionment\n", "abstract": " Validating a complex system specification is a difficult problem. Generating behaviors and using them to critique a specification is one effective approach. Up until now, symbolic evaluation has been the key technique of behavior generation. Unfortunately, it has drawbacks both in the amount of time it takes to complete a symbolic run, and in the large amount of uninteresting data it produces. The authors propose goal-directed envisionment as an alternative to symbolic evaluation, supplementing the basic envisioning techniques of qualitative physics with behavioral goals. This approach overcomes the problems of symbolic evaluation by generating interpretations in a reasonable amount of time and by exploiting goals to prioritize and analyze the interpretations. The authors describe and evaluate SC, an implemented system which employs goal-directed envisionment to critique specifications.< >", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1455"]}
{"title": "Ontology-based error detection in text\n", "abstract": " In general, research related to text analysis assumes that the information contained in text form, although ambiguous, is correct with respect to the domain to which that text belongs to. This assumption comes in part from the fact that text analysis has historically been done over scientific documents. As the trend of taking text understanding to broader domains, such as Internet, we need to consider the presence of incorrect text in our data set. By incorrect text, we refer to a natural language text statement which is either false or contradicts the knowledge of the domain.We propose the use of Ontology-based Information Extraction (OBIE) to identify incorrect statement in a text. OBIE, a subfield of Information Extraction (IE), uses the formal and explicit specification provided by an ontology to guide the Information Extraction process. OBIE can capture the semantic elements of the text through its IE component, and it can determine if these semantics contradicts the domain through its ontology component, concluding if the text is correct or incorrect.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1455"]}
{"title": "Requirements Engineering in a Mobile Setting: How Travelers with a Cognitive Impairment Ask for and Use Help\n", "abstract": " A requirements-gathering study of getting-lost behavior is described. Two matched groups of subjects, one with and one without acquired cognitive impairments, were asked to navigate a walking route. Two foils were introduced to induce problems in route following. A phone helper was available to assist with problem solving. Both quantitative and qualitative results are reported.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1455"]}
{"title": "SCORE: the first student contest on software engineering\n", "abstract": " The Student Contest on Software Engineering (SCORE), organized for the first time in conjunction with the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) 2009, attracted 50 student teams from around the world, produced an impressive and varied set of projects, and earned appreciative comments from participants and even from teams who chose not to submit their results to the competition. It was a remarkable success, but not without problems and setbacks. In this article we explain the objectives, constraints, and design philosophy of SCORE, particularly as they distinguish it from the tradition of computer science contests focused more narrowly on programming. We also recount key approaches taken to design and management of this novel kind of contest, the difficulties we met (some still outstanding), and the lessons learned.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1455"]}
