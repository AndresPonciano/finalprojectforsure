In other work we have shown how sequence diagrams combined with an OCL liveness template gives us a much richer language for inter-object behaviour specification. In this paper, we give a semantics of these enriched diagrams using labelled event structures. Further, we show how sequence diagrams can be embedded into a true-concurrent two-level logic interpreted over labelled event structures. The top level logic, called communication logic, is used to describe inter-object specification, whereas the lower level logic, called home logic, describes intra-object behaviour.

Its principal uses are specifying constraints such as well-formedness conditions (e.g. in the definition of UML itself) and specifying contracts between parts of a system being modelled in UML. Focusing on the latter, we propose a systematic way to extend OCL with temporal constructs in order to express richer contracts. Our approach is based on observational mu-calculus, a two-level temporal logic in which temporal features at the higher level interact cleanly with a domain specific logic at the lower level. Using OCL as the lower level logic, we achieve much improved expressiveness in a modular way.

IODs are a highlevel structuring mechanism for sequence diagrams and a special kind of activity diagram (AD). Whilst ADs have been used to model mobility, they are not adequate to capture at the same time the structure of the system (locations), how objects move between locations, and how objects behave/interact within locations. By contrast, this is possible using IODs. An IOD allows us to describe a mobile system at two levels. The higher level describes the locations of the system and how objects move between locations. The lower level describes how objects behave and interact locally and is given by the individual nodes of the IOD, namely sequence diagrams. Both levels are enriched with performance related information (ie, activities). Furthermore, our approach of using IODs for modelling interactions and mobility enhanced with performance information offers a novel and natural UML counterpart for PEPA nets [1], a performance modelling language which consists of a restriction of Petri nets where tokens are terms in a stochastic process algebra PEPA [2]. We describe the formal translation of IODs into PEPA nets. Essentially, the structure given by the IOD corresponds to the high level net structure of the PEPA net, and the behaviour described in the IOD nodes (sequence diagrams) can be translated onto PEPA terms.

This paper suggests a novel approach to integrate data from multiple sources and formats, by providing a uniform structure to the data in a healthcare data lake with multiple zones reflecting how refined the data is: from raw to curated when ready to be consumed or used for analysis. The integration further requires solutions that can be proven to be secure, such as patient-centric data sharing agreements (smart contracts) on a blockchain, and novel privacy-preserving methods for extracting metadata from data sources, originally derived from partially-structured or from completely unstructured data.

A product in the category of labelled prime event structures is given accordingly to Winskel and Nielsen but denotes parallel composition in a sense that does not have much practical interest. For synchronously communicating modules, by applying to the product a restriction on the allowed life cycles by means of the categorical concept of a functor induced by a co bration and a morphism on labels, we achieve the desired joint behaviour. A way to model asynchronous composition of modules is to construct a coproduct and extend it by their interaction rules. At the end of...", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["604"]}

We define two kinds of hiding morphisms on labels: total and partial.
