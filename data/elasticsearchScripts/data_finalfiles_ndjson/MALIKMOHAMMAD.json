{"title": "A lagrangian particle dynamics approach for crowd flow segmentation and stability analysis\n", "abstract": " This paper proposes a framework in which Lagrangian particle dynamics is used for the segmentation of high density crowd flows and detection of flow instabilities. For this purpose, a flow field generated by a moving crowd is treated as an aperiodic dynamical system. A grid of particles is overlaid on the flow field, and is advected using a numerical integration scheme. The evolution of particles through the flow is tracked using a flow map, whose spatial gradients are subsequently used to setup a Cauchy Green deformation tensor for quantifying the amount by which the neighboring particles have diverged over the length of the integration. The maximum eigenvalue of the tensor is used to construct a finite time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) field, which reveals the Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) present in the underlying flow. The LCS divide flow into regions of qualitatively different dynamics and are used to\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "711\n", "authors": ["12"]}

Each kinematic feature, when computed from the optical flow of a sequence of images, gives rise to a spatiotemporal pattern. It is then assumed that the representative dynamics of the optical flow are captured by these spatiotemporal patterns in the form of dominant kinematic trends or kinematic modes. These kinematic modes are computed by performing principal component analysis (PCA) on the spatiotemporal volumes of the kinematic features.

{"title": "Floor fields for tracking in high density crowd scenes\n", "abstract": " This paper presents an algorithm for tracking individual targets in high density crowd scenes containing hundreds of people. Tracking in such a scene is extremely challenging due to the small number of pixels on the target, appearance ambiguity resulting from the dense packing, and severe inter-object occlusions. The novel tracking algorithm, which is outlined in this paper, will overcome these challenges using a scene structure based force model. In this force model an individual, when moving in a particular scene, is subjected to global and local forces that are functions of the layout of that scene and the locomotive behavior of other individuals in the scene. The key ingredients of the force model are three floor fields, which are inspired by the research in the field of evacuation dynamics, namely Static Floor Field (SFF), Dynamic Floor Field (DFF), and Boundary Floor Field (BFF).

Systematic review of new evidence on potentially useful interventions and delivery strategies identifies 37 key promotional, preventive, and treatment interventions and strategies for delivery in primary health care. Some are especially suitable for delivery through community support groups and health workers, whereas others can only be delivered by linking community-based strategies with functional first-level referral facilities.

This issue has become more important in recent years as more firms are listed on stock exchanges as public firms. This study examines the association between the level of managerial ownership and earnings management activities, represented by the magnitude of discretionary accounting accruals in Malaysian listed firms. The results show that managerial ownership is negatively associated with the magnitude of accounting accruals. However, this study finds that managerial ownership is less important in large-sized firms compared to small-sized firms. This finding suggests that large-sized firms demand and use better corporate governance mechanisms due to higher agency conflicts, and, therefore, less managerial ownership is needed for control. As part of the ownership structure, this study also examines the roles of block and foreign ownerships in relation to the magnitude of discretionary accounting accruals.", "num_citations": "181\n", "authors": ["12"]}

To analyze global changes in AS under salt stress, we obtained high-coverage (~200 times) RNA sequencing data from Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings that were treated with different concentrations of NaCl. We detected that ~49% of all intron-containing genes were alternatively spliced under salt stress, 10% of which experienced significant differential alternative splicing (DAS). Furthermore, AS increased significantly under salt stress compared with under unstressed conditions. We demonstrated that most DAS genes were not differentially regulated by salt stress, suggesting that AS may represent an independent layer of gene regulation in response to stress. Our analysis of functional categories suggested that DAS genes were associated with specific functional pathways, such as the pathways for the responses to stresses and RNA splicing. We revealed that serine/arginine-rich (SR) splicing factors were frequently and specifically regulated in AS under salt stresses, suggesting a complex loop in AS regulation for stress adaptation. We also showed that alternative splicing site selection (SS) occurred most frequently at 4 nucleotides upstream or downstream of the dominant sites and that exon skipping tended to link with alternative SS. Our study provided a comprehensive view of AS under salt stress and revealed novel insights into the potential roles of AS in plant response to salt stress.", "num_citations": "175\n", "authors": ["12"]}

The effect sizes of these associations suggest that TLR1 and HLA-DRB1/DQA1 are major susceptibility genes in susceptibility to leprosy. Further population differentiation analysis shows that the TLR1 locus is extremely differentiated. The protective dysfunctional 602S allele is rare in Africa but expands to become the dominant allele among individuals of European descent. This supports the hypothesis that this locus may be under selection from mycobacteria or other pathogens that are recognized by TLR1 and its co-receptors. These observations provide insight into the long standing host-pathogen relationship between human and mycobacteria and highlight the key role of the TLR pathway in infectious diseases.", "num_citations": "157\n", "authors": ["12"]}

We show that full length murine IL-33 is active as a cytokine and that it is not processed by caspase 1 to mature IL-33 but instead cleaved by caspase 3 at aa175 to yield two products which are both unable to bind to the IL-33 receptor. Full length IL-33 and its N-terminal caspase 3 breakdown product, however, translocate to the nucleus. Finally, bioactive IL-33 is not released by cells constitutively or after activation. This suggests that IL-33 is not a classical cytokine but exerts its function in the nucleus of intact cells and only activates others cells via its receptor as an alarm mediator after destruction of the producing cell.", "num_citations": "117\n", "authors": ["12"]}

In this paper, we propose an algorithm that uses instantaneous motion field of the video instead of long-term motion tracks for learning the motion patterns. The motion field is a collection of independent flow vectors detected in each frame of the video where each flow is vector is associated with a spatial location. A motion pattern is then defined as a group of flow vectors that are part of the same physical process or motion pattern. Algorithmically, this is accomplished by first detecting the representative modes (sinks) of the motion patterns, followed by construction of super tracks, which are the collective representation of the discovered motion patterns.

Several scale-adapted region descriptors are introduced to characterize these blob regions. A semi-supervised based learning approach, which requires few manually annotated learning examples, is also proposed to train a classifier which can detect true MAs. The developed system is built using only few manually labeled and a large number of unlabeled retinal color fundus images.

Elderly gentleman presented with symptoms of rhythmic jerky movements of the left arm and both the lower limbs. Clinical suspicion of focal epilepsy was made and EEG, MRI-Brain with MRA were done. EEG and MRI-Brain revealed normal findings but the MRA revealed complete occlusion of right internal carotid artery. On a follow-up visit jerky movements of the left arm were precipitated by hyperextension and a tremor of 3\u0393\u00c7\u00f44 Hz was revealed. Based on this the diagnosis of low flow TIA was made the patient was treated conservatively with adjustment of his anti-hypertensive and anti-platelet medications. Diagnosis of limb-shaking TIA is important and should be differentiated from other disorders presenting as tremors. Timely diagnosis is important as these patients are shown to benefit from reperfusion procedures either surgical or radiological reducing their risk of stroke.", "num_citations": "100\n", "authors": ["12"]}

Despite their wide occurrence in all eukaryotes, little is known about the roles of Sm-like proteins in the regulation of splicing. Here, through comprehensive transcriptome analyses, we demonstrate that depletion of the Arabidopsis supersensitive to abscisic acid and drought 1 gene (SAD1), which encodes Sm-like protein 5 (LSm5), promotes an inaccurate selection of splice sites that leads to a genome-wide increase in alternative splicing. In contrast, overexpression of SAD1 strengthens the precision of splice-site recognition and globally inhibits alternative splicing. Further, SAD1 modulates the splicing of stress-responsive genes, particularly under salt-stress conditions.

{"title": "A KH-domain RNA-binding protein interacts with FIERY2/CTD phosphatase-like 1 and splicing factors and is important for pre-mRNA splicing in Arabidopsis\n", "abstract": " Eukaryotic genomes encode hundreds of RNA-binding proteins, yet the functions of most of these proteins are unknown. In a genetic study of stress signal transduction in Arabidopsis, we identified a K homology (KH)-domain RNA-binding protein, HOS5 (High Osmotic Stress Gene Expression 5), as required for stress gene regulation and stress tolerance. HOS5 was found to interact with FIERY2/RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) carboxyl terminal domain (CTD) phosphatase-like 1 (FRY2/CPL1) both in vitro and in vivo. This interaction is mediated by the first double-stranded RNA-binding domain of FRY2/CPL1 and the KH domains of HOS5. Interestingly, both HOS5 and FRY2/CPL1 also interact with two novel serine-arginine (SR)-rich splicing factors, RS40 and RS41, in nuclear speckles. Importantly, FRY2/CPL1 is required for the recruitment of HOS5. In fry2 mutants, HOS5 failed to be localized in nuclear speckles but was found mainly in the nucleoplasm. hos5 mutants were impaired in mRNA export and accumulated a significant amount of mRNA in the nuclei, particularly under salt stress conditions. Arabidopsis mutants of all these genes exhibit similar stress-sensitive phenotypes. RNA-seq analyses of these mutants detected significant intron retention in many stress-related genes under salt stress but not under normal conditions. Our study not only identified several novel regulators of pre-mRNA processing as important for plant stress response but also suggested that, in addition to RNAP II CTD that is a well-recognized platform for the recruitment of mRNA processing factors, FRY2/CPL1 may also recruit specific factors to regulate the co\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "69\n", "authors": ["12"]}

It looks at how the population has changed and is likely to change over the medium term future and reviews changes in national identification, drawing upon a range of survey data sources and published research. Overall, identification with Britain has been declining in recent decades as identification with individual UK countries has become stronger. However, people from minority ethnic groups tend to be more likely than White people to identify themselves as British. People from higher status social groups are more likely to identify themselves as British, while those from lower status social groups are more likely to identify with the country they live in. Younger adults demonstrate weaker national identity than older people. It is likely that migration and rates of population increase for minority ethnic groups will remain high and current trends in identity will continue over the next ten years. The research evidence demonstrates that ethnic diversity on its own does not result in a lack of social cohesion but that ethnic diversity, population mobility and economic deprivation combine together to have a negative effect. Thus, the impact of increased ethnic diversity upon social and neighbourhood cohesion will be strongly influenced by economic conditions and the relative prosperity of individual ethnic groups.", "num_citations": "64\n", "authors": ["12"]}

It is reasonable to assume therefore that pectate lyase can cleave pectin with three consecutive galacturonate residues. The enzyme in the absence of substrate binds a single calcium ion, and we show that two additional calcium ions bind between enzyme and substrate carboxylates occupying the +1 subsite in the Michaelis complex. The substrate binds less intimately to the enzyme in a complex made with a catalytic\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "62\n", "authors": ["12"]}

Treatments were performed on primary cultures of prenatal rat hippocampal neurons transfected with or without GABAB1R small interfering RNA (siRNA). The results showed that, when ethanol treatment was followed by anthocyanins treatment, cellular levels of proapoptotic proteins such as Bax, activated caspase-3, and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) were decreased, and the cellular level of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 was increased compared to treatment with ethanol alone. Furthermore, the effects of ethanol on cellular levels of GABAB1R and its downstream signaling molecules such as protein kinase A, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), and phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein were diminished or reversed by anthocyanins treatment. The ability of anthocyanins to reverse the effects of ethanol on cellular levels of Bax, Bcl-2, active caspase-3, cleaved PARP-1, GABAB1R, and CaMKII were abrogated in cells transfected with GABAB1R siRNA.

In this study to evaluate the effect of drought stress on some cotton traits, 5 improved cotton varieties were studied in a split plot design with three replications in 2 years (2000-2001) at 2 locations (Hashemabad and Anbaroloom); one with Mediterranean climate and the other with drought-stress condition. Treatments were irrigation as main plot in 3 levels (I0= without irrigation, I 1= one time irrigation; that carried out 70 days after sowing, and I 2= at least 3 times irrigation) and varieties as subplot in 5 levels (5 genotypes). In the basis of combined variance analysis significant differences were detected among varieties for yield, boll number, boll weight, length and number of sympodial and monopodial branches. Drought stress decreased yield, boll number, boll weight, and induced earliness. With increasing irrigation frequency, earliness lightly reduced in the former climate probably because of inducing vegetative growth and retarding in generative phase. In latter climate increased irrigation frequency had a positive effect on the yield. It seems that water deficiency has reduced yield via decreasing boll number. The number of formed bolls in stressful conditions was less than that of in non-stressful conditions.

Through genetic crosses we had revealed that a dominant avirulence locus UhAvr1 which triggers immunity in barley cultivar Hannchen harboring resistance gene Ruh1, resided within an 80-kb region. DNA sequence analysis of this genetically delimited region uncovered the presence of 7 candidate secreted effector proteins. Sequence comparison of their coding sequences among virulent and avirulent parental and field isolates could not distinguish UhAvr1 candidates. Systematic deletion and complementation analyses revealed that UhAvr1 is UHOR_10022 which codes for a small effector protein of 171 amino acids with a predicted 19 amino acid signal peptide. Virulence in the parental isolate is caused by the insertion of a fragment of 5.5 kb with similarity to a common U. hordei transposable element (TE), interrupting the promoter of UhAvr1 and thereby changing expression and hence recognition of UhAVR1p. This rearrangement is likely caused by activities of TEs and variation is seen among isolates. Using GFP-chimeric constructs we show that UhAvr1 is induced only in mated dikaryotic hyphae upon sensing and infecting barley coleoptile cells. When infecting Hannchen, UhAVR1p causes local callose deposition and the production of reactive oxygen species and necrosis indicative of the immune response. UhAvr1 does not contribute significantly to overall virulence. UhAvr1 is located in a cluster of ten effectors with several paralogs and over 50% of TEs.

The unsaturated triglycerides in the fat are ozonized and then derivatized. The mixture of derivatized and saturated triglycerides is analyzed by liquid chromatography using a reverse-phase column and a UV detector. Pork fat has larger amounts of triglyceride containing saturated fatty acid at the C-2 position than does the fat of other meat. The ratio of triglyceride containing saturated fatty acid vs triglyceride containing unsaturated fatty acid at the same (C-2) position (SSU/SUS) in a sample is compared with those of pure meats. The presence of pork in the sample causes the ratio to increase compared with ratios for pure beef or mutton. The increase in the SSU/SUS ratio is significant for the addition of 1% pork in beef.

The aim of our study was to devise a scoring system from our local database and test its accuracy in the preoperative diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Methods: Clinical data from 401 patients having undergone appendectomy were collected to identify predictive factors that distinguished those with appendicitis from those who had a negative appendectomy. Ten such factors were identified and using Bayesian probability a weight was assigned to each and the results summated to get an overall score. A cut-off point was identified to separate patients for surgery and those for observation. The scoring system was then retrospectively applied to a second population of 99 patients in order to compare suggested actions (derived from the scoring system) to those actually taken by surgeons. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for the level of decision was then calculated. Results: Of the 99 patients, the method suggested immediate surgery for 65 patients, 63 of whom had acute appendicitis (3.1% diagnostic error rate). Of the 33 patients in whom the score suggested active observation, 18 had appendicitis. The accuracy of our scoring system was 82%. The method had a sensitivity of 78%, specificity 89% and a positive predictive value of 97%. The negative appendectomy rate determined by our study was 7% and the perforation rate 13%.

Here, populations of single-stranded DNA plant begomoviral genomes and their associated beta-and alpha-satellite molecules (virus-satellite complexes)(genus, Begomovirus; family, Geminiviridae) were enriched from total nucleic acids isolated from symptomatic, field-infected plants, using rolling circle amplification (RCA). Enriched virus-satellite complexes were subjected to Illumina-Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). CASAVA and SeqMan NGen programs were implemented, respectively, for quality control and for de novo and reference-guided contig assembly of viral-satellite sequences. The authenticity of the begomoviral sequences, and the reproducibility of the Illumina-NGS approach for begomoviral deep sequencing projects, were validated by comparing NGS results with those obtained using traditional molecular cloning and Sanger sequencing of viral components and satellite DNAs, also enriched by RCA or amplified by polymerase chain reaction. As the use of NGS approaches, together with advances in software development, make possible deep sequence coverage at a lower cost; the approach described herein will streamline the exploration of begomovirus diversity and population structure from naturally infected plants, irrespective of viral abundance.

However there are many situations where mixture models comprise an interesting sketch of different aspects. In this study we explore the idea of mixture density under Type I censoring scheme. We model a heterogeneous population by means of two components mixture of the Maxwell distribution. The parameters of the Maxwell mixture are estimated and compared using the Bayes estimates under the square error loss function and precautionary loss function. A censored mixture data is simulated by probabilistic mixing for the computational purpose. Closed form expressions for the Bayes estimators and posterior risk are derived for the censored sample as well as for the complete sample. Some interesting comparison and properties of the estimates are observed and presented. A real life data application has also been discussed.", "num_citations": "48\n", "authors": ["12"]}
{"title": "Jacobi fields on statistical manifolds of negative curvature\n", "abstract": " Two entropic dynamical models are considered. The geometric structure of the statistical manifolds underlying these models is studied. It is found that in both cases, the resulting metric manifolds are negatively curved. Moreover, the geodesics on each manifold are described by hyperbolic trajectories. A detailed analysis based on the Jacobi equation for geodesic spread is used to show that the hyperbolicity of the manifolds leads to chaotic exponential instability. A comparison between the two models leads to a relation among statistical curvature, stability of geodesics and relative entropy-like quantities. Finally, the Jacobi vector field intensity and the entropy-like quantity are suggested as possible indicators of chaoticity in the ED models due to their similarity to the conventional chaos indicators based on the Riemannian geometric approach and the Zurek\u0393\u00c7\u00f4Paz criterion of linear entropy growth, respectively.", "num_citations": "48\n", "authors": ["12"]}
{"title": "A supervised learning framework for generic object detection in images\n", "abstract": " In recent years kernel principal component analysis (kernel PCA) has gained much attention because of its ability to capture nonlinear image features, which are particularly important for encoding image structure. Boosting has been established as a powerful learning algorithm that can be used for feature selection. In this paper we present a novel framework for object class detection that combines the feature reduction and feature selection abilities of kernel PCA and AdaBoost respectively. The classifier obtained in this way is able to handle change in object appearance, illumination conditions, and surrounding clutter. A nonlinear subspace is learned for positive and negative object classes using Kernel PCA. Features are derived by projecting example images onto the learned subspaces. Base learners are modeled using Bayes classifier. AdaBoost is then employed to discover the features that are most relevant\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "48\n", "authors": ["12"]}

{"title": "Susceptibility to typhoid fever is associated with a polymorphism in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)\n", "abstract": " The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is the affected protein in cystic fibrosis (CF). The high rate of CF carriers has led to speculation that there must be, similar to the sickle cell haemoglobin advantage in malaria, a selective advantage for heterozygotes. Such a selective advantage may be conferred through reduced attachment of Salmonella typhi to intestinal mucosa, thus providing resistance to typhoid fever. We tested this hypothesis by genotyping patients and controls in a typhoid endemic area in Indonesia for two highly polymorphic markers in CFTR and the most common CF mutation. We found an association between genotypes in CFTR and susceptibility to typhoid fever (OR=2.6). These analyses suggest that the role CFTR plays in vitro in S. typhi infection is also important for infection in the human population.", "num_citations": "47\n", "authors": ["12"]}

When screening for other S. thermophilus phages expressing this type of lipoprotein, three temperate phages - TP-EW, TP-DSM20617 and TP-778 - were isolated. In this communication we present the total nucleotide sequences of TP-J34 and TP-778L. For TP-EW, a phage almost identical to TP-J34, besides the ltp gene only the two regions of deviation from TP-J34 DNA were analyzed: the gene encoding the tail protein causing an assembly defect in TP-J34 and the gene encoding the lysin, which in TP-EW contains an intron. For TP-DSM20617 only the sequence of the lysogeny module containing the ltp gene was determined. The region showed high homology to the same region of TP-778. For TP-778 we could show that absence of the attR region resulted in aberrant excision of phage DNA. The amino acid sequence of mature LtpTP-EW was shown to be identical to that of mature LtpTP-J34, whereas the amino acid sequence of mature LtpTP-778 was shown to differ from mature LtpTP-J34 in eight amino acid positions. LtpTP-DSM20617 was shown to differ from LtpTP-778 in just one amino acid position.

There have not been many studies measuring total factor productivity growth in Pakistan's agriculture. The most frequently applied techniques for measuring total factor productivity growth in agriculture are: (a) Arithmetic Index (AI); and (b) Tornqvist-Theil Index (TTI). Total Factor Productivity in this study has been estimated using both the Arithmetic and the Tornqvist-Theil indexing methodologies. It has been shown that the Tornqvist-Theil indexing procedure is more appropriate due to dependence of results for the Arithmetic index on the weights used. The TFP index for the period 1960-96 is computed with a gross output index that includes both crops and livestock products and the aggregate input index that, in addition\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "43\n", "authors": ["12"]}

The aim of this study was to compare the production and antimicrobial resistance patterns of some virulence factors in extended spectrum\\beta-lactamase (ES\\betaL)-producing and nonproducing P. aeruginosa clinical isolates. Materials and methods: Out of 183 different clinical specimens, 104 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were recovered. The isolates were screened for ESbL production using the double disk diffusion test and phenotypic confirmatory disk diffusion test. All isolates were tested for susceptibility to 25 antimicrobials, as well as for expression of various virulence factors including pigment, hemolysin, gelatinase, protease, lipase, rhamnolipids, biofilm, and cell surface hydrophobicity. The results of ESbL producers and nonproducers were statistically compared. Results: All isolates showed a high frequency of multiple resistance to at least 14 and up to 25 of the tested antimicrobials. Nevertheless, most virulence factors were produced at higher rates in ESbL-producing than in ESbL-nonproducing Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest a correlation between ESbL phenotype and the production of some factors that are reported to be involved in the virulence of P. aeruginosa.", "num_citations": "42\n", "authors": ["12"]}

An overwhelming majority of current research on sensor networks considers static networks only, while we consider mobile environment. DEMC is distributed, works well with mobile nodes, and has a recovery mechanism that is used to reduce the packet loss during inter cluster communication. The recovery mechanism also improves the connectivity between cluster heads during inter cluster communication. On average, each node sends less than one message during clustering, and does not rely on periodic hello messages. As a result reducing number of transmissions leads to energy efficiency. Simulation results show that DEMC is energy efficient, incurs less packet loss, increases packet delivery ratio, and exhibits robustness against moderate to high mobility of nodes.", "num_citations": "40\n", "authors": ["12"]}

Agricultural growth at this rate was sustained by the technological progress embodied in the high-yielding varieties of grains and cotton, with supporting public investment in irrigation, agricultural research and extension (R&E), and physical infrastructure. This rate of agricultural growth has significantly contributed to the overall economic growth of about 6 percent per year during this period. Sustaining this performance presents a considerable challenge for the public policy framework for agriculture, not the least for the agricultural research and extension system in Pakistan. This study analyses the impact of R&E investment on TFP growth in Pakistan's agriculture within a distributed lag framework.

Interoperability feature of WMNs have made them to integrate easily with other network technologies like wired networks, WiFi, WiMax, MANETs, and cellular networks. WMNs are gaining popularity due to their high network throughput which highly depends on the routing procedures. Routing algorithms like optimized link state routing protocol and dynamic source routing make efficient routing decisions on the basis of routing metrics which actually predict the cost of link quality. Most of the routing protocols and routing metrics implemented in WMNs are actually designed for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). Since WMNs have different characteristics and limitations as compared to MANETs, so the routing metrics design for MANETs do not perform well in WMNs. Furthermore, quality of service (QoS) and throughput of the network in WMNs can be enhanced by using cross layer routing approach and by deploying multi-channel multi-radio (MCMR) scenarios in each relay node. This article discusses a design taxonomy, limitations and qualitative comparison of existing routing metrics for QoS in MCMR WMNs with respect to routing parameters, i.e., transmission rate, inter-flow interference, intra-flow interference, congestion, and channel diversity. Moreover, our taxonomy also opens the door up for new research areas in the design of cross layer routing metrics for MCMR radio WMNs for high throughput IP\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "37\n", "authors": ["12"]}

Current schemes suggest only the selection of Primary Channel if there is not any licensed user available. We propose the fuzzy-based system to estimate gain of candidate channels so that the most advantageous channel can be selected. We also incorporate the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio with Primary User Interference to take handoff decision. We claim that Quality-aware channel selection along with primary user susceptibility is important to improve the throughput of Cognitive Radio Networks.

{"title": "Discovery of two critically endangered tree species and issues related to relic forests of the Western Ghats\n", "abstract": " Madhuca bourdillonii (Gamble) Lam. and Syzygium travancoricum Gamble, considered almost extinct but later found to be occurring in small numbers in their home range in Western Ghats, south of Palghat Gap, have been now discovered in some of the relic primeval evergreen forests of Uttara Kannada, over 700 km north. These relic forests also shelter scores of other rare endemic elements of flora and fauna. These findings highlight the need for making intensive efforts for locating more of such relic forests and documenting their biota. Also, biologists need to restrain from the tendencies of considering any novel occurrences of species away from their home ranges as new species, before ruling out the possibilities that these could be the relics of ancient populations or their morphological variants. Presence of relic forests does reveal the legacy of erstwhile contiguous forests, which is now fragmented due to rapid land use changes. Conservationists handling biodiversity hotspots should be able to distinguish between relics of primeval forests and advanced stages of secondary successions. Lack of such understanding will result in imperceptible extinctions of many endemic species.", "num_citations": "33\n", "authors": ["12"]}

Transplanted rice gave a significantly higher paddy yield of 19.18% versus direct-seeded crop. Nitrogen application at 100 kg N ha^{-1} provided a maximum paddy yield (4.39 and 4.67 t ha^{-1}) in both years. The rice kernel characteristics were also affected by culture methods and nitrogen levels. In addition, return variable cost in the transplanted rice increased by 22.27% over direct-seeded rice. Regarding quality, the amylose (24.35%) and protein (8.56%) contents were also higher in transplanted rice as compared to direct seeding at 100 kg N ha^{-1} application. The lowest amylose contents were recorded in N0 (23.55%) and N_1 (23.69%) treatments, and amylase contents were also found lower in N_0 and N_1 in the direct seeding method. The nitrogen rate and cultures method also affect the chlorophyll contents positively in transplanted plants at higher level of nitrogen.

One ppm SO2 concentration caused a significant decline in leaf number and leaf area per plant, total leaf dry weight, and the size and amount of midrib vasculature. The density and size of stomata decreased and many stomata were damaged. Interestingly, new epidermis developed over some of the damaged leaf stomata, thus showing a unique defence strategy against SO2 stress through dedifferentiation of the epidermal cells. Decline in the concentrations of leaf chlorophylls and carotenoids in treated plants were up to 20% and 29% respectively. Stomatal conductance, intercellular CO2 content and net photosynthetic rate lowered by over 52%, 20% and 35%, respectively, under the SO2 stress.

Mature seeds were used as explants for primary callus induction. Different concentrations of 2, 4-D were investigated to study its effect on callus induction and callus growth frequency (CGF). Compact, whitish, healthy and fluffy calli were induced in Sahar and GA-02 in MS medium supplemented with 5 mg/l and 4 mg/l 2, 4-D respectively. The calli produced were subjected to somatic embryogenesis and regeneration studies. For this purpose, MS Medium was supplemented with different concentrations and combinations of plant growth regulators like IAA and BAP. Maximum embryogenic callus formation was observed in MS medium supplemented with 0.1 mg/l IAA in combination with 1.5 mg/l BAP and it resulted in 73.51% and 62.33% embryogenic callus formation in Sahar and GA-02 respectively. These optimum concentrations of IAA and BAP were further experimented with different concentrations of Kin for efficient regeneration and it was observed that 1 mg/l Kin was optimum for this purpose. Such studies help in understanding the response of wheat to tissue culture conditions and ultimately promise in improving yield by employing various biotechnological techniques.", "num_citations": "31\n", "authors": ["12"]}

Our solution consists of iteratively learning a distance metric for retrieval, based on user feedback. The approach employs (retrieval) rank based constraints and convex optimization to efficiently learn the distance metric. The algorithm uses both user labeled and unlabeled examples in the learning process. The method is fast enough for a new metric to be learned interactively for each target query. In order to reduce the burden on the user, a model-independent active learning method is used to select key examples, for response solicitation. This leads to a significant reduction in the number of user-interactions required for retrieving the target of interest.

The effect of different plant growth regulators was assessed on callus induction, in vitro shoot regeneration and hairy root formation in tomato. The maximum callus induction frequency was recorded culturing hypocotyls, while in vitro shoot regeneration frequency was significantly higher when leaf discs were used as explants. The highest callus induction frequency (67.48%) was recorded in cv. Rio Grande followed by Roma (62%) and Moneymaker (58.23%) on MS basal media along with 2.0 mg/l IAA and 2.5 mg/l BAP. Similarly, the highest in vitro shoot regeneration frequency (69.6 and 65.3%) was recorded in Rio Grande and Roma on MS media fortified with 0.1 mg/l IAA, 1.0 mg/l ZEA and 2.0 mg/l BAP, while in case of Moneymaker, the highest in vitro shoot regeneration frequency (67.3%) was obtained on MS media enriched with 0.1 mg/l IAA and 3.0 mg/l BAP. The highest hairy root formation frequency (100, 91.72 and 93.74%) was achieved in cvs. Rio Grande, Moneymaker and Roma, respectively on MS media supplemented with 0.1 mg/l IAA, 2.0 mg/l ZEA and 2.0 mg/l BAP. These optimized procedures would be applicable to other genotypes of tomato for the development of cultivars tolerant to abiotic stresses developed via Agrobacterium mediated transformation system.", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["12"]}

{"title": "Analyzing the dynamics of energy consumption, liberalization, financial development, poverty and carbon emissions in Pakistan\n", "abstract": " Environmental degradation has been a major source of concern for the developing countries of the world especially during last two decades. The environmental quality has become on stake in the process of achieving prime objectives of higher and sustained economic growth, employment generation and poverty alleviation. Extended levels of consumption of fossil fuels coupled with the human induced greenhouse gases have put a heavy toll on the environmental quality that resulted in serious and unprecedented issue of non-renewable natural resource depletion and global warming. Keeping in mind the notion that, in the era of globalized and liberalized world economy, analysis of environment-growth nexus would not clear the picture unless implications of international trade, flows of foreign direct investment, financial development and poverty levels are taken into consideration. So this study is attempt to analyze the impact of energy consumption, economic growth, financial development, economic globalization along with poverty incidence measured by poverty head count ratio on carbon emissions in Pakistan economy. A long run equilibrium association has been found between carbon emissions and regressors in the carbon emission model. Long run and short run causality have been found between the variables.", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["12"]}
{"title": "Automated detection of microaneurysms using robust blob descriptors\n", "abstract": " Microaneurysms (MAs) are among the first signs of diabetic retinopathy (DR) that can be seen as round dark-red structures in digital color fundus photographs of retina. In recent years, automated computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) of MAs has attracted many researchers due to its low-cost and versatile nature. In this paper, the MA detection problem is modeled as finding interest points from a given image and several interest point descriptors are introduced and integrated with machine learning techniques to detect MAs. The proposed approach starts by applying a novel fundus image contrast enhancement technique using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of fundus images. Then, Hessian-based candidate selection algorithm is applied to extract image regions which are more likely to be MAs. For each candidate region, robust low-level blob descriptors such as Speeded Up Robust Features\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["12"]}

However, some types of the data are incomplete and noisy in practical environments, such as signal analysis, fault diagnosis etc. To solve this problem, a universal neighbourhood rough sets model (variable precision tolerance neighbourhood rough sets [VPTNRS] model) is proposed based on a tolerance neighbourhood relation and the probabilistic theory. The proposed model can be inducing a family of much more comprehensive information granules to characterize arbitrary concepts in complex universe. In this paper, we discussed the properties of the model as well as some important relevant theorems are also introduced and proved.

{"title": "Measuring flow complexity in videos\n", "abstract": " In this paper a notion of flow complexity that measures the amount of interaction among objects is introduced and an approach to compute it directly from a video sequence is proposed. The approach employs particle trajectories as the input representation of motion and maps it into a'braid'based representation. The mapping is based on the observation that 2D trajectories of particles take the form of a braid in space-time due to the intermingling among particles over time. As a result of this mapping, the problem of estimating the flow complexity from particle trajectories becomes the problem of estimating braid complexity, which in turn can be computed by measuring the topological entropy of a braid. For this purpose recently developed mathematical tools from braid theory are employed which allow rapid computation of topological entropy of braids. The approach is evaluated on a dataset consisting of open source videos depicting variations in terms of types of moving objects, scene layout, camera view angle, motion patterns, and object densities. The results show that the proposed approach is able to quantify the complexity of the flow, and at the same time provides useful insights about the sources of the complexity.", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["12"]}

{"title": "Growth and yield components of wheat genotypes as influenced by potassium and farm yard manure on a saline sodic soil.\n", "abstract": " The adequate supply of mineral nutrients through chemical fertilizers and manure may help to sustain the crop productivity and ensure plant survival under salinity stress. A field study was conducted on saline sodic soil (ECe= 13 dS m-1, SAR 23.3 (mmol L-1) 1/2, pH= 8.6 of surface 15 cm layer) to quantify the effects of potassium (K) and farm yard manure (FYM) on two wheat genotypes differing in salinity tolerance. Three K levels (0, 80, 120 kg ha-1) and two FYM levels (0, 10 t ha-1) were tested using randomized compete block design (RCBD) with three replications. The application of K along with FYM reduced Na+ uptake and accumulation in plant tissue. The K concentration and K+/Na+ ratio were significantly improved in both wheat genotypes with the supplementation of K and FYM. The grain yield was improved by 40-156% in salt tolerant genotype and 46-206% in salt sensitive genotype with added K and FYM. Similar trend was observed in yield components. Ameliorative effects of added K and FYM were more marked in salt sensitive genotype (Auqab-2000) than in salt tolerant (Inqlab-91). Grain yield of salt sensitive and salt tolerant wheat genotypes was positively correlated with leaf K+ concentration determined at various treatments. Addition of K along with FYM decreased sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and electrical conductivity (EC) of soil particularly in upper layers. Therefore, it is concluded that K along with FYM could help to alleviate deleterious effects of salts and thus improve the productivity of salt affected soils.", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["12"]}

Still, transdermal passage of molecule is tedious due to less permeability of stratum corneum (SC), the outermost layer of the skin. In its intact state the skin is a formidable barrier, resistant to chemicals and tissue-harmful ultraviolet rays and virtually impenetrable to the life threatening microorganisms. The stratum corneum (SC) develops a thin, tough, relatively impermeable membrane which usually provides the rate limiting step in transdermal drug delivery system. To overcome this barrier function chemical permeation enhancers (CPEs) are used that facilitate the absorption of permeate through the skin by temporarily decreasing the impermeability of the skin\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "23\n", "authors": ["12"]}

The obtained systems are characterized by secondary ion mass spectrometry and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry. The metal/glass interface chemistry plays an important role in the behavior of the metals and, especially for Ag, a proper time is required for the deposited film to first oxidize and then diffuse into the matrix, owing to the external electric field. Diffusion of Ag in silica is observed to be very sensitive to the applied field at relatively high temperatures, being stopped when a high field value is applied. This behavior may be attributed to the low availability of sites and the build-up of local electric fields within the glass.

{"title": "The Population Structure of Vibrio cholerae from the Chandigarh Region of Northern India\n", "abstract": " Background Cholera infection continues to be a threat to global public health. The current cholera pandemic associated with Vibrio cholerae El Tor has now been ongoing for over half a century.  Methodology/Principal Findings Thirty-eight V. cholerae El Tor isolates associated with a cholera outbreak in 2009 from the Chandigarh region of India were characterised by a combination of microbiology, molecular typing and whole-genome sequencing. The genomic analysis indicated that two clones of V. cholera circulated in the region and caused disease during this time. These clones fell into two distinct sub-clades that map independently onto wave 3 of the phylogenetic tree of seventh pandemic V. cholerae El Tor. Sequence analyses of the cholera toxin gene, the Vibrio seventh Pandemic Island II (VSPII) and SXT element correlated with this phylogenetic position of the two clades on the El Tor tree. The clade 2 isolates, characterized by a drug-resistant profile and the expression of a distinct cholera toxin, are closely related to the recent V. cholerae isolated elsewhere, including Haiti, but fell on a distinct branch of the tree, showing they were independent outbreaks. Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) distinguishes two sequence types among the 38 isolates, that did not correspond to the clades defined by whole-genome sequencing. Multi-Locus Variable-length tandem-nucleotide repeat Analysis (MLVA) identified 16 distinct clusters.

Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test is applied to check the stationary of variables. It is hypothesized that increase in crime leads to less economic growth in Pakistan. Autoregressive Distributive lag (ARDL) to cointegration is used to find short and long run relationship between crime and Economic growth. Results reveal that crime has negative and significant impact on economic growth in the long run, whereas in short run the effect of crime on economic growth is negative but insignificant. ECM term explains that adjustment process is quick. Our model is free from hetroskedasticity, autocorrelation with satisfactory functional form, which suggests the stability of our model. The CUSUM and CUSUMSQ are showing that the model is structurally stable and stays within the 5% of critical bounds.

On farm technicalities are increasing while farmers\u0393\u00c7\u00d6 technical knowledge is stagnant making insect pests and diseases pathogens resistant. Citrus is leading fruit and its better productivity is vital for the farmers and national economy but per acre production is lower that potential. Insect pests and diseases role is counted as significant in lowering the production. Therefore presents study was undertaken to explore growers concerns. 120 respondents were selected using probability sampling technique under survey based research design. Findings indicated that growers were more familiar to insects/pests attack than diseases infestation. The adoption of cultural and mechanical control was found more prominent method to manage diseases impacts. Lack of technical knowledge, Finance shortage, and high cost of inputs were the major adoption militating factors among growers. Micro credit schemes should be started by the public sector to alleviate the finance problem and trainings should be imparted by the pathology and entomology experts along with extension agents to adopt alternate way to manage the viral diseases.", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["12"]}

Seasonal changes in population density, sex ratio, age group, roosting sites, nesting sites, food and water points of pigeons were recorded in Rawalpindi/Islamabad. Higher population density of the pigeon in Islamabad was recorded in winter season followed by autumn, spring and summer season (0.13, 0.13, 0.10 and 0.09 individuals/ha respectively) whereas the higher population density of the pigeon in Rawalpindi was found in summer season followed by winter, spring and autumn (0.13, 0.11, 0.11 and 0.10 individuals/ha, respectively). The male and female sex ratio of the pigeon population confirms 1: 1 sex ratio, both in Rawalpindi/Islamabad in different seasons. However, adult and juvenile numbers in the pigeon population did not follow 1: 1 ratio; adults were more than juveniles in Rawalpindi/Islamabad in all seasons. The roosting sites, nesting sites, food and water points did differ in different seasons in Islamabad. Highest population of the pigeon was recorded in old buildings (0.30 individual/ha) and lowest in parklands (0.008 individual/ha). It is concluded that population density of the pigeon mainly concentrated in old buildings; roosting sites, nesting sites, food and water points used by pigeons changed with respect to different seasons.", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["12"]}

But little is known about how MCPH1 represses telomerase activity. In this study, to determine the mechanism by which MCPH1 regulates hTERT gene expression, we examined the role of MCPH1 in regulating the hTERT promoter in vitro. Co-transfection of the hTERT promoter with MCPH1 in Hela cells could inhibit the hTERT promoter activity. The EMSA assay demonstrated that MCPH1 could bind to the proximal hTERT promoter. Overexpression of MCPH1 could repress telomerase activity, and the repression was abolished by knocking down the MCPH1 expression using siRNA in U2OS cells. We propose that MCPH1 functions as a transcriptional repressor of hTERT in vitro.

{"title": "Effects of different fire severity levels on soil chemical and physical properties in Zagros forests of western Iran\n", "abstract": " The study focused on the effect of different intensities of fire on physical and chemical properties of soil in Zagros forests of western Iran. The dominant tree species in these forests is oak (Quercus persica). Three sites were selected; high severity burned site (HS), low severity burned site (LS) and control (not burned) site (C). Soil chemical properties such as: organic matter (OM), the total nitrogen (N), NO3-N, soluble potassium (K), soil phosphorus (P), pH, soil electrical conductivity (EC), cation exchangeable capacity (CEC), base cations (Ca, Mg, Na), CO2 and soil physical properties such as saturation percentage (SP), bulk density (BD), sand, clay and silt percentages were assessed in soil samples. To determine significance of differences among the three observed sites and most effective variables in the separation of sample plots, one-way analysis of variance and principal component analysis were used, respectively. Mean pH, N, NO3- N, OM, SP, P, K, and CEC at HS site were lower than at the sites with other fire intensities but the EC value for HS site was higher in comparison with other sites observed. According to Duncan's test, mean BD value for HS site was higher when compared with other sites but SP value was comparatively lowest. At LS site, mean sand content was lowest and the amount of silt was highest, in comparison with other sites. The results showed that observed fire severities had significant effects on physical and chemical properties of soil, yet fire low severity and control sites were very similar to each other in terms of investigated factors.

State-of-art methods exhibit high image registration accuracy at the expense of computational time. We propose an algorithm which selects either a feature based method or an optical flow method according to the image texture; for fast and accurate bladder wall mosaicing. Total variation (TV) optical flow method (deduced by duality) guarantees robust registration of poorly textured images. Realistic phantom images are registered with subpixel accuracy with a processing speed-up by a factor of 8 and 16 for two reference methods.

{"title": "Knowledge and attitude regarding euthanasia among medical students in the public and private medical schools of Karachi.\n", "abstract": " OBJECTIVE: To assess the awareness about and perception of euthanasia among medical students of Karachi. METHOD: The cross-sectional study was conducted from December 2011 to March 2012 among students of private-sector and one public-sector medical college in Karachi. Data was analysed using SPSS version 17, and associations were worked out using chi-square test. RESULTS: Out of the 493 students, 226 (46%) were from the matriculation system and 194 (39%) from the Cambridge system, while the remaining 15% were from the American High School. The male-female ratio was 1: 3. There were 284 (58%) students from the private medical college. Majority of the private medical school students (n= 284; 99.6%) knew about euthanasia, compared to the public-sector facility where only 161 (77%) knew of it. Of the total, 405 (82%) students agreed that it is physician-assisted suicide; 255 (52%) agreed to the idea of palliative care, claiming it was sufficient to maintain life; 226 (54%) disagreed that a doctor should not be allowed to administer a lethal dose while only 162 (33%) agreed to the idea of it; 285 (58%) disagreed that a law regarding the practice of euthanasia should not be introduced, whereas 134 (27%) agreed to it; 70 (14%) agreed to the practice of euthanasia, while 311 (63%) disagreed, mostly for religious reasons. CONCLUSION: The awareness of euthanasia was high, but a very small proportion of students approved of it.

Currently, about 500 pesticide companies are working in private sector and providing plant protection advisory services to the farmers. This study investigated the role of private sector in promoting IPM practices among the farming community in Punjab, Pakistan. Sixty (60) extension personnel of a private extension agency and some 408 farmers were selected for interview by using simple random sampling technique through Fitzgibbon table. The data were collected through validated interview schedule and analyzed by using SPSS. The results of the study revealed that the mean value for the physical, cultural, and biological control methods, was below 2 indicating that pesticide companies are less interested to promote IPM practices.

It is nutritionally as good as that of the major sources of red or white meat. Camel is a desert animal but is not less than other red meat animals (beef, lamb and goat) in its composition. The proximate composition, fatty acid profile and mineral contents of the local camel (Camelus dromedarius) meat have been investigated. It contained 72.03\u252c\u25920.014% water, 4.45\u252c\u25920.011% ash, 5.79\u252c\u25920.012% fat and 66.42\u252c\u25920.534% protein. It has been found that camel meat has relatively more moisture, less fat, less ash and similar protein content than that of beef, lamb and goat [1]. It has similar mineral composition (Na, K, Ca, Fe, Zn, P, Mg, Cd, Cr, Co, Mo, Ni, and Pb) to beef except for sodium. Fatty acid profile for camel meat oil showed high content of palmitic acid and oleic acid. These two fatty acids are essential in human nutrition. In view of the above, it is possible that camel meat could make a greater contribution to the growing need for meat in developing countries like Pakistan.", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["12"]}

The world is still to fully fathom the extent and gravity of the problem. This problem aggravates particularly during and after pregnancies due to increased nutritional demands and inadequate iron supply and is therefore more widespread in parous segments of female population. Objective of this study was to determine prevalence of anaemia in apparently healthy parous female population of Abbottabad and investigate underlying causes. Methods: This descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2001 to March 2011 in Abbottabad. Women reporting for various surgical procedures were investigated for anaemia by obtaining history through a structured performa, specifically designed to identify the underlying causes. Sixteen thousand women of child bearing age (20\u0393\u00c7\u00f440 years) were included in the study; 14,800 with history of at least one pregnancy and remaining with no previous pregnancy. Haemoglobin (Hb) was measured using haematology analyser Sysmex (KX21). Results: Of the screened women, 60% were found anaemic (Hb< 12 g/dl) 10% of which were severely anaemic (Hb< 6 g/dl). Anaemia was related to socio-demographic and obstetric history characteristics. The prevalence of anaemia was significantly lower in women who used iron supplements during their pregnancies. Lactating mothers not making up for the iron deficiencies during pregnancies usually carried their anaemia postpartum and beyond.

The herb has been revered for treating infectious diseases and highly regarded also as having a preventative effect from many diseases, due to its powerful immune strengthening benefits. The propagation of A. paniculata through seed is somewhat difficult which may be due to various germination problems. In view of the above, the present investigation was conducted with an objective to assess the compatible substratum for standard seed germination test of Andrographis seed. The seeds were collected and stored for six months at optimum temperature. Four substrata namely filter paper, top soil, saw dust and riverbed sand was collected for the experiment. Sand and soil were sieved with a 2 mm sieve to ensure uniform particle size. A standard germination test was done under partly sterilised and non-sterilised substratum with proper maintenance of light (11 hrs) and temperature (250C) by adding water up to 60\u0393\u00c7\u00f470% WHC. The 16 days test showed varied germination index and number of secondary roots. The result showed that the sterilized filter paper has proved most effective and compatible substratum for the Andrographis paniculata standard seed germination test. This led to uniform and quick germination with proper secondary roots and primary leaves. It can be suggested that due to scarcity of filter papers, sand substratum can also be used as an alternate as it showed more uniform germination than the rest two substrata.[The Journal of American Science. 2009; 5 (6): 70-75].(ISSN 1545\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["12"]}

Furthermore, knowing that integrable and chaotic quantum antiferromagnetic Ising chains are characterized by asymptotic logarithmic and linear growths of their operator space entanglement entropies, respectively, we apply our IGAC to present an alternative characterization of such systems. Remarkably, we show that in the former case the IGE exhibits asymptotic logarithmic growth while in the latter case the IGE exhibits asymptotic linear growth.At this stage of its development, IGAC remains an ambitious unifying information-geometric theoretical construct for the study of chaotic dynamics with several unsolved problems.

{"title": "Geometrodynamics of information on curved statistical manifolds and its applications to chaos\n", "abstract": " A novel information-geometrodynamical approach to chaotic dynamics (IGAC) on curved statistical manifolds based on Entropic Dynamics (ED) is presented and a new definition of information geometrodynamical entropy (IGE) as a measure of chaoticity is proposed. The general classical formalism is illustrated in a relatively simple example. It is shown that the hyperbolicity of a non-maximally symmetric 6N-dimensional statistical manifold M_{s} underlying an ED Gaussian model describing an arbitrary system of 3N degrees of freedom leads to linear information-geometric entropy growth and to exponential divergence of the Jacobi vector field intensity, quantum and classical features of chaos respectively. An information-geometric analogue of the Zurek-Paz quantum chaos criterion in the classical reversible limit is proposed. This analogy is illustrated applying the IGAC to a set of n-uncoupled three-dimensional anisotropic inverted harmonic oscillators characterized by a Ohmic distributed frequency spectrum.", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["12"]}

Using a realizable non-linear k-\u255e\u00c6\u251c\u00e2 model, the approximate solutions are derived and numerical simulations are carried out. Using the approximate solution, the values of model constants are tuned considering the predictability of turbulent structures at the vortex center.

Analysis of variance showed highly significant differences among the genotypes for all the traits studied except for dry shoot weight. The estimates of genotypic variance for plant height (75.04) were found highest among the traits followed by shoot length (3.36). Heritability estimates in general were higher in magnitude for all the traits except for dry shoot weight (25%). The simple correlation coefficient for coleoptile length showed positive and significant correlation with root length. Correlation coefficient was negative and non-significant for fresh shoot weight and plant height for coleoptile length. Two components with eigen value> 1 contributed 79% of the variability amongst the genotypes studied. Genotypes, which have longer coleoptile, root and shoot lengths tended to have reduced fresh shoot weight, dry shoot weight and plant height.

Generally, original concentrations of culture filtrates of all Trichoderma spp., except T. harzianum, significantly reduced various parameters of root and shoot growth of wheat seedlings. In foliar spray bioassay, pot-grown 1-wk and 2-wk old A. fatua and wheat seedlings were sprayed with 100% culture filtrates of the four Trichoderma spp. thrice with 5 d interval each. Culture filtrates of all except T. viride significantly diminished root and shoot biomass of A. fatua plants in 1-wk old plants. The effect of foliar spray on root and shoot growth of wheat was insignificant. Present study concludes that metabolites of T. harzianum, T. reesei and T. pseudokoningii contain herbicidal constituents for the management of A. fatua.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["12"]}

It has always been crucial and a complex phenomenon for the experts in the field of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) to decode and deduce the meaning of a text through context. They examine and attribute language as a social process involving context to determine the meaning of an utterance to its producer and receiver. It has also been of great interest and enthusiasm for discourse analysts to explore and identify the underlying objective of meaning carrying an ideological message based on religious, sociopolitical, and historical assumptions. The discourse practitioners are seriously occupied with critical studies on revealing social inequality, power relations, and dominance operated through language (Wodak, 2001a). Critical studies have actively pursued such discursive practices of power dominance, the imposition of an ideology, and discrimination through text and talk. There have been important insights on sociopolitical and historical discourse serving the purpose at (macro and micro) levels of analysis (van Dijk, 1993). It suggests the use of conversation analysis, narrative analysis, rhetoric/stylistics, and media analysis. The underlying approach may be used to analyze the discourse of speeches delivered by renowned politicians, parliamentarians, and national leaders.

The extensive simulation and analysis of results show that position-based routing protocols incur less packet loss as compared to the non position based protocols. However, position-based protocols require localization mechanism or a GPS for the location information, which consumes energy and affects the network lifetime. Alternatively, non position-based protocols are more energy efficient and provide extended network lifetime.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["12"]}

Do they think of themselves, for example, as being primarily British, as being primarily members of a minority group or as both? Do they share British values? And how, on the other hand, do members of the majority group (that is, people of white British origins) perceive and treat minorities? How widespread is racial and ethnic prejudice?

And what are the implications of the majority\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s attitudes for minority reactions?These issues, and the policy responses to them, have been much debated in Britain and more widely throughout Western Europe. Following the immigration into Western Europe over the past half-century, many countries have seen the rise of the so-called \u0393\u00c7\u00fffar-right\u0393\u00c7\u00d6political parties pursuing unambiguously racist and exclusionary policies. One of the most notable has been the Front National in France, which won the second highest number of votes (over 16 per cent) in the 2002 Presidential elections, reaching the second round after defeating Lionel Jospin of the Socialist Party.

An important objective in mobile communication systems is secure speech communication. GSM suffers from various security weaknesses. The GSM voice traffic is secure outside the core network but it has no security over the core network. This system can be made thoroughly secure by encrypting the speech which is to be transmitted on the GSM voice channel. In this paper we have demonstrated a real-time prototype of an end-to-end secure communication system developed in MATLAB Simulink. Our technique comprises of encryption of the speech before entering the GSM handset which adds security and confidentiality to our communication.

Widespread violence and repression in numerous forms jeopardize women's life in almost all parts of the country. For quite some years now, the index of violence is fattening. For this situation, many blame lack of adequate legal protection and administrative failures to contain violence. Rampant Terrorism and hooliganism add fuel to the fire, immediate victims of which are no sane group else than women. In the reporting year of 2001, the ongoing spate of violence against women and children reached a new height with rape incidents taking some unprecedented barbaric forms in some parts of the country. Also, acid throwing increased alarmingly. Abduction, murder and physical torture were also rampant. Incidents of dowry, dowry related violence such as physical torture and murder for dowry were common phenomena, particularly in the rural areas. As a whole the year's recorded facts and figures unearth a sad episode of the state of women in Bangladesh.The present study on violence against women in 2001 is the result of BNWLA'S experience with field level activism in rescuing of and extending legal assistance to destitute women and children of the country.

There are different variations or classification of e-learning approaches. One of notable approaches is Personal Learning Environment (PLE). In a PLE system, the contents are presented to the user in a personalized manner (according to the user's needs and wants). The problem arises when a new user enters the system, and due to the lack of information about the new user's needs and wants, the system fails to recommend him/her the personalized e-learning contents accurately. This phenomenon is known as cold-start problem. In order to address this issue, existing researches propose different approaches for recommendation such as preference profile, user ratings and tagging recommendations. In this research paper, the implementation of a novel interaction-based approach is presented. The interaction-based approach improves the recommendation accuracy for the new-user cold-start problem by integrating preferences profile and tagging recommendation and utilizing the interaction among users and system. This research work takes leverage of the interaction of a new user with the PLE system and generates recommendation for the new user, both implicitly and explicitly, thus solving new-user cold-start problem.

Its straw constituents are essential part of livestock feed and for paper making (Agu et al., 2006). Due to its immense and multipurpose use in daily life, the prosperity and well being of Pakistan depends upon good harvest of wheat crop. Its average yield in developed countries of the world such as China, Mexico, Australia, France, Egypt, Germany and United Kingdom is 3729 kg ha-1, 4404 kg ha-1, 4500 kg ha-1, 6487 kg ha-1, 6251 kg ha-1, 7282 kg ha-1 and 7700 kg ha-1 respectively (FAO, 2012). The average yield is far below the genetic potential of existing cultivars (Khaliq et al., 2013). The causes of low yield of wheat in Pakistan are nutrient deficiency in soil, delay in sowing, selection of low potential cultivars, less efficient and conventional methods of sowing, shortage of irrigation water and poor management techniques to control weed infestation (Hussain et al., 2014). Nitrogen is a major factor in achieving higher yield because it promotes vegetative growth of plant. Nitrogen increases leaf area, which enhances interception of photosynthetically active radiations (PAR) and its use efficiency (Arduini et al., 2006; Ara et al., 2014).

This leads to high operational and maintenance cost, and also reducing the profit margin of IaaS Cloud providers. Apparently profit margin depends on operational cost and revenue earned to comply with the Service Level Agreement (SLA) on the basis of achieved performance level. In this paper, we are building the relationship between energy consumption of servers and fulfillment of SLA (QoS) in IaaS Cloud. So we propose a framework to maximize revenues from SLA achieved requests on the energy efficient resource management in IaaS Cloud, in which the servers are equipped with DVFS module.

The traditional spring-damper suspension is currently being replaced by either a semi-active or active suspension system, because, passive suspension system cannot give better ride comfort and handling property. In order to improve the capability of active suspension systems, a robust Adaptive B-spline Neuro-fuzzy (ABNF) based control strategies are used to give better road handling and passenger comfort. In this paper, different orders of B-spline membership functions are used in the proposed ABNFs control strategies. The shape of B-spline membership functions can be adjusted self-adaptively by changing control points during learning process. The order of the B-spline membership functions gives a structure for choosing the shape of the fuzzy sets. The update parameters of ABNFs are trained by gradient descent based technique during the learning process. The ABNFs control techniques are successfully applied to full car suspension model which reduces the seat heave pitch and roll displacement, suspension travel and wheel displacement of the vehicle. The performance index of the proposed techniques is taken on the basis of seat, heave, pitch and roll of the vehicle. Simulation is based on the full car mathematical model by using MATLAB/SIMULINK. The simulation results show that the ABNFs control techniques give better results than passive and semi-active suspension systems.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["12"]}

{"title": "Improved Estimation of Trilateration Distances for Indoor Wireless Intrusion Detection.\n", "abstract": " Detecting wireless network intruders is challenging since logical addressing information may be spoofed and the attacker may be located anywhere within radio range. Accurate indoor geolocation provides a method by which the physical location of rogue wireless devices may be pinpointed whilst providing an additional option for location-based access control. Existing methods for geolocation using received signal strength (RSS) are imprecise, due to the multipath nature of indoor radio propagation and additional pathloss due to walls, and aim to minimise location estimate error. This paper presents an approach to indoor geolocation that improves measurements of RSS by averaging across multiple frequency channels and determining the occurrence of walls in the signal path. Experimental results demonstrate that the approach provides improved distance estimates for trilateration and thus aids intrusion detection for wireless networks.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["12"]}

In the automated class model generation, a higher accuracy can be achieved by overcoming the inherent syntactic ambiguities and semantic inconsistencies in English. In this paper, we propose a SBVR based approach to generate an unambiguous representation of NL software requirements. The presented approach works as the user inputs the English specification of software requirements and the approach processes input English to extract SBVR vocabulary and generate a SBVR representation in the form of SBVR rules. Then, SBVR rules are semantically analyzed to extract OO information and finally OO information is mapped to a class model. The presented approach is also presented in a prototype tool NL2SBVRviaSBVR that is an Eclipse plugin and a proof of concept.

The Western Ghats being one of the global biodiversity hotspots, is reeling under a tremendous pressure from human induced changes in terms of developmental projects like hydel or thermal power plants, big dams, mining activities, unplanned agricultural practices, monoculture plantations, illegal timber logging, etc. This has led to the once contiguous forest habitats to be fragmented in patches, which in turn has led to the shrinkage of original habitat for the wildlife, change in the hydrological regime of the catchment, decreased inflow in streams, human-animal conflicts, etc. Under such circumstances, a proper management practice is called for requiring suitable biological indicators to show the impact of these changes, set priority regions and in developing models for conservation planning. Amphibians are regarded as one of the best biological indicators due to their sensitivity to even the slightest changes in the environment and hence they could be used as surrogates in conservation and management practices.

In each simulation a monoenergetic neutron source of a particular energy was embedded in the center of a sphere made of CR-39. Surrounding the source there were concentric shells of 2 \u256c\u255dm CR-39 track detectors. The code, MCNP, was run on personal computer for 7.5\u251c\u00f9106 histories. The number of proton recoils in each shell of 2 \u256c\u255dm of CR-39 were determined. The simulation results show that apart from proton recoils (for En > 1.0 MeV), about 50% recoils are due to heavy charged particles i.e. Oxygen and Carbon in CR-39. This indicates that etched tracks are not only due to recoil of protons but also due to recoil of heavy charged particles. The upper limits of the track registration efficiencies have been determined as a function of neutron energies\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["12"]}

Clinical presentation may vary from mere presence of fever to altered sensorium. The incomplete clinical picture of CAP in the elderly may be associated with a delay in establishing the diagnosis and, consequently, in starting adequate antibiotic therapy. Delay in diagnosis and treatment may contribute to the higher observed death rate in the elderly population with CAP. Hence the following study was undertaken to study the clinical, radiological, and bacteriological profile of community-acquired pneumonia in elderly. A total of 50 patients were studied. Age group varied from 66 years to 88 years. Presentation varied from typical symptoms to altered sensorium. Smoking and COPD were most common predisposing conditions. Most common organisms responsible were Streptococcus pneumonia, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas, H. influenza, and Staphylococcus aureus. Etiological agents could not be identified in many cases because of difficulty in collecting sputum in elderly patients, lower yield of culture, and various atypical and difficult to isolate causative organisms. Hence there is need for an empirical therapy covering both typical and atypical organisms.

Traditionally, landmark database was built with visual odometry system, and the 3D information of each visual landmark is reconstructed from video. Due to the drift of the visual odometry system, a global consistent landmark database is difficult to build, and the inaccuracy of each 3D landmark limits the performance of landmark matching. In this paper, we demonstrated that with the use of precise 3D Li-dar range data, we are able to build a global consistent database of high precision 3D visual landmarks, which improves the landmark matching accuracy dramatically. In order to further improve the accuracy and robustness, landmark matching is fused with a multi-stereo based visual odometry system to estimate the camera pose in two aspects.

Serum biochemical parameters, antioxidant enzyme levels, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and serum transaminases (glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) and glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT)) values and histopathology were systematically evaluated. Reserpine exposure led to increase the oxidative stress and organ injury was significantly observed through biochemical parameters and ultrastructural evaluation. Sprague-Dawely (SD) rats were intraperitonealy administered reserpine to induce oxidative kidney damage. Experimental rats were given green tea extract according to the protocol given below. Sixty rats were randomly divided into six groups, with 10 rats in each group. Reserpine was found to cause kidney proximal tubule damage, such as stripping and clustering of ribosomes from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) and demolishing of mitochondrial christae with elevated level of oxidative stress markers, such as TBARS. While the ultrastructural study showed a revival of kidney proximal tubule cells as a result of the administration of green tea extract to rats. We suggest that green tea might elevate antioxidant defense system, clean up free radicals, lessen oxidative damages and protect kidney against reserpine-induced toxicity and thus had a potential protective effect.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["12"]}

{"title": "Management of legume N 2 fixation in cereal systems. A research programme for the rain fed areas of Pakistan, Nepal and Australia\n", "abstract": " [en] Legumes play an important and unique role in agriculture because of their ability to fix atmospheric N 2. This allows them to grow in N impoverished soils without fertilizer N and, theoretically, to grow in any soil without depleting the N reserves. The nodulated roots and above ground residues, left after the seed and other components of the crop have been harvested, represent valuable sources of N for the replenishment of soil organic N. The major objective of a Co-ordinated Research Programme, funded by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR), is to develop and promote the use of legumes as a source of N for cereal production for rain fed systems in Pakistan, Nepal and Australia. The experiments will aim at identifying the cultural practices that maximize N 2 fixation, including weed control, fertilizer inputs, inoculation and alternative cultivars and species. Use will be made of the 15 N and xylem sap techniques to quantify the amounts of N 2 fixed. The major foci of the project are the cool season systems involving cereals (wheat and barley) and pulse (chickpea, lentil, pea and faba bean). An additional aim of the project is to function the relationships between soil water and nitrate and legume N 2 fixation, using data from the full range of environments and crop species. It is envisaged that such functions will be useful in the management of legumes for N 2 fixation. The residual effects (benefits) of legumes on soil mineral and total N and on cereal production will be assessed.

Research attempted to save and surface rapidly dying healing and treatment practices alongwith the gradually perishing floral wealth from the area. A total of 108 phanerogamic species belonging to 37 families were recorded. Indigenous communities use 38 species (35.18%) for medicinal purposes including abdominal pain, jaundice, flu, cough, dandruff, asthma, bone fracture, blood pressure, rheumatism, diabetes, cancer and cardiac anomalies. Based on the frequency and scope of utilization Berberis lycium stood 1st followed by Artemisia maritima 2nd and Linum usitatissimum 3rd. At present only 1.4% population practice folk medication compared to 80% in 1950s. Several adverse causes have left many important plant species under severe pressure. Under such visible and invisible hostile pressures, Ethnobotanical knowledge and indigenous wild and cultivated medicinally important floral species are perishing concurrently. Distilled folk insights documented can help pharmacognosy and innovation into existing medication for several ailments.

Aceclofenac, rectal suppositories were developed by employing various hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymeric bases like gelatin, PEG-400 and hydrogenated vegetable oil using propylene glycol as plasticizer and beeswax as hardening agent. The in-vitro release rate data was evaluated statistically and was found that from all the formulations the drug release is by diffusion mechanism (r= 0.9547 to 0.9967) according to Higuchis equation. All the prepared formulations have shown zero-order release kinetics except those prepared by utilizing 15% and 20% of PEG-400. The formulation prepared using 7.5% beeswax in hydrogenated vegetable oil has displayed zero-order drug release (r= 0.9927) and has released 99.18% of the aceclofenac within 4h, hence, this formulation is considered as a promising formulation. The stability study on the promising formulation was conducted over a period of 6 months and found that there are no significant changes in the drug content and in-vitro drug release rate (p< 0.05).

T. pseudokoningii, T. harzianum, T. viride and T. reesei against parthenium (Parthenium hysterophorus L.) weed. Fungal metabolites were prepared in malt extract broth and MID medium. In laboratory bioassays, parthenium seed were sown on filter papers in Petri plates (9-cm diameter) and 3 mL of original and 50% diluted metabolites of the test Trichoderma spp. were applied. Metabolites of all the four fungal species showed herbicidal action. The highest herbicidal activity was observed due to metabolites of T. harzianum. Fungal metabolites prepared in M-1-D medium generally showed greater inhibitory potential against seed germination and seedlings root/shoot growth as compared to the metabolites prepared in the other medium. For foliar spray bioassays, pot grown parthenium seedling at 1-and 2-week growth stages were sprayed with original fungal metabolites. Foliar spray was carried out three times with five days of intervals. In these pot trials, metabolites of all the four fungal species reduced shoot and root growth significantly in 1-week old parthenium plants. Metabolites prepared in M-1-D medium showed greater herbicidal effect than those formed in malt extract broth. It is concluded that metabolites of Trichoderma species, particularly prepared in M-1-D medium can be exploited for the management of parthenium weed.\u252c\u2310 2013 Friends Science Publishers", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["12"]}

{"title": "Weak Form Efficiency: Indian Stock Market.\n", "abstract": " This study examines the random walk hypothesis to determine the validity of weak-form efficiency of major stock market in India, BSE. The study uses daily observation over the span from 3rd July 2007 to Bist December 2011, comprising a total of 1116 observations. The random walk hypothesis is examined using Auto correlation test, unit root tests. Augmented Dickey-Fuller test and the Runs test. The result of ADF and unit root tests clearly reveals that the null hypothesis of unit root is convincingly rejected in the case of stock market returns of BSE SENSEX and the industry indices. This suggests that the Indian stock markets do not show characteristics of random walk. But the ACF and Unit root test does not show characteristics of random walk. This implies that the Indian stock markets are not weak form efficient. This provides an opportunity to the traders for predicting the future prices and earning abnormal profits on the auto industry. The implication of rejection of weak form efficiency for investors is that they can better predict the stock price movements.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["12"]}

Simulation results also show that phase noise effects performance for BPSK, QPSK & 16 PSK constellation which lead to the conclusion that a phase noise mitigation mechanism is needed to obtain acceptable performance.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["12"]}
{"title": "3-D numerical simulation of flow and clear water scour by interaction between bridge piers\n", "abstract": " In this paper, the flow and local scour variation around single pier and by interaction between bridge piers are studied using 3D flow model. The model uses a finite-volume method to solve the non-transient NavierStokes equations for three dimensions on a general non-orthogonal grid. The k \u2229\u00c7\u00a1 \u2229\u00fc\u00d1 turbulence model is used to solve the Reynolds-stress term. The numerical model solves the sediment continuity equation in conjunction with van-Rijn\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s bed-load sediment transport formula to simulate the bed evolution. The 3D flow model is verified through experimental study in a non cohesive bed material in an experimental flume. The different causes of local scour around the pier are simulated well, such as bow flow, down flow, horseshoe vortex, pressure variation and lee-wake vortex. It is found from this study that the local scour depth by interaction between bridge piers depends on the Froude number, the longitudinal distance between piers and the ratio of pier diameter to channel bed width. The maximum scour depth for double piers is higher than that for single pier. Furthermore, the effect of pier shape on the scour process is studied and it is found that the maximum scour depth for circular pier is less than that for rectangular one for both single and double piers. The effect of double piers on scour hole depth is diminished at L/D= 7 for circular piles and at L/D= 15 for rectangular ones. The results show good agreement between simulation and experimental results. Also, empirical equations are developed for computing the maximum scour depth due to the interaction between bridge piers at rectangular and circular shapes.

{"title": "Health hazards among coastal villagers of Pakistan due to arsenic contaminated drinking water\n", "abstract": " Water supply has become insufficient for the rapidly rising population in Pakistan. As in other parts of Pakistan, coastal villagers also become helpless to use ground water for drinking and daily consumption, due to their need and their not knowing about the quality of water. A number of patients arrived to Karachi hospitals, suffering from a strange disease and this study has been done to find the exact cause of this disease by assuming that arsenic contaminated drinking water may be one of the possibilities. Maximum permissible limit (MRL) of arsenic in drinking water of Pakistan has been calculated by analysis of 50 samples of supply water as 0.05 mg/l. It was observed that most of the residents of Ibrahim Hyderi, Rehri, Chashma, Mubarak, Fagheer Muhammad and Gul Hasan Goths (villages) of the coastal belt of the Karachi city were suffering from melanosis, leuco-melanosis, keratosis, hyperkeratosis, dorsum, non-pitting oedema, gangrene and skin cancer that might be due to arsenic contamination in drinking water. Studied subjects were seriously affected due to paralyzing lower limbs, arms and other body parts in the coastal belt of Karachi, which was observed to be the most prominent health hazards of arsenic. The majority of victims were children. This community problem demands proper addressing and extensive research for improving the quality of life of these villagers.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["12"]}
{"title": "A Cointegration Approach to Estimate Private Investment Demand Function of Pakistan\n", "abstract": " The present study estimates the long run private investment function for the period from 1972 to 2011 by using Johansen cointegration approach. The results suggest debt servicing, inflation and private investment to be negatively associated. The study concludes positive impact of GDP growth rate, foreign direct investment, and exchange rate on private investment in Pakistan. The Wald (\u2567\u00e72) Statistics show that GDP, FDI and exchange rate Granger cause private investment. The significance of coefficient of the error correction term confirms the long run causality between explanatory variables and private investment. The pair-wise Granger causality concludes unidirectional causality from private investment to GDP growth, from private investment to foreign direct investment, inflation rate to private investment and from private investment to exchange rate but causality test confirms bidirectional causality between debt servicing and private investment.

The soil water was available maximum on high height and low height terraces but it was observed minimum in medium terrace. Thus, the low delta crops on medium terrace should be planted instead of growing high delta crops. Actually, the medium terrace contains relatively low clay contents which resulted low retention of soil water. The soil water contents within all terraces down to the depth increased linearly. The rainfall distribution was almost same on the study site during the rainy season. However, the temperature variation trend at all the locations was season dependent. This study provides an idea for crop management under arid environment and to introduce the suitable crop in their cropping pattern.

The limits of the glass forming regions in the Ca and Sr systems and substitution limits in the AE-Ca-Si-ON systems have been determined and physical properties of the glasses measured. Transparent glasses were obtained for a few specific compositions in the Ca-Si-ON and Mg-Ca-Si-ON systems. All other glasses were found to be translucent gray to opaque black, with the coloration of the glasses depending on the modifier. Small inclusions of Ca/Sr silicides and, in much smaller amounts, elemental Si are believed to be responsible for their poor transparency. A large glass forming region was found for the Ca-Si-ON system, with glasses retaining up to 58 e/o N and 42 e/o Ca. In comparison, a more narrow glass forming region was found for the corresponding Sr system, with glasses retaining up to 45 e/o N and 39 e/o Sr. The glass formation was found to depend on reaction kinetics and precursors used. A strong exothermic reaction was observed at temperatures 650\u0393\u00c7\u00f41000oC, providing improved conditions for reaction kinetics upon further heating.Physical property measurements for the Ca and Sr glasses showed that glass transition and crystallization temperatures, viscosity, hardness, Young\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s modulus and shear modulus depend strongly on the nitrogen content and that these properties increase\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["12"]}

Ten different combinations of months for two, four, five or other seasons were tried. The other fixed effect in the model was age defined within parity. The random effects were permanent environment and animal's breeeding value along with the residual effects. A single trait animal model was used where all known relationships of an animal were incorporated in a relationship matrix. The error variance from the fitted model decreased as the number of year-season combinations increased, indicating a month-year model to be more appropriate. This, on the other hand, decreased the number of contemporaries for certain subclasses to a minimum of one, making the bull comparisons invalid.

{"title": "Ricci dark energy of amended FRW universe in chern-simon modified gravity\n", "abstract": " The energy density of the universe is proportional to the Ricci scalar curvature in the dynamical Chern-Simon (CS) modified gravity. In this paper, we consider the Amended Friedman-Robertson-Walker (AFRW) universe and explore its scale factor and the Ricci Dark Energy. These turned out to be well-defined and definite. We compare the scale factors of FRW, Generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) and AFRW models graphically. The combined graph of these models show that the behavior of both FRW and AFRW models is similar as these overlap each other for choosing particular values of the integration constants. Also, we draw a combined graph of the Ricci dark energy densities of FRW and AFRW models, in CS gravity, and the energy density of GCG. It shows that the densities of former two models are increasing with time while the energy density of GCG is decreasing.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["12"]}
{"title": "Robust bladder image registration by redefining data-term in total variational approach\n", "abstract": " Cystoscopy is the standard procedure for clinical diagnosis of bladder cancer diagnosis. Bladder carcinoma in situ are often multifocal and spread over large areas. In vivo, localization and follow-up of these tumors and their nearby sites is necessary. But, due to the small field of view (FOV) of the cystoscopic video images, urologists cannot easily interpret the scene. Bladder mosaicing using image registration facilitates this interpretation through the visualization of entire lesions with respect to anatomical landmarks. The reference white light (WL) modality is affected by a strong variability in terms of texture, illumination conditions and motion blur. Moreover, in the complementary fluorescence light (FL) modality, the texture is visually different from that of the WL. Existing algorithms were developed for a particular modality and scene conditions. This paper proposes a more general on fly image registration approach\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["12"]}

By nature, the existence of femtocell can lead to the increase of handover initiation. However, 3GPP standard provides Mobility Robustness Optimization (MRO) to optimize handover performance. MRO is a use-case for Self-Organizing Network (SON). The conventional MRO algorithm tunes handover parameters based on counts of handover failures and handover events. In addition, conventional MRO algorithm uses hysteresis only to adjust and improve HO performance. In this paper, we propose an improved MRO algorithm by taking into account new optimization parameters, which is Time To Trigger parameter (TTT) to improve MRO algorithm performance in terms of reducing Ping-Pong rate and lower HO failure rate between femtocell and macrocell.

Experiments have been performed to measure the energy head losses for a range of subcritical flow conditions, varying discharges and downstream water levels. The energy head loss caused by the submerged vegetated weir-like obstacle has been modeled using an expansion loss form drag model that has been derived from the one-dimensional momentum conservation equation and accounts for the energy loss associated with a deceleration of the flow downstream of a sudden expansion.

The data regarding eight characters including branches per plant, nodes per plant, pods per plant, seeds per plant, 100 seeds weight, days to flowering, days from flowering to maturity and seed yield were evaluated for phenotypic-genotypic correlations and path coefficient analysis. Means for yield and its components were significantly different among all genotypes for all characters. Significantly positive phenotypic correlation was observed between seed yield and days to flowering. Furthermore, genotypic correlation showed that seed yield was positively correlated with all characters except 100 seeds weight. Pods per plant showed the highest positive direct effect on seed yield, followed by branches per plant. In addition, the indirect effects of most characters were high through pods per plant. The results obtained from genotypic correlations and path analyses showed that the efficiency of selection for seed yield in early maturing soybean should increase through the selection of pods per plant.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["12"]}

Ondansetron is a routinely used anti emetic drug which is being administered by the trial and error principle. Though it did revolutionized the management of this condition but by and large failed to completely eliminate the problem. Recently an important factor possibly elucidating this failure is said to be the differing expression of genes controlling proteins that are involved in transport and receptors related to this drug. Quite surprisingly these transporter and receptor pathways have been found to be polymorphic and at the same time shown to be related to efficacy of the drug. The differentiation between those responding to treatment and those not responding may pave a way to individualize treatment for emesis to a greater extent. This review highlights the pharmacogenetics related to this commonly used anti-emetic drug in anaesthesia. It is visualized as a promising way to achieve the target of individualized therapy.

Keeping in view its significance, this study was designed to assess the effect of various concentrations of salicylic acid on fresh apricot market traits as fruit firmness, weight loss, total soluble solids, acidity, total sugars, microbial and organoleptic quality at ambient conditions. Four concentrations of salicylic acid (0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2mM) were applied on fresh apricot by dipping and evaluated at 2 day intervals for physico-chemical, microbial and sensorial quality. A decreasing trend in fruit firmness and increased weight losses were witnessed during storage. However, higher concentrations of salicylic acid favor firmness and lowered weight loss. Total soluble solids increased steadily among the samples treated with higher level of salicylic acid. Titratable acidity decreased initially in all treatments with a rapid decline in control followed by lower concentrations of salicylic acid, whereas total sugars increased throughout storage. Lower microbial load and higher sensorial scores were achieved at higher concentrations of salicylic acid. This study revealed that 2mM concentration of salicylic acid was effective in retaining keeping quality of apricot significantly up to 12 days at ambient storage.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["12"]}

A cross-sectional research design was used for the study. Farmers were asked about their demands for advisory services on four-point likert scale. A sample of 408 farmers was selected for interview using simple random sampling technique through Fitzgibbon table. The data were collected through validated interview schedule and analyzed by using SPSS software. The results revealed that there were high demands of advisory services for specific crops in specific cropping zones. In cottonzone, demand for agronomic and plant protection advisory services regarding cotton was very high with mean values of 3.85 and 3.91 with standard deviation of 0.46 and 0.41, respectively. Similarly, in rice-zone, demand for these advisory services regarding rice was also very high with the mean values of 3.65 and 3.60 with standard deviation of 0.54 and 0.59, respectively. This study rejected the impression that farmers are not interested in advisory services.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["12"]}

{"title": "Simulation of MIMO antenna systems in simulink and embedded matlab\n", "abstract": " Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) has emerged as a hot topic in wireless communications during the last decade. This is due to possible dramatic increases in reliability and capacity as compared to single-antenna solutions. However, much of the existing theoretical results are based on very simplistic models of the antennas and transciever circuitry. Within the Strategic Research Center on Atenna Systems Charmant at Chalmers, we are developing a systems simulator for making more realistic studies of MIMO systems. Models of different complexity can be used for the different components. For the linear components, S-parameters are used as the interface. These can come from theoretical models, electromagnetic field simulations, or directly from measurements. For the non-linear components, simple memoryless models can be used, as existing in the RF Toolbox. However, wideband applications demand more elaborate models. We have implemented a so-called memory polynomial model, which has been found to match measurements of nonlinear wideband power amplifiers well. Since RF Toolbox cannot handle multi-port scattering matrices (yet), the MIMO part is here computed in a Matlab function, and then implemented as a MIMO transfer function. The paper describes an implementation of a transciever chain including mixers, filters, PA/LNA, matching network, MIMO antennas and channel models. The simulator can be used for a wide range of wireless communication applications.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["12"]}

However, the proposed solutions for interference mitigation are not satisfying and need further improvement. Two main reasons identified for this unsatisfactory, firstly the small number of femtocells used in the simulation scenario which can lead to high failure probability if applied under real enterprise environment, secondly; the provided solutions discussed only part of the problem, ie either in co-tier interference or cross-tier interference but not both. Thus the need arises for stable solution which can resolve the interference problem for both inter and intra scenarios.

A deterministic propagation model is used as an experimental tool to investigate the narrowband characteristics of the channel. The indoor radio propagation channel is modeled by using ray tracing and humans are modeled as perfectly conducting cylinders. The human bodies are considered as randomly distributed cylinders in a room. By varying both the number of persons and room size their effect on the received signal strength i.e. its fading distribution has been studied statistically. For a fixed room size as the number of persons increase, the variance of path loss increases due to more variations in the received signal. The variance decreases as the room size increases for a fixed number of persons. It was found that change in the\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["12"]}

Rarely, these drugs have been observed to cause hypocholesterolemia. We present a case of forty years old male who was started on Atorvastatin after his angioplasty following anterior myocardial infarction. Six weeks after the start of antilipid drug patient developed symptoms of phobias, nightmares, insomnia, forgetfulness, body aches, muscle cramps, cognitive, sexual and psychomotor disturbances. On investigation he was found to have hypocholesterolemia. Atorvastatin was stopped and dietary restrictrictions were lifted. Over five month patients symptoms resolved as the serum cholesterol levels became normal. Because of similarities of symptoms of hypocholesterolemia secondary to antilipid therapy and the disease itself, hypocholesterolemia was overlooked initially by physicians. Patients on antilipids must be evaluated for any fall in serum cholerterol if they develop unusual symptoms and patients on long term antilipids must have regularly lipid profile checked.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["12"]}

A case of extensive aplasia cutis congenita was seen and oral intake of azathioprine by the mother during pregnancy was suspected as an etiologic factor. The parents of the patient did not consent for biopsy or autopsy so the histopathological picture was not available and hence involvement of other systems could not be ascertained.

Head loss due to submerged vegetated dikes and groins has been modeled by expansion loss form drag model (Energy and momentum balance principles) and it has been compared with experimental data. An experimental study has been carried out on a scaled physical model in the Laboratory of Environmental Fluid Mechanics of Delft University of Technology. The prototype dike and groin has been modeled as a weir and vegetation has been represented as cylinders on the crest of the weir with varying blockage area. Different cases have been studied for emerged and submerged cylinders. Measurements for energy head losses were carried out for a range of discharges and down stream water levels covering submerged and subcritical flow conditions. Agreement of theoretical results predicted by an expansion loss form drag model is good with experimental data for the case of a weir with cylinders. So the expansion loss model is of practical use for the prediction of head losses of a vegetated groin or dike.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["12"]}

The shared trees are built by choosing one node as the center of the tree. The optimal location of a center under the constraints of minimal tree cost and delay for a particular group is an NP-complete problem. Current implementations of protocols decide on the location of these centers administratively, an attractive choice given that the solution is obviously sub-optimal and does not lend itself to dynamic reconfiguration of centers. We present a scalable heuristic to find a near-optimal solution to the center location problem. Our solution is easily amenable to distributed implementation and provides the protocol with a list of possible centers ranked in the order of their optimality, therefore providing fault tolerance and reducing the chances of a single point of failure at the center.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["12"]}

In this paper, we review several techniques proposed in the literature for testing object-oriented software, and investigate the impact of object-oriented approach on the design of testing strategies. In particular, we focus on the test case selection problem in class testing. We observe that an effective test case should consists of a tuple (s, \u2567\u00ea) where s is a class state and \u2567\u00ea a sequence of operations that may be applied to the state. State space analysis and trace analysis techniques are discussed, which may be used to characterize the class state space and the interactions of operations, so that effective test data can be selected.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["12"]}

{"title": "Robust and accurate optical flow estimation for weak texture and varying illumination conditions: Application to cystoscopy\n", "abstract": " Robustness and accuracy of the existing optical flow algorithms can still be improved for noisy, low textured and poorly contrasted images. Most methods are based on the variational approach given by the Horn-Schunck model which can suffer from over-smoothing problems. In this paper, we propose to take into account the significant structural information of the images during optical flow computation. This will allow for discontinuities across the structure boundaries. In the data term, our optical flow model uses a classical brightness constancy assumption complemented by a modified Hessian constancy assumption based on shape structure. A constraint is added along with the regularization term, for handling the over-smoothing problems. Results on the Middlebury benchmark show the competitiveness of this algorithm.

It has high nutritional prospects and carries appreciable amounts of biologically active components and hence there is an increasing demand for fresh apricot. Keeping in view the growing interest in this fruit, the present investigation was planned to evaluate the effect of different concentrations of salicylic acid (0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2millilimol) on storage quality of apricot during ambient storage. Some biochemical quality parameters as total soluble solids, pH, acidity, ascorbic acid, total phenolics, carotenoids, antioxidant capacity and enzymatic activity (polphenol oxidase, peroxidase and catalase) were evaluated. The results revealed that salicylic acid application significantly maintained quality attributes of apricot at ambient conditions. Among different concentrations; 2 mmol/l salicylic acid retained maximum ascorbic acid, carotenoids, antioxidant activity and maintained lower levels of degrading enzymes followed by 1.5 mmol/l. The effective concentrations of salicylic acid (2, 1.5 mmol/l) slowed down ripening process and kept the produce acceptable up to 12 days, whereas, lower concentrations had no pronounced effect on fruit quality as compared to control.

These significant improvements have resulted in the deployment of a very large number of sensing devices in various domains for capturing a huge amount of data. To make the captured data potentially useful for applications, it needs to be openly accessible to applications in an understandable pattern and linked with other related open data sources instead of being locked inside organizations. However, the data produced by sensors normally is in different formats and lacking of semantic to describe their meanings. This poses significant problems in accessing and using sensor data in applications, and linking with other related data sources. To solve these problems, sensor data needs to be annotated using Semantic Web technologies and published over the LOD cloud using the Linked Data principles. The resulting integration opens novel ways to both industry and academia for designing useful web services and applications. The efforts in this direction are not well organized and well coordinated and make it difficult for a researcher to know state of the art and precisely identify an issue and follow a clear course of investigation.

The results indicated that there was significant genotypic variation among the genotypes. Additive dominance model revealed full fitness of the data for RL, DSW, FRW, DRW, spike length, and 1000-grain weight but was partially fit for SL, FSW, R/S, tillers per seedling, plant height, tillers per plant, spikelets per spike, and grain yield per plant. The partially adequate models for these plant characters might be due to the presence of non-allelic interaction, linkage, and non-independent distribution of the genes in the parents. Additive genes coupled with moderate to high narrow sense heritability were involved in the heritage of all the traits, which indicated a higher scope of selection in early generations.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["12"]}
{"title": "Impact of Pollutants on Physico-Chemical Characteristics of Dal Lake under Temperate Conditions of Kashmir\n", "abstract": " Lake viz. Hazratbal, Nishat, Nehru Park and Nigeen basin in Kashmir during March-December, 2008 to study the effects of pollutants on physicochemical characteristics of Dal Lake. After physicochemical analysis of water samples collected from four basins of the lake, Nigeen basin showed the highest level of pollution than rest of the basins. Therefore the present study clearly indicates that Dal Lake is undergoing rapid eutrophication under the increasing anthropogenic impacts in their drainage basins. The rate of pollution varies from one basin to other. It was observed that pollution problem in the basins of Dal is mainly due to addition of major plant nutrients particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, derived from human wastes, detergents and agricultural practices. The organic and inorganic pollutant load in the Dal have accelerated the macrophytic growth which in turn has reduced the water quality and biological oxygen demand (BOD) of the lake and hence have reduced the recreational and aesthetic appeal of the lake. The condition of Dal Lake has reached a critical stage from the ecological angles and if proper conservation measures are not taken in future, the lake will likely deteriorate further and will soon turn into a dust bin.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["12"]}
{"title": "Integrated preparatory method for cotton towel by using enzymes\n", "abstract": " This study was undertaken to develop one-bath preparatory process for cotton towel by the use of different enzymes. The results obtained were compared with the conventional processing method. Instead of using amylase enzyme in the conventional method, amyloglucosidase/pullanase enzyme was used to carry out desizing in one-bath process that produces glucose units. The next process of bleaching (GOx treatment) was carried out in the spent bath of desizing, the glucose oxidase enzyme (Aspergillus Oryzae) was used to generate hydrogen peroxide from the residual glucose generated during desizing previously. The hydrogen peroxide yield was 85 mg/l. Glucose oxidase enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of glucose units to gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide simultaneously in the presence of oxygen. The decomposition of residual hydrogen peroxide from bleached towel was done with catalase enzyme. The results revealed similar Tegewa scale rating and Absorbency coupled with acceptable degree of Whiteness with integrated method when compared with the conventional method. The proposed integrated method is more economical as it requires less utilities and having environmental benefit owing to the elimination of desizing process effluent discharge.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["12"]}
{"title": "Aetiological factors in mechanical intestinal obstruction\n", "abstract": " Background: Intestinal obstruction occurs when the normal flow of intestinal contents is interrupted. The most frequent causes of intestinal obstruction are postoperative adhesions and hernias, which cause extrinsic compression of the intestine. Less frequently, tumours or strictures of the bowel can cause intrinsic blockage. Objective of the study was to find out the various aetiological factors of mechanical intestinal obstruction and to evaluate the morbidity and mortality in adult patients presenting to Surgical \u0393\u00c7\u00ffA\u0393\u00c7\u00d6unit of Ayub teaching hospital with mechanical intestinal obstruction. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from March 2009 to September, 2009. All patients presenting with intestinal obstruction and were above the age of 12 years were included in the study. Patients with non-mechanical obstruction were excluded from the study and those who responded to conservative measures were also excluded. Results: A total of 36 patients with age ranging from 12 to 80 years (Mean age 37.72\u252c\u259219.74 years) and male to female ratio of 1.77: 1, were treated for mechanical intestinal obstruction. The most common cause for mechanical intestinal obstruction was adhesions (36.1%). Intestinal tuberculosis was the second most common cause (19.4%), while hernias and sigmoid volvulus affected 13.9% patients each. Malignancies were found in 5.6% cases. Conclusion: Adhesions and Tuberculosis are the leading causes of mechanical intestinal obstruction in Pakistan. Although some patients can be treated conservatively, a substantial portion requires immediate surgical intervention.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["12"]}

The method involves an ansatz technique to solve an equivalent first-order PDE system of similarity variables given by group foliations of this heat equation, using its admitted group of scaling symmetries. This technique yields explicit similarity solutions as well as other explicit solutions of a more general (non-similarity) form having interesting analytical behavior connected with blow up and dispersion. In contrast, standard similarity reduction of this heat equation gives a semilinear ODE that cannot be explicitly solved by familiar integration techniques such as point symmetry reduction or integrating factors.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["12"]}

A cross-sectional research design was used for the study. A sample of 408 farmers was drawn by using Fitzgibbon table. Only 260 respondents (who were able to rate the strengths and weaknesses of extension methods) reported that they got extension services from private sector. The data were collected through personal interviews with the help of pre-tested and validated interview schedule. The data were analyzed by using computer software (SPSS). About 98.5 percent of the respondents reported that group discussion was a commonly used method followed by TV channels (62.7%) and telephone calls (52.3%). Regarding effectiveness of communication, overall mean value (2.11) depicts that it was considered a weakness of the private extension system by the end users. The study concludes that effective communication of a message is more important than delivery of a message. So the private extension system should focus on effective communication rather than communication.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["12"]}

During subsequent ten years of family planning clinical practice, I never found another one to remove. The same concern came to my mind during an operations research workshop sponsored by University Research Corporation (URC) in early 1986, where we had to brainstorm research ideas. That was just four years after Copper T-200 was introduced in the National Family Planning Program in Bangladesh. I realized that by this time, a part of the cohort of 1982-83 IUD acceptors will be needing replacement of their IUDs, since the recommended effective life span of Cur device is four years.Thus the thought that the program should have an a88e88ment whether the users and the service providers are aware of the recommended life of the device and whether the expired devices are being removed was found to be very timely.

{"title": "Public spending on human capital formation and economic growth in Pakistan\n", "abstract": " The differences in growth among the countries initially mainly considered the availability of physical capital stock. However, after the seminal work of Lucas (1988), Romer (1990) and Mankiw, Romer and Weil (1992), the role of human capital in economic growth has become widely accepted, along with the physical capital stock. Human capital stock is determined through education, health, research and development, and training. However, it is still being debated as to which factor is most efficient and effective with regard to human capital accumulation. Another burning issue pertains to the role of public investment. The effectiveness of public investment on private investment and consequently on growth is widely discussed in economic literature. The classical school of thought is of the view that increments in public spending reduces economic growth by crowding out private investment, as higher spending requires higher taxes at individual and corporate levels, which create a distortion in the choice of economic agents. The Keynesians, on the other hand, consider government spending as a key variable for economic growth. They argue that government development expenditures on health, education, and infrastructure increase labour productivity and reduce the cost of conducting business, which spurs gross private domestic investment.In Pakistan, the public sector is intended to play an effective and efficient role with regard to economic growth and the welfare of the society. In pursuance of these objectives, the Government is trying to improve infrastructure and energy generation and distribution, and promote the establishment of health and\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["12"]}

As it is so popular, Olive can play an important role in the economy of a country and thus best practices can increase production per plant. Therefore, an attempt has been made to test the effect of three grafting times (June, July and August) and olive cultivars (Frantoio, Moresca, Biancolella and Leccino) on the production of Italian olives. The study was carried out at Agriculture Research Institute Tarnab, Peshawar-Pakistan during the summer of 2012. The various growth parameters (such as, sprouting percentage, number of sprouts, sprout length, number of leaves and days to sprout) were recorded from the time after grafting. The highest number of sprouts, sprouting percentage and days to sprout was observed in plants grafted in July, whereas, the maximum length of sprouts and leaves per sprout was noticed in plants grafted in June. Plants of Biancolella cultivar grafted in August took fewer days to sprout compared to other treatments. In general the Italian olive cultivar, Frantoio performed well among the other cultivars and hence concluded that Frantoio is a good scion to be grafted in July in Peshawar-Pakistan.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["12"]}

In the present study thirty dahi samples were investigated for bacteriocin producing L. bulgaricus. Fourteen different isolates were obtained and five were scrutinized for antibacterial activities against food born pathogens. Amongst, a strain TLB06FT was found to have a wide array of antibacterial activities against Gram positive and negative bacteria was selected for further characterization. Growth media optimization for this strain revealed maximum bacteriocin production on MRS media supplemented with glucose (2%), sodium chloride (1%), Tween-80 (0.5%) and yeast extract (1%). In addition, optimization of growth conditions revealed maximum bacteriocin production at pH 5.5 and temperature of 30-37oC. Bacteriocin showed thermo stability at 90oC and remained highly active in the pH range of 3.5-7.5, inactive by protein catalyzing enzymes and showed no change in activity (800AUmL-1) when treated with organic solvents and surfactants. The obtained bacteriocin was purified to 1600AU mL-1 by ammonium sulfate precipitation (80%) by using dialyzing tubing. In the same way, a single peak was obtained by RP-HPLC having antibacterial activity of 6400AU mL-1.

It basically explores the latest improvements in self-determination theory as to why consumers develop strong attachments to human brands. Human brand refers to any well known personality who is the subject of marketing communication efforts. Survey has been done through questionnaires and autonomy as well as relatedness needs of the consumers have been identified. Results suggest that when a human brand enhances and fulfills the autonomy and relatedness needs of the consumers, consumers develop a strong attachment to the human brand. The results also imply that organizations will also be benefitted such as entertainment firms and political parties that establish direct interaction between human brands and consumers. Also, much of the success of the media and entertainment industry depends upon the strong relationships between the consumers and human brands.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["12"]}

The rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) in the brainstem integrates a variety of functions, including pain modulation and pain perception. In the present study, we investigated the effect of temporary inactivation of RVM on stress-induced analgesia. Methods: This study was performed using adult male Wistar rats (200-250 gr). Swim stress was induced using a cylinder filled with water (50 cm height, 20\u251c\u00e9\u252c\u25921\u251c\u00e9\u252c\u2591C) in which the rats were kept for 3 min. For induction of pain, 50 \u251c\u00c4\u252c\u255dL of 2 formalin was injected subcutaneously in the hind paw. For temporary inactivation of RVM, 0.5 \u251c\u00c4\u252c\u255dL of 2 lidocaine was injected into RVM. Results: Injection of lidocaine into RVM, before inducing swim stress, potentiated the anti-nociceptive effects of swim stress in phase 1 and phase 2A. In phase 2B swim stresses increased nociceptive scores of formalin test; so administration of lidocaine into RVM inhibited the effect of swim stress. Conclusion: The result of this study demonstrated that temporal inactivation of RVM by lidocaine potentiated stress-induced analgesia.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["12"]}

The daily rate of water application was 8 mm. Therefore, the amount/irrigation was 64 and 96 mm for W1 and W2 respectively. The irrigation treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replications. The measured parameters were fresh and dry weights of the fodder, leaf/stem ratio and the actual water used by the crop (Etcrop) between two successive cuts. The calculated values were crop water use efficiency (WUE), field water use efficiency (FWUE) and the crop factor (kc). The results showed that the fresh and dry weights and leaf/stem ratio under W1 were greater than those under W2 for both irrigation systems, with superiority of these parameters under drip irrigation. WUE and FWUE under W1 with drip irrigation were always higher than those of W2 with sprinkler irrigation.

It is essential for Malaysia to adopt the IWRM concept in managing its water resources to overcome the usual flash flood and water shortages in its major cities. In this regard the State of Selangor of Malaysia, being the most industrialised and highly populated state in Malaysia, has taken up the challenge for implementing IWRM for its river basins. This is done by establishing an agency called the Selangor Water Management Authority (SWMA) which will act as a single institution responsible to manage water resources, river basins and coastal zone in an integrated and sustainable manner. Being the first of its kind among all states in Malaysia, this pioneering model, if successful, will be the perfect model for all states in Malaysia to implement IWRM and to overcome the usual water related problems in the country. Be that as it may, the successfulness of the agency to mobilize IWRM in Selangor remains in doubt after a decade in administration.

Currently, private sector (320 multinational, national and generic pesticide companies) is actively engaged in extension activities in the Punjab. The sector is bound to provide extension services to the farmers in addition to selling pesticide products. In the present study, Narayana\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s Lotus Model was adopted to assess the strengths and weaknesses of competencies possessed by extension workers of private extension system. A cross-sectional research design was used for the study in Punjab province. Simple random sampling technique was used for the selection of respondents. Sixty (60) respondents (private extension field staff) from selected multinational pesticide company (Syngenta) were personally interviewed with the help of pre-tested and validated research instrument. Results show that mean values of professional competencies of private agricultural extension workers regarding knowledge, attitude, skills and attributes were 3.68, 3.82, 3.84 and 3.73 with standard deviation of 0.47, 0.39, 0.38 and 0.49, respectively. This means that competencies possessed by extension workers of private sector (Syngenta) were perceived in the range of strength and great strength on the likert scale.

We present an analytical expression of the spectrum of acceleration fluctuations of the test-masses of the interferometer in terms of the experimentally obtainable spectrum of pressure fluctuations.

The succession starts with the Hazara Formation, which contains complete and incomplete Bouma sequences suggesting its deposition in deep marine turbidite settings. The overlying Tanawal Formation, rich in massive sandstone, shale and siltstone, was deposited in shallow marine conditions, as indicated by the presence of parallel lamination, large scale tabular, trough cross-and hummocky cross-stratifications. The Tanawal Formation facies shift laterally from proximal (south-southeast) to distal (north-northwest). The glaciogenic Tanaki Boulder Bed, overlying the Tanawal Formation, was deposited during the Maronian glaciation. It is equivalent to the Blaini Formation of India, and to the Sinian diamictites of South China. The Abbottabad Formation of Cambrian age overlies the Tanaki Boulder Bed, and is composed of dolomite, chert nodules and phosphate-rich packages; similar successions are documented in India and South China at the same stratigraphical interval. The similarities of the Neoproterozoic successions of Lesser Himalaya (both in Pakistan and India) and South China suggests their possible proximity during the break-up of Rodinia and the assembly of the Gondwana Supercontinent.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["12"]}

The area is unexplored with respect to distribution of SOC stock. Furthermore, SOC distribution factors like altitude, slope aspect, vegetation, deforestation and depth of soil remain unclear. In the present study SOC stock and bulk density in three depths were determined in 10-sites of forest under different altitude (2787-3600 m), slope aspect (north and south facing slope) and vegetation types on the mountainous forest of Bagrot valley, North Karakorum, Gilgit-Baltistan. The results showed that SOC stock and bulk density varied significantly with respect to altitude, aspect, vegetation and depths (p< 0.05). SOC stocks correlated positively with the altitude but negatively with bulk density, depth and pH. Mean SOC at north facing slope was comparatively higher than the south facing slope. The highest SOC stock was observed in Rakhan forest site at altitude 3460 m located at north facing slope and dominated by dense Betula utilis (Birch) vegetation. Similarly, the lowest SOC stock was found at the Gasonar forest site covered by Juniperous excels vegetation, where severely deforested was observed. The variation in SOC stocks were mainly due to the increasing precipitation and decreasing temperature and pH with altitude, which resulted in decreased litter decomposition. In addition to altitude the vegetation, soil depth and deforestation also significantly effect on SOC stock.

{"title": "Chemotherapy of Karnal bunt of wheat: A Review\n", "abstract": " Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is the main staple food crop and major source of nutrition for the people of Pakistan. Many factors contribute to low yield in Pakistan, diseases being one of them. Karnal bunt (partial bunt) of wheat caused by Tilletia indica (Mitra) Mundkur, causes considerable losses in the yield of wheat. The disease not only reduces the weight of grains, but also deteriorates its quality and makes it unacceptable for human and animal consumption. The pathogen infects the ovaries in the emerging wheat heads and converts the grains partially or completely into dark colored powdery masses of teliospores. The diseased fields emit a foul smell like that of rotten fish due to production of trimethylamine. Karnal bunt can reduce wheat yields. Karnal bunt differs from other diseases of wheat in that the pathogen infects plants during anthesis and it sporulates on the same generation of the host which it infects. Neither all spikes of plant nor all grains in spike are affected by the disease and usually a few irregularly distributed kernels are bunted. Its spores remain viable in soil for a long period. Teliospores are very resistant to adverse environmental conditions. Although many control strategies have been suggested for the management of karnal bunt disease and the strategies include seed treatment with hot water and solar energy, seed treatment with fungicides and soil drenching with fungicides, however, the results were not convincing. The cheapest and the most feasible method of Karnal bunt control is the use of host resistance and breeding for varieties resistant to karnal bunt disease.

{"title": "Parenting Practices and Well Being Outcome in Young Adulthood.\n", "abstract": " This research investigated the consequences of early parenting practices on well-being during adulthood. We hypothesized: a) parental care would be correlated with psychological well-being variables of psychological strain and self-esteem; and b) parental over-protection would be correlated with the variables of psychological well-being (psychological strain and self-esteem). For this purpose, we solicited 67 men and 83 women within an age range of 18 to 25 (M= 21.20, SD= 1.90). The Parental Bonding Instrument,(PBI: Parker, Tupling, & Brown, 1979), General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12; Goldberg, 1972) and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE: Rosenberg 1965) were used to assess the early parenting practices, psychological strain and self-esteem, respectively. A Pearson Product Moment correlation of coefficient was calculated to assess the relationship among the variables. Results suggested that parental care was significantly negatively correlated with psychological strain (r=-. 26, p<. 01) and significantly positively correlated with self-esteem (r=. 38, p<. 01); whereas parental over-protection was significantly positively correlated with psychological strain (r=. 30, p<. 01) and significantly negatively correlated with self-esteem (r=-. 34, p<. 01). The findings indicated that parental affection, emotional warmth and empathy serve as a guard against psychological vulnerability for young adults and hence enhance their self-esteem, however, intrusion, and parental over-control develop a sense of worthlessness, low self-esteem and psychological strain among individuals.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["12"]}
{"title": "Heavy downpour event over upper Sindh in September, 2012\n", "abstract": " This study mainly focuses on the phenomenon of heavy downpour rainfall event which stuck up in the upper Sindh in September, 2012. High resolution regional model (HRM), developed by DWD (National Meteorological Service of Germany), output and National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Reanalysis data along with satellite imagery are used for the post analysis of this downpour. The analysis illustrates that the heavy rainfall occurred over the upper parts of Sindh was due to the orientation of monsoon currents. The monsoon currents penetrated deeper in latitude than normal due to variation in Tibetan high, Somalia\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s Jet and local prevailing condition in upper Sindh and Balochistan. A very prolonged hot condition of the region caused the maximum temperature to reach to 5 C as there was no precipitation for last three months over upper parts of Sindh. Comparatively more drier and hot condition than normal intensified a seasonal low than its normal intensity. A low pressure system developed over Bay of Bengal (BoB) passed over central India and entered in Pakistan on 9th September, 2012, afterwards the seasonal low over Balochistan helped it in intensifying and a strong Somalia\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s Jet acted as source of moisture supply from Bay of Bengal.

The open channel contains a weir-like obstruction with different leeward slopes. Two discharge values have been used under subcritical flow conditions. The objective of the present study is to investigate the flow behavior behind a vegetated obstacle. The characteristics explored included the turbulent kinetic energy and recirculation zone behind the vegetated obstacles. It was observed from this work that the TKE has higher values in recirculation regions. On the other hand it was also found to be of high intensity in the vegetated zones of the flow. However TKE was maximum and positive close to the bed at a section at the end of the weir crest and it was negative below the top of the vegetation dowels. As far as recirculation region was concerned, it was observed that the vegetation had no effect on the recirculation zone behind the vegetated weir. In case of weir with mild downstream slope (1: 7), the flow separation zone vanished and the energy head loss in this case decreased due to the decrease in form drag of the weir.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["12"]}

It is grown in different cropping systems, such as cotton-wheat, rice-wheat, sugarcane-wheat, maize-wheat, and fallow-wheat. Currently, only 20% of wheat is being planted at optimum planting time (15th October to 15th November). Improved tillage and crop establishment methods present real potential for improving the sustainability and productivity. Shifting towards new interventions of resource conservation and exploitation of available resources is therefore, necessary for enhancing wheat productivity. Delayed harvesting of summer crops with the consequent late planting of wheat; less or no access of the farming community to improved inputs like seed, non-judicious use of fertilizers, less or no control of weeds, inappropriate use of irrigation water, drought stress in rainfed areas, no care of the soil degradation and inefficient and ineffective extension services are some of the major reasons for low and instable productivity of wheat. Use of modern technologies like laser land levelling, zero tillage through happy/combo seeder, bed planting of wheat, crop residue management and wheat straw chopper may be helpful in the time lost between the harvesting of kharif crops and sowing of wheat. By reducing this interval wheat can be sown earlier and yield reduction can be avoided. In addition to these modern technologies, use of early maturing varieties of kharif crops may also be beneficial to achieve in time sowing of wheat crop.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["12"]}

This study was conducted in Kuwait University Hospital between February 2004 to March 2006. The excision was under local anesthesia using an operating microscope with rotation autograft taken from upper temporal bulbar conjunctiva by total excision, and free transposition to the bare sclera. We treated 38 eyes by 900 rotation, 15 eyes by 00 rotation, and 21 eyes by 1800 rotation.Results: With a one-year follow-up, the recurrence rates (regrowth of the pterygium more than 1 mm over the cornea) were 3% in 900 rotation, 28.6% in 00 rotation, and 15.8% in 1800 rotation (p= 0.033). The overall recurrence rate for all rotation autograft surgeries was 10.8%.Conclusion: In this study, all techniques were effective, and 900 rotation autograft is safe and an easy procedure to perform for management of pterygium, with a lower recurrence rate compared with the 00 and 1800 rotation autograft (p= 0.033).

The current study was aimed at the characterization of wheat genotypes for their heat tolerance in yield and yield related traits. Sixteen wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes including two check cultivars (Saleem-2000 and Bakhtawar-2000) were sown in the field of Nuclear Institute for Food and Agriculture, Peshawar, Pakistan on 15 November (normal) and 13 December (late Sowing) for two consecutive years (2003-2004 and 2004-2005). Two years data was pooled and subjected to statistical analysis. Mean square values indicated that difference between years, seasons and genotypes were highly significant at P less than or equal to 0.01 probability levels whereas differential responses were observed for interactions. Minimum differences were observed for tillers m2 (51 tillers), spike length (0.3 cm), grains per spike (00), grain weight per spike (0.2 g), 1000-grain weight (2.2 g) and grain yield per ha (0.68 tons) in late sowing in comparison to the normal sowings. Genotype CT-7 exceeded for spike length and grain weight per spike and CT-10 was better for 1000-grain weight in late sowings than normal sowings whereas CT-7 produced similar number of grain per spike in both sowings indicating that these genotypes have intrinsic potential for higher yields in terminal heat stress.

Such plants are a few in Pakistan at present, but likely to rise in future because of the importance of treating sewage water, before it is dumped in water bodies. In developed countries, sewage sludge is preferably applied on forest and agricultural land as soil amendment instead of burning it or throwing it in oceans or rivers. The present study was carried out at the research farm of the University of Arid Agriculture, Rawalpindi, during 1998 and 1999, to evaluate the usefulness of sewage sludge of the Islamabad Sewage Treatment Plant, as a soil amendment. Field experiments, under rain-fed conditions, were conducted on maize and the sewage sludge was compared with poultry litter, farmyard manure, and chemical fertilizers. The treatments consisted of. control, NP at the rate of 90-60 kg ha-1, farm yard manure (FYM) at the rate of 20 Mg ha-1 poultry litter (PL) at the rate of 20 Mg ha-1, sewage sludge (SS) at the rate of 20 Mg ha-1, 1/2 FYM+ 1/2 NP, 1/2 PL+ 1/2 NP, and SS+ 1/2 NP, of the above given rates of each.

Using a general Lagrangian formulation, the dynamics model of the system is derived, and the results are summarized in an explicit dynamics model of multiple manipulator space free-flyers. The system dynamics is also formulated on the basis of choosing Euler parameters for orientation representation. This selection introduces algebraic constraints to the system, and the Natural Orthogonal Complement Method is applied to obtain independent system of equations of motion. Two model-based control algorithms, based on an Euler angle and an Euler parameter description of the orientation, are developed that allow coordinated control of the manipulators and the spacecraft, to track the planned trajectories. These trajectories ensure smooth operation, and reduce disturbances on the spacecraft and on the object just before grasping. The performance of the two model-based algorithms is compared to that of a transposed Jacobian controller, by a 3-D simulation. It is shown that both model-based algorithms result in smaller errors, as long as model uncertainties are limited. However, the Euler angle model-based control algorithm (MB1) presents the inconvenience of representational singularities at some orientations, while the one based on Euler parameters (MB2) overcomes this problem.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["12"]}

Each node stores and maintains more or less accurate information of its direct neighbors in a table. However, due to high mobility vehicles and traffic congestion the stored neighbors information is quickly outdated, failure notification increases significantly, and leading sub-optimal path. Furthermore, the transmission of periodic \u0393\u00c7\u00a3hello\u0393\u00c7\u00a5 messages and table maintenance consume resources, which is not suitable for sensitive VANET. In this paper, we propose a geographical forwarding mechanism based on Multi-criteria Receiver Self-Election (MRSE) scheme to find best next hop without sending the periodic \u0393\u00c7\u00a3hello\u0393\u00c7\u00a5 messages and maintaining neighbors information in the table. The selection of best next hop is based on the multi-criteria waiting function. In this function, the four key parameters including link life time, optimal distance from sender to receiver, optimal transmission range, and received power are determined to enable the next candidate node to make packet forwarding decisions. The simulation results show that the MRSE scheme performs up to 22% better in terms of packet delivery ratio as compared to some existing schemes. In terms of average delay, MRSE scheme performs best, with as much as 81% decrease compared to some existing schemes.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["12"]}

The Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is enveloped, negative sense ssRNA, and has non\u0393\u00c7\u00f4segmented genome of length 15156 bases (Millar and Emmerson, 1988). Based on pathogenicity, three classes of NDV namely lentogenic (apathogenic), mesogenic (intermediate), and velogenic (highly pathogenic) are recognized (Hanson, 1988). However, based on the hypervariable region of the fusion gene, the NDV can be divided into two main classes, I and II. The class II of NDV is further divided into I\u0393\u00c7\u00f4XI genotypes (Zhang et al., 2011). The group VI and VII can further be subdivided into sub\u0393\u00c7\u00f4genotypes VIa to VI\u0393\u00c7\u00f4h (Biagini et al., 1999; Herczeg et al., 1999) and VIIa to VII\u0393\u00c7\u00f4f (Munir et al., 2012).

These bacteria can be found in the gut of both warm and cold-blooded organisms. Fecal coliform is a subset of this group. They have been characterized to grow at elevated temperatures and specifically associated with the fecal material of warm-blooded animals. Gilgit River was evaluated using coliforms (total coliform and fecal coliform) as indicators, in relation with physicochemical parameters such as biological oxygen demand (BOD), conductivity, dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrate, ph, phosphate, salinity, temperature, total dissolved solids (TDS) and total suspended solids (TSS). Monthly sampling was conducted from November 2011 to April 2012 in the upstream, midstream and downstream sections of the river. The multiple tube fermentation technique was used for the analysis of coliforms. FC values showed significant spatial variation (p= 0.004) which could be ascribed to a lower level of biological pollutants in the upstream however, the difference in values across time was not significant. This implies that the river water was severely polluted at the time of sampling. The coliform bacteria did not show significant correlations (p> 0.05) with the physicochemical factors. A negative relationship was noted between coliforms with pH, DO and nitrate. This could be ascribed to the presence of organic pollutants coming from domestic and industrial discharges.* Corresponding Author: Salar Ali\u0393\u00a3\u00eb salar. ali.@ kiu. edu. pk", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["12"]}

Two maize hybrids namely Monsanto-6789 and Pioneer-30Y87 were tested using different fertilizer rates viz., F1 (200: 100: 90 kg NPK ha-1), F2 (250: 125: 110 kg NPK ha-1), F3 (300: 150: 130 kg NPK ha-1) and F4 (350: 175: 150 kg NPK ha-1). Treatments were arranged in randomized complete block design under factorial arrangement replicated thrice. Results revealed that increasing the level of fertilizer up till F3 enhanced the crop yield and its related attributes. Maximum 1000-grains weight (255.4 g), grain yield (6.9 t ha-1) and biological yield (20.97 t ha-1) were observed in F3 (300: 150: 130 kg NPK ha-1).

Based on previous findings, A. flavus can be divided into two groups,(i) isolates that can synthesize AFB1, and (ii) isolates unable to produce AFB1. The aim of this study was to assess whether AFB1 can be used as a marker to differentiate clinical and non-clinical isolates of A. flavus. Representative clinical isolates were obtained from patients while non-clinical isolates were obtained from the environment. Isolates were identified as A. flavus using selective media. AFB1 production was assessed through cultural assays and genes for aflatoxin production, aflR and aflS, were amplified using PCR. Conditioned media and methanol extract of A. flavus isolates were prepared and tested for AFB1 presence using Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS). Additionally, conditioned media and extract were tested for their cytotoxic effects on primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) and immortalized human heptaoma cells (Huh7). Both clinical and non-clinical isolates of A. flavus exhibited aflatoxin production, albeit some clinical isolates produced excessive AFB1 (up to 15785 ng/mL). Importantly, A. flavus isolates produced higher levels of AFB1, exhibited increased host cell cytotoxicity, whereas strains exhibiting negligible amount of aflatoxin exhibited minimal cytotoxic effects suggesting AFB1 as a marker for pathogenic potential of A. flavus.

A number of drugs including proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor antagonists are available for the treatment of peptic ulcer, but these drugs has shown incidence of relapses, side effects, and drug interactions. Thus the development of new antiulcer drugs and the search for novel molecules has been extended to herbal drugs that offer better protection and decreased relapse. Medicinal plants provide an effective and safer way in disease management. Many medicinal plants exhibit antiulcer activity and found useful in the treatment of peptic ulcer. Physalis minima has shown antiinflammatory and analgesic action in animals. In this present work, anti-ulcer effect of different extracts of Physalis minima was studied in NSAIDs induced ulcer model in albino rats. The extract at dose of 200,400 mg/kg produced significant inhibition of gastric lesion induced by NSAIDs induced ulcer. The extract reduced ulcerative lesion. The result obtained suggesting that extract possesses significant anti-ulcer activity.INTRODUCTION: Peptic ulcer is an excoriated area of the gastric or duodenal mucosa caused by action of the gastric juice. It is a chronic and recurrent disease, and is the most predominant of the gastrointestinal diseases 1. It is generally recognized that peptic ulcer is caused by a lack of equilibrium between the gastric aggressive factors and the mucosal defensive factors 2. Gastric ulcer is among the most serious diseases in the world. It is a major health problem with multifactorial etiology.

{"title": "Flow over weir-like obstacles\n", "abstract": " For an accurate prediction of the water levels during flood events, it is important to account for the important processes that contribute to the flow resistance. A significant portion of the energy loss is found in the flow over weir-like obstacles which get submerged at high water stages. In addition to the bed friction that is found everywhere, the rapidly varying flow over, for examples groynes, access roads, and summer embankments complicates the proper estimation of the conveyance capacity. It becomes even more complicated when the elevated parts of the bed are covered with high vegetation in the form of bushes or trees. The flow that is already accelerated above the crest of the groyne or dyke experience a further acceleration passing between the vegetation. In case of high water the resistance of a river reach is for an important part governed by the bed forms and obstacles in the floodplain. The obstacles can consist of groynes, summer dykes, bridge piers, ditches, bushes etc.It is especially related during extreme river discharges for which the design height of winter dykes is derived and for which costly operations are planned, often based on model (Numerical models) predictions. Measures that will significantly change the flow in a certain river reach can by definition not be calibrated for in advance. Validity of current systems is limited especially where it concerns the underlying physics of rapidly varying non-hydrostatic flows. Yet, extensive calibration has made the systems reasonably accurate for current situations, but it is obscuring the deficiencies in modelling approach.

The amount of encoded information needed to generate and manipulate these structures is poorly understood. Investigating the dynamics of spontaneous pattern formation in non-biological systems provides insights to the physio-chemical phenomena that biological systems must have harnessed for living systems and that modern scientists need to understand for complex nano-technological applications. Here we show that highly complex, precipitation patterns similar to those found in biological systems can be formed in simple Cu(II)-oxalate systems. In these Cu(II)-oxalate systems, structures are constructed by a hierarchy of multiple processes that are precisely self-organized in space and time to form interconnected causal networks that generate complex and diverse structures dependent on construction trajectories that can be controlled by minor variations of initial conditions. Highly complex precipitation patterns similar to those found in biological systems can be generated without a correspondingly complex set of instructions. Our result has implications for understanding early biotic systems that existed prior to the evolution of sophisticated genetic machinery. From an applications perspective, processes and structures that occur spontaneously are the building blocks for novel system chemistry based technologies where products are self-constructed.

The foundation of the proposed technique is to approximate the likelihood function by a matrix normal-Wishart distribution on the parameter space. Based on the approximated likelihood function, the marginal posterior probability mass function of the model order is developed in an analytic convenient form. Then it is possible to easily evaluate the posterior probabilities of the model order and choose the order at which the posterior mass function attains its maximum to be the identified order. A simulation study, with 3 different priors, was conducted to demonstrate the idea of using the proposed Bayesian technique and check its adequacy in handling the identification problem.

Equalization techniques both in time domain and frequency domain are used to suppress the effects of reverberations at the receiver. However, time domain techniques have higher complexity. Frequency domain Equalization involves the use of cyclic prefix in between the guard intervals. This makes the channel matrix circular for which simple frequency domain equalization techniques could be used. For Wavelet Packet based multi carrier modulated system FDE cannot be applied due to the absence of guard intervals. Therefore overlap FDE has been used for multicarrier modulation systems.

{"title": "Typhoid fever: aspects of environment, host and pathogen interaction\n", "abstract": " In a surveillance study in Jakarta, Indonesia, 88 typhoid and 26 paratyphoid fever patients were identified by blood culture. Risk factors for transmission of typhoid fever were mainly intra-household factors (poor hand-washing hygiene, recent household contacts), whereas paratyphoid was mainly contracted through street food. In an additional study, street vendors observed poorer hand-washing and food-handling hygiene compared to food handlers in restaurants, and had higher bacterial loads in dishwater. Further host factor-studies in (para)typhoid patients revealed that polymorphisms in genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-_, IL1A/B, IL1R1, TNFRSF1A, CASP1 and CRP) were not associated with susceptibility to typhoid fever, and might therefore at most be associated with severity of disease. An association was found of typhoid fever and a polymorphism in the PARK2/PACRG proteasome-mediated protein degradation pathway through ubiquitination, similar to infection with Mycobacterium leprae. Also an association between genotypes in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (the affected protein in Cystic Fibrosis) and susceptibility to typhoid fever was found, suggesting a decreased adherence potential of S. typhi to intestinal mucosal cells with these polymorphisms. Finally, bacterial characteristics were compared by use of AFLP and biochemical/antibiotic susceptibility profiles, showing very homogeneous S. typhi and S. paratyphi A strains circulating in the study area.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["12"]}

Sorghum (S) and groundnut (G) were mixed in row proportions of 1: 1 (S1G1), 2: 1 (S2G1) and 1: 2 (S1G2), plus sole sorghum as control (S1). The experiments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replicates. The results of soil analysis, by the end of the second growing season as compared to their values by the end of the first season, showed that (S1G2) treatment gave the lowest PH (6.53) and the highest nitrogen (0.054%) and organic matter (0.68%) percentages and consequently an increase in electrical conductivity (0.21 dsm-1). Whereas, the sole sorghum (S1) showed the lowest values for nitrogen (0.063% and 0.032%), organic matter (0.66 and 0.47%) and electrical conductivity (0.08 and 0. 12 dsm-1) and the highest pH (0.686 and 7.12) by the end of the first and second seasons, respectively. The results also showed no significant differences between treatments in sorghum head length during both growing seasons, and in 1000-grain weight, number of productive tillers/plant, dry matter weight and total grain yield during the second poorly-distributed rainfall season (2007), whereas, the differences were significant (P\u0393\u00eb\u00f1 0.05) during the first well-distributed rainfall season (2006).

In such lasers, fibre core diameter is an important consideration in deploying a beam delivery system. Using a smaller core diameter fibre allows higher irradiances at focus position, less degradation of beam quality, and a larger stand-off distance. In this work, we have put efforts to efficiently deliver the laser output of \u0393\u00c7\u00ffceramic reflector\u0393\u00c7\u00d6-based long pulse Nd:YAG laser through a 200 \u256c\u255dm core diameter optical fibre and successfully delivered up to 60 J of pulse energy with 90% transmission efficiency, using a GRADIUM (axial gradient) plano-convex lens to sharply focus down the beam on the end face of the optical fibre and fibre end faces have been cleaved to achieve higher surface damage thresholds.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["12"]}

{"title": "The jigsaw of resource description framework (RDF) and topic maps serialization formats: A survey\n", "abstract": " The dawn of the 21st century saw the emergence of a number of technologies which not only revolutionized human lives but also opened new avenues of research. Semantic Web technology is one of the technologies which attracted tremendous research attention around the globe. To successfully implement Semantic Web, technologies have been developed to effectively represent, create, and navigate metadata relationship among the Web resources. Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Topic Maps (TMs) emerged as the leading technologies of the newly envisioned Semantic Web. RDF and TMs are independent technologies using different mechanisms to represent semantic relationships between the Web resources. A number of serialization formats have been investigated by the researchers in the past few years for successful storage and transmission of RDF and TMs data. However, different representation mechanisms and serialization formats result into the problem of interoperability, potentially resulting in the division of the Semantic Web into two islands. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the available serialization formats of RDF and TMs by categorizing, analysing, and evaluating them using a set of criteria. For evaluation purpose, simple book ontology is developed in both RDF and TMs formats. It has been observed that serialization formats vary in different aspects but are powerful enough to encode their respective data models and the interoperability among them is possible, subject to some additional effort. This investigation provides a compact platform for researchers to solve the interoperability problem\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["12"]}

{"title": "Can herbicide stress in artichoke (Cynara cardunculus) be detected by chlorophyll fluorescence?\n", "abstract": " Artichoke leaves contain a high percentage of polyphenols that are used for certain medicinal purposes. Due to wide row spaces and slow plant development during early growth stages, there is a high risk of weed infestation in field cultivation of artichoke. Post emergence herbicides used for weed control may also affect the non target crop by a temporary or permanent stress. Abiotic stress in crops may be detected by certain parameters like measurement of chlorophyll fluorescence after the application of herbicides. A field experiment was carried out at the research station Giessen, Germany during 2008 to study the possibility of herbicide stress detection in artichoke by measuring chlorophyll fluorescence. Eight post-emergence herbicides ie, Phenmedipham, Pyridate, Quizalofop-P, Prosulfocarb, Carfentrazone, Rimsulfuron, Aclonifen and Clomazone were used in comparison with a mechanically weeded control. Fluorescence yield of light and dark adapted leaves showed that Clomazone affected chlorophyll fluorescence at one day after herbicide application and the effect went on increasing followed by that of Aclonifen and Rimsulfuron (appeared one week after herbicide application). These adverse effects started decreasing from three weeks after application of herbicides and were almost normal (compared with that of control) at four weeks after herbicide application during first growth phase, whereas these showed no recovery during second growth phase. Experimental study led to the conclusion that different post-emergence herbicides, depending on their mode of action, affect leaf yield of artichoke and chlorophyll fluorescence\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["12"]}

{"title": "Calculation of Power Efficiency of Installed Photovoltaic (PV) Solar Panels at Different Temperatures-A Test Case\n", "abstract": " Pakistan is an energy deficient country, where a large fraction of the population still does not have access to modern day energy services such as electricity. This is due to very limited fossil fuel resources and poor economy, which restrains the import of fossil fuels on a large scale. To overcome energy shortage, Pakistan needs to develop its indigenous energy resources like hydropower, solar and wind. Pakistan lies in an area of one of the highest solar insulation in the world. All this will help in both reducing the import of fossil fuels and dependency of people on fuel wood, which in turn will provide some respite for the dwindling forest reserves of Pakistan. Accordingly, the status and outlook of solar energy use in Pakistan is discussed. In addition, the role of Rand D organizations in the promotion of solar energy technologies in Pakistan is also presented including a description of some proposed projects. It is concluded that the current infrastructure has not been able to advance the status of solar energy in Pakistan. Significant efforts are needed to effectively utilize this cheap renewable energy source.

{"title": "Energy-Momentum Distribution of Non-Static Plane Symmetric Spacetimes in General Relativity and Teleparallel Theory\n", "abstract": " Among all the available theories of gravitation in the literature, the theory of general relativity (GR) is considered as a standard theory of gravitation, due to the fact that many physical aspects of nature have been verified experimentally in this theory. However, the problem of localization of energy and momentum in GR is still most controversial [1]. A number of scientists have attempted to resolve this issue and gave their own definitions. As a pioneer, Einstein [2] gave an energy-momentum prescription for the localization of energy and momentum. Following him, many scientists, including Landau and Lifshitz [3], M\u251c\u2555ller [4], Bergmann and Thomson [5], Tolman [6], and Weinberg [7], gave their own energy-momentum prescriptions. To explore energy, the use of Cartesian coordinates are necessary for these prescriptions except for M\u251c\u2555ller\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s prescription, which is independent of the coordinate system. Misner et al.[1] proved that the energy can be localized in a spherical coordinate system. After a short time, Cooperstock and Sarracino [8] proved that if the energy can be localized in a spherical system then it can be localized in any other coordinate system.

An unfairness problem occurs in DiffServ networks, however: fairness deteriorate as the number of aggregates increases in the network. Researchers have thus, created various algorithms to overcome fairness deterioration. This article studies a packet marker based on a Time Sliding Window (TSW) and proposes a new hybrid marker algorithm to improve bandwidth fairness on DiffServ networks by providing a proportional fair share of excess network bandwidth among TCP aggregates. The simulation experiments have compared the new hybrid marker algorithm to various algorithms using NS-2. The results show that the proposed hybrid marker is sensitive not only to the number of flows in the aggregate but also to the number of aggregates in the network. \u252c\u2310 2012 Academic Journals Inc.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["12"]}

This was achieved by electrostatic immobilization of creatinine deiminase (CD) on the surface of the ZnO NWs followed by applying a chitosan membrane in conjunction with glutaraldehyde. This immobilization resulted in a sensitive, selective, stable, reproducible and fast creatinine biosensor. The potentiometric response of the ZnO sensor vs. Ag/AgCl reference electrode was found to be linear over a wide logarithmic concentration of creatinine electrolyte solution ranging from 1-1000 \u252c\u2561M. The sensor illustrates good linear sensitivity slope curve of~ 33.9 mV/decade along with a rapid response time of~ 7 s. Furthermore, the sensor response was unaffected by normal concentrations of common interferences such as potassium, calcium, magnesium, sodium, copper ions and glucose.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["12"]}

{"title": "A methodology to counter DoS attacks in mobile IP communication\n", "abstract": " Similar to wired communication, Mobile IP communication is susceptible to various kinds of attacks. Of these attacks, Denial of Service (DoS) attack is considered as a great threat to mobile IP communication. The number of approaches hitherto proposed to prevent DoS attack in the area of mobile IP communication is much less compared to those for the wired domain and mobile ad hoc networks. In this work, the effects of Denial of Service attack on mobile IP communication are analyzed in detail. We propose to use packet filtering techniques that work in different domains and base stations of mobile IP communication to detect suspicious packets and to improve the performance. If any packet contains a spoofed IP address which is created by DoS attackers, the proposed scheme can detect this and then filter the suspected packet.

According to its high prevalence in Iran, using a diagnostic procedure with more rapid result than culture, more sensitive and specific than smear and near to culture can help us to diagnose and treat the disease rapidly and accurately, and thus control it in the community. So we decided to evaluate PCR for the diagnosis of Tuberculosis in Broncho-alveolar Lavage (BAL) and compare it with smear.Methods: Patients who were admitted at Hazrat Rasoul Akram Hospital during 2 years of 2010-11 with the impression of tuberculosis and underwent bronchoscopy were included. Their BAL was sent for smear, culture and PCR for tuberculosis diagnosis. Data were analyzed by mean and standard deviation and p Value under 0.05 was considered significant.Results: Forty seven patients with probable pulmonary tuberculosis underwent bronchoscopy. BAL cultures were positive in 6 (12.8%) patients, smears in 5 (10.6%) patients and PCR in 3 (6.4%) patients. According to this result smear had 83% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% PPV and 98% NPV. However PCR had 50% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% PPV and 93% NPV.Conclusion: Although PCR is a rapid and new tool for TB diagnosis, smear-which is an older way is simpler has lower cost and is feasible in all points of Iran and still is a better method for TB diagnosis.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["12"]}

Based on this mechanism a node cannot transmit until the medium is free. Collision can occur if two or more stations within each other's transmission range transmit simultaneously. To overcome this problem several solutions have been proposed, for instance Request To Send/Clear To Send (RTS/CTS) mechanism, through which the channel is reserved for a specified time period known as Network Allocation Vector (NAV). Although this mechanism provide all the nodes to share the medium fairly but it is observed that this mechanism can lead to bandwidth underutilization, especially in networks with higher packet delivery failure rates.

The method consists of generation, measurement, and processing of dispersive elastic waves in layered systems. The test is performed on the pavement surface at low strain level, where the elastic properties are considered independent of strain amplitude. During an SASW test, an impact source was used to generate energy at various frequencies. Two vertical acceleration transducers are set up to detect the energy transmitted through the testing media. By recording signals in digitised form using a data acquisition system and processing them, surface wave velocities can be determined by constructing a dispersion curve.

This adds further confirmation to the hypothesis that the reaction takes place directly between the sugars and hypoiodous acid. The results indicate that the reaction is first order kinetics with respect to sugars and hypoiodous acid but it is zero order kinetic with respect to iodine concentration. The low value of energy of activation confirmed the presence of neutral molecules in rate determining step, and the negative value of entropy shows that the process is not spontaneous but the reverse process is spontaneous at all temperatures.

This thesis presents a strategy which combines the ability to approximate the experimental errors and to evaluate the system parameters based on these errors with the ability to solve the optimization problem in the presence of these errors. The proposed strategy transforms the data into intervals using statistical methods and then uses these intervals to evaluate worst case scenarios of the constraints and objective functions of the optimization problem. The strategy employs a posteriori error estimation methods which produce bounds on the constraints and objective functions in order to obtain the \u0393\u00c7\u00a3best\u0393\u00c7\u00a5 worst case scenarios. These worst case scenarios reflect the propagation of error from the data and ensure the feasibility of the results of the optimization problems.The evaluation of worst case scenarios results in a bilevel optimization formulation of the actual optimization model. This resulting bilevel optimization problem is solved using a nested-level approach where the inner level is solved for each iteration of the outer level for the case where the outer level problems are assumed to be differentiable. For the case in which the outer level problems are non-differentiable, the strategy uses a semi-infinite formulation which overcomes the evaluation of the worst case scenarios thereby rendering the problems differentiable if the functions are differentiable. The semi-infinite formulation is then solved using a discretization algorithm. Log-barrier functions and\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["12"]}

A review of the facts shows that among all dams that have suffered damage or failed from internal erosion, there is not a single case in which hydraulic fracture or dispersive clay action alone was the responsible mechanism. In almost all cases, a concentrated leak developed through a nearly horizontal crack or separation extending from upstream to downstream.

Methods: This study was conducted in Ayub medical Complex Abbottabad, Pakistan, to investigate the occurrence of anencephaly cases in neonates. Pregnant women during last trimester of their pregnancies were analyzed by Ultrasonography to find neural tube defects of foetus, complete physical analyses of Anencephalic neonates were done after birth or termination of pregnancies. Results: Out of 7202 reported births at Ayub Medical Complex, Abbottabad during the period of 2007 to 2010, almost 1 percent of the infants born had anencephaly. The ratio of anencephaly in female neonates was found higher (64.47%) than the male babies (31.37%). Conclusion: The overall prevalence of neonatal anencephaly is however not significantly different from the other areas of the country but there is gradual increase in anencephaly cases reported every year in Hazara. It is therefore suggested that this medical complication can be prevented by medicinal therapy for instance folic acid supplements, which should be administered to pregnant women at early stage of pregnancy to minimize the risk of anencephaly occurrence in coming baby. For best results, women should take folic acid as part of a healthy diet before pregnancy, as by the time pregnancy is detected, it may be too late to attempt to prevent neural tube defects.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["12"]}

The novelty of the results is due to non-normality condition on under consideration cone of a Banach space. Our results are independent of the remarks presented in literature on metric spaces with normal cones. In all of the results we use the generalized Hausdorff distance on closed subsets of a given complete cone metric space.

Using these features, we develop a traffic preprocessor which compensates for the negative effects of p2p traffic on anomaly detection.

Information and communication technology brought a dramatic change because it is relatively easy to access information in the electronic form and comparatively easy for its users to analyze. Within the last few years, distance learning has become a focal point in several universities, while much research has been devoted to produce e-content, describing it with metadata, and constructing e-learning platforms. It is observed that less attention has been paid on usage of technology to improve the learning process in terms of its effectiveness. This research aim to fill this gap by considering learning support by the usage of information and communication technology and knowledge based resources (intelligent system) perspective. Our research investigates how information and communication technology, knowledge base learning and quality focus can be brought together to get the best result. This research focuses on the case study of literacy rate in Bahawalpur, Pakistan which is the area wise largest division of Punjab [Pakistan] province and worst case in literacy condition.

It is very good source of energy and gives 72% of calories and proteins by consuming the wheat products like breads, cakes, biscuits, chapattis, nans, pasteries (Heyne, 1987). It provides food for 36% of the world population and also gives 20% of food calories. Wheat is a self-fertilized annual crop and is grown in most parts of the world than any other crop. Wheat is staple food of Pakistan and outstandingly feeds humanities of urban and rural areas (Hussain et al., 2013). Wheat contains an important chemical substance called gluten, with especial physical and chemical properties, through which risen loaf bread is produced. Hexaploid wheat is mainly used for production of bread around the world but it is also used to make numerous other food products namely cakes, pastries, cookies, noodles etc. Many agricultural scientists have done a lot of research on wheat in order to improve the grain yield per unit area.

In this work, we investigate the case of dimensioning parameters for linear and tiered wireless sensor network deployments with notion of providing extended lifetime and reliable data delivery over extensive infrastructures. We provide a single consolidated reference for selection of intrinsic sensor network parameters like number of required nodes for deployment over specified area, network operational lifetime, data aggregation requirements, energy dissipation concerns and communication channel related signal reliability. The dimensioning parameters have been analyzed in a pipeline monitoring scenario using ZigBee communication platform and subsequently referred with analytical models to ensure the dimensioning process is reflected in real world deployment with minimum resource consumption and best network connectivity. Concerns over data aggregation and routing delay minimization have been discussed with possible solutions.

Many properties of nanomaterials, such as size, shape, chemical composition, surface structure, surface charge, aggregation, agglomeration, and solubility can greatly influence their interactions with biomolecules and cells [2]. The uniqueness of the structural characteristics, energetics, response, dynamics, and chemistry of nanostructures constitutes the basis of nanoscience [3]. Suitable control of these properties and responses of nanostructures can lead to new devices and technologies. Although it is basically impossible to cover all the areas where nanoscale materials are involved, we have made a choice of topics for this book that will provide the reader not only with a broad overview of current hot topics in materials chemistry, but also with specific examples of the special properties of these materials and some particular applications of interest.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["12"]}

Various reports demonstrated its merits in reducing postoperative pain, analgesic requirement, incidence of wound infection, and hospital stay. The role of laparoscopy in management of complicated appendicitis remains undefined. Complicated appendicitis is associated with a significant risk of postoperative morbidity, making the value of the minimally invasive approach is superior.Methods: This is a retrospective study done in Chittagong Medical College Hospital and various private hospitals in Chittagong from January 2008 to June 2011. Sixty patients with complicated appendicitis included perforated appendicitis, gangrenous appendicitis, and appendicular abscess or lump found intra-operatively. The conversion rate, operative time, postoperative abdominal and wound infections, the return to oral intake, and the length of hospitalization were analysed. Laparoscopic appendectomy was done by three trocar techniques in all cases.Results: During the study period, 60 patients underwent laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. There were 35 patients with perforated appendicitis, 12 patients with gangrenous appendicitis, and 13 patients with early appendicular lump or abscess. The average operating time was 65 min. The average length of hospitalization was 3.2 (25) days. The postoperative narcotic analgesic requirement was minimal. Laparoscopy was converted to open surgery in two patients (3.33%).

{"title": "Influence of spur dike on flow patterns in an open channel\n", "abstract": " Spur dikes are used for river protection purposes. They are typical in-stream structures. There existence results in a considerable change in the flow structure of open channel flow both upstream and downstream of the spur dike. This paper presents a numerical work conducted to get the mean and turbulent flow features under the influence of spur dike. Primary velocity distributions over cross sections and horizontal planes, streamlines over vertical sections and turbulence kinetic energy were investigated. The presence of spur dike was found to have disturbed all the investigated flow features along the length of the channel. The flow separation and recirculation was observed on the down stream side of the dike. The reversal of flow behind the dike was directed downwards from the surface. On the basis of the results obtained in this study, an attempt has been made to enhance the understanding of the flow patterns which exist in case of a spur dike which can further be used for development and improvement of formulae relevant to spur-dikes.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["12"]}
{"title": "Estimation of Flow Resistance Due to Embankments and Spur Dikes during Floods\n", "abstract": " Flow resistance is a key factor in predicting the river conveyance capacity and associated water levels. In addition to bed resistance, the obstacles (embankments, spur dikes etc.) in the flood plain of a river contribute to the flow resistance. In particular the elevated parts are expected to play an important role. The objective of this study is to develop and parameterize an analytical model for the form drag due to such obstacles. An experimental study was carried out for validation purposes of the developed analytical model. The prototype weir-like structure (in the form of an embankment) was modeled as a weir with various leeside slopes. Measurements for energy head losses were carried out for a range of discharges and downstream water levels covering submerged flow conditions. The energy head loss due to submerged dikes was modeled as an expansion loss form drag. The analytical form drag model was estimated using a one-dimensional momentum conservation equation which accounts for the energy loss associated with a deceleration of the flow in the leeside region of the sudden expansion. The predicted losses from the analytical model agreed well with the experimental results. The minor deviations observed could be attributed to downstream slope effects and non-uniform velocity distribution in expansion zone (recirculation region) of an embankment.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["12"]}

{"title": "How is quantum cryptography used for secure financial transactions\n", "abstract": " In recent years quantum physicists have proposed a new type of cryptosystem known as quantum cryptography (QC) which has proven promising for online security in public key infrastructure (PKI). Researchers are now examining QC as a possible alternative to classical encryption algorithms, such as AES, RSA. Unlike many classical encryption algorithms, QC does not depend on factoring large integers into their primes but on the fundamental principles of quantum physics. It is more secure because an intruder will never be able to replicate a photon to recreate the key. QC allows the exchange of cryptographic keys, a method known as quantum key distribution (QKD), whose security is guaranteed by quantum physics. Any eavesdropping will change the state of the photon that will alarm the user of the presence of hacking. Once cryptographic keys have been exchanged, strong cryptographic algorithms are used to encrypt and decrypt the flow of data transmitted over an optical fiber. QC would allow users to overcome the vulnerabilities of public key cryptography. The paper reviews the systematic and chronological development of QC, pioneering methods of QKD, QKD products, secure quantum networks, and finally how QC has been used to securely transfer funds in Europe.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["12"]}

Our objective was to compare the efficacy of splinting and placebo with splinting and VitaminB6 in patients with CTS. Methodology: We conducted a randomized case-control trial in the neurology clinic of Alzahra hospital, Isfahan, Iran, between March 2009 and March 2010. Ninety outpatients who were at least 18 years old and who had clinically and electrophysiologically confirmed idiopathic CTS were included in the study. The patients were randomly allocated to two groups: placebo plus wrist splinting (control) or VitaminB6 supplementation (for six months) plus wrist splinting (case) for at least three months. Eighty-six patients (95%) completed the study. The primary endpoint was improved sensory nerve conduction by the median nerve. Result: Evaluations performed at three months follow up revealed a significant difference in the mean peak sensory latency between the case and control groups (p= 0.002). A total of 65% of patients in the case group reported subjective symptom relief compared with 58% of patients in the control group. These data suggest that splinting combined with VitaminB6 supplementation is more effective than splinting alone in improving electrophysiological parameters and subjective symptoms of CTS.Conclusion: Vitamin B6 is an effective treatment in mild and moderate CTS and could be considered as a conservative treatment.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["12"]}

{"title": "Autonomic service composition through context orientation approach\n", "abstract": " In this paper we present a novel service composition scheme for ubiquitous environments. As in a ubiquitous system there are many heterogeneous devices connected to each other in various topologies and one type of application that gives optimal performance on one node can perform differently from the other nodes. Our scheme addresses this issue through a dynamic service composition scheme that considers constrains on a local node and generates an application with near optimal performance with respect to its context. We simulate the scheme in our project environment consisting of hybrid mesh. The overall objective is to propose an efficient mechanism to meet the optimization demands at software level.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["12"]}

Samples were characterized by nitrogen adsorption, TEM, XRD, TPR, TPO and H2-TPD. Addition of niobium increased the dispersion of cobalt but decreased the catalysts reducibility. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) was carried out in a fixed-bed microreactor at 543 K, 1 atm and H2/CO = 2 for 5 h. Addition of niobium enhanced the C5+ hydrocarbons selectivity by 39% and reduced methane selectivity by 59%.

The results revealed the usefulness of multivariate techniques for evaluation of input water sources and interpretation of large complex water quality dataset for effective management of water resources. The largest source of variation (25%) is contributed from physical water quality parameters. Additional inputs come from the second factor accounting for about 15%. The third factor, accounting for 14% is associated with wastewater discharges and the fourth factor accounting for 12%. Finally, it suggests that a fraction of wastewater discharge is the only primary source of variations in this reservoir and there is no major threat of pollution.

A community, on this understanding is a group of people linked by a shared consciousness and shared identity where people are open and honest to each other because, they all see the world in the same way. Here, people develop a shared centre of values, sentiments and beliefs which encourages them to think in terms of\" we\" rather than\" I\". To transform a school into such a learning community the school leadership plays a critical role. The function of school leadership is growing complex and perplex in terms of its extensive involvement in the social, moral, educational and technical aspects of the school life. This leadership is considered as the entrance through which the norms, values and beliefs inter into the school milieu and become part of the school culture. Therefore, it becomes indispensable to explore the role of the principal as the school leader in transforming the school into a learning community. This study aimed at exploring the role of the school leadership in transforming a school into a learning community. It further intended to explore the strategies adopted by the school leadership and the challenges faced in transforming the school into a learning community.

Performance of any geolocation system is based upon the reported distance error. The accuracy required varies from application to application. For example an accurate geolocation system is required to apprehend a rogue client (illegitimate connection) inside a building in a dense wireless environment. At present this is possible only through wireless radio frequency (RF) interception of signals. The received signal strength (RSS) of a signal can be used to report the position of a client by triangulation. The hostile indoor environment presents many challenges including multipath and wall attenuation that needs to be considered for determining accurate indoor location. In this thesis a novel method to reduce the variation in RSS values is demonstrated by exploiting the frequency diversity existing across multiple channels of devices equipped with the IEEE 802.11 a/b/g wifi (wireless fidelity) standards. Absorption of the RF signal due to walls is observed and identified as one of the major factors that influence location estimation. RSS from different directions and within different environments is also studied. The processed RSS values are then applied to location estimation using a novel RSS threshold algorithm based upon a RF propagation model. The algorithm is designed based on the room dimensions where location sensors are placed.

This system was able to detect a significant shift in resist sidewall angle (SWA) on an incoming resist batch that was undetected by the primary metrology in use at the time, a scanning electron microscope (CD-SEM). This SWA shift correlated to an undesirable shift in post-etch CD created by the new resist batch.

Besides being time consuming and computationally expensive, the actual mathematical models and underlying structure of these problems are for most part unknown.  This paper presents a method for constructing approximate low-dimensional models for such problems using the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) technique.  We consider a heat diffusion problem and a contamination transport problem, where the actual mathematical models are assumed to be unknown but numerical data in time are available so as to enable the formation of an ensemble of snapshots The POD technique is then used to produce a set of basis functions that spans the snapshot collection corresponding to each problem.  The key idea is then to assume some functional form of the low-order model, and use the available snapshot data to perform a least squares fit in the POD basis coordinate system to determine the unknown model coefficients. Initial results based on this approximation method seem to hold some promise in creating a predictive low-order model, that is, one able to predict solutions not included in the original snapshot set.  Some issues arising from this approximation method are also discussed in this paper.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["12"]}

However, most of this previous work has been focused on analyzing the structure of the network and its evolution through time on a global scale. Relative little work has been performed to predict the leading countries in global trade network. Can we build a model that can identify and predict the trade leading country in the trade network?

The nonlinear ANFT2-based direct control scheme is proposed to damp inter-area oscillations by utilizing its model free and universal approximation capabilities. The Gaussian and triangular membership functions with different variations of uncertain mean and standard deviation are considered for ANFT2. The adaptation mechanism utilizes gradient descent-based back-propagation algorithm using Lyapunov stability criteria to update the rule parameters. The performance evaluation of proposed control strategy has been validated using two and three machine power systems. The nonlinear time domain simulations reveal that ANFT2 has excellent damping capabilities as compared to conventional PI control\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["12"]}

{"title": "What determines the yields for treasury bills in Pakistan?\n", "abstract": " Treasury bills are financial tools to maintain and control liquidity in economies. Liquidity has implications on business activities and therefore has considerable importance for economic growth. Pricing of financial tools adjust to demand and supply forces. The macroeconomic landscape of Pakistan largely depends on interventions made by the State Bank of Pakistan through its monetary policy. Treasury bills are assumed to perform a dual role of maintaining liquidity while keeping inflation low. The yields on securities primarily depends on the terms of maturity however there could be many other factors that affect the yields of treasury bills in Pakistan. There is little empirical research available that empirically measures the effects of all underlying factors on the yields of treasury bills in the native economy. Term of maturity is an important consideration when it comes to determining the yields on securities. Yields on Treasury Bills in Pakistan may involve other factors apart from term premiums. Term premiums have been studied by notable researchers around the world using sets of macroeconomic factors as independent variables. This paper considers macroeconomic factors more relevant to the Pakistani context that play towards shaping the bid and offer rates of Treasury Bills locally. This paper adopts the Risk-Averse Preferred Habitat Model suggested by (Heuson, 1988) by taking term premiums as explained variable. The set of macroeconomic factors include un-expected changes in stock prices, money supply, consumer price index, and the prime rate.

The main agro-wastes are rice straw, cotton stalks, and maize straw in addition to this biomass milling residue is also available in huge quantity. Apart from the problems of storage, handling, transportation, direct burning of loose biomass in conventional grates is associated with very low thermal efficiency and widespread air pollution. To overcome these problems, biomass needs to be compressed ten times to increase its density and durability. In this study, durability, density and compression strength of sawdust, cotton stalks, maize straw and rice straw briquettes at different levels of moisture content, particle size and compression ratio is to be determined.

Mycobacterium marinum, a close relative of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is such an intracellular pathogen that can infect, survive and replicate in phagocytic cells of vertebrates as well as protozoan species. Here, we employed transposon-directed insertion-site sequencing (TraDIS) of a large pool of M. marinum transposon mutants to determine which genes are required, advantageous or disadvantageous for survival and replication in phagocytic cells of different host species. We found a number of general virulence mechanisms relevant for all hosts, including the ESX-1 protein secretion system, biosynthesis of the polyketide lipid phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM) and proteins involved in uptake and metabolism of cholesterol. In addition, we could identify the putative CpsA regulator as a new general virulence factor. Interestingly, our data also showed that M. marinum contains a large set of host-specific virulence determinants. For instance, the general virulence-associated ESX-1 system requires auxiliary proteins that play a crucial role in species-dependent infection. We show that the bacterial factors required for a successful infection of protozoan species frequently differ from those used for macrophages derived from vertebrates, indicating that broad-host range pathogens such as M. marinum contain different sets of virulence factors that are customized for specific hosts.

These sources include wood, dried twigs and grass, crop residues, and animal dungcakes, which collectively are called biomass fuels. Although in developed world these highly polluting fuel sources have been replaced with cleaner sources, such as liquified petroleum gas and electricity, it is estimated that still nearly 50% of all house-holds worldwide and 90% of all rural households continue to use biomass fuel as their main domestic source of energy. On a global scale, the household use of solid fuels is the most important source of indoor air pollution and the exposure to the by-products of the combustion of biomass fuels, particularly wood smoke, has been related to numerous respiratory problems, and increased mortality and burden of disease. Recent data attribute 1.5 to 2 million deaths worldwide every year equivalent to 4 to 5% of total global deaths to indoor air pollution and most of them (1 million) occurring in children younger than 5 years due to acute respiratory infections (ARI).

There is no universal turbulence model which can be applied in all the scenarios. Therefore, if a suitable closure model is used in a simulation work, only then the successful numerical modelling will be achieved. This paper presents the evaluation of three turbulence models in numerical modelling of open channel flows having beds comprising of two parallel strips, one being smooth and the other one being rough. The roughness on the rough side of the channel was created with the help of gravels. The turbulence models tested for their suitability in this case were Reynolds stress model, k-\u256c\u2561 model and RNG based k-\u256c\u2561model. A structured mesh was used in this simulation work. Grid independence test was also conducted in the simulation. The evaluation of the turbulence models was made through the primary velocity contours and secondary velocity vectors over the cross section of the channel. It was revealed that Reynolds stress model simulated the flow behaviour successfully and results obtained through this model matched very closely to that of the experimental data whereas k-\u256c\u2561model and RNG based k-\u256c\u2561 model failed to reproduce the flow field successfully.

{"title": "Abundant Information of Hip Joint for Gender Detection Using 3D Motion Data\n", "abstract": " Correct gender perception is an important issue and we have received significant attention in the last decade. In this paper, the authors propose a human gender identification method based on basic statistical moments (mean and variance) under joint movement three-dimensional motion data. The statistical moments used to correlate the information of the human joints in the gait are applied for gender recognition. The information about the gait is obtained from the three-dimension motion of the Biovision Hierarchical data (BVH file). In this paper, the rotation angle data of the hip joint were computed from the BVH motion file, because this joint provides plentiful of information for gender recognition. The uses of BVH file for human gender recognition is a novel feature of this work. The experimental results indicated that the proposed approach is highly reliable and simple for gender recognition.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["12"]}

The samples were characterized by simultaneous thermal analysis (STA) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The STA results indicate that the filter ash melts at 1140oC with 10 wt% of the mass loss and Bottom ash partially melts at 1170oC with below 2 wt% of the mass loss. The low melting point of the filter ash is due to the high concentration of the alkali metals in the filter ash. Similar trends were observed in the case of fly ash and bottom ash with peat admixture to the fuel. Furthermore the elementary analysis via scanning electron microscopy, coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis showed that 7% of peat addition to the fuel does not significantly effect on the ash composition.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["12"]}

This problem could weaken cement at the top, gas migration problem and non uniform density of cement slurry that are even worst in cementing deviated well. Another concern on cementing design is the porosity of the hardened cement. If the cement is too porous, it can lead to gas migration and casing corrosion. The intent of this research was to utilize the waste produced by distillation process of Agarwood oil and convert it into a profitable oilwell cement additive. All tests were conducted according to API Specification-10B. Free water test was determined at different concentrations of Agarwood Waste Additive (AWA), different inclination angles and different temperatures. Based on the findings, it was observed that zero free water was produced when 2% BWOC of AWA was used at all angles. The findings also revealed that AWA can maintain good thermal stability as it could maintain zero free water at increased temperature up to 60 C. The porosity of AWA cement was comparable with standard API neat cement as the porosity did not differ much at 2% BWOC of AWA. Therefore, it can be concluded that the AWA is suitable to be used as an additive in oil well cement (OWC) with 2% BWOC is taken as the optimum concentration.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["12"]}

Laser Doppler velocimeter measurements of the water flow velocities over trapezoidal vegetated and non-vegetated weir-like structures (dike, groyne) have been made. The measurements extended to a distance of 20 weir heights downstream of the weir crest, it also included the flow separation zone behind the weir crest. The Reynolds\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s number was of the order of 104 in the flume, and imperfect flow conditions with Froude number< 0.4 above the weir crest were considered. Two discharge values were considered in the experimental work. A comparison between the flow characteristics of vegetated and non vegetated weir-like structure was made. The variables investigated included longitudinal and vertical velocity components. Reynolds shearing stresses have also been investigated. The measured mean and turbulent velocities provided more detailed insight about the flow behind vegetated weirs. Strong vortices and turbulent intensities in region especially downstream of vegetated weir crest showed that the flow in the region near bed (on downstream slope of weir the recirculation zone is the main contributor) and at the top of the modeled vegetation is very unstable and leads to the formation of the coherent structures and it is the area of significant mass and momentum exchange. The results indicated that regaining of the logarithmic velocity profile behind the vegetated weir-like structures are delayed due to the presence of vegetation.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["12"]}

{"title": "Recent Advancement in the Treatment of Open Apex: Materials and Technique\n", "abstract": " Cessation of the root development occurred by traumatic injury and as a sequence of caries prevents obturation of the root canal during endodontic treatment and subsequent treatment like fixed prosthesis. Thus, the goal of apexification was to obtain an apical barrier to prevent the passage of toxins and bacteria into the periapical tissues from the root canal and to induce an apical barrier against which GP points can be condensed. Apexification has been carried out from long time where calcium hydroxide is the widely used material. Calcium hydroxide gained the widest popularity. It is bactericidal in nature with an alkaline pH that may be responsible for stimulating apical calcification. Despite its widest acceptance, it has some disadvantages including variability of treatment time, difficulty in patients follow up, delayed healing, needs multiple visits to the completion to induction of calcific barrier formation and it weakens the dentin of root. Thus, the scientists and clinicians felt urge to introduce new materials and techniques that will help to the quick resolution of the apical radiolucency and to form the apical barrier. MTA (mineral trioxide aggregate), a recently introduced material is successfully used in the treatment of apexification. Many renowned scientists and clinicians worked on this materials and got very good results.

{"title": "Liquefaction Remediation\n", "abstract": " Naturally occurring soils are heterogeneous materials due to their varying composition broadly termed as granular and cohesive in view of their grain size distribution, and or contractive and dilative according to physical behaviour. Their engineering behaviour is affected by composition, moisture conditions, stress history, boundary conditions, future loading conditions, seismic conditions, etc. The intensity and magnitude of such variable factors make the engineering behaviour of soils under static and dynamic conditions variable from one point to another and is thus regarded as nonlinear and anisotropic. Behaviour under low and high moisture conditions is significantly different under dynamic loading such as earthquakes, machine vibrations, traffic vibrations, etc.Engineering behaviour of soils under loads is evaluated in terms of shear strength which comprises of parameters known as cohesion, angle of internal friction, effective stress, and pore pressure. Under static conditions (monotonic loading) when loads reach to limit where pore pressure equals effective stress, saturated loose granular soils loose their strength and behave like a liquid. This phenomenon is called liquefaction. While behaviour of medium to dense saturated sands under static loading is dilative in nature, under cyclic loading of certain magnitude and shaking, undergoes failure similar to liquefaction called \u0393\u00c7\u00a3cyclic mobility\u0393\u00c7\u00a5. Civil engineering structures built on sites of loose saturated and dense cohesionless soils are therefore at risk of liquefaction and cyclic mobility with potential of damage to the structures and need improvement to safeguard against damages by liquefaction\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["12"]}

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus and impaired fasting glucose (IFG). We hypothesized that the relation of fasting glucose levels to ASCVD is linear, with the prevalence of clinical ASCVD beginning to increase even among individuals currently categorized as normoglycemic. Methods. Patient charts were retrospectively reviewed from our Dyslipidemic Preventive Cardiology Clinic. We evaluated the prevalence of ASCVD relative to fasting glucose levels in a cross-section of patients at high risk for ASCVD.  Results. In 558 dyslipidemic patients, ASCVD prevalence increased with increasing fasting glucose levels. A significantly higher prevalence of ASCVD was observed among patients with fasting glucose levels between 90 and 99\u0393\u00c7\u00ebmg/dL versus lower levels. As glucose levels increased from 90 to 125\u0393\u00c7\u00ebmg/dL, the prevalence of ASCVD continued to rise in parallel.

This project aimed to investigate the source of the 2N vibration response seen in misaligned vibrating machinery by simulating misalignment through a coupling. Three flexible disc-pack couplings (4-bolt, 6-bolt, and 8-bolt coupling) were modeled, and parallel and angular misalignments were simulated using a finite element program. The stiffness terms obtained from the coupling simulations had 1N, 2N, and 3N harmonic components. The 4-bolt coupling had large 1N reaction components under angular and parallel misalignment. The 6-bolt coupling model only had a 1N reaction component under angular misalignment, and both cases of parallel misalignment showed a strong 2N reaction component, larger than both the 1N and 3N components. The 8-bolt coupling model under angular misalignment produced large 1N reaction components. Under parallel misalignment, it produced 1N, 2N, and 3N components that were similar in magnitude. All the couplings behaved linearly in the range studied. A simple model predicted that the 2N frequency seen in the response is caused by the harmonic (1N) term in the stiffness. The amplitude of the 2N component in the response depends on the amplitude of the 1N term in the stiffness compared to the average value of the stiffness and the frequency ratio. The rotordynamic response of a parallel and angular misaligned system was completed in XLTRC2.

{"title": "Feasibility of floating content service for context aware applications\n", "abstract": " Context aware applications encompass an ever-expanding set of applications that make use of a combination of restricted spatio-temporal locality and mobile communications to deliver a variety of services to the user. The communication requirements for such applications significantly differ from ordinary applications and opportunistic communications can play a role for such applications because they naturally incorporate context.  In this work we chose to analyze the complex interplay between context information, communication technologies, and context aware applications, by studying the feasibility of a context aware communication service called floating content as a support for context aware mobile applications. In order to complement our performance study, we considered a specific context aware application belonging to family of \u0393\u00c7\u00a5social proximity sensing\u0393\u00c7\u00a5 which can be implemented via floating content.  We analyzed the suitability of the floating content technique for such an application, and analyzed the main performance bounds at the communication level by means of simulations. The analysis revealed that floating content service can be used only for the applications that are used in areas having high user density.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["12"]}

In the present study this unexpected phenomenon was explored, using commonly used radionuclides (viz., 201Tl and 131I). Comparison was made with technetium-99m pertechnetate (99mTcO4-) and technetium-99m labeled methoxyisobutylisonitrile (99mTc-MIBI) that are known to show conventional 2 phase graph representing inflow and outflow segments. Serial in vitro, ex-vivo and in vivo gamma scintigraphy as well as NMR spectroscopy experiments were conducted to corroborate the results. BMG-1 cells demonstrated a four-phase uptake pattern with 201Tl as compared to a conventional biphasic pattern with 99mTc-MIBI. Flow cytometry data however did not reveal any 201Tl induced cell injury. Further, mice tissue extracts injected with 201Tl also showed a transient depression in its uptake. Scintigraphy experiments in rabbits administered with diagnostic dose of 201Tl and 131I confirmed the in vitro and ex vivo findings. Further, proton NMR spectroscopy showed decrease in the level of choline at 3 h and 24 h in 201Tl treated animals as compared to control. Phosphoethanolamine peak firstly decreased at 3 h but reached normal level at 24 h time point. No significant change was observed in the level of betaine. This transient reduction in internalization of 201Tl and 131I may represent a hitherto unknown acute effect of low dose radiation, i.e., transient depression in Na+-K+ ATPase pump activity without any apparent evidence of cell damage\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["12"]}

{"title": "Complex Linearizability Criteria for Differential Equations\n", "abstract": " The classical work of Lie for linearization of a scalar second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) has recently been extended to higher order and to systems using real variables. There is little available of a general nature for partial differential equations (PDEs). Here we use complex functions of a complex variable to extend the earlier results to systems of PDEs and complex functions of a real variable to extend to systems of real variables. Linearization of nonlinear PDEs is one of the challenging problems in mathematics. There exists no invariant criteria to check the linearizability of such equations. In a non-trivial way, we gain explicit invariant linearizability conditions for a class of systems of non-linear PDEs which were not reported before. The problem of construction of linearizing transformation is also addressed which give way to procedures for writing down the solutions of the linearized equations. Besides, the integrability of systems of ODEs is achieved by taking advantage of analytic continuation. The usual Lie compatibility conditions contain more than ten equations which are reduced to a smaller number of conditions for such systems.

{"title": "A technique for handling multiple queries for wireless sensor network\n", "abstract": " Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are being developed for a diverse range of applications. The power of these networks lies in the ability to deploy large numbers of tiny nodes that are self-manageable and adaptable. With the enduring advancement in network and application design of these sensor networks, appropriate middleware is needed for providing both standardized and portable system abstractions and the capability to support and coordinate concurrent applications on sensor networks.Research has been carried out on WSN middleware from different aspects and for different purposes. In this paper, a technique is provided to handle requests of multiple clients and provide services for querying nodes to fulfill user requests. The technique presented in this paper gives a developer the opportunity to construct a query in any format that fulfils the application requirements. The Application Interface Service of our middleware framework will extract the required information and convert it into a standard format before forwarding to the sensor network. The novel aspect of this work lies in the fact, that the AIS is not binding the developer to any particular query language, for example, SQL or SQL-like languages as done in the previous works. This paper also provides implementation details of Application Interface Services.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["12"]}

{"title": "Molecular studies on bacteriophages of the foodstarter culture Streptococcus thermophilus\n", "abstract": " Lactic acid bacteria play divergent and important roles for human beings: On the one hand they include major bacterial pathogens like Streptococcus pyogenes and S. pneumoniae and on the other hand many species are used as starter cultures for the manufacture of fermented food (ie, dairy products, meat, vegetables, wine, sour dough, cocoa) and silage. S. thermophilus is one of the most important lactic acid bacteria required for the manufacture of yogurt, mozzarella and other cheese varieties (eg Cheddar and Swiss-type cheeses). Bacteriophage attacks are always a serious problem in industrial fermentations leading to significant financial losses. Characterization of bacteriophage populations is therefore the first step of efficient phage control in dairies and other food fermentation industries. The aim of the work described in Chapter 1 was to identify and characterize a new temperate S. thermophilus phage (ie, phage TP-778) that was induced from its lysogenic host strain S. thermophilus SK778. Phage TP-778 revealed the typical morphology of all known S. thermophilus phages with isometric heads and long non-contractile tails. It was classified as a pac-type phage with a genome size of ca. 44 kb. No prophage-cured strain could be obtained, indicating that correct excision of prophage DNA from the host chromosomal DNA was prevented. Phage TP-778 could be propagated lytically on the non-lysogenic S. thermophilus strain B106, and a lytically propagated derivative (ie, TP-778L) was isolated and also characterised as described in this chapter.

Lack of optimal camera platforms and visualizing a three-dimensional surgical area in two-dimension elongates the time required to perform simple tasks such as knot tying. The robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgeries can be made more efficient and less time consuming if some of the less-critical and routine tasks that surgeons perform can be automated.

To investigate the genes involved in leaf senescence, both molecular and mutational approaches could be used. In the present experiment, mutagenic approach was used to understand the leaf senescence in Arabidopsis thaliana Landsberg erecta. Arabidopsis seeds were treated with a chemical mutagen, ethyl methane sulphonate (EMS). The mutagenized population was screened to identify delayed senescence mutants. Two different classes of Arabidopsis mutants were identified. Morphologically delayed senescing mutants; mds, were identified by robust structure, prolonged greenness, continuous flowering and increased number of leaves, branches and siliques. The biochemically delayed senescing mutants; bds, showed reduced protein degradation during senescence. Both these characters (mds and bds) were found heritable.

For this purpose, the wild-culture (Saccharomyces cerevisiae IS-14) was developed by combined treatments of radiations and chemicals (UV/MNNG, UV/EMS, MNNG/EMS) for different time intervals (10-30 min). The best \u256c\u2593-D-fructofuranosidase mutant strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (34.12 U/ml) was coded to as UME-2. This mutant strain was cultured on the medium containing 2-deoxy D-glucose (2dg) and its stability for \u256c\u2593-D-fructofuranosidase productivity was determined at various 2dg levels. The 2dg concentration of 0.04 mg/ml was found optimal, as at this level UME-2 gave consistent \u256c\u2593-D-fructofuranosidase yield. After optimization of incubation time (48 h), sucrose concentration (5.0 g/l), initial pH (6.0) and 16 h old inoculum (size 2.0%, v/v), enzyme production reached 45.65 U/ml with a noticeable\u0393\u00eb\u00ea 40-fold increase compared to the original wild-culture (IS-14).

{"title": "Growth and instability in the major crops sector of East Asian countries\n", "abstract": " The study analyzed the growth and instability/variability in five major crops areas, production and yield for two different periods of East Asian countries to clearly bring out the trends in the more recent period. Period I (1976\u0393\u00c7\u00f477 to 1988\u0393\u00c7\u00f489) and Period II (1989\u0393\u00c7\u00f490 to 2001\u0393\u00c7\u00f42002) for Japan, China and South Korea. Due to data limitation in North Korea, Period I is from 1983\u0393\u00c7\u00f484 to 1991\u0393\u00c7\u00f492 and Period II is from 1992\u0393\u00c7\u00f493 to 2001\u0393\u00c7\u00f42002. The study reveals that the high production growth rate of potatoes in China and South Korea was mainly due to favorable price incentives, expanded irrigation system, HYVs and rising level of chemical fertilizer application in Period II. The instability in the production of potatoes also declined. In North Korea, the production growth rate of potatoes increased in Period II but at the same time its instability also increased. In Japan, the production growth rate became negative in Period II. The\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["12"]}

{"title": "Biotechnological application of alkaline cellulase in food technology\n", "abstract": " The alkalophilic Bacillus macernas SM was isolated from polluted Solanum tuberosum wastes in Upper Egypt. It produced high level of extracellular alkaline cellulase. The maximum enzyme production induced at a substrate concentration of 0.5%; temperature and pH optima were 40 C and 8 respectively, an optima carbon and nitrogen sources essential for the best yield of enzyme were cellulose and potassium nitrate respectively. On the other hand the best yield of cellulase was obtained after 24h incubation in 1000ml flask volume under static fermentation conditions. The optimal cultural and nutritional conditions for production of maximal alkaline cellulase for application study resulted in: Increasing of maceration yield up to 85.61% of potato pulp followed by increasing a clarification yield 15.27% in guava and filtration yield 70.28% in tomato juice. The best preservation conditions of enzyme used of both guava clarification and tomato filtration were detected at room temperature. The present cellulase may be of remarkable application in the field of biodetergents and in food processing industry in large-scale.INTRODUCTION:", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["12"]}
{"title": "A case of mistaken muscles\n", "abstract": " Oxford Clinical School recently piloted a scheme in which final year students serve as mentors to first year clinical students. The assumption is that near qualified students are not too far advanced to have forgotten those first anxious steps on the wards and can, therefore, provide a type of support that qualified doctors cannot. Equally important, they have sufficient experience to teach the basic clinical skills of history taking and physical examination.During a teaching session given by Hashim Uddin Ahmed (a finalist) to Sarah Ali (a first year student) on the dreaded neurological examination, we both gained valuable lessons beyond those related to the intricacies of the nervous system.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["12"]}

{"title": "Status of Volatile Organic Compounds, Suspended Particulate Matters and Lead in Ambient Air and Indoor Environments in Dhaka City\n", "abstract": " In recent studies conducted by the authors, a solid phase microextraction (SPME) technique was applied for sampling volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in ambient air polluted by automobile exhausts in the Dhaka city. Subsequent analysis was carried out by capillary gas chromatography (GC) and GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The accuracy for total VOCs concentration measurement was about 7%. The chromatograms reveal signature similar to that of unburned gasoline (petrol) and weathered diesel containing more than 200 organic compounds. The identified hydrocarbons include pentane (nC 5H12) through nonacosane (nC 29H60), aromatic hydrocarbons: benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, n-propylbenzene, n-butylbenzene, 1, 3, 5-trimethylbenzene, xylene, and 1-isocyanato-3-methoxybenzene. Air samples collected from autorickshaw exhaust contained as high as 1,479,000 \u252c\u2561g/m3 of VOCs. Additional ambient air samples collected in the street showed 135,000 \u252c\u2561g/m3 and 180,000 \u252c\u2561g/m3 of total VOCs. To the best of our knowledge this is the first of its kind of study on Dhaka city air pollution. The lead (Pb) in ambient air were measured in a number of locations in the city during the winter month (January 2002) and the level ranged from 265 to 495 ng/m3 air. Suspended particulate matters (SPM) and a range of VOCs in kitchen smokes were measured in several indoor environments in the Dhaka city slum areas. Our findings on air pollutants in Dhaka city, their implications on public health are presented in this paper.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["12"]}

{"title": "Mercury sphygmomanometers: disposal has far reaching consequences\n", "abstract": " EDITOR\u0393\u00c7\u00f6The papers by O'Brien and Beevers et al have documented the trend away from the use of the mercury sphygmomanometer. 1 2 But the ethical, legal, economic, and public health consequences associated with their disposal have not been so well documented. This lack of advice is surprising since mercury has well known toxic properties. Haphazard disposal of mercury inevitably leads to environmental recycling and bioconcentration, with ecological damage at best and human poisoning at worst. 3The Special Waste Regulations 1996 classify mercury and waste material containing more than 3% mercury as special waste and require extensive documented control of, and the use of approved contractors for, each stage of the disposal process.

The determinant of coherency matrix, intensity and degree of polarization of each line are zero, non-zero and unity, respectively. The determinant of coherency matrix and the degree of polarization are anisotropic whereas the intensity is isotropic. The Kramer's degeneracy does not exist. The results are transformed from the principal axis system to the crystal fixed axis system using the rotation matrices. Certain symmetries have also been found. The computer analysis reveals that the degree of polarization is very sensitive function of the hyperfine field parameters in single crystals.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["12"]}
{"title": "IN TRACRANIAL SUPPURATION FOLLOWING NEUROSURGICAL PROCEDURES DUE TO BRUCELLA SPECIES\n", "abstract": " Reported here are two cases of delayed postsurgical brucella abscess within the cranium, treated successfully by reoperation and appropriate medical therapy. Both patients had an occupational exposure to the pathogenic organism. Systemic symptoms of brucellosis became manifest postoperatively in case I and were present in case II long before operation. The diagnosis was confirmed by serology and positive culture. Later an intracranial abscess developed in both cases at the previous operative sites.Hematogenous spread of bacteria to the locally low resistance host tissue was speculated as the possible mechanism. Successful management was accomplished by reoperation, comprised of local drainage and debridement followed by a combined anti brucella drug regimen for a period of 6 months.

Comparison between these heat capacity measurements and transport measurements provides critical complimentary information about fundamental thermodynamic properties and granularity m superconductors. We have used a tiny, robust, highly sensitive and broadly field independent Cemox thermometer (CX-1030), eliminating the use of bulky gas thermometry or capacitance thermometry. The diameter of the probe is 20 min which facilitates use in our 17 T high field magnet and in free-standing cryostats. Experiments include accurate measurement of temperature oscillations of 10(^-6)K. The measurements and analysis of the data were made fully computer controlled. Measurements on Cu and NbTi demonstrate we achieved an accuracy of \u252c\u25920.2 K in temperature and a typical accuracy of -10% m the specific heat values quoted. Gd-doped Lead Chevrel phase material Pb(_1-x)Gd(_x)Mo(_6)S(_8) has been fabricated in a controlled environment using simple sintering methods and a Hot Isostatic Press (HIP) operating at pressures up to 2000 atmospheres. Cp has been measured and the properties of the materials including B(_c2)(T) have been determined. HIP processing improves the materials, increasing Tc ~ 15 K and B(_c2)(0) ~ 60 T. These values are amongst the best reported values for the Chevrel phase materials to date. I am personally responsible for taking all the data and its analysis. The modification of the probe were also undertaken by me\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["12"]}

The properties of bulk PMS and Gd-PMS fabricated at ambient pressure arc compared with material fabricated at a pressure of 2x10* N. m'2 (2000 bar) using a Hot Isostalic Press (HIP). The volumetrically averaged upper critical field (B^ CT)) has been determined as a function of temperature for these materials. The Gd-PMS shows evidence for a two-phase separation into a low temperature phase which is probably magnetic in origin and a PMS-likc superconducting phase where the Gd may act primarily as an oxygen getter. Both PMS samples show high upper critical field values (Tc\u0393\u00c7\u00f3 13K, 8^(0)\u252c\u2557 55 T) which were significantly higher than the irreversibility lines determined from complementary transport and magnetic measurements.

{"title": "A comparison of bacterial resistance to antimicrobials in Riyadh, Medina, and Oklahoma City.\n", "abstract": " Many bacteria are known to develop resistance to anti-microbial agents following their clinical use. The resistance pattern varies from one geographic location to another depending upon the patient population and local history of antibiotic use. The bacterial resistance to commonly used antimicrobial agents in Oklahoma City was found to be different from two cities in Saudi Arabia, especially amongst Gram-negative bacilli. A total of 13,575 fresh clinical isolates from the Veterans Administration Medical Center (VAMC), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre (KFSH), Riyadh; and the King Fahad Hospital (KFH), Medina, Saudi Arabia; were used. There were 6,270 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, 2,799 pseudomonads and Acinetobacter, and 4,506 Gram positive strains of staphylococcus bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria from KFH were considerably more resistant to ampicillin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole than at KFSH and VAMC. On the other hand, Staphylococcus aureus isolated from VAMC exhibited a significantly higher degree of resistance to oxacillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole than those at KFSH and KFH.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["12"]}

{"title": "Deuteron-deuteron elastic scattering at high energies\n", "abstract": " [en] The eikonal picture which has theoretical foundations in some areas of physics has been successful in explaining various aspects of elastic scattering at high energies. Chou and Yang first proposed a preliminary version of the eikonal model for hadron-hadron elastic scattering. The model is based on geometrical considerations in which hadrons are treated as extended objects. Elastic scattering then results from the propagation of attenuated wave function. By assuming that at high energies the scattering amplitude is purely imaginary and that the hadronic matter distribution is proportional to the charge distribution on protons, Durand and Lipes studied high energy pp scattering on the basis of this prestine model. Later on, the model was extended to other elastic reactions. However, a survey of literature shows that it has been successful only in the diffraction peak region. It has been shown that the pristine Chou-Yange model can explain the differential cross section for deuteron-deuteron elastic scattering at\u0393\u00ea\u00dc s= 53 GeV in the diffraction peak region. In order to fit the large momentum transfer data, the generalized Chou-Yang model is used", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["12"]}

Branhamella catarrhalis (formerly Neisseria catarrhalis) has also been regarded as a normal respiratory commensal, but reports indicate that it can be pathogenic. The role of Neisseria spp was studied in 160 patients with chest infections and symptoms and signs of obstructive respiratory disease. Group I patients (n= 140) had a history of asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema. Group II patients (n= 20) had an initially responsive pulmonary tuberculosis but presented with fever and obstructive airway disease. Group I patients had disease that was difficult to control despite increased bronchodilator therapy, but they responded dramatically after two to three days of appropriate antibiotic therapy. Patients in group II showed a similar response to erythromycin. Neisseria infection was responsible for precipitating or exacerbating respiratory distress in both groups. Accordingly, it is concluded that Neisseria can be pathogenic and that patients with fever and obstructive respiratory symptoms require treatment.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["12"]}

The expectation of obtaining the phase shifts with an attractive part only arises because in previous investigations it had been found that the repulsive part needed for the higher partial waves was effectively masked by the large centrifugal barriers. In fact, it was found that the G-wave phase shifts can be reproduced even without any repulsive part. The phase shifts for lower l values, however, needed some repulsion. Since potential (3) used in the present work has a different shape and flexibility, it is worth-while exploring if the repulsive part is really essential for the lower partial waves. Naturally, we started with an attractive part only and looked for a common set of parameters. In fact, it turned out that such a set does exist. The potential corresponding to this set (U= 127.5~ eV, ro= 1.15 fm, a= 0.6 fm) is plotted\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["12"]}
