Tilting-rotor quadcopter is a more agile version of conventional quadcopter as the propeller motors are actuated to tilt about the quadcopter arm. The tilt-rotor quad-copter is capable of following complex trajectories with ease. In this paper, we employ differential flatness based feed-forward position control by utilizing a combination of propeller rotational speeds along with rotor tilts. The rotational motion of propellers work simultaneously in sync with propeller tilts to control the position and orientation of the UAV during autonomous flight.

{"title": "Stabilizing and control of tilting-rotor quadcopter in case of a propeller failure\n", "abstract": " In this paper, stability and control of tilting-rotor quadcopters is presented upon failure of one propeller during flight. A tilting rotor quadcopter provides advantage in terms of additional stable configurations and maneuverability. Upon failure of one propeller, a traditional quadcopter has a tendency of spinning about the primary axis fixed to the vehicle as an outcome of the asymmetry about the yaw axis. This forces the quadcopter to land abandoning its mission. The tilting-rotor configuration is an over-actuated form of a traditional quadcopter and it is capable of handling a propeller failure, thus making it a fault tolerant system. In this paper, a dynamic model of tilting-rotor quadcopter with one propeller failure is derived and a controller is designed to achieve hovering and navigation capability.

This design is capable of morphing the shape of the UAV during flight to achieve position and attitude control. We consider a dynamic center of gravity (CoG) which causes continuous variation in a moment of inertia (MoI) parameters of the UAV.

This UAV falls in the category of multirotors with tilt-motion enabled rotors. Since the vehicle considered is over-actuated in nature, the dynamics and control allocation have to be analysed carefully. Moreover, the possibility of hovering at large attitude maneuvers of this novel vehicle requires singularity-free attitude control. Hence, quaternion state feedback is utilized to compute the control commands for the UAV motors while avoiding the gimbal lock condition experienced by Euler angle based controllers. The quaternion implementation also reduces the overall complexity of state estimation due to absence of trigonometric parameters.
