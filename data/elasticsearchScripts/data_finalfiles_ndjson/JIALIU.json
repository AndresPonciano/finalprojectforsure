{"title": "In situ electro-sequencing in three-dimensional tissues\n", "abstract": " Pairwise mapping of single-cell gene expression and electrophysiology in intact three-dimensional (3D) tissues is crucial for studying electrogenic organs (e.g., brain and heart). Here, we introduce in situ electro-sequencing (electro-seq), combining soft bioelectronics with in situ RNA sequencing to stably map millisecond-timescale cellular electrophysiology and simultaneously profile a large number of genes at single-cell level across 3D tissues. We applied in situ electro-seq to 3D human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte (hiPSC-CM) patches, precisely registering the CM gene expression with electrophysiology at single-cell level, enabling multimodal in situ analysis. Such multimodal data integration substantially improved the dissection of cell types and the reconstruction of developmental trajectory from spatially heterogeneous tissues. Using machine learning (ML)-based cross-modal analysis, in situ electro-seq identified the gene-to-electrophysiology relationship over the time course of cardiac maturation. Further leveraging such a relationship to train a coupled autoencoder, we demonstrated the prediction of single-cell gene expression profile evolution using long-term electrical measurement from the same cardiac patch or 3D millimeter-scale cardiac organoids. As exemplified by cardiac tissue maturation, in situ electro-seq will be broadly applicable to create spatiotemporal multimodal maps and predictive models in electrogenic organs, allowing discovery of cell types and gene programs responsible for electrophysiological function and dysfunction.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["7"]}

Electrets are dielectrics that trap charges or dipoles. Applications include electrophotography, microphones, air filters, and energy harvesters. To trap charges or dipoles for a long time, electrets are commonly made of hard dielectrics. Stretchable dielectrics are short\u0393\u00c7\u00f4lived electrets. The two properties, longevity and stretchability, conflict; existing electrets struggle to attain both. This work describes an approach to developing stretchable electrets. Nanoparticles of a hard electret are immobilized in a matrix of dielectric elastomer. The composite divides the labor of two functions: the particles trap charges with longevity, and the matrix enables stretchability. The design considerably broadens the choice of materials to enable stretchable electrets. Silica nanoparticles in the\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["7"]}

The probe may be formed from relatively flexible materials such as polymers, and in some cases, the probes may comprises nanoscale wires or other electronic components. The probe may be cooled to a temperature that causes the probe to harden, eg, to a temperature below a glass transition temperature, prior to insertion, to facilitate the insertion of the probe into the tissue. s", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["7"]}
{"title": "ClusterMap for multi-scale clustering analysis of spatial gene expression\n", "abstract": " Quantifying RNAs in their spatial context is crucial to understanding gene expression and regulation in complex tissues. In situ transcriptomic methods generate spatially resolved RNA profiles in intact tissues. However, there is a lack of a unified computational framework for integrative analysis of in situ transcriptomic data. Here, we introduce an unsupervised and annotation-free framework, termed ClusterMap, which incorporates the physical location and gene identity of RNAs, formulates the task as a point pattern analysis problem, and identifies biologically meaningful structures by density peak clustering (DPC). Specifically, ClusterMap precisely clusters RNAs into subcellular structures, cell bodies, and tissue regions in both two-and three-dimensional space, and performs consistently on diverse tissue types, including mouse brain, placenta, gut, and human cardiac organoids.

{"title": "A method for three-dimensional single-cell chronic electrophysiology from developing brain organoids\n", "abstract": " Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived brain organoids have shown great potential for studies of human brain development and neurological disorders. However, quantifying the evolution and development of electrical functions in brain organoids is currently limited by measurement techniques that cannot provide long-term stable three-dimensional (3D) bioelectrical interfaces with brain organoids during development. Here, we report a cyborg brain organoid platform, in which 2D progenitor or stem cell sheets can fold \"tissue-like\" stretchable mesh nanoelectronics through organogenesis, distributing stretchable electrode arrays across 3D organoids. The tissue-wide integrated stretchable electrode arrays show no interruption to neuronal differentiation, adapt to the volume and morphological changes during organogenesis, and provide long-term stable electrical contacts with neurons within brain organoids during development. The seamless and non-invasive coupling of electrodes to neurons enables a 6-month continuous recording of the same brain organoids and captures the emergence of single-cell action potentials from early-stage brain organoid development.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["7"]}

Accordingly, such cell scaffolds can be used to grow cells or tissues which can be determined and/or controlled at very high resolutions, due to the presence of the nanoscale wires, and such cell scaffolds will find use in a wide variety of novel applications, including applications in tissue engineering, prosthetics, pacemakers, implants, or the like.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["7"]}
