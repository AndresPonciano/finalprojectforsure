Reflective middleware exploits Gregory Kiczales\u2019 meta-object protocol, combining the ideas of computational reflection and object orientation. 9 His model distinguishes between base-level objects (concerning the systems\u2019 functional aspects) and metalevel objects (concerning aspects such as policies, mechanisms, or strategies). The base level of reflective middleware addresses the application program\u2019s functionality, while the metalevel designates collections of components that form the internal architecture of the middleware platform. Reflection allows the inspection and modification of these objects, enabling changes in the middleware\u2019s behavior.As computer networks become pervasive and portable, and as embedded and handheld devices become more common, mobile users are creating a demand for a plethora of ubiquitous services. Because ubiquitous computing is characterized by constant change and a large degree of dynamism, users must interact with heterogeneous systems using different devices at different locations over different networks with different quality-of-service requirements. They must also share the systems with many other users. In practical terms, it is difficult to devise a fixed set of policies and mechanisms for communication, security, and resource allocation that accommodates such diversity, change, and scale.", "num_citations": "257\n", "authors": ["840"]}

This survey discusses the state-of-the-art of SFL, including the different techniques that have been proposed, the type and number of faults they address, the types of spectra they use, the programs they utilize in their validation, the testing data that support them, and their use at industrial settings. Notwithstanding the advances, there are still challenges for the industry to adopt these techniques, which we analyze in this paper. SFL techniques should propose new ways to generate reduced sets of suspicious entities, combine different spectra to fine-tune the fault localization ability, use strategies to collect fine-grained coverage levels from suspicious coarser levels for balancing execution costs and output precision, and propose new techniques to cope with multiple-fault programs. Moreover, additional user studies are needed to understand better how SFL techniques can be used in practice.

In this paper, we argue that mobile agents, due to its inherent flexibility, can bring a number of benefits to pervasive computing systems. Furthermore, we propose a novel architecture that uses mobile agents to perform three common tasks of pervasive computing more efficiently: system adaptation, component updates and QoS negotiation.", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["840"]}

Moreover, nascent ecosystems need a clear vision of how to develop their community to evolve towards a fruitful and sustainable ecosystem. This paper proposes a maturity model for software startup ecosystems based on a multiple case study of two existing ecosystems.

Briefly describing, data regarding the area subject to forecasting is split into smaller pieces, each one corresponding to a fraction of the total area. Each fragment is then assigned to a computing resource, typically a PC in a cluster, or a processor in a parallel machine. During the computation, each computational node needs to exchange data with others, since the forecasting in each of the fragments is influenced by neighboring areas. After several hours of processing, the results of the computation are expected to reflect the weather of the given area for a certain period, a few days for example. Figure 1 shows the results of a simulation where the total area was divided in 16 fragments. In order to perform a computation such as the one described, one typically uses dedicated infrastructures, such as parallel machines or dedicated clusters. Institutions typically have a limited amount of these resources, which are disputed by many users who needs processing power.

{"title": "A pattern language for adaptive distributed systems\n", "abstract": " Modern computing environments are characterized by a high level of dynamism. Two major kinds of dynamic changes occur frequently. The first refers to structural changes such as hardware and software upgrades, protocol and API updates, and operating system evolution. The second refers to dynamic changes in the availability of memory, CPU, network bandwidth and, in mobile systems, connectivity and location. Drastic changes may occur in a few seconds, impacting the performance of user applications profoundly. Among existing production software systems few offer support for managing, adapting, and reacting to these changes; most of the times, all the work is left to users and system administrators who must take care of them manually.Fortunately, this scenario is gradually changing as researchers in academia and industry investigate elegant and robust ways to build self-adaptive systems for the dynamic, distributed environments of the future. In this paper we present a pattern language that captures some of the most relevant problems and solutions faced by developers who accept the challenge of building automatically configurable and adaptive distributed systems.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["840"]}

However, it is still difficult to develop efficient, reliable, and dynamically con gurable component-based systems. Components are often developed by different groups with different methodologies. Unspecified dependencies and behavior lead to unexpected failures. We argue that component-based software systems must maintain explicit representations of inter-component dependence and component requirements. This provides a common ground for supporting fault-tolerance and automating dynamic reconfiguration. In this paper, we present a generic model for reifying dependencies in distributed component systems. We describe our experience deploying our framework in a reective ORB and discuss the use of this model in a new distributed operating system.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["840"]}

Nevertheless, most of these projects fail to attract people and never become active. To minimize this problem, we developed a theoretical model around a crucial construct (attractiveness) to open source projects, proposing its causes (project characteristics), indicators (eg, number of members) and consequences (levels of activeness, efficiency, likelihood of task completion, time for task completion and software quality). We tested this model empirically using 3 samples of over 4600 projects each in a multi-sample SEM analysis. The results confirm the central role that attractiveness plays to guarantee an active and efficient community of software development, shedding new light on whether more developers increase software quality by finding and fixing more bugs and providing upgrades. They also clarify the actual causal structure involving Web page visits, downloads and members, which can be easily mistaken. Moreover, the results can provide useful insights to strategists as we discuss the impacts of license restrictiveness, software development status, type of project and intended audience on attractiveness and its consequences.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["840"]}

{"title": "Dynamic resource allocation using performance forecasting\n", "abstract": " To benefit from the performance gains and cost savings enabled by elasticity in cloud IaaS environments, effective automated mechanisms for scaling are essential. This automation requires monitoring system status and defining criteria to trigger allocation and deallocation of resources. While these criteria are usually based upon resource utilization, this may be inadequate due to the impossibility of identifying the actual amount of required resources. Consequently, most systems update resource allocation in small increments, e.g., one VM at a time, which may negatively affect performance and cost. In this paper, we propose a novel approach in which the system monitors workload, instead of utilization, and, by means of a scalability model, it makes predictions of resource demand and updates the allocated resources accordingly.

{"title": "Downloading Musical Signs\n", "abstract": " In 1977, the Voyager interplanetary probes 1 and 2 were launched into space. Their mission was to send back to the Earth information about the outer planetary system and the limits of the solar system. Although their transmissions were not meant to last more than a few decades, the Voyagers also carry a more long lasting idea: to project our communication with the future. Both spacecrafts include a phonograph golden record containing natural sounds from the Earth and pieces of music produced by different cultures and eras. In the recorded information, one can find the first movement of Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 2 in F, Azerbaijani bagpipes, Senegalese percussion, and the Latin phrase Ad astra per aspera (To the stars through difficulties) in Morse code. The hope that, in a distant future, this little piece of human culture may be discovered by an alien civilization reminds us of lost seamen sending messages in bottles thrown into the sea.The idea of projecting culture in time has always been present in the development of the human kind, oscillating between the recuperation and maintenance of past values and knowledge and the quest for something that would bring us a step closer to the future. These two poles have been present in the history of music; either as a celebration of certain compositional procedures or in the revolutions that ended up destroying them. Eventually, a certain period or segment of our culture experiences a state of stability in which the music does not look for the past or the future, but only its presentness.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["840"]}

For digital games, this uniqueness reduces the opportunity for software reuse.

Despite that potential, existing research on game development lacks a comprehensive analysis of how game mechanics could benefit from the field of software architecture. This limits the opportunities for developers and researchers alike to benefit from findings on the subject.

The automation of resource management, known as elasticity, has been subject to much research. In this context, monitoring of a running service plays a crucial role, and adjustments are made when certain thresholds are crossed. On such occasions, it is common practice to simply add or remove resources. In this paper we investigate how we can predict the performance of a service to dynamically adjust allocated resources based on predictions. In other words, instead of \u201crepairing\u201d because a threshold has been crossed, we attempt to stay ahead and allocate an optimized amount of resources in advance. To do so, we need to have accurate predictive models that are based on workloads.

Due these characteristics, simple web services can be combined in more complete ones by using: orchestration or choreographies. In an orchestration, a central node (the orchestrator) coordinates the flow of information from other participating services. Although straightforward and simple, its centralized nature leads to scalability. As a solution, choreographies have been proposed as decentralized and scalable solutions for composing web services. Nevertheless, inherent characteristics of SOA such as dynamicity, third-party and governance issues, and the decentralized flow of information, make the automated testing of choreographies difficult. The goal of this research is to present Rehearsal: a framework for automated testing of choreographies to support Test-Driven Development (TDD) of choreographies. This framework provides a set of features to assist the choreography developer during choreography testing. Through this framework:(i) choreography elements can be manipulated as Java Objects;(ii) web service operations can be invoked dynamically; and (iii) messages exchanged in the choreography can be intercepted and analyzed. Since real choreographies involve multiple internal and external services, the framework also provides mechanisms for mocking web services or invoking them in their real environments.

We tested this model empirically using 3 samples of over 4600 projects each in a multi-sample SEM analysis. The results confirm the central role that attractiveness plays to guarantee an active and efficient community of software development, shedding new light on whether more developers increase software quality by finding and fixing more bugs and providing upgrades.

{"title": "A Middleware System for Distributed Real-Time Multimedia Processing\n", "abstract": " The development of distributed applications for Multimedia processing with real-time and low-latency requirements faces a few key challenges. In this paper, we characterize such applications as \u201cfirm real-time applications\u201d, argue that they should be based on a callback architecture, and discuss the associated network limitations. We present a new middleware system addressing the challenges discussed and describe an application for distributed audio processing built on top of this middleware. Experimental results obtained with this application demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["840"]}
{"title": "CompositeCalls: A Design Pattern for Efficient and Flexible Client-Server Interaction\n", "abstract": " What do well-known techniques such as gather/scatter for input/output, code downloading for system extension, message batching, mobile agents, and deferred calls for disconnected operation have in common? Despite being rather different techniques, all of them share a common piece of design (and, possibly, implementation) as their cornerstone: the CompositeCalls design pattern.All techniques mentioned above are designed for multiple-domain1applications. In all of them, multiple operations are bundled together and then sent to a different domain, where they are executed. In some cases, the objective is to reduce the number of domain-crossings. In other cases, it is to allow for dynamic server extension.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["840"]}
{"title": "Towards a grand unified framework for mobile objects\n", "abstract": " Distributed object systems (DOS) are usually implemented as middleware which repeats and undoes a significant amount of work performed by the underlying operating system [3]. This introduces overhead and leads to distinct, incompatible middleware implementations. Therefore, basic mechanisms are not usually shared. If mobility and replication rely on common techniques and mechanisms no matter the application domain, why are these mechanisms not shared?", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["840"]}
{"title": "Interaction and Distribution of Execution Environments in 2K\n", "abstract": " The scaling of the computing infrastructure in distribution and heterogeneity is correlated to increasing complexity in navigation and management at the execution environment level. In 2K, which is a user-centric, distributed and adaptable operating system, computation occurs in environments that are customizable to the user requirements and to the characteristics of the host computing systems. A 2K environment is a container of components, devices and conguration parameters and provides an execution context for users within the distributed system. The management of 2K execution environments contributes to the user-centrism of the system, by aggregating all the computing contexts of a user in a composite structure, accessible anywhere in the scope of 2K. The structures of composite environments interact within themselves and with one another, and are correlated since actions in certain environments imply actions in others. In this paper, we describe event management in aggregated st...", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["840"]}
{"title": "Heterogeneidade como solu\u00e7 ao para bancos de dados m\u00f3veis em um sistema de saude\n", "abstract": " In Brazil, Healthcare Centers (Centros de Sa\u00fade) play the role of primary healthcare provider under the National Unified Health System (SUS). The system comprises programs such as the Family Health Program (PSF) in which health professionals provide healthcare in the patient\u2019s home. The Borboleta project offers a system in which these professionals use mobile devices with a specialized database for consulting and recording user health data. In this paper, we argue that there are benefits in adopting a different model in this database, called the mobile database, with respect to the healthcare center database, ie, the databases should be heterogeneous. This approach requires a data transforming process, in which we use XML, XSLT, and REST.Resumo.
