Design: Systematic review of trials.   Measurements and main results: We found no study that assessed Ayurvedic as a system of care. Botanical therapy was by far the most commonly studied Ayurvedic treatment. Herbs were studied either singly or as formulas. In all, 993 titles in Western computerized databases and 318 titles identified by hand-searching journals in India were examined, yield ing 54 articles reporting the results of 62 studies. The most-studied herbs were G sylvestre, C indica, fenugreek, and Eugenia jambo/ana. A number of herbal formulas were tested, but Ayush- 82 and 0 -400 were most often studied. Thirty-five of the studies included came from the Western literature, 27 from the Indian. Seven were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 10 controlled clinical trials (CCTs) or natural experiments. Twenty-two studies went on to further analysis based on a set of criteria. Of these, 10 were RCTs, eCTs, or natural experiments, 12 were case series or cohort studies. There is evidence to suggest that the herbs C indica, holy basil, fenugreek, and G sylvestre, and the herbal formulas Ayush-82 and 0 -400 have a glucose-lowering effect and deserve further study.

{"title": "The challenge of determining appropriate Care in the era of patient-centered care and rising health care costs\n", "abstract": " Appropriateness of care is typically determined in the United States by evidence on efficacy and safety, combined with the judgments of experts in research and clinical practice, but without consideration of the cost of care or patient preferences. The shift in focus towards patient-centered care calls for consideration of outcomes that are important to patients, accommodation of patient preferences, and incorporation of the costs of care in patient-provider shared clinical decisions. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness method was designed to determine rates of appropriate or inappropriate care, but the method did not include patient preferences or costs. This essay examines how methods of studying appropriateness can be made more patient-centered by describing a modification of the RAND/UCLA method by including patient outcomes, preferences, and costs.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["2091"]}

In 2008, at the request of the Samueli Institute, RAND Health conducted an informal one-day workshop on the use of dietary supplements for performance enhancement and on regulatory issues affecting dietary supplements. The workshop included a panel of experts who considered the following questions What types of policies and regulations currently exist regarding the use of dietary supplements in civilian-sector groups, such as among athletes and those whose jobs demand high levels of physical or cognitive performance What types of policies currently exist in the commercial domain around the point-of-sale for dietary supplements What kind of regulations does the military currently have in place with respect to the use and purchase of dietary supplements If it so chose, what could the military do to regulate the use of dietary supplements The purpose of this conference proceeding is to summarize the workshop that occurred on September 16, 2008.
