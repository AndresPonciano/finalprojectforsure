{"title": "ACCESS: A Toolset for Safety Case Creation and Management P. Steele; University of Virginia; Charlottesville, Virginia, USA KR Collins; University of Virginia; Charlottesville\u00a0\u2026\n", "abstract": " Strategies and methods for ensuring adequate system safety have developed in recent years to adapt to the everincreasing complexity of safety-critical systems. One of these new methods is the safety case with a rigorous safety argument documented in the Goal Structuring Notation (GSN). GSN has been shown to improve structure, clarity, and rigor of safety arguments, and to support better safety case maintenance. Despite the advantages of GSN, safety cases using GSN can still be difficult to manage. For real systems that need to integrate heterogeneous systems into a whole, GSN arguments tend to be large, complex and difficult to reason about. This paper presents ACCESS, a toolset designed to support creation, inspection, validation, maintenance, and other activities related to GSN that helps engineers document their belief in the adequacy of the safety of their system.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1499"]}
