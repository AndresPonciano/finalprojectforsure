{"title": "A framework of knowledge management systems: issues and challenges for theory and practice\n", "abstract": " As the basis of value creation increasingly depends on the leverage of the intangible assets of firms, knowledge management systems (KMS) are emerging as powerful sources of competitive advantage. However, the general recognition of the importance of such systems seems to be accompanied by a technology-induced drive to implement systems with inadequate consideration of the fundamental knowledge problems that the KMS are likely to solve. This paper contributes to the stream of research on knowledge management systems by proposing an inductively developed framework for this important class of information systems, classifying KMS based on the locus of the knowledge and the a priori structuring of contents. This framework provides a means to explore issues related to KMS and unifying dimensions underlying different types of KMS. The contingencies that we discuss\u2014the size and diversity of networks, the maintenance of knowledge flows and the long term effects of the use of KMS\u2014provide a window into work in a number of reference disciplines that would enrich the utility of KMS and also open up fruitful areas for future research.", "num_citations": "425\n", "authors": ["907"]}

With a larger online referral network, consumers are exposed to higher volume of WOM.

Next, we theorize the dynamic impacts of a broader reach of WOM on market structures in terms of market life duration and size via an agent-based simulation model.

Moreover, when we compare corporate venture capitalists (CVCs) with independent venture capitalists (IVCs), obtaining crowdfunding is positively\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["907"]}
{"title": "The role of project modularity in information systems development\n", "abstract": " Recent surveys have shown that ISD project success rates are particularly low. Organizations are applying a wide array of information systems development methodologies (ISDMs)\u2013both plan-based and agile, such as waterfall, scrum and XP\u2013to improve information systems development (ISD) performance. However, as ISD projects often have different characteristics such as size, scope and complexity, prior studies have been focused on helping organizations better choose an ISDM for projects. Nevertheless, prior research has not taken into consideration the notion of problem modularity of ISD projects. In this study, we utilize the NK fitness landscapes model to computationally examine via computer simulations the effects of problem modularity alongside various project environmental factors, and aim to answer the question: under various environmental factors, which ISDM should an ISD team adopt under various degree of problem modularity?", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["907"]}
{"title": "Measuring the effectiveness of e-commerce website design and its impact on business value\n", "abstract": " This dissertation consists of three essays that offer an in depth analysis of the impact of e-commerce website design. The first essay presents a conceptual framework for understanding the efficacy of systems design for Internet-based selling. Using the conceptualization of online shopping as information processing (ie, purchase decision making), I characterize the online purchasing process as information foraging, which makes it possible to conceptualize the effectiveness of website design in terms of how well the website enables the consumer to achieve high levels of return on information foraging. I present a framework that identifies purchase decision-making contingencies in the context of three different consumer purchase scenarios. The framework is illustrated and evaluated with reference to mini-cases for each of the purchase scenarios. The results of the mini-case analyses suggest a number of design\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["907"]}
{"title": "Popularity and Competition in a Digital Platform Ecosystem: A Network Perspective\n", "abstract": " Competition in popular digital platform ecosystems is fierce. How to get recognized in a platform system is an important theoretical and practical question. Past research looked at the issue from either demand-side or supply-side network externality. Drawing on the insight that digital innovation is (re) combinatorial, we offer a complementary approach based on a network perspective. Specifically, we argue that that the essential value of a digital ecosystem is determined by the recursive feedback of the functional fit of digital products that eventually allows the structure of a digital ecosystem to evolve and change over time. We adopt a network perspective to propose the underlying mechanism of the multi-layered dynamics between digital products and the uncoordinated design actions of third-party developers. We analyze the source code data of all available packages from the R platform system from the beginning of 1991 to September 2016. We statistically capture the value of the generative role of digital products developed by others on increasing the popularity of new digital products and the change driven by the (re) combinatorial design pattern of third-party developers.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["907"]}
{"title": "Tapping the Crowd for Feedback: The Dynamics of Strategic Behaviors in Crowdfunding\n", "abstract": " Crowdfunding is a novel mechanism for sourcing financial capital for entrepreneurial ventures. The IT-enabled nature of crowdfunding platforms facilitates entrepreneurs to interact directly with current and prospective backers and to obtain timely and immediate feedback from the market during the fundraising process. Despite the dynamic nature of this process, there is a notable dearth of attention to it. The present study strives to fill this gap by examining the influences of fundraising patterns on entrepreneurs\u2019 strategic behaviors for managing the project during the course of fundraising. Drawing upon the performance feedback model from the behavioral theory of the firm, we propose hypotheses related to the influences of concurrent funding performance on entrepreneurs\u2019 exploitative and explorative actions, and the role of deadline proximity in these relationships. The proposed hypotheses will be empirically tested using a unique dataset that contains daily snapshots of crowdfunding projects. Expected theoretical and practical contributions are discussed.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["907"]}

The second examines the measurement of the effectiveness e-commerce web site design\u2013how can we conceptualize and measure the effectiveness of an e-commerce web site?, can we identify web site design inefficiencies? For this, we define the concept of web site design efficiency as the degree to which the intended usage of a web site matches a customer\u2019s actual usage given her current shopping goal. We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of an ecommerce web site using data envelopment analysis (DEA) on clickstream data. Finally, the third study investigates the business value of e-commerce site design\u2013does web site design efficiency translate into business value?, what are the sources of business value created?

{"title": "Handling Missing Values in Information Systems Research: A Review of Methods and Assumptions\n", "abstract": " In today\u2019s big data environment, missing values continues to be a problem that harms the data quality. The bias caused by missing values raises the highest concern as it cannot be eliminated simply by increasing the sample size. Although the statistics literature has developed approaches to handling missing values and formulated assumptions regarding when these approaches generate valid statistical inferences, these prescriptions have yet to be broadly accepted by many social science disciplines including the Information Systems (IS) discipline. By reviewing recently published empirical research in information systems, we find that missing values is indeed an important and pervasive problem. We believe that a review of missing value theory is necessary for the IS community to understand the nature of missing values and to promote more rigorous research practice when missing values is often unavoidable. In addition, the not missing at random (NMAR) mechanism brings in challenges in parameter estimation. We contribute to research practice by proposing and demonstrating the superior performance of a Monte Carlo likelihood approach in correcting bias in parameter estimation. We conclude by suggesting that research validity can be enhanced through reasoned adoption of missing value handling method and missing value reporting practice.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["907"]}
{"title": "The effects of programming style on open source collaboration\n", "abstract": " Open source software (OSS) development has recently garnered much attention from both industry practitioners and academic researchers. However, existing research on OSS usually focus on the role of behavioral factors in affecting collaboration outcomes but has neglected to critically consider the nature of software itself. In this study, we seek to integrate collaboration factors and software factors in OSS collaboration. Specifically, we investigate the role of programming style in open source collaboration, where strict guidelines for coding are usually not enforced. We develop three implications of programming style on contributor, development and diffusion from a diversity perspective. Additionally, two team level factors that moderate the negative effects of programming style are discussed. A comprehensive measure for quantifying programming style is proposed and verified in our preliminary investigation. Our study is expected to contribute to the literature on OSS development, software engineering and diversity in distributed work groups.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["907"]}

{"title": "The Complex Effects of Cross-Domain Knowledge on IS Development: A Simulation-Based Theory Development\n", "abstract": " Information systems development (ISD) requires both business domain and technology domain knowledge. How cross-domain knowledge affects ISD outcomes is one of the most fundamental and persistent problems in the IS field. We argue that the effect of cross-domain knowledge depends on its distribution across business and IT units and ISD complexity in terms of level and pattern of design element interdependencies. We systematically investigate the complex effects of cross-domain knowledge on ISD performance by using simulations based on the NK fitness landscapes model. We find that cross-domain knowledge not only increases ISD performance but also reduces its variability. These effects are greater when ISD complexity is greater. Cross-domain knowledge is found to increase the robustness of ISD performance across different patterns of design element interdependencies. Interestingly, ISD performance is higher when cross-domain knowledge is unevenly distributed across business and IS units and when its distribution pattern matches the pattern of the design element interdependencies. We develop a theoretical framework and propositions based on our findings.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["907"]}

In this study, we investigate whether and how we can use transfer learning (ie, training a model using large but potentially less relevant data sets consisting of both historical and recent source data) when there is only a small amount of source data that exhibits the target data pattern. We provide theoretical insights on when and to what extent transfer learning works by using a sample selection perspective to represent changes. We conduct simulation analyses to examine two practical tradeoffs data analysts face with data changes\u20131) whether or not they should use transfer learning to retrain the prediction model, and 2) whether they should adjust the prediction model immediately or later when more timely-relevant source data becomes available.

This economic model is used to study the impact of a new technology on the supply of information that is produced in terms of both its quality and quantity. Our results show that reduction in costs and relaxation of capacity constraints lead to an increase and decrease, respectively, in the quality of articles produced by a publisher.
