In this paper, we suggest a genetic algorithm for the QAP and report its computational behavior. The genetic algorithm incorporates many greedy principles in its design and, hence, we refer to it as a greedy genetic algorithm. The ideas we incorporate in the greedy genetic algorithm include (i) generating the initial population using a randomized construction heuristic; (ii) new crossover schemes; (iii) a special purpose immigration scheme that promotes diversity; (iv) periodic local optimization of a subset of the population; (v) tournamenting among different populations; and (vi) an overall design that attempts to strike a balance between diversity and a bias towards fitter individuals.

The resulting abstractions are always discrete transition systems which can then be used by any traditional analysis tool. The constructed abstractions are conservative and can be used to establish safety properties of the original system. Our technique works on linear and non-linear polynomial hybrid systems, that is, the guards on discrete transitions and the continuous flows in all modes can be specified using arbitrary polynomial expressions over the continuous variables. We have a prototype tool in the SAL environment [13] which is built over the theorem prover PVS [19].

We characterize the sets of predicates that can be used to create high quality abstractions and we present new approaches to discover such useful sets of predicates.

The semantics of Stateflow is quite complex and it is valuable if these designs can be formally analyzed for both early error detection and positive assurance.It is important that formal analysis should be unobtrusive and acceptable to engineering practice. We motivate a methodology called \u201cinvisible formal methods\u201d that provides a graded sequence of formal analysis technologies ranging from extended typechecking, through approximation and abstraction, to model checking and theorem proving. As an instance of invisible formal methods, we describe the formal semantics of a fragment of Stateflow based on a modular representation called communicating pushdown automata.

All the steps, from model generation to the simplification of the reachable set, have been automated using a variety of decision procedure and theorem-proving tools. The concluding example computes the reach set for a four cell network with 8 continuous and 256 discrete states.

Increasingly, these deep NNs are also been deployed in high-assurance applications. Thus, there is a pressing need for developing techniques to verify neural networks to check whether certain user-expected properties are satisfied. In this paper, we study a specific verification problem of computing a guaranteed range for the output of a deep neural network given a set of inputs represented as a convex polyhedron. Range estimation is a key primitive for verifying deep NNs. We present an efficient range estimation algorithm that uses a combination of local search and linear programming problems to efficiently find the maximum and minimum values taken by the outputs of the NN over the given input set. In contrast to recently proposed \"monolithic\" optimization approaches, we use local gradient descent to repeatedly find and eliminate local minima of the function. The final global optimum is certified using a mixed integer programming instance. We implement our approach and compare it with Reluplex, a recently proposed solver for deep neural networks.

{"title": "Learning task specifications from demonstrations\n", "abstract": " Real world applications often naturally decompose into several sub-tasks. In many settings (e.g., robotics) demonstrations provide a natural way to specify the sub-tasks. However, most methods for learning from demonstrations either do not provide guarantees that the artifacts learned for the sub-tasks can be safely recombined or limit the types of composition available. Motivated by this deficit, we consider the problem of inferring Boolean non-Markovian rewards (also known as logical trace properties or specifications) from demonstrations provided by an agent operating in an uncertain, stochastic environment. Crucially, specifications admit well-defined composition rules that are typically easy to interpret. In this paper, we formulate the specification inference task as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) probability inference problem, apply the principle of maximum entropy to derive an analytic demonstration likelihood model and give an efficient approach to search for the most likely specification in a large candidate pool of specifications. In our experiments, we demonstrate how learning specifications can help avoid common problems that often arise due to ad-hoc reward composition.", "num_citations": "43\n", "authors": ["281"]}

It consists of finding a unifier for a set of term equations containing first-order variables and context variables. In this paper we analyze the special case of context unification where the use of at most one context variable is allowed and show that it is in NP. The motivation for investigating this subcase of context unification is interprocedural program analysis for programs described using arbitrary terms, generalizing the case where terms were restricted to using unary function symbols. Our results imply that the redundancy problem is in coNP, and that the finite redundancy property holds in this case.

{"title": "Prediction of left ventricular dysfunction after device closure of patent ductus arteriosus: proposal for a new functional classification\n", "abstract": " Aims: The aims of this study were to determine the incidence and correlates of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction amongst percutaneous patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) device closure patients, and to propose an indexed parameter for predicting LV dysfunction.Methods and results: In a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of 30 months duration, 447 patients who underwent PDA device closure were studied. The diameter of the PDA at the pulmonary artery end was measured in the angiograms in all patients and was indexed for their body surface area. The indexed PDA size was categorised into group A (1-2.9 mm/m\u00b2, 35/447), B (3-5.9 mm/m\u00b2, 254/447), C (6-8.9 mm/m\u00b2, 66/447) and D (> 9 mm/m\u00b2, 35/447). Systolic LV function was evaluated using echocardiography at frequent intervals. Overall, 62.63% of the patients were female (280/447). At baseline, all 447 patients had normal LV function. LV dysfunction was seen in 102/447 (22.8%) patients with 2.8% in category A (1/35), 10.6% in category B (27/254), 34.1% in category C (42/123) and 91.4% in category D (32/35) after PDA device closure. Correlation of indexed PDA size and LV dysfunction was statistically significant (p< 0.05).Conclusions: Accurate prediction of LV dysfunction is important in risk stratification, ICU management and counselling in PDA device closures. Indexed PDA size correlates well with post-procedural LV dysfunction. The authors propose a new classification of PDA utilising this accurate, reproducible and easy to perform parameter, which does not involve any extra cost, for risk stratification and early management in device closure of PDA.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["281"]}

{"title": "Model checking of worm quarantine and counter-quarantine under a group defense\n", "abstract": " We consider what it means to perform worm quarantine across a network with an emerging self-propagating worm outbreak. It is generally understood that an effective quarantine defense can under certain conditions reduce the infection growth rate, and ideally can prevent a worm from reaching its full saturation potential. This report attempts to more precisely define the desired properties of a quarantine algorithm, and suggest different forms of quarantine properties that vary in their ability to isolate infected nodes, ensure the existence of an uninfected population, and guarantee some persistent protection, no matter how the worm behaves. We employ the SAL formal modeling language and model checker to investigate these properties on a specific group-based quarantine algorithm. In addition to answering questions regarding algorithm correctness and validating some quarantine properties, the model checker disproves other quarantine properties. The proofs and counter-examples produced during this process help in algorithm design and may be useful in informing simulation experiments or building test cases. Using a game theoretic approach, counter-examples of a win scenario for the defense yield insight into smart worm behavior that defeats a known quarantine defense. c\u00a9 2005 SRI International, 333 Ravenswood Avenue, Menlo Park, CA 94025.

{"title": "Theory of reals for verification and synthesis of hybrid dynamical systems\n", "abstract": " Real numbers are used to model all physical processes around us. The temperature of a room, the speed of a car, the angle of attack of an airplane, protein concentration in a cell, blood glucose concentration in a human, and the amount of chemical in a tank are a few of the countless quantities that arise in science and engineering and that are modeled using real-valued variables. Many of these physical quantities are now being controlled by embedded software running on some hardware platform. The resulting systems could possibly be communicating and coordinating with other such systems and reacting actively to changes in their environment. The net result is a complex cyber-physical system. Several such systems operate in safety-critical domains, such as transportation and health care, where failures can potentially cause a lot of financial as well as human life loss.

{"title": "Towards automated proofs of observational properties\n", "abstract": " Observational theories are a generalization of first-order theories where two objects are observationally equal if they cannot be distinguished by experiments with observable results. Such experiments, called contexts, are usually infinite. Therfore, we consider a special finite set of contexts, called cover-contexts, ''\\emphcovering'' all the observable contexts. Then, we show that to prove that two objects are observationally equal, it is sufficient to prove that they are equal (in the classical sense) under these cover-contexts. We give methods based on rewriting techniques, for constructing such cover-contexts for interesting classes of observational specifications.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["281"]}
{"title": "Congruence closure and syntactic unification\n", "abstract": " Kanellakis and Revesz 3] clari ed the directional duality between congruence closure and uni cation closure by showing suitable reductions from instances of one problem to instances of the other. We outline here a more direct relationship between computation of uni ers and construction of congruence closures by presenting a set of abstract transformation rules for syntactic uni cation plus congruence closure. We believe that this approach is also useful for practical purposes. The motivation for combining congruence closure construction with syntactic uni cation arises from several observations. First, an idempotent substitution can be characterized via the ground equational theory induced by the set of equations E obtained by interpreting the substitution assignment as mathematical equality (Proposition 1), and provability in a ground equational theory can be e ciently decided through the use of congruence closure 6]. Secondly, for e ciency reasons, both syntactic uni cation and congruence closure algorithms use a dag-based term representation. Furthermore, e cient algorithms for syntactic uni cation maintain a congruence relation on the vertices of the term dag using techniques for manipulating dags that are also common in congruence closure algorithms.We present a set of abstract transformation rules for syntactic uni cation that are similar to the standard rules except that we add a rule for explicit congruence closure computation. A detailed formulation of transformation rules for congruence closure has been presented in 2]. These rules are shown to suitably capture manipulation of term dags done in graph based congruence closure\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["281"]}

The structural characteristics, projected densities of states (PDOS), mechanical strength, optical, and adsorption properties have been calculated using first-principles based on density functional theory (DFT). The findings of the comparative and theoretical study showed that, amongst MN, HfN has comparatively higher optical conductivity. Its higher absorption coefficient and least reflectivity ensure the availability of adequate light on its surface. HfN is also found to be more thermally stable with cohesive energy of\u2212 19.112 eV/atom and formation enthalpy of\u2212 5.169 eV/atom.

Existing suppression strategies of charge injection effect for CIS and CDS circuits lack in accuracy because of the absence of knowledge of its effect with variation in major device parameters related to switching transistors viz. width ( W ), length ( L ), sense node capacitance ( Cpd ) and photon current ( I ph ). Therefore, variations in these parameters under the effect of charge injection have been experimentally studied. Based on the outcomes, it can be concluded that four-parameter logistic regression symmetrical sigmoid function is the best fit for the non-linearity introduced.

{"title": "Clocking scheme, Reset noise analysis and reduction technique for CMOS Image Sensors utilized in Subretinal Implant\n", "abstract": " A novel approach of on-chip clock generation and reset noise reduction using the charge pump phase locked loop (CP-PLL) for CMOS active pixel sensor cell (APS) used for subretinal implant system is proposed in this work. The dual role of CP-PLL (clock generation and noise reduction) is presented. The noise in both the popular type of pixel design techniques that is 3T and 4T/5T CMOS pixel sensor is analyzed first. Our investigation shows that accommodation of one extra transistor in CMOS-APS helps in reduction of noise i.e. 4T/5T APS are less noisy in comparison with 3T APS. The maximum noise values recorded for both the types of pixel is 740 mV/sqrt Hz and 1.12 V/sqrt Hz respectively. For analysis of noise under different light conditions, five different photon test currents in the range of 50pA-58pA was applied to APS. Utilizing the proposed methodology the noise for highest current value of 58pA is\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["281"]}
{"title": "Distribution of heavy metals in tissues of the Common carp, Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus, 1758 from the Ganga river, India\n", "abstract": " Heavy metals, ie Copper (Cu), Chromium (Cr), lead (Pb) and Zinc (Zn) were analyzed in Cyprinus carpio collected from the Ganga River at Kanpur and Allahabad sites, India during 2012 through 2013. Accumulation of heavy metals was estimated in different tissues of C. carpio. At both study sites (Kanpur and Allahabad), metal accumulation in different tissues of this fish was found to be in the following order: Zn> Pb> Cu> Cr in muscles, Zn> Pb> Cu> Cr in gills and Pb> Zn> Cu> Cr in liver. However, it was recorded that the level of heavy metals in all fish organs at the Kanpur site (except Pb and Zn in livers and Zn in gills) was higher as compared to the Allahabad site. The determined bioaccumulation factor of heavy metals in different organs at the Kanpur site was as follows: Cu (18.47), Cr (1.58), Pb (7.12), Zn (71.6) in muscles, Cu (33.78), Cr (2.96), Pb (11.86), Zn (89.97) in gills and Cu (45.63), Cr (3.19), Pb (2.5), Zn (68.6) in liver. Meanwhile, at the Allahabad site, the bioaccumulation factor was found to be slightly lower: Cu (23.92), Cr (0.78), Pb (11.93), Zn (87.23) in muscles, Cu (35.85), Cr (1.82), Pb (20.46), Zn (128.57) in gills and Cu (49.64), Cr (2.89), Pb (45.63), Zn (93.53) in liver.

{"title": "Non-monotonic program analysis\n", "abstract": " Traditionally, program analysis is formulated as computation of fixpoints using monotonic iteration of lattice-theoretic functions. Monotonicity is important because it ensures convergence of the analysis towards a fixpoint. Still, the idea of non-monotonic iteration is intriguing because such an analysis can cut short the search, potentially converging much faster than monotonic iteration. In this paper, we answer the question whether non-monotonic analyses are a worthwhile pursuit. We consider several non-monotonic algorithms for the specific problem of solving systems of Horn clauses. Our algorithms have in common that they (1) use logical abduction to span the search space of nonmonotonic iteration sequences, and (2) bound the non-monotonic search by a monotone sequence of checkpoints to enforce overall convergence. The algorithms differ in their search strategies, where the most interesting one performs an A*-like search. We have implemented these algorithms and compared them against existing monotonic analyses for solving Horn clauses. Our evaluation indicates that non-monotonic fixpoint iteration is a promising complementary technique to traditional program analyses.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["281"]}
{"title": "Non-linear rewrite closure and weak normalization\n", "abstract": " A rewrite closure is an extension of a term rewrite system with new rules, usually deduced by transitivity. Rewrite closures have the nice property that all rewrite derivations can be transformed into derivations of a simple form. This property has been useful for proving decidability results in term rewriting. Unfortunately, when the term rewrite system is not linear, the construction of a rewrite closure is quite challenging. In this paper, we construct a rewrite closure for term rewrite systems that satisfy two properties: the right-hand side term in each rewrite rule contains no repeated variable (right-linear) and contains no variable occurring at depth greater than one (right-shallow). The left-hand side term is unrestricted, and in particular, it may be non-linear. As a consequence of the rewrite closure construction, we are able to prove decidability of the weak normalization problem for right-linear right-shallow term\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["281"]}
{"title": "Mixed signal IC (CP-PLL) Testing scheme using a novel approach\n", "abstract": " An effective novel approach for built in self test is proposed in this paper, which is useful in Mixed signal IC testing (here CPPLL). The approach is useful in digital testing applications which can detect the fault in any of the block that is phase frequency detector, VCO, loop filter, or charge pump. The key advantage of this approach is that it uses all the existing elements for measuring and testing which reduces the area overhead for testing scheme. Restated, that the proposed architecture does not alter the analog blocks. Rather the proposed approach adds small circuits to PLL with slight modification for digital part. The testoutput generated is purely a digital output which certainly increases the realiability of the proposed BIST structure. A fault simulation result shows the charactericstics of the BIST structure that is high fault coverage of 98%.
