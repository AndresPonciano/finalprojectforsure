{"title": "Automated 3-D extraction and evaluation of the inner and outer cortical surfaces using a Laplacian map and partial volume effect classification\n", "abstract": " Accurate reconstruction of the inner and outer cortical surfaces of the human cerebrum is a critical objective for a wide variety of neuroimaging analysis purposes, including visualization, morphometry, and brain mapping. The Anatomic Segmentation using Proximity (ASP) algorithm, previously developed by our group, provides a topology-preserving cortical surface deformation method that has been extensively used for the aforementioned purposes. However, constraints in the algorithm to ensure topology preservation occasionally produce incorrect thickness measurements due to a restriction in the range of allowable distances between the gray and white matter surfaces. This problem is particularly prominent in pediatric brain images with tightly folded gyri. This paper presents a novel method for improving the conventional ASP algorithm by making use of partial volume information through probabilistic\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "836\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

{"title": "Hydrologic systems: watershed modeling\n", "abstract": " This book continues the discussion of Volume I on application of systems and control-theoretic concepts to analysis and synthesis of hydrologic systems. Recent years have witnessed a phenomenal surge in application of these concepts for devel-opment of watershed models, motivated partly by increased emphasis on environmental quality. Fragmented accounts of some of these models have appeared in many textbooks on hydrology. The motivation for writing this book stemmed from the desire to provide, under one cover, a comprehensive account of what is perceived to be required for development of these models, as well as for developing new and more comprehensive models to accomplish their intended purpose. This book is an outgrowth of lecture notes prepared for courses on hydrologic modeling taught to geoscience students at New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, and civil engineering students at the George Washington University, Mis-sissippi State University, and Louisiana State University. The criticisms and discussions offered by the students to some extent influenced the style of presentation in the book. Considerable effort has been made to discuss concepts and illustrate them with examples, even at the expense of increasing the size and having repetition. This style may appear somewhat less rigorous to a hydrologist, but it is deemed desirable for the person not knowing the subject.

{"title": "Permissiveness in transactional memories\n", "abstract": " We introduce the notion of permissiveness in transactional memories (TM). Intuitively, a TM is permissive if it never aborts a transaction when it need not. More specifically, a TM is permissive with respect to a safety property p if the TM accepts every history that satisfies p. Permissiveness, like safety and liveness, can be used as a metric to compare TMs. We illustrate that it is impractical to achieve permissiveness deterministically, and then show how randomization can be used to achieve permissiveness efficiently. We introduce Adaptive Validation STM (AVSTM), which is probabilistically permissive with respect to opacity; that is, every opaque history is accepted by AVSTM with positive probability. Moreover, AVSTM guarantees lock freedom. Owing to its permissiveness, AVSTM outperforms other STMs by up to 40% in read dominated workloads in high contention scenarios.

Tests are conducted on 100 kN servohydraulic universal testing machine under displacement mode of control, digital Rockwell hardness testing machine and impact testing machine. Modifying epoxy resin through bamboo fibres and improve mechanical properties is main focus of this study. Bamboo fibres at different wt%(20, 30 and 40) are filled in epoxy resin and the effects of mixing bamboo fibres on mechanical and physical properties are studied. On the basis of mechanical testing results it is found that 30 wt% of bamboo fibre mixed epoxy is giving optimum mechanical properties. The addition of bamboo fibres has improved tensile, flexural and impact properties of epoxy resin and increased water absorption of the material. On the basis of overall study the epoxy modified with 30% of bamboo fibre is found to be better than other combinations.", "num_citations": "53\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

Web services are the most popular mode of implementing service oriented architecture (SOA). With this growth and acceptance in the industry, the role of security is crucial. Most of the existing security mechanisms in Web services like XML encryption, digital signatures, user tokens etc. provide security on one basic assumption that source of the request is legitimate. But a typical denial of service attacker can use these sources as reflectors and play around with the contents of a Web service body to create an attack scenario. In this paper, we propose PreSODoS - a framework to detect and prevent XML based denial of service (XDoS) attacks on Web services based applications.

BBCH (Biologische Bundesantalt, Bundessortenamt and Chemische Industrie) scale was used for data recording and to assess utility of the scale in mango phenological studies. Phenological stages of the mango were recorded at weekly intervals on 60 shoots of cultivar Totapuri at five diverse locations for testing usefulness of scale under different diverse ecologies and data from one location, ie, Lucknow (26o 54 N and 80o 48 E) was used for analysis. Existing BBCH scale was modified on the basis of data recorded for mango in which seven out of 10 principal stages were used, starting with bud development (stage 0) and ending with maturity of fruit (stage 8). Three digit scale was used for inclusion of the mesostages between the principal and secondary growth stages. Highly recurring flowering phenophases were 511 (18%), 513 (20%) recorded in standard week 9 and 517 (45%) in standard week 11 (March). Other important phenophases, 619 (38%) and 709 (10%) occured during standard weeks 13 and 22 to 23, respectively. A high degree of variation in shoots representing principal growth stages viz., vegetative bud, leaf and shoot development was observed due to simultaneous transition of the stages during standard week 33 to 42 and 4 to 24. Limitations of existing BBCH scale and comprehended modifications have been proposed and discussed.

One of the immaculate biological fibers is the human hair. On the whole, three to four tons of human hair fibers are wasted in India annually; hence they pose an environmental challenge. In order to find commercial application the wasted human hair fibre is nowadays finding its use in the field of material science. Human hair is basically a nano-composite biological fiber with well characterized microstructures. Different techniques and technologies have been employed to study the different characteristics of the human hair to prove it a biological composite fiber. The main component of hair is keratin which is tough, insoluble and incredibly strong. An important aspect is that a single strand of hair can withstand the load of 100-150 grams. Hair is elastic and it is capable of regaining its original position on removal of the deformation load. Therefore, the present review paper reports the current scenario of human hair as biological composite fiber and its application in various fields.", "num_citations": "44\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

{"title": "Do nonpartisan programmatic policies have partisan electoral effects? Evidence from two large scale randomized experiments\n", "abstract": " A vast literature demonstrates that voters around the world who benefit from their governments' discretionary spending cast ballots for the incumbent party in larger proportions than those not receiving funds. But contrary to most theories of political accountability, the evidence seems to indicate that voters also reward incumbent parties for implementing ``programmatic'' spending legislation, over which incumbents have no discretion, and even when passed with support from all major parties. Why voters would attribute responsibility when none exists is unclear, as is why minority party legislators would approve of legislation that will cost them votes. We address this puzzle with one of the largest randomized social experiments ever, resulting in clear rejection of the claim, at least in this context, that programmatic policies greatly increase voter support for incumbents. We also reanalyze the study cited as claiming the strongest support for the electoral effects of programmatic policies, which is also a very large scale randomized experiment. We show that its key results vanish after correcting either a simple coding error affecting only two observations or highly unconventional data analysis procedures (or both). We discuss how these consistent empirical results from the only two probative experiments on this question may be reconciled with several observational and theoretical studies touching on similar questions in other contexts.", "num_citations": "40\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

There are less detailed genetic studies on the populations inhabited in this region. Therefore, this study is an attempt for extensive characterization of genetic ancestries of three tribal populations, namely; Bharia, Bhil and Sahariya, inhabiting this region using haploid and diploid DNA markers.   Methodology/Principal Findings Mitochondrial DNA analysis showed high diversity, including some of the older sublineages of M haplogroup and prominent R lineages in all the three tribes. Y-chromosomal biallelic markers revealed high frequency of Austroasiatic-specific M95-O2a haplogroup in Bharia and Sahariya, M82-H1a in Bhil and M17-R1a in Bhil and Sahariya. The results obtained by haploid as well as diploid genetic markers revealed strong genetic affinity of Bharia (a Dravidian speaking tribe) with the Austroasiatic (Munda) group. The gene flow from Austroasiatic group is further confirmed by their Y-STRs haplotype sharing analysis, where we determined their founder haplotype from the North Munda speaking tribe, while, autosomal analysis was largely in concordant with the haploid DNA results.   Conclusions/Significance Bhil exhibited largely Indo-European specific ancestry, while Sahariya and Bharia showed admixed genetic package of Indo-European and Austroasiatic populations.

This phone sensing-based method can potentially complement surveys, thus providing a cheaper, faster, automated method for generating insights into cooperation levels of users. Based on a 10-week field study involving 54 participants, we report that:(1) multiple phone-based signals were significantly associated with participant's cooperation attitudes; and (2) combining phone-based signals yielded a predictive model\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "37\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

The production, consumption and marketing of buffalo milk are higher than those of cow milk in the state. The number of cows per hundred buffaloes decreased tremendously during the last three decades which indicates that the farmers have shifted from cows to buffaloes as a source of milk. The possible reasons for this may be higher lactating efficiency, milk yield, quality of milk and feed conversion efficiency of buffaloes as compared to* cows. With the increase in demand for milk in the urban areas and concentration of milk production activity in the rural areas, a large number of co-operative and private milk marketing agencies have entered into the business of procurement, processing and distribution of milk. The co-operative milk marketing societies were established with two major objectives:(a) to provide remunerative prices to the milk producer-sellers and (b) to ensure regular supply of milk to the urban consumers at affordable prices. Keeping in view these problematic situations, the present study was conducted with the following specific objectives:(1) to work out the economics of milk production,(2) to find out the break-even point of dairy enterprise,(3) to study the factors affecting marketed surplus of milk of members and non-members of milk co-operatives in the state, and (4) to study the economic efficiency in milk\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "36\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

{"title": "Repeat performance: how do genome packaging and regulation depend on simple sequence repeats?\n", "abstract": " Non\u2010coding DNA has consistently increased during evolution of higher eukaryotes. Since the number of genes has remained relatively static during the evolution of complex organisms, it is believed that increased degree of sophisticated regulation of genes has contributed to the increased complexity. A higher proportion of non\u2010coding DNA, including repeats, is likely to provide more complex regulatory potential. Here, we propose that repeats play a regulatory role by contributing to the packaging of the genome during cellular differentiation. Repeats, and in particular the simple sequence repeats, are proposed to serve as landmarks that can target regulatory mechanisms to a large number of genomic sites with the help of very few factors and regulate the linked loci in a coordinated manner. Repeats may, therefore, function as common target sites for regulatory mechanisms involved in the packaging and dynamic\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "27\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

{"title": "Unravelling the distinct strains of Tharu ancestry\n", "abstract": " The northern region of the Indian subcontinent is a vast landscape interlaced by diverse ecologies, for example, the Gangetic Plain and the Himalayas. A great number of ethnic groups are found there, displaying a multitude of languages and cultures. The Tharu is one of the largest and most linguistically diverse of such groups, scattered across the Tarai region of Nepal and bordering Indian states. Their origins are uncertain. Hypotheses have been advanced postulating shared ancestry with Austroasiatic, or Tibeto-Burman-speaking populations as well as aboriginal roots in the Tarai. Several Tharu groups speak a variety of Indo-Aryan languages, but have traditionally been described by ethnographers as representing East Asian phenotype. Their ancestry and intra-population diversity has previously been tested only for haploid (mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosome) markers in a small portion of the population\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "23\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

The possible influence of air-flow limitation, alveolar air trapping, hypoxaemia and hypercapnia on the electrocardiographic findings indicative of right-sided cardiac involvement have been investigated. Thus, the findings: P greater than 2.5 mm, P-axis over+ 90 degrees, QRS axis over+ 90 degrees, RV6 less than or equal to 5mm and R/S ratio in V5 V6 less than or equal to 1.0 showed a significant negative correlation with FEV1/FVC ratio. The other features like Ta waves, negative P in AVL, S greater than 5 mm in depth in V5-6 and S1, S2, S3 pattern were observed to be less frequent and correlated weakly with the severity of the disease as judged by the lung function status. The reduction of FEV1/FVC was associated with increased residual volume (air trapping), hypoxaemia and hypercapnia.

The proposed model has been used and simulated for an example problem of transverse vibrations of plates viz. vibration of circular and elliptic annular plates. There exist nine different boundary conditions for the present example problem which are all simulated using the model. The training and testing with unseen patterns show the efficacy and reliability of the proposed technique for the MISO systems.

As far as resistance against powdery mildew is concerned, the presence of powdery mildew-resistance gene O (Mlo) plays a key role. The Mlo gene was first identified in barley, and the Mlo protein was found to be an integral plasma membrane-localized protein that possesses seven transmembrane regions. In the present work a total of 12 well reported Mlo genes from Oryza sativa, 15 well characterized Mlo genes from Arabidopsis thaliana genome were taken for comparative studies in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor). Comparative analysis of Mlo proteins from S. bicolor genome revealed the presence of 13 hypothetical genes within the genome. Map viewer analysis indicates that the predicted S. bicolor SbMlo genes are distributed on eight of the ten chromosomes. Sorghum chromosome 9 has 3 genes; chromosome 10 and chromosome 1 have 2 genes each, while chromosomes 2, 3, 4 and 5 have 1 gene each. Sub-cellular localization of identified Mlo proteins encoded by genes SbMlo1, SbMlo2, SbMlo4, SbMlo5, SbMlo6, SbMlo9, SbMlo10, SbMlo11, SbMlo12 and SbMlo13 are present in plasma membrane; SbMlo3 product is located in endoplasmic reticulum, SbMlo7encoded protein is located in vacuolar membrane and SbMlo8 product is present in the nuclear region.

{"title": "Enhancing use efficiency of phosphorus and potassium under different cropping systems of India\n", "abstract": " Low use efficiencies of applied nutrients pose a major challenge for sustainable agriculture, as these lead to excessive use of fertilisers, increasing production cost, lowering farm income, soil health deterioration and potential environmental risks. In Indian agriculture, use efficiencies (measured as apparent recovery or recovery efficiency of applied nutrients) ranging from 30-40% for N, 15-20% for P and 50-60% for K are frequently reported, which are obviously very low requiring focused R&D efforts for their improvement. Emphasis needs to be laid on improving P and K use efficiencies, as nearly 40% of P and entire K consumption is met through imports resulting in significant burden on the exchequer. In fact, most of the raw material for indigenously produced P fertilisers is also imported. The price escalation for P and K fertilisers subsequent to implementation of nutrient-based subsidy further aggravated the situation and calls for a strong thrust necessary for their efficient use. This article presents some proven strategies to improve P and K use efficiencies in cropping systems as emerged out of extensive experimentation. Also, a few important areas are outlined for strengthening future research and policy support on this aspect.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

A solution to this problem is the design rules\" CAN Kingdom\" and the basics for this are presented. This model consists of the collection and display of data which are independent of each other and remotely executed. The data collection module receives data through CAN bus, and the data display module display these data via GUI designed by Qt/Embedded in Microcontroller. Temperature sensor and IR sensors are used as data collection agents and LCD and motor is used as output agents for an application here to demonstrate the effectiveness of CAN.To avoid data corruption, redundancy and reduce the complexity of circuit, MCP2510 is used for extending CAN. The whole CAN bus system is made up of the MCP2510 which is a stand-alone CAN controller with SPI Interface and the MCP2551 which acts as an interface between the CAN controller and the physical bus which carries data. MCP2510 is capable of both acceptance filtering and message management. It includes three transmit buffers and two receive buffers that reduce the amount of microcontroller (MCU) management required.

Today large number of population suffers from kidney stone, gall stone and urinary calculi. Stone disease has gained increasing significance due to changes in living conditions ie industrialization and malnutrition. Changes in prevalence and incidence, the occurrence of stone types and stone location, and the manner of stone removal are explained. Medicinal plants are used from centuries due to its safety, efficacy, cultural acceptability and lesser side effects as compared to synthetic drugs. The present article deals with measures to be adopted for the potential of medicinal plants in stone dissolving activity. The problem of urinary stones or calculi is a very ancient one and many remedies have been employed during the ages these stones are found in all parts of the urinary tract, the kidney, the ureters and the urinary bladder and may vary considerably in size. In the present article, an attempt has been made to emphasis on herbal option for urinary stone.INTRODUCTION: All over the world especially in developing countries, approximately 80% of population continues to use traditional medicine in primary medical problems.

The most common disturbance among them is power-line frequency noise of 50 Hz. This makes clinical analysis and information retrieval difficult. It is necessary to remove all such disturbances in EEG signals for proper diagnosis. In this study, performance analysis of Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter based on various windows and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters for noise reduction from EEG signals have been done. Digital FIR and IIR filter of 100th order applied to signal epochs were studied and performance analysis was done by calculating the fast Fourier transform and signal-to-noise ratio. The result shows that Kaiser window-based FIR filters is better at removing power-line noise from EEG signal.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

This cropping problem is entirely an inherent problem of the flowering physiology which is exclusively different from the problems of unfruitfulness. The flowering and fruiting behaviour of mango trees differs markedly among the varieties and even within the different units of the same trees (Babu et al., 2006). Thus, even in bearing trees there are bearing and non-bearing units which could be attributed to the differential potentiality of the shoots to form flower buds (Davenport, 2009). It was reported that the potential shoots of regular bearing mango have narrow variation in their carbon assimilation component as compared to the wide variation in biennial cultivars (Singh et al., 2009). The exhaustion of trees during the period of crop load and vigorous vegetative growth with high gibberellin content at the time of flower bud differentiation and imbalance in C/N ratio have been considered the causes of bienniality in mango which has been attributed as", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

The BBCH scale (Biologische Bundesantalt Bundessortenant and Chemiscle Industrie) is used for recording the data of the different phenological stages in coded form starting from bud development, vegetative stages, floral stages and ends in fruit maturity. Pruning is an important tool for increasing the production but it impacts the normal phenological stages by causing variation in the occurrence of principal and secondary stages. Therefore, the normal BBCH scale proves to be erroneous. In order to assess the quantum of variation on the normal phenology, an experiment was carried out in the guava cv. Lalit for collection of phenological data using the traditional nomenclature described by Fleckinger (1945) and to relate them to the BBCH general scale in pruned or unpruned trees. Significant variation in the principal growth stages was observed as a result of pruning during February, May and September. The duration between the pruning and the beginning bud sprout was from 11 to 15 days during different times of pruning. In contrast, the control unpruned tree showed bud emergence within 2-3 days. The flowering in February and September pruned trees ranged from 78 to 93 days from flower opening and took 153 and 150 days, respectively, for the fruit ripeness as compared to control (129-146 days).

Series of slow cyclic tests were conducted on the Aluminum-core BRBs (Al-BRBs) to study its restraining mechanism, end connection capability and to verify the ability of the Al-BRB to sustain expected cyclic axial forces and deformations. Experimental investigations resulted in an optimum and effective design of Al-BRB with excellent hysteretic behavior and large axial deformation capability. Applicability of the Al-BRB was verified by analytical and experimental studies on truss moment frames (TMFs) with buckling restrained knee brace (BRKB-TMF), designed for large span industrial buildings. The BRKB-TMF was designed using Performance-Based Plastic Design (PBPD) method with a pre-selected target drift and yield mechanism as key performance limit states.

Results The key components of our solution include: QSAR models selected from a combinatorial set, similarity information and literature-derived sub-structure patterns of known skin protein reactive groups. Its prediction performance on a challenge set of molecules showed accuracy = 75.32%, CCR = 74.36%, sensitivity = 70.00% and specificity = 78.72%, which is better than several existing tools including VEGA (accuracy = 45.00% and CCR = 54.17% with \u2018High\u2019 reliability scoring), DEREK (accuracy = 72.73% and CCR = 71.44%) and TOPKAT (accuracy = 60.00% and CCR = 61.67%). Although, TIMES-SS showed higher predictive power (accuracy = 90.00% and CCR = 92.86%), the coverage was very low (only 10 out of 77 molecules were predicted reliably).   Conclusions Owing to improved prediction performance and coverage, our solution can serve as a useful expert system towards Integrated Approaches to Testing and Assessment for skin sensitization. It would be invaluable to cosmetic/ dermatology industry for pre-screening their molecules, and reducing time, cost and animal testing.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

Two foundational elements for planning and conducting assessments can benefit these communities: explicit theories of change and a hierarchy for evaluation. Having an explicit theory of change helps the assessor identify what to measure and supports an assessment structure that tests assumptions as hypotheses, which leads to improved operations, outcomes, and assessments. The hierarchy of evaluation described here includes five nested levels:(1) needs,(2) design and theory,(3) process and implementation,(4) outcomes/impact, and (5) cost-effectiveness. Rigorous assessments capture all of these levels and recognize their nested relationship, which helps the assessor match assessments to stakeholder needs and identify where improvements are needed when operations do not produce desired outcomes.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

{"title": "An experimental study of vibration control of cantilever beam using eddy current damper\n", "abstract": " Most of the damping mechanisms add damping to the structure by coming in physical contact with the structure thereby adding mass and altering the stiffness properties of the structure as a result of which the dynamics of structural elements are altered. Also they can cause localized defects/imperfections to structural elements. To overcome these drawbacks researchers are looking for potential methods which can add significant damping to the structure without coming in direct contact with the structure. One such method of adding damping is Eddy Current Damper (ECD). Eddy Current Damper (ECD) works on the principle of Electromagnetic Induction. According to the theory of electromagnetic induction, a current flows in a conductor whenever a change in magnetic flux is linked with it. Change in magnetic flux takes place when a conductor moves in a stationary or transient magnetic field. And according to Lenz\u2019s law, the resulting magnetic field opposes the cause of changing magnetic flux. The cause in present study is the motion of the conductor. Hence the resulting magnetic field opposes the motion of conductor. In dynamics of structural elements, the kinetic energy resulting from the motion of the structure is converted into potential energy and vice versa. Hence we need to find a system which dissipates this energy through a specific dissipation function. The motivation of the research lies in the formulation of this dissipation function. A theoretical model of the system is derived using electromagnetic induction theory enabling us to estimate the damping force induced in the structure. Experiments were conducted on basis of theoretical models\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

Results showed that apart from vegetative and floral malformed panicles, normal apical shoot and healthy panicles also develop Fms colonies indicating its systemic nature. Further, isolations made from the different portions of the normal panicles yields highest number of the Fms colonies from the base portion of the panicles (69.4%), followed by the top portion of the panicles (38.8%). Least number of the colonies (3.0%) were isolated from the stem portion below the panicle. Generally from the middle portions of the panicles Fms could not be recovered. Results indicate the accumulation of pathogen at certain portions. Threshold level of pathogen at the base of panicle may be responsible for the production of malformation symptom in the mango plants. The highest number of colonies were obtained from the samples of second fortnight of February, the period with moderate temperature ie avomax. temp. 25.90C and avomill. temp. 8.1 C.

A lymphatic malformation is a congenital defect that occurs during early embryonic development when the lymphatic vessels do not properly form. The vessels may become blocked and enlarged as lymphatic fluid collects in the vessels, forming a mass or a cyst. About 50% of all lesions are noted at birth and around 90% develop by 2 years of age.Materials and MethodsWe report the case of lymphangioma, with an unusual presentation in the cheek region resulting into vestibular obliteration and expanding to the left maxilla diagnosed on the basis of histopathology.

All the animals were subjected to 15-days of pre-experimental period for getting them acclimatized to feed and micro-environment. The ewes were synchronized for estrus by administering 2 injections of PGF 2 \u03b1 (7.5 mg) at 10 days interval at their respective places. The onset of estrus, estrus duration and various sexual behaviours ie circling, tail fanning, head turning, standing and approaching to ram were recorded during the experiment. The ewes maintained under shed set in estrus earlier and had longer duration of estrus as compared to ewes exposed to thermal stress. The lambs born from the group 1 ewes had significantly higher birth weight than lambs from group 2 ewes. It is concluded from this study that exposure to heat stress treatment was sufficient to alter the onset of estrus, sexual behaviour, conception and lambing rates of ewes reared in the semi-arid tropical environment.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

The core concept that drives this rapid growth has been the use of a standardized 3D coordinate space for combining data from many subjects and/or time-points. This has allowed geographically-separated laboratories to reproduce experiments in precise detail, to share data or to perform meta-analysis in ways that go far beyond the traditional reviewing of summary results in journal publications. A further corollary of the brain mapping approach is the natural fostering of multi-center collaboration among distant sites.

{"title": "Development and evaluation of self-propelled rice ridge seeder for pre-germinated seeding.\n", "abstract": " Seeding of pre-germinated rice seeds is increasingly considered an alternate to manual transplanting because of reduced labour and drudgeries; higher profit and comparable yields. Traditionally farmers practice manual broadcasting of pre-germinated seeds. For line sowing many designs of manual drum seeders have been developed but pulling them on puddle fields involves drudgeries and is classified as heavy work. Besides this, their capacity is rather low. To address the issue, development of self-propelled rice ridge seeder was taken up and its performance was compared. Lab testing of seed metering mechanism revealed that seeding rate variation within permissible 10% limit is possible by maintaining a desirable drum fill condition. The developed unit is designed for ridge seeding of pre-germinated seeds in 8 rows at 24 cm spacing. A 4.5 hp diesel engine was selected taking into consideration the draft requirement in puddle field. The seed metering mechanism with provision of varying seed rate is driven by rear shaft from engine. The effective field capacity was 0.30 ha/h at 2 km/h forward speed. The developed unit is suited to operate in shallow puddled fields just after the drainage of surface water, when the moisture content of topsoil layer is nearer to liquid limit. The yield of crop sown by the developed unit was 5.3 t/ha and it was comparable to manual transplanting (5.7 t/ha) and manual drum seeder (5.1 t/ha) and it was higher than manual broadcasting (4.4 t/ha). Seeding by developed unit helped in avoiding nursery raising; in eliminating the labour for rice transplanting; in reducing the drudgery of labourers both in pulling the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

In the present study, phage has been isolated from stagnant water by overlay method against host bacteria. Titer of phages was calculated to be 107 PFU/ml using 10-fold dilutions. Stability was determined at different parameters like pH, temperature and ultra violet radiation. Morphology and identification of phage was done using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) by staining with uranyl acetate. The phage capsid was about 78 nanometers (nm) in diameter with tail of length 527 nm as compared to wild type lambda phage whose head is about 65 nm. Isolated phage is classified into order Caudovirales since it possesses a long non contractile tail and icosahedral capsid head, thus is a member of the family Siphoviridae. Also the phage identified followed a lytic life cycle since plaque reaction activity was observed within 4-6 h against host bacteria ie E. coli by spot test. Molecular characterization of isolated bacteriophage (dsDNA> 33.5 Kbp) was carried out and compared with standard lambda DNA by subjecting to restriction enzyme digestion, using BamHI, EcoRI, and HindIII. The results of restriction digestion were compared in-silco and were found to be similar. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacryamide gel electrophoresis (10% SDS-PAGE) profiles for protein structure analysis indicated ten protein bands of different molecular weight that were stained with Coomassie blue, followed by de-staining. It is therefore, proposed that the isolated phage be classified as lambda like virus. This phage could infect and kill several potentially harmful bacteria ie.

We evaluate farmers\u2019 preference for yield performance under different weather scenarios, duration, seed reusability and seeding rate. Our results show that farmers value the reduction in yield variability offered by DT cultivars, but are willing to pay even more for cultivars that offer yield advantages even under normal conditions. Rice farmers were found to prefer short duration cultivars, which provide an alternative pathway by which farmers can manage drought risk. Finally, we find that farmers highly value seed-reusability, and would, other things equal, demand a discount on hybrid seeds that do not have this characteristic.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

In this paper, we are focused on effective image classification using low-level colour and texture features. It is well proved that the classifier performances are good for the unknown images, if quite similar images are present in the training set. On the other hand, classifier performances could not be guaranteed for images that are very much dissimilar from training set. This generalization problem of classifier can bias the image retrieval and annotation process. This paper objective is to investigate the discrimination abilities for such different class standard images. For improved image classification, we extract the effective low-level colour and texture features from the images. These features include; local binary pattern (LBP) based texture features, and colour percentile, colour\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

{"title": "Marine bacterial extracellular polymeric substances: characteristics and applications\n", "abstract": " The major part of the earth\u2019s biosphere is covered by the marine hydrosphere, which covers about 70% of total surface area. Ocean is considered the largest ecosystem, covering an area of~ 365 million km2 and a maximum depth of> 11,000 m. Ocean is home for the most diverse groups of flora and fauna, and forms a vast source of natural products (Satpute et al., 2010). Marine microorganisms produce unique metabolites to thrive in the extreme conditions of the marine ecosystem, which are unlikely to be found in terrestrial microbes (Fenical, 1993). Bacteria are highly diversified according to the marine environment, and most of the marine bacterial cells are surrounded by extracellular polymeric substances to survive in adverse conditions. Marine bacteria generally exist in two forms: either attached to the substrate and forming biofilms, or free-living as the planktonic cell. Most of the bacteria are reported to be attached to a surface in the marine environment (Zobel, 1943). About 99% of microorganisms inhabiting the earth are found to be present in biofilms or in an aggregate mode of life (Costerton et al., 1987). Extracellular polymeric substances or exopolysaccharides (EPSs) are carbohydrate polymers produced by bacteria, cyanobacteria, fungi, marine microalgae, and some marine microorganisms. The term exopolysaccharide was coined by Sutherland (1972) for high-molecular-weight carbohydrate polymers produced by marine bacteria, and is often used to define extracellular polymeric substances (Wingender et al., 1999).

{"title": "Characterization of modified polypropylene powder (Accurel) and its use for adsorption of phenolics from aqueous solution\n", "abstract": " The polypropylene based Accurel has been modified using surfactant and then characterized for selective adsorption of phenolics. The pore distribution falls between macroporous and mesoporous domains. The SEM images of Accurel reveal that it has porous structure of typically 73% void volume with cells of 5-10 \u03bcm connected by pores of 0.0028 \u03bcm diameter. The BET surface area of the Accurel is typically found as 27 m2/g. The titled adsorbate-sorbent system follows  L2 type of adsorption. The adsorption of studied phenolic acids depends on several factors, such as pKa, ionic strength, and steric effect (molecular size). The adsorption coefficients for the studied phenolics follow the sequence: chlorogenic acid > p-cumaric acid > syringic acid > p-hydroxy benzoic acid. The adsorption capacity of phenolics grows with increase in \u2013OH groups in the structure of the acids. The amount of adsorbed phenolics increases with increasing ionic strength and obeys the sequence: Cl <  SO < PO. Similarly, the cations are added in the same concentration range as anions and the effectiveness is found to obey the sequences: Na+ < Ca2+ < fe3+. The adsorbed amount decreases at both high and low pH values. Adsorption is found to increase significantly with increase in ionic strength, suggesting a role for the hydrophobic force in this adsorption process. Urea, a hydrogen bond breaker, reduces the adsorption, suggesting that the hydrogen bonding may also play a role in the adsorption of phenolics on modified Accurel. The modified Accurel shows significant sorption capacity for phenolics under suitable experimental condition and hence, will serve as a\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

The application of denoising procesn satellite image data and also in television broadcasting. Image data sets collected by image sensors are generally contaminated by noise. Furthermore, noise can be introduced by transmission errors and compression. Thus, denoising is often a necessary and the first step to be taken before the images data is analyzed. In this paper a Modified Functional Link Artificial Neural Network (M-FLANN) is proposed which is simpler than a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). It have been implemented for image restoration in this paper. Its computational complexity and speed and generalization ability to cancel Gaussian noise is compared with that of MLP. In the single layer functional link ANN (FLANN) the need of hidden layer is eliminated. The novelty of the FLANN structure is that it requires much less computation than that of MLP. In the presence of additive white Gaussian noise, salt and pepper noise, Random variable impulse noise and mixed noise in the image the performance of the proposed network is compared with that of MLP in this paper.

It has been shown that unlike other artificial neural networks (ANN) paradigms, which start with random weights, CPNN is very sensitive to initial weights. To reduce the dimension and training time, a novel feature selection method, based on the coherency existing between load buses with respect to voltage dynamics, is employed to select significant input features for the CPNN.

The adsorption is significantly affected by the age of the sulfonate solutions. A new mechanism of adsorption involving sulfonate monomers and multimers has been proposed. The adsorption behavior is best characterized by Langmuir and Freundlich models. At higher temperatures, the mineral surface seems to be capable of forming chemical bonds with the sulfonate anions. Micelles are not considered to be the species favored for adsorption. The adsorption, depending upon the concentration of added electrolyte, either reaches a saturation value or decreases abruptly after a fixed surfactant concentration has been reached. The apparent surfactant loss at higher salt concentrations seems to be due to salting\u2010out of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

Modularization of network implementation is important in this environment to make efficient use of ever-improving technologies and protocols. The need for modularization makes it desireable to separate a routing and target identification scheme from gateway implementation--a facility that source routing provides. Moreover, removing routing and target identification responsibilities from the gateways leads to their simplicity and therefore, a better chance that gateways will not be bottlenecks in the high-bandwidth network. This thesis focuses on the design of a Routing Service to support source routing in the campus environment.Descriptors:", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1783"]}
{"title": "Morphology of the gynoecium in Labiatae\n", "abstract": " Two gynoecial primordia are initiated as discrete units but soon get interconnected by the occurrence of interprimordial growth between them. A rim of meristematic tissue thus produced gives rise to the ovary wall by zonal growth. The residual floral apex grows parallel to the gynoecial primordia in the form of a septum. The two placental ridges arise from the inner lateral walls of the ovary, grow into the ovarian cavity, and ultimately fuse with the axial septum. The anterio- posterior region of the ovary wall also grows into the ovarian cavity to form a false septum which divides each locule into two. The Labiatae show a placentation which is neither true axile nor true parietal but an intermediate condition between the two, as the septum grows like in a typical axile placentation and the placentae like in typical parietal placentation. The gynobase in Labiatae is considered to be carpellary in nature.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

{"title": "FPGA-based implementation of finite set-MPC for a VSI system using XSG-based modeling\n", "abstract": " Finite set-model predictive control (FS-MPC) is used for power converters and drives having unique advantages as compared to the conventional control strategies. However, the computational burden of the FS-MPC is a primary concern for real-time implementation. Field programmable gate array (FPGA) is an alternative and exciting solution for real-time implementation because of the parallel processing capability, as well as, discrete nature of the hardware platform. Nevertheless, FPGA is capable of handling the computational requirements for the FS-MPC implementation, however, the system development involves multiple steps that lead to the time-consuming debugging process. Moreover, specific hardware coding skill makes it more complex corresponding to an increase in system complexity that leads to a tedious task for system development. This paper presents an FPGA-based experimental implementation of FS-MPC using the system modeling approach. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of FS-MPC in stationary \u03b1\u03b2 and rotating dq frame is considered for simulation as well as experimental result. The FS-MPC for a three-phase voltage source inverter (VSI) system is developed in a realistic digital simulator integrated with MATLAB-Simulink. The simulated controller model is further used for experimental system implementation and validation using Xilinx FPGA: Zedboard Zynq Evaluation and Development Kit. The digital simulator termed as Xilinx system generator (XSG) provided by Xilinx is used for modeling-based FPGA design. View Full-Text", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

Mn-oxidizing bacterium was isolated from arsenic and manganese contaminated ground water from district Ballia (UP), India. The bacterium was identified as Acinetobacter  sp. by the Institue of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh, India. Synthetic solution of Mn (25 ppm) was treated with Acinetobacter sp. (20 mg/mL) biomass in neutral pH (7.0) at ambient temperature. Acinetobacter  sp. was found efficient to oxidize 44.04% (11.01 ppm) Mn within 2 h. Kinetics of Mn oxidation showed that maximum velocity (Vmax) for Mn oxidation was 16.69 \u00b5M mg-1 h-1, while kinetic constant (Km) was found to be 1.09 mM. Mn oxidation by Acinetobacter  sp. follows the Michalis-Menten kinetics. Free and immobilized cells of Mn-oxide laden  Acinetobacter  sp. was used for removal of arsenite [As(III)] from arsenite contaminated water. Free and immobilized cells of Mn-oxide (11.01 ppm) laden  Acinetobacter sp. biomass (20 mg/mL) was effective in removing of 0.760 ppm arsenite within 30 min and 3.39 ppm arsenite within 15 min from 5 ppm As(III) containing synthetic solution at pH 7. The immobilized cells of Mn-oxide laden  Acinetobacter  sp. were found to be 4.46 times more effective for the removal of As(III) as compared to the free cells.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

A number of the factors resulting in dissonance post purchase and prior to it are comprehensively studied in this article. It is not certain that cell phone users are fully satisfied since they are usually confused with abundant information during purchasing period. It begins with the identification of the degree of involvement in the purchase of a product which creates dissonance for a consumer. The higher the degree of purchase involvement on behalf of the patron, the lesser would be his dissonance level. If a consumer takes the purchase decision by his own, he/she would be a lot of gorged along with the decision as compared to an acquisition decision taken in consultation with others. Additionally it is proposed, that the longer a consumer devotes to his purchase decision, the lot of content he would be along with his decision and lesser would be the dissonance hooked up with the choice. The study additionally unveils that, a consumer is probably going to face a lot of dissonance over his decision, which involves the purchase of branded and sophisticated cell phones whereas less dissonance was found to be associated with the purchase of low featured cell phones. In other words, purchase of branded cell phones would create customers a lot of dissonant as compared economical cell phones. Furthermore, there's ample area for enhancements.

Copper, iron, zinc and magnesium act as cofactors for several enzymes in energy metabolism therefore it is important to study the interactions between exercise and nutritionally important minerals [1]. Copper, iron, zinc and magnesium play important roles in facilitating the conversion of chemical energy of food into potential energy for work and thereby integrate physiological functions to enhance physical performance.Individuals involved in some kind of physical activity require adequate amount of these micronutrients in their diet to ensure the capacity for increased energy expenditure and enhanced work performance. Some of the studies carried out in the past years have shown exercise influences the status of minerals in the human body. Physical activity results in short term increase of mineral loss in both urine and sweat, which leads to alteration and perturbation of mineral status [2]. Decreased zinc and magnesium concentrations in serum have been reported in athletes participating in some kind of physical activity [3, 4].

We employ discrete choice experiments to examine farmers\u2019 preferences for DT traits and explore heterogeneity in these preferences using primary data collected in rural Bihar, India. Using different modeling approaches to capture preference heterogeneity, our results show that farmers value the reduction in yield variability offered by DT cultivars but are willing to pay even more for rice seed that offers yield advantages even under normal conditions.

In order to confirm that relationship between toxicity and abiotic factors is not coincidental, activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), acid phosphatase (ACP) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in the nervous tissue of control as well as sublethal thymol (60% of 24h LC50) treated snail, were assayed during each of the 1 2 months of the same year. A significant positive rank correlation was noted between AChE/ACP/ALP activity and corresponding sublethal treatment of thymol. Maximum inhibition of AChE, ACP and ALP activity was observed in the month of May.

Although pyridine provides both \u03c3-and \u03c0-bonding capabilities towards metal atoms and ions, the mono-ligand and di-ligand Cu-pyridine complexes are determined to be \u03c3-structures. In the di-ligand complex, the two pyridine rings prefer the eclipsed to the staggered form. Due to an additional Cu-N \u03c3-bond and stronger ligand \u03c0-electron donation, the di-ligand complex possesses a stronger metal ligand interaction than the mono-ligand complex. Upon ionization, the metal-ligand bonding in the di-ligand complex is more strongly enhanced compared to the mono-ligand complex.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

A minutia matching is widely used for fingerprint recognition but shows poor performance when image quality is degraded. However, its performance can be enhanced by the combination of other technique like wavelet transform method. Wavelets are good for local analysis, so used for extracting local features from fingerprint. The final matching score is estimated using fusing matching scores of minutiae based and wavelet based method. By measuring False reject rate (FRR) and false accept rate (FAR) the performance of hybrid fingerprint identification method is calculated.

{"title": "Hybrid correlation based gene selection for accurate cancer classification of gene expression data\n", "abstract": " Microarray data has been widely applied to cancer classification, where the purpose is to classify and predict the category of a sample by its gene expression profile. DNA microarray is a gene chip which consists of expression levels for a huge number of genes on a relatively small number of samples. However, only a small number of genes contribute in accurate classification of cancer. Therefore, the challenging task is to identify a small subset of informative genes which has maximum amount of information about the class. Moreover, it also minimizes the classification errors. In this paper, we propose a hybrid negative correlated method, which combines the features from various correlation based feature selection techniques, for the generation of mutually exclusive informative feature sets. We test the effectiveness of the proposed approach using a neural network based classifier on two benchmark gene expression data sets-colon dataset and leukemia dataset. The obtained results are encouraging as hybrid negative correlated method based features give better recognition accuracy than positive correlated and other negative correlated features.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

The robust growth in the livestock sector is likely to continue considering rapidly increasing demand for animal food products (Delgado et al., 1999 and Parthasarathy Rao et al., 2004). Robust growth in livestock production is important to sustain agricultural growth, and also to improve household nutritional security, generate employment and reduce poverty. Besides, the contribution of livestock towards draft power, energy for rural households and maintaining soil fertility is of great importance (Mishra and Sharma, 1990; Sharma, 2004). The importance of livestock is much pronounced in arid and semi-arid environments as in Rajasthan, which are frequently prone to droughts (Rathore, 2004). Livestock production is vulnerable to such natural hazards, but not as much as crop production, it acts as a cushion against risks of crop failure. Livestock generate a continuous stream of income and help consumption smoothening, and being more liquid, they can be easily marketed during times of crises. In 2003 Rajasthan had 10.9 million cattle, 10.4 million buffalo and 26.8 million small ruminants and produced 80 lakh tonnes of milk, 0.63 lakh tonnes of meat and 0.15 lakh tonnes of wool, contributing 9.1, 1.5 and 30.7 per cent of state GDP (gross domestic product) respectively (Government of Rajasthan, 2003).", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

{"title": "Seismic resolution and geophone ground coupling\n", "abstract": " Geophone ground coupling is one of the various factors which greatly affect the seismic bandwidth and hence the resolution. The effect of ground coupling can be ignored as long as the geophones are planted in firm soil, since coupling resonance is much higher than the normal seismic frequency band of 10-l 50 Hz. for reflection survey. In loose and unconsolidated soil, coupling resonance falls well within the seismic frequency band resulting in distortion of the signal. Highly variable surface conditions in Ramnad subbasin of Cauvery basin in India severely affect the seismic data quality. This has necessitated the need to study the effect of geophone ground coupling in this area. Seismic data was acquired at different locations for different coupling sequences namely, surface plant, replant and good plant. In addition, a profile of 2 Km. length was shot to study the qualitative and quantitative aspects of geophone\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

Further, the application of Branch and Bound to single-stage multi-commodity single-period warehouse location problem (SSMCSPWLP) with strong constraints has shown that they are more effective. It was also shown in the previous research (in the context of Branch and Bound Methodology) that hybrid formulation for the single-stage single-period multi-commodity warehouse location problem yielded superior results. In this paper we apply Benders\u2019 decomposition to strong and weak formulations of single-stage multi-commodity multi-period warehouse location problem (SSMCMPWLP). As suggested in the previous literature we put feasibility constraints in the pure integer sub- problem to speed up the performance of Benders\u2019 decomposition. We also develop an additional cut (constraint that is again added to pure integer sub-problem) and show that it further speeded up Benders\u2019 Decomposition.

With the measured conductivities, activation energy and pre-exponential factors have been evaluated over the studied range of temperature. Transport properties in the respective phases are discussed and compared with those reported in the literature. Though the order of magnitude of observed conductivity is same as that reported in literature, the observed values are higher than those reported earlier. The electrical conductivity of -CuBr increases rapidly with temperature, from 2.51 \u00d7 10-3 \u2126-1 m-1 at 50 \u00b0C to 16.08 \u2126-1 m-1 at 400 \u00b0C. After the first phase transition of -CuBr \u2194 \u03b2-CuBr, the electrical conductivity attains a value of 148 \u2126-1m-1 and increases further with increase in temperature. The conductivity increases  by about 30 % on \u03b2-phase \u2194 \u03b1-phase transition (maximum  value 377.60 \u2126-1m-1 at 487 \u00b0C).

This study utilizes the Arabidopsis-GPA model system with the aim to elucidate the role of the plant disaccharide trehalose in providing defense against GPA. This study demonstrates a novel role for TPS11 in providing defense against GPA. TPS11 expression was found to be transiently induced in Arabidopsis plants in response to GPA infestation and the TPS11 gene was required for curtailing GPA infestation. TPS11, which encodes for trehalose phosphate synthase and phosphatase activities, contributes to the transient increase in trehalose in the GPA infested tissues.

{"title": "Generalizing the correctness of transactional memory\n", "abstract": " Transactional memory (TM) is a promising paradigm for concurrent programming in the multi-core era. It provides programmers a simple and familiar tool\u2014transactions\u2014and gives opportunities to execute those transactions concurrently in a scalable way. Ideally, programs could execute all operations on shared data within transactions, and optionally some operations on thread-local data non-transactionally. In practice, however, not all operations on shared data can be wrapped in transactions because of either performance concerns or requirements of interoperability with legacy software components. It is thus not surprising to see a large body of research dedicated to exploring the various models of interactions between transactions and non-transactional code, and implementing those models, eg,[6, 2, 7, 1]. The mutual interaction between transactions is formalized by the notion of opacity [3], which is indeed ensured by most TM implementations. Opacity requires that transactions should \u201clook like\u201d they executed in some sequential order, consistent with their real-time order, and no transaction (even an aborted one) should ever observe an inconsistent state of the system. At a high-level, this gives programmers an illusion that there is no concurrency between transactions, which resembles the intuitive model of critical sections protected by a single global lock. The interactions between non-transactional operations are expressed using a memory model. While a TM can be implemented in a way to ensure opacity for transactions, there is little one can do (on a given platform or run-time environment) to change the underlying memory model\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

Considerable variability for different fatty acids has been reported in Indian mustard [3, 4]. And now all the advanced breeding lines are screened for their fatty acid composition together with yield performance for their release as new varieties.Fifty six advanced breeding lines selected for superior oil quality (ie low erucic acid in oil)[twelve PRQ (RC-78J x Zem-1), thirty three PLEM (Kranti x Zem-1), three DL [(BJ-1058 x Kranti) x (RC-781 x Zem-l)] and eight LG (BJ-1058 x Kranti)] along with three checks viz. Kranti and Pusa Karisma and PRQ-2005-1 (registered donor for low erucic acid IC-546946) were grown in Augmented Block Design in eight blocks and all the recommended cultural practices were performed in rabi 2005-06 and rabi 2006-07. Self seeds from all the advanced lines and checks were harvested upon maturity. Days to maturity for each advanced line were recorded. Mature seeds were dried in hot air oven at 60oC till they become moisture free and 1000 seed weight was taken with the help of numerical seed counter and electronic balance. The oil content (%) in seeds was determined by Newport Analyzer-4000 based on the principle of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Fatty acid methyl esters were prepared from the seeds of each line using bulk seed method by crushing 10-15 seeds of each line in petroleum ether and were esterified using IN Sodium Methoxide [5] and the supernatant was taken and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

The suitability of buffers to stabilize the pH of sugar solutions at pH 6.4 was investigated by employing the following buffers, viz., MES, MOPSO and MOPS. Using cellulose ester filters with a 0.80 \u03bcm followed by 0.45 \u03bcm pore size, turbidity was minimized. MES buffer showed excellent pH stabilization at pH 6.4 and limited color alteration. On the basis of these preliminary investigations, it is suggested that the use of MES buffer for pH adjustment in the measurement of all types of sugar colors be subjected to collaborative testing by ICUMSA as per the IUPAC protocol. The method format as per the IUPAC protocol has been given in the text.

{"title": "Powertrain transfer path analysis of a truck\n", "abstract": " A project to perform a powertrain Noise Path Analysis (NPA) on a two-wheel rear drive vehicle was performed at Visteon Corporation. Research engineers gained insight into the NPA procedure as applied to a typical medium-duty production pick-up truck. Visteon's interest in this project was two folded. First, to do a full experimental Noise Path analysis (NPA) and then, develop a methodology to integrate the experimental measurements and analytical results into a unified model to predict the responses at passenger interface points within a vehicle. This presentation will cover the details of the experimental NPA including measurement locations, transducer types and placement, elastomeric mount characterization, and the matrix inversion process required for indirect force estimation. Both the direct mount method and the indirect force methods based on matrix inversions were used for several mount locations to allow the estimated forces from two independent methods to be compared for accuracy and verification. Finally, subsets of forces were estimated from analytical models and compared to the experimentally determined forces. This process allows Visteon to predict passenger response interface point amplitudes from a combination of their Finite Element Powertrain models and P/F body measurements supplied by the OEM to characterize the transfer paths. This process gives Visteon the ability to enhance their driveline subsystem NVH performance relative to the sensitivities for the receiving body structure.

The leaves normally produced only sporophytes from the'buds' formed at notched portions of lamina wherefrom no gametophytic outgrowths ever emerged. The latter were confined only to the stipe region and in association with some sporophytic and abnormal outgrowths of unspecified nature which die out shortly and the gametophytic outgrowths produced mature gametophytes on subculturing. Regeneration of gametophytes from cordate and spatulate thalli was also observed. Roots lacked the potentiality for regeneration. Owing to the presence of a number of chlorenchymatous cells surrounding the outgrowth proper, a multicellular origin has been assumed for it. The factors responsible for determining its nature\u2014whether sporophytic or gametophytic\u2014seemed to depend on the regulatory mechanism of genes or gene blocks in the same set of genome, switching off and on at appropriate times.

Here we utilized the recently available large-scale genome sequencing data from these parasites and compared the pattern of single nucleotide polymorphisms, which may be related to these differences. We found that there was a five-fold higher preference for AT nucleotides compared to GC nucleotides at synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism sites in P. vivax . The preference for AT nucleotides was also present at non-synonymous sites, which lead to amino acid changes favouring those with codons of higher AT content. The substitution bias was also present at low and moderately conserved amino acid positions, but not at highly conserved positions. No marked bias was found at synonymous and non-synonymous sites in P. falciparum . The difference in the substitution bias between P. falciparum and P. vivax found in the present study may possibly contribute to their divergent evolutionary response to similar drug pressures.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

There is a reference to ber in Yajur Veda, written not later than 1000 BC It is said to be indigenous to the area stretching from India to the South Western Asia up to Malaya. The Indian Ber (Zizyphus mauritiana Lamk.) belongs to family Rhamnaceae and genus Zizyphus. It is a tetraploid (2n= 48) in nature. It is cultivated widely for its resistance to grow in drought and diversified soil and climatic conditions, and is known as \u201cKing of Arid Fruits\u201d. It requires less care and even in neglected condition. However, produces sufficient fruits and can be successfully grown under the most unfavourable conditions of the soil, water and climate. It grows even on the marginal soil and various kinds of wasteland situations such as sodic saline soil, ravines, arid semi-arid region including platen area of Bundelkhand and South India. The ripe ber fruits have high nutritive value, conventionally it is considered a \u201cpoor man\u2019s fruit\u201d. It is richer than apple in protein, phosphorus, calcium and vitamin \u2018C\u2019(Bakshi and Singh, 1974).Nutrients play a important role in many physiological phenomena like vegetative propagation, induction of seedlessness increase fruit set prevention of pre-harvest fruit drop, regulation of flowering, fruit size, thinning of flower and fruits. Various types of nutrients like Fe, K, borax, Zn, Ca. Fe and borax are used for improving the flowering, fruit set, size and quality of fruit as well as yield in many tree crops.

{"title": "Analysis of Eddy current damper for suppression of vibrations using COMSOL software\n", "abstract": " An Eddy current damper uses magnets to suppress vibrations due to external excitations. These dampers also called electromagnetic dampers, have advantages of no mechanical contact, high reliability and stability, but require a relatively large volume and mass to attain a given amount of damping. The magnets respond to an external excitation field. Along with the construction of the damper, COMSOL software is used for analysis of the eddy current damper and got various results like magnetic flux density, eddy current intensity, velocity and acceleration of the moving magnet. For this a standard dimension of an automotive vehicle damper is used so that the prototype could be tested on a damper testing machine. The standard dimension is chosen to increase the adaptability, compatibility and to ease of testing the damper. After this task the response of damper under various loads is observed. Different materials of housing tube are taken to observe the effects of various parameters like flux density, current intensity and, of course, the damping capability of the prototype damper.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

Results showed that the application of recommended doses of NPK (100, 22, 42 kg N, P2O5 and K2O, respectively) to rice produced grain yields of 4.26 and 5.80 t/ha during 2008-09 and 2009-10, respectively (Table 3). Omission of P and K fertilisers caused yield losses of 0.6 to 0.9 t/ha and 1.0 to 1.02 t/ha, respectively. AEK was between 13.8 to 21.4 kg grain/kg of K. Similar response to K over N alone was 7.6 to 26 kg/kg for K. Like rice, the maize grain productivity was maximum in plots treated with the recommended doses of NPK (6.22 to 7.09 t/ha). Omission of K resulted in significant (p\u2264 0.05) yield losses of 1.82 to 1.93 t/ha over the two years (Table 3). At these response levels, AEK was 55.2 to 58.5 kg/kg, respectively. These results agreed closely with another on-farm study by Majumdar et al.(2012) in which yield losses due to the omission of K application to rice and maize were 90 to 1,806 kg/ha (mean= 622 kg/ha) and 140 to 1,320 kg/ha (mean= 700 kg/ha), respectively. Considerable increases in AEN and AEP due to K application were observed in this experiment. Synergistic effects of balanced fertilization were earlier reported by Tiwari (2002), which revealed that efficiency of applied N and P increased with increasing initial available K status of soils.

{"title": "Carbohydrate metabolism during fruit spoilage\n", "abstract": " Consumption of fruit and vegetables has dramatically increased globally during the past a few decades. These are living perishable biological entities which perform a number of metabolic functions and have a short life span. Once the fruit is harvested, respiration and transpiration continue, but only for as long as the fruit can draw on its own food reserves and moisture. It is this limited ability to continue vital metabolic functions which define fruit as perishable. It is also estimated that about 20% of all fruits and vegetables produced are lost each year due to spoilage. The process of the fruit spoilage is just the decomposition of the fruit itself. Once harvested, this begins to deteriorate until eventually it becomes unfit for consumption. This deterioration is known as decay and that leads to spoilage. Latter may be defined as \u201cany sensory change (physical, visual, olfactory or flavour) which the consumer considers to be unacceptable. The gradual changes which cause deterioration and decay in fruits are due to certain organisms and chemicals present in the food and outside the food. Carbohydrates play a major role in the fruit spoilage process (Prasanna et al., 2007) by way of depolymerization leading to decreased molecular size with concomitant increase in the levels of ripening inducing specific enzymes, whose target differ from fruit to fruit.

There are large number of techniques that have been developed to predict the bankruptcy, which help the decision makers, such as investors and financial analysts. One of the bankruptcy prediction models is back-propagation neural network (BPNN). The paper first surveys the existing literature for various techniques that have been developed to assess credit risks, including the credit scoring models and quantitative models pioneered by Beaver and Altman, which focuses on the borrower's inability to meet credit obligation. Thereafter, this paper, using the tailored BPNN, endeavours to predict the financial ratios expressing the position of a firm to regulate the bankruptcy and assess the credit risks.

In developing countries majority of population lives in rural areas having limited resources and socio-cultural biodiversity. Their personal, socio-cultural and occupational habits vary and need to be addressed. So a culturally relevant and contextually appropriate, Composite Indian Functional Knee Assessment Scale (CIFKAS) for measuring the functional status in knee osteoarthritis was formulated. 128 participants from various geographical regions of India of age range 40 to 60 years using convenient sampling were included and informed consent signed by the participants. Each participant was assigned to one of the two groups. 39 participants in group A reported no episode of knee pain while 89 participants in group B reported at least one episode of knee pain in the last two months. Each participant was assessed on Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and CIFKAS and statistical analysis was done. The Pearson correlation coefficient calculated for all 128 subjects for pain, physical functional abilities and total functional disability score were 0.878, 0.925 and 0.945 respectively. Between group analysis was done using Independent t test and p value was found to be not significant for pain (\u2264 178), highly significant for physical functional abilities (p\u2264 0001) and very significant for total functional disability status score (p\u2264 004).

During the past few decades application of synthetic pesticides to control agricultural pests has been a standard practice. However, with the growing evidence regarding detrimental effects of many of the conventional pesticides on health and environment, requirement for safer means of pest management has become very crucial. Biopesticides of botanical origin have become the focus of attention today for facing the nematode problems in an eco-friendly manner. Many plants and plant products when applied in soil are known to cause reduction in the nematode population below damaging level. In few cases plants have been found to be actually antagonistic towards nematodes and some have been shown to produce toxic materials inhibitory to nematodes. The use of botanical products to manage phytonematodes population has a number of possible advantages over synthetic products viz. the botanical pesticides are available in bulk; they are easy to apply and are expected to be cheaper in comparison to synthetic chemicals.

{"title": "Formalizing and verifying transactional memories\n", "abstract": " Transactional memory (TM) has shown potential to simplify the task of writing concurrent programs. TM shifts the burden of managing concurrency from the programmer to the TM algorithm. The correctness of TM algorithms is generally proved manually. The goal of this thesis is to provide the mathematical and software tools to automatically verify TM algorithms under realistic memory models.Our first contribution is to develop a mathematical framework to capture the behavior of TM algorithms and the required correctness properties. We consider the safety property of opacity and the liveness properties of obstruction freedom and livelock freedom. We build a specification language of opacity. We build a framework to express hardware relaxed memory models. We develop a new high-level language, Relaxed Memory Language (RML), for expressing concurrent algorithms with a hardware-level atomicity of instructions, whose semantics is parametrized by various relaxed memory models. We express TM algorithms like TL2, DSTM, and McRT STM in our framework. The verification of TM algorithms is difficult because of the unbounded number, length, and delay of concurrent transactions and the unbounded size of the memory. The second contribution of the thesis is to identify structural properties of TM algorithms which allow us to reduce the unbounded verification problem to a language-inclusion check between two finite state systems. We show that common TM algorithms satisfy these structural properties. The third contribution of the thesis is our tool FOIL for model checking TM algorithms.

{"title": "Natural Resources Management: An Overview\n", "abstract": " Crop production is the resultant effect of interaction between different natural resources such as soil, water and weather as well as external inputs like seed fertilizer, energy, management etc. Temperature variation in productivity is often witnessed depending upon how these resources are used and managed as reflected in wide spatial and temporal fluctuations with marked peaks and through among different agro-ecological situations or even within the same ecosystem. Over exploitation beyond the resource capability or an imbalanced use not in harmony with local situation in an attempt to augment rapid production for meeting the immediate mounting demands of the burgeoning human and animal population with out long term perspective leads to unabated degradation of resource base, loss of biodiversity, decline in total factor productivity in the farming system, and environment deterioration. With shrinking per capita land, water, the prevalent increasing demographic trend is putting further enormous strain on the already overburdened resource base. This unhealthy situation has become more prominently damaging under intensive agriculture after advent of green evolution era not only in India but elsewhere as well. Unsustainability of higher productivity associated with fast resource degradation at an alarming rate has become a cause of serious concern the world over in the recent years.

The diffusion controlled nature is prominent particularly in mixtures having low concentration of sulphuric acid (0.001M-0.01M). The critical current density for the passivity is found to be influenced by the content of acid added in alcohols.

The effect of chronic radiation on Lens culinaris is being reported for the first time. These aber rations are compared with those caused by acute radiation. The cells undergoing meiotic division show bipartite nature of their chromo somes from early zygotene to the end of second metaphase. The chromatid aber rations and physiological effects (surface stickiness of the chromosomes) are two abnormalities exhibited by the chromosomes when the cells are irradiated during the process of their division (Marquardt 1938, Lea 1955, Swanson 1965).

A strain gauge mounted on this plate suffers a shear strain which is detected electrically by the conventional technique of the Wheatstone bridge followed by an amplifier. The output of the amplifier was found to be linearly related to the square of applied voltage between the plates, as it theoretically should be. The technique can be used to measure dc and ac voltages, particularly when their magnitudes are high and there is also high impedance.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

{"title": "Effect of a phytogenic feed additive supplemented diet on economic efficiency and cost of production of broiler chickens\n", "abstract": " The industrialization of poultry husbandry and the improvement in feed efficiency have accelerated the introduction of feed additives in broilers diet. Feed is a major input for the broiler rearing and contributes about 70-80% of the total cost of production hence plays a vital role in broilers economy. The main goal of scientists is to increase production by maintaining good health of broilers. Antibiotics were used as a growth promoter to improvement of production parameters and diseases prevention from many years. However repeated utilization of antibiotics has led to the increasing resistance of pathogens to antibiotics and the accumulation of antibiotic residues in animal products and in the environment. These situations force the world to restrict the use of antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) in animal feed (Alloui et al., 2014). The removal of AGPs from broilers feed had negative impacts on their productions performance and foster the resurgence of pathogens causing illness and economic losses in farms. To overcome from these problems, herbs and plant extracts are searched to be incorporated in poultry feed as growth promoters (Alloui et al., 2013). Many medicinal plants were tried by various researchers, some of them proved the ability of bioactive compounds of plants (phytobiotics) to prevent disease and promote the growth of broilers at same time. The advantage of phytogenic feed additives over synthetic growth promoters is mainly due to the natural synergistic effect of all agents within the plants.

Human gait is first recorded using a vision system and the hip and knee joint trajectories extracted from the data. Optimal 4-bar mechanisms are then designed using a genetic algorithm that gives the smallest mechanism that can replicate the hip and knee joint trajectories accurately. The orthosis joints are gravity balanced so that the potential energy of the system in any orientations is constant, and the wearer does not feel the weight of the system.

When a Mobile station moves between the Access Service Networks (ASN) and Base Stations in End to End WiMax Communication network then to minimize the handoff latency ASN connected mobility is adopted by the MS. But this process will increase the load heavily on ASN Gateway. Hence to reduce the load from gateway, relocation of gateway for connected gateway will be required. The standards only describe the procedures of the gateway relocation but they do not describe that when should gateway relocation be performed and how many number of Mobile Stations should be relocated. This problem is left for the researchers and service providers. In the article we will propose an algorithm based on average mobile stay time (AMST) in which a decision will be taken for the number of mobile stations to be relocated and to determine the appropriate time for the gateway relocation so that the load and handover delay can be reduced from ASN gateway.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

{"title": "Effect of Cutting Parameters of Turning Process on Cutting Tool vibrations and surface roughness of stainless steel using Taguchi Method\n", "abstract": " In actual cutting conditions various forces and unseen factors arise which cause vibrations. If vibrations occur between the tool and the job, then naturally the dimensional accuracy cannot be maintained and the performance of the machine tool will not be satisfactory. Also the machine tool vibration has detrimental effect on tool life and thus the cost of the production is increased and productivity lowered.In any machining operation, minimizing the vibration of the tool is a very important requirement for any turned work piece. Thus the choice of optimized cutting parameter is very important for minimizing the vibration of the cutting tool. The focus of this study is the collection of tool vibration data generated by the lathe dry turning of SS304 samples of diameter 31 mm using ISO 6R 1212 as the cutting tool at different levels of speed (130, 180, 340rpm), feed (0.1, 0.20, 0.22 mm/rev) and depth of cut (0.4, 0.5, 0.6 mm) and then analyzing the obtained data using taguchi analysis to show how tool vibration varies within a given range of speed, feed & depth of cut. The vibration here is represented by its peak acceleration. The analysis revealed that for the specified range of speed, feed and depth of cut, any change in the depth of cut causes a large change in the tool vibration while change in the cutting speed causes comparatively lowest change in tool vibration. This study highlights the use of Taguchi design to optimize the multi response in turning operation. For this purpose Taguchi design of experiment was carried out to collect the data for tool vibration and cutting forces.

The treatment plan in children has to be modified as compared to adults considering the presence of tooth buds and potential disturbances in growth. Use of acrylic splints has been one of the popular techniques in children because of its relatively easy placement and reduced risk of hindrances to growth of jaw. These splints have been traditionally been fixed with the help of cements and circummandibular wires. We describe the use of intravenous cannula stilete instead of traditional bone awl to secure the splint in place.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

Diagnostic surveys conducted in Upper Gangetic Plains reveal that in rice, farmers practice 4-6 pre-puddling tillage operations, followed by two puddling operations. The frequency of pre-puddling tillage was also greater in case of medium and large farmers (average 04) as compared to the small ones (average 03), whereas 02 puddlings was a common practice by all the farmers irrespective of their holding size. With these considerations, a 3-year field experiment was conducted on a sandy loam (Typic Ustochrept) soil of Modipuram to study the interactive effects of pre-puddling tillage and puddling intensity on soil physico-chemical properties, nutrient uptake and field water use efficiency in rice, energy use, and on the productivity of rice and wheat crops.

{"title": "Fabrication of light weight farms yoke with the use of composite material\n", "abstract": " Natural fibers are subdivided based on their origins, coming from plants, animals or minerals. All plant fibers are composed of cellulose while animal fibers consist of proteins (hair, silk, and wool). Plant fibers include bask (or stem or soft sclerenchyma) fibers, leaf or hard fibers, seed, fruit, wood, cereal straw, and other grass fibers. Over the last few years, a number of researchers have been involved in investigating the exploitation of natural fibers as load bearing constituents in composite materials. The use of such materials in composites has increased due to their relative cheapness, ability to recycle and for the fact that they can compete well in terms of strength per weight of material. Natural fibers can be considered as naturally occurring composites consisting mainly of cellulose fibrils embedded in lignin matrix. The cellulose fibrils are aligned along the length of the fiber, which render maximum tensile and flexural strengths, in addition to providing rigidity. The reinforcing efficiency of natural fiber is related to the nature of cellulose and its crystallinity. The existing traditional yoke is made up of the wood of trees like Tun and Haldu which are not easily available in different parts of India. The life of a yoke is about 3 to 5 years, due to this 628 tons of wood is required at every 3-5 years in India that would create a burden to the presently available forests. To overcome these problems, there is a need to develop yoke from waste bio-materials. Keeping this in view, a yoke from composite material was designed and developed and relative comparison between traditional wooden and developed yoke has been done.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

To improve the productivity, the production from the existing area needs to be increased and at the same time, new areas also need to be brought under cultivation. For this, new plantings need to come up on wide variety of soils under different agro-climatic conditions. In India, soil salinity is becoming a major problem and nearly 6.73 million hectares of area is under salt affected soils of which, 2.7 million hectares is under Indo-Gangetic plains comprising of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and part of Bihar, West Bengal and Rajasthan. Salinity is a serious limitation for bringing large geographical areas under mango. In addition to this, use of poor quality irrigation water also causes salt stress to the crop. The mango is very sensitive to salinity particularly at early stages of growth.

India ranks first in area and production of mango in the world (Shikamany and Sudha, 5). Mango malformation is of two types vegetative and floral, the former being more common on the nursery seedlings and young plants and the later, on trees at the bearing stage. It is the floral malformation which directly affects the productivity. The disease is characterized in the growing plants by production of multiple shoots with rudimentary leaves from either at leaf and or at the base of the shoot, which gives an impression of bunchy top. These symptoms are very usually seen in vegetative malformation. In floral malformation because of short internodes length and thickened peduncle, the malformed peduncles give the appearance of compact mass of flowers which are mostly male (Majumder and Sinha, 3\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

Increased total activity of LDH isozymes in the seminal plasma of mice is due to increased level of M-isozymes of LDH in the treated group. Such increased level of M-isozymes of LDH in seminal plasma of neem oil treated mice caused more accumulation of lactate and decreased cellular respiration. Possibly this may impair sperm motility and cause higher mortility of spermatozoa in the treated group of mice.

Agricultural credit has played a vital role in supporting agricultural production in India. The green revolution characterised by a greater use of inputs like fertilisers, seeds and other inputs has increased the credit requirements which were provided by non-institutional and institutional sources-agricultural financial institutions. Although the role of financial institutions increased during the last fifty years after the start of planned development in the country but still it is out of reach to a large section of the rural people. During this period share of agricultural credit has been rising in proportion to agricultural and total gross domestic product but agricultural credit remains almost constant as proportion of total credit. Therefore there is still scope for higher allocation of credit to agricultural and rural sector to achieve\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

{"title": "Analysis of mixed mode crack initiation angle and fatigue crack growth\n", "abstract": " Fracture mechanics has been established as an important principle dealing with the growth of fatigue crack. During recent years, the fracture mechanics has obtained a considerable importance for studding the crack growth behavior under static and fatigue loading. The largest number of in-service failures results from the scenario involving fluctuating, cyclic or repeated loading, usually combination with static load. Typically, a defect located near a stress raiser enlarges under repeated tensile stresses into a crack that continues to grow stably a small amount during each load cycle until the crack either penetrates the structure or attains critical length, after which unstable crack propagation occurs.The present investigation has been under taken keeping in mind some of the problems concerning the crack propagation direction and growth under constant amplitude load in an inclined crack geometry.

But in the previous reported works on filled frames with opening, effect of lintel band over opening is not prperly covered. Objective of the present study was to understand behaviour of the brick masonry (BM) infilled reinforced concrete (RC) frame having shear connection between BM infill and the RC frame, and opening having isolated lintel and continuous lintel band. Three infilled frame models were tested for this purpose. The first model was BM infilled RC frame without opening. The second model was BM infilled RC frame with opening having continuous hand. The third model was BM infilled RC frame with opening having isolated lintel Shear connection between the enclosing frame and the infill was provided by the offsets in the alternate courses of the BM and casting the concrete after the BM was cast, Experimental results of the three types of frames under static loading were compared and it is concluded that due to higher load at first crack, more number of cracks at ultimate load, higher stiffness, strength and energy absorption capacity, the RC frame with opening having continuous lintel band was far more superior to infilled RC frame with opening having isolated lintel.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

Analytical tools can be used to tune axle system dynamics in order to alleviate noise and vibration issues. Analytical results can be utilized to evaluate design alternatives, reduce the number of prototypes, thus to reduce product development time.

The proper selection of processing sequence and their quality control can provide improvement for this problem. It has been seen that the effect of random noise leaking into the deconvolution operator cause most wavelet instability problems. This can be minimized by using surface consistent hypothesis. In this hypothesis, a seismic trace is the convolution of source operator, a receiver operator, a reflecdvity operator and offset related operator. Application of surface consistent deconvolution (SCD) on real data shows tremendous improvement in data quality by reducing random noise, removing the variation of amplitudes due to near surface irregularities and improves the statics estimation. On the other hand, single trace deconvolution fails to do so. In this paper effect of SCD on wavelet stability and seismic attributes have been studied by selecting a portion of seismic line from Vindhyan basin, India. Its robust to any kind of noise and estimation of stable wavelets have also been shown and correlated from the single trace deconvolution. Seismic attributes extracted from surface consistent deconvolved data show major differences as compared to single trace deconvolved data. This improvement of seismic data may be highly helpful in extracting micro-detailed information during interpretation and reservoir characterization.Introduction:", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

For irrigated crops, the main source of energy was fertilisers followed by electricity and diesel. However, for rainfed crops, the maximum energy was consumed in the form of seeds. In physical terms for the year 1990-91, there was a need for 2006 million units of electricity (1 unit-1 kwh), 116 million litres of diesel, 0.46 million tons of the nitrogenous fertilisers and 0.003 million tons of pesticide chemicals (active ingredients). There would be an increase in the requirement of seeds for paddy, soyabean, maize, wheat, gram, pea, mustard and potatoes whereas the requirement of seeds for sorghum, cotton, tur and sugarcane will decrease with respect to their needs for the year 1990-91.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1783"]}
{"title": "Geotechnical Studies for Slope Design of a Large Opencast Coal Mine\n", "abstract": " \u6b63 The paper discusses about geotechnical evaluation and slope design of one of the largest opencast coal mine, Gevra (India), which is currently 45 m deep with a strike length of about 5 km and annually produces more than 10 million tons of coal and more than 12 million m~ 3 of overburden/waste rock. Geotechnical investigations were carried out to design overall pit slopes for a depth of 180 m. The cores of four diamond drill boreholes were tested for representative engineering parameters for the pit design. A few direct shear tests on weak planes have also been done to determine the cohesion and friction angle. Simplified Bishop method and Sarma's method were used for stability analysis. It was found that 44 overall slope angle is safe for 180 m high slope. This slope steepening has resulted into saving of huge area of agricultural land around the mine, which otherwise would have been used for dumping of the overburden material. So, it helped for the betterment of the environment around the mine.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

Its success varies greatly due to several factors including velocity anisotropy. The characterstics of seismic signals depend upon the properties of the medium of propagation. In an anisotropic medium the seismic properties depend on the direction of wave propagation which may seriously affect the results of basic processing, interpretation as well as specialised studies like AVO analysis. The effect of velocity anisotropy is not only limited to the angular dependence of reflection coefficients but it also distorts the AVO signatures due to redistribution of energy along the wavefront of the wave travelling down to the reflector and coming up to the surface. An appropriate analytical expression of reflection coefficients using ray velocity has been derived in weak anisotropic condition.

A certain combination of C, Cr and Mo has shown improved sulphide stress cracking resistance. The susceptibility of high Cr steel can be explained, at least in part, by the enhanced absorption of hydrogen. As Cr content increases, the solubility of H in steel increases drastically. This may be associated with the formation of chromium carbide which as incoherent interface with matrix, thereby providing large trap sites for H. Molybdenum has been found to improve the sulphide stress cracking resistance, at least up to 0.7%. The precipitation of molybdenum carbide is thought to be the reason for this improvement.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1783"]}
{"title": "End point for sclerosis of esophageal varices.\n", "abstract": " BACKGROUND: Small esophageal varices are difficult to inject intravariceally and complete eradication of varices may not be therapeutically necessary. METHODS: A prospective study designed to compare the use of different end points of sclerotherapy ie (i) total eradication (grade 0)(ii) grade I varices or (iii) grade II white (IIw) varices, by stopping variceal injection when one of these was reached. The patients were followed endoscopically and clinically at 3-4 mo intervals. OUTCOME MEASURES: Variceal recurrence and rebleeding rates. RESULTS: Of 266 patients with portal hypertension (147 cirrhosis, 51 non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis, 68 extra-hepatic portal venous obstruction), 232 (87.2%) reached one of the three end points--six to grade 0, 96 to grade I and 130 to grade IIw. Among 212 patients followed up for a mean post-sclerotherapy period of 12.2 mo (range 3-48 mo), variceal recurrence rates, time intervals to recurrence and rebleed rates were comparable in patients with endpoints of grade I and grade II (white) varices (28.5% vs 38.9%, 10.8 mo vs 9.2 mo, and 7.7% vs 7.8%, respectively; all p= ns). Overall, 51 patients had interval bleed before reaching the end point--50 (98%) of them bled from grade III and IV varices while only one patient (2%) bled with grade IIw varices. CONCLUSION: Grade I or grade IIw varices should be acceptable as the end points for endoscopic sclerotherapy of esophageal varices.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

Sandy soils are often deficient in available sulphur and crop responses to sulphur on such soils have been reported (Aulakh et ah 1977). Application of sulphur has been observed (Joshi & Seth 1975) to increase the availability of soil P. The present study was carried out to investigate the effect of sulphur fertilization on an arid sandy soil from two sources viz, pyrite and gypsum, on growth and nutrsent uptake by cowpea as well as on some soil properties (pH and available P status).A sample of bulk soil was collected from the Central Research Farm, Central Arid Zone Research Institute, Jodhpur. It was alkaline in reaction (pH 8.4), low in organic carbon (0.2%), available N (150 kg/ha), available S (6.5 ppm) and medium in available P (9.5 ppm).

{"title": "Forms of Selenium in Soils of Western Uttar Pradesh\n", "abstract": " The amount of selenium occurring in soil affects the crops, and the animals which feed on them. When present in excess, it inhibits growth of plants, but at low level it has a stimulatory effect on some crops (Trelease & Trelease 1938). Since the soils of western Uttar Pradesh are neutral to alkaline, having free lime or gypsum and high salt content, some of these may contain potentially toxic levels of selenium (Kubota & AUaway 1972). The information regarding selenium status in the soils of this area is practically lacking and western UP being a cattle raising region the study was taken up.Four hundred and sixty surface (0-15 cm) soil samples were collected from Agra and Meerut regions of western Uttar Pradesh. From each district about 45 to 50 sites were selected for sampling. The soils were analysed for pH, electrical conductivity (EC), organic carbon, CaCOs and clay content by standard procedures (Jackson\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

All the compounds synthesized are colourless liquids which can be distilled under reduced pressure. The synthesized compounds were characterised by their elemental analysis, and i.r. and p.m.r. spectral studies. The molecular weights of these compounds in boiling benzene have been determined.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

{"title": "Shoot apex organisation and leaf development inRicinus communis L.\n", "abstract": " Cytohistologically the shoot apex ofRicinus communis is distinguished into five zones: (i) Tunica, (ii) Corpus, (iii) Flank meristem, (iv) Rib meristem, and (v) Cambium-like zone. The cells of the cambium-like zone are radially elongated and stretched across the apex from the base of the leaf. This zone is formed during the early part of the plastochron. The differentiation of this zone begins in the centre of the apex and proceeds outwards. It becomes fully developed by mid-phase. This zone is responsible for the differentiation of the node and elongation of the stem. Leaf initiation takes place in the second tunica layer and the leaf primordium increases in height by a group of subapical initials. Apical growth of the primordium ceases when it is about 120 microns high. The cells of the middle layers are derived by the periclinal divisions of both adaxial and abaxial hypodermal layers.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1783"]}

{"title": "Fluctuation theorems for the Feynman fluid model of inclusive reactions\n", "abstract": " In order to understand simply certain features of high-energy multiproduction, FnYN~ A~(~) suggested an one-dimensional classical fluid analogue. This has stimulated considerable amount of further work. A particular iormulation of this analogue model has been done through the e] uster expansion for the moments of the multiplicity distribution by MU~ LL~ I~(2). In this note we give some exact results pertaining to Mueller's formulaVion of the fluid analogue. Our results show this particular formulation of the Feynman fluid anatogu6 to be untenable, We further comment on the general fluid analogue picture and show that the present data require the underlying picture to be that of a fluid at its critical temperature.

{"title": "Flextic: Trading time for discounts in cloud computing\n", "abstract": " Cloud computing aims to give users virtually unlimited pay-per-use computing resources without the burden of managing the underlying infrastructure. We present a system Flextic, which allows the user to benefit from a pricing model that offers flexibility at the requirements level, such as a tradeoff between different degrees of execution speed and execution price. At the same time, Flextic allows the provider to benefit from pricing contracts that guarantee the long-term usage of computing resources.This paper presents and evaluates Flextic. Flextic runs on top of cloud computing infrastructure and provides a job execution platform for users. The novelty of Flextic lies in the flexibility it offers: users can choose a price of job execution, which converges to zero if the user is willing to wait for a sufficiently long period. We evaluate Flextic on Amazon EC2. We use Flextic to manage various data intensive and compute\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1783"]}
