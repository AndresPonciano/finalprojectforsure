Due to non-uniform heat spreading, thermal hotspots are formed which reduces the system reliability.

{"title": "On finding suitable key-gate locations in logic encryption\n", "abstract": " Logic encryption is a popular technique to safeguard an IC design from different security vulnerabilities. However, several recently proposed attacks exploit the weakness in key-gate placement schemes to extract the secret keys of an encrypted design. Security of a logic encryption strategy highly depends on the locations of the key-gates in a circuit. Most of the state-of-the-art logic encryption schemes suffer from the fact that the defence strategies against different attacks demand different locations for the placement of the key-gates. Therefore, it becomes incredibly challenging for a single solution to thwart all the state-of-the-art attacks. In this paper, we address this issue and propose a strategy which judiciously selects the locations of the key-gates to prevent different attacks and simultaneously satisfies another fundamental criterion of logic encryption, i.e., high output corruption for wrong keys.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["1066"]}

{"title": "Low Power Pseudoexhaustive Testing with Cellular Automata\n", "abstract": " Compared to exhaustive testing, pseudo exhaustive testing requires a smaller test size and lesser test time. Dynamic power dissipation accounts for the major share of power dissipation in CMOS circuits. The amount of heat dissipated limits the density of a chip. The test mode power has been proved to be more than the functional power dissipation. In this work, we propose a method to identify the seed Cellular Automata (CA) that dissipates the minimum energy, during test. It has been observed that for many circuits, the variation in energy consumption is upto 83.78% at the maximum (3.86% at the minimum), considering all CA configurations. The variation in peak energy consumption is upto a maximum of 50% ( 8.62% at the minimum) among all CA configurations.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1066"]}

The blocking pattern is used to prevent the scan-chain transitions to reach circuit inputs. This, though reduce dynamic power significantly; can result in quite an increase in the leakage power. We have presented a novel approach to select a blocking pattern using genetic algorithm and use it properly so that both dynamic and leakage power are reduced.

{"title": "Synthesis & Testing for Low Power\n", "abstract": " In recent years, power dissipation has emerged as the key issue not only for portable computers and mobile communication devices, but also for high-end systems. Reducing power dissipation is of primary importance in achieving longer battery life in portable devices. On the other hand, for high-end systems the cooling and packaging requirements are pushing the chip designers for low power alternatives. As a consequence, apart from the size, cost and performance, now-a- days power is also considered as one of the most important constraints. This has led to vigorous research in the synthesis of low-power and high-performance circuits and systems. Moreover, aggressive device size scaling used to achieve high-performance leads to increased variability due to short-channel and other effects. This, in turn, leads to variations in process parameters such as, L eff , N ch , W, T ox ,W t  V,, etc. Performance\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1066"]}

FFT based block processing is then used on the received input block and the decision block to carry out the block ADFE operation. A direct floating point (FP) based realization of this scheme, however, pushes up the cost and complexity of processing hugely, as each FP operation involves several additional steps not present in its fixed point (FxP) counterpart. To overcome this problem, a block floating point (BFP) based treatment is presented in this paper for realization of the block ADFE. The proposed scheme, while maintaining FP like high dynamic range, deploys mostly FxP operations and thus reduces the processing cost and complexity substantially.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1066"]}

On-chip test pattern generators often suffer from the problem that they require incorporation of idle cycles between the test patterns. In this paper we present a scheme that can generate any given sequence of test patterns using a scheme based on cellular automata (CA) and some associated circuitry without any inserted idle cycles. This also results in up to 95% reduction in the memory requirement over the direct storage of the patterns. Moreover, regular, modular and cascadable structures of CA with local interconnections make the scheme ideally suited for VLSI implementation.

The use of MPSoC (Multi-Processor System on Chip) based design of real-time safety-critical embedded systems (such as, Avionics, Automotive etc.) is really a challenge because of the requirement of time predictability and reliability of highest degree. Task mapping and flow priority assignment are two crucial steps for real-time NoC design.

{"title": "Teel Cord Skim Compound for Radial Tyre Based on Natural Rubber-Carbon Black-Organoclay Nanocomposites\n", "abstract": " A novel carbon black (CB) and nanoclay (NC) filled system in Natural rubber (NR) matrix has been developed for steel cord tyre ply compound with optimized performance properties. The effect of partial replacement of CB (N-220) by two different kinds of nanoclay (Cloisite-20A and Cloisite-30B) on the adhesion properties has been extensively investigated. The nanocomposites have shown improved adhesion properties between steel cord and rubber (aged and unaged) ie pull out force and rubber coverage (%), for relatively lower loading of both Cloisite 20A and Cloisite 30B (3 phr). The addition of nanoclay at lower loading (upto 3 phr) leads to an increase in the overall performance of the rubber compound. Due to nano filler reinforcement, the cohesive strength of the nanocomposites increases, but it is still lower than the adhesive force between steel cord and rubber. As a result the failure is mostly cohesive with higher pull out force. The adhesion improvement is more significant in case of 3phr Cloisite 30B. Cloisite 30B contains polar modified quaternary alkyl ammonium ions as intercalants in its gallery spacing, which may form hydrogen bonding with the resin network available near the copper sulphide bonding layer and leads to better rubber reinforcement and higher pull out force.

It reduces the time to market and product cost. The back bone of any diagnosis algorithm is the test set in use.

The proposed method, which takes as input a test set generated for high fault coverage, is capable of increasing the diagnostic power of the test set without affecting its fault coverage. It is able to achieve this with either no or small increase in number of patterns. The crux of the method lies in introducing test patterns having `X' bits into the test set without changing its coverage, and using a `X' bit filling algorithm to maximize its diagnostic power.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1066"]}
