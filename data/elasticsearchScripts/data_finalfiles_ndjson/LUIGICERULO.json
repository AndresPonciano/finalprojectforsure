{"title": "Learning gene regulatory networks from only positive and unlabeled data\n", "abstract": " Recently, supervised learning methods have been exploited to reconstruct gene regulatory networks from gene expression data. The reconstruction of a network is modeled as a binary classification problem for each pair of genes. A statistical classifier is trained to recognize the relationships between the activation profiles of gene pairs. This approach has been proven to outperform previous unsupervised methods. However, the supervised approach raises open questions. In particular, although known regulatory connections can safely be assumed to be positive training examples, obtaining negative examples is not straightforward, because definite knowledge is typically not available that a given pair of genes do not interact. A recent advance in research on data mining is a method capable of learning a classifier from only positive and unlabeled examples, that does not need labeled negative examples. Applied to the reconstruction of gene regulatory networks, we show that this method significantly outperforms the current state of the art of machine learning methods. We assess the new method using both simulated and experimental data, and obtain major performance improvement. Compared to unsupervised methods for gene network inference, supervised methods are potentially more accurate, but for training they need a complete set of known regulatory connections. A supervised method that can be trained using only positive and unlabeled data, as presented in this paper, is especially beneficial for the task of inferring gene regulatory networks, because only an incomplete set of known regulatory connections is available in public\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "114\n", "authors": ["201"]}

Several classes of sequence-based features have been proposed to distinguish between coding and non-coding transcripts. Among them, open reading frame, conservation scores, nucleotide arrangements, and RNA secondary structure have been used with success in literature to recognize intergenic long non-coding RNAs, a particular subclass of non-coding RNAs. In this paper we perform a systematic assessment of a wide collection of features extracted from sequence data. We use most of the features proposed in the literature, and we include, as a novel set of features, the occurrence of repeats contained in transposable elements. The aim is to detect signatures (groups of features) able to distinguish long non-coding transcripts from other classes, both protein-coding and non-coding. We evaluate different feature selection algorithms, test for signature stability, and evaluate the prediction ability of a signature with a machine learning algorithm. The study reveals different signatures in human, mouse, and zebrafish, highlighting that some features are shared among species, while others tend to be species-specific.

It can happen that due to gene mutations, as for example when cancer progresses, the gene expression network undergoes some amount of localized re-wiring. The ability to detect statistical relevant changes in the interaction patterns induced by the progression of the disease can lead to the discovery of novel relevant signatures. Several procedures have been recently proposed to detect sub-network differences in pairwise labeled weighted networks.

The proposed procedure exploits a more effective model selection criteria to generate p-values for statistical significance and is more efficient in terms of computational time and prediction accuracy than literature methods.

GBM can be subcategorized into four distinct subtypes; tumors that shift towards the mesenchymal phenotype upon recurrence are generally associated with treatment resistance, unfavorable prognosis, and the infiltration of pro-tumorigenic macrophages. We explore the transcriptional regulatory networks of mesenchymal-associated tumor-associated macrophages (MA-TAMs), which drive the malignant phenotypic state of GBM, and identify macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO) as the most highly differentially expressed gene. MARCOhigh TAMs induce a phenotypic shift towards mesenchymal cellular state of glioma stem cells, promoting both invasive and proliferative activities, as well as therapeutic resistance to irradiation. MARCOhigh TAMs also significantly accelerate tumor engraftment and growth in vivo. Moreover, both MA-TAM master regulators and their target genes are significantly correlated with poor clinical outcomes and are often associated with genomic aberrations in neurofibromin 1 (NF1) and phosphoinositide 3-kinases/mammalian target of rapamycin/Akt pathway (PI3K-mTOR-AKT)-related genes.

We used transcriptome profiling, in silico analysis, immunohistochemistry, western blot, RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence staining to characterize novel CRC immune biomarkers. The effects of selective antagonists were tested by in vitro assays of long term viability and analysis of kinase active forms using anti-phospho antibodies. We identified the lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus G6D (LY6G6D) as significantly overexpressed (around 15-fold) in CRC when compared with its relatively low expression in other human solid tumours. LY6G6D up-regulation was predominant in MSS CRCs characterized by an enrichment of immune suppressive regulatory T-cells and a limited repertoire of PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint receptors. Coexpression of LY6G6D and CD15 increases the risk of metastatic relapse in response to therapy. Both JAK-STAT5 and RAS-MEK-ERK cascades act in concert as key regulators of LY6G6D and Fucosyltransferase 4 (FUT4), which direct CD15-mediated immune-resistance.

{"title": "A visual approach to define xml to fo transformations\n", "abstract": " XML is the most influential standard for data exchange and Web presentation. The power of XML derives from the fact that the aspects of structuring, representing and visualizing a piece of information are handled independently with specific tools. In this article we deal with the information visualization aspect, which in XML is managed through XSLT transformations, and propose a visual approach to define XML to FO transformations. The approach has been implemented in a graphical environment that eases the definition of the format and visualization of XML documents by means of a graphicalcontent/container metaphor.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["201"]}

{"title": "Deep learning predicts short non-coding RNA functions from only raw sequence data\n", "abstract": " Small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are short non-coding sequences involved in gene regulation in many biological processes and diseases. The lack of a complete comprehension of their biological functionality, especially in a genome-wide scenario, has demanded new computational approaches to annotate their roles. It is widely known that secondary structure is determinant to know RNA function and machine learning based approaches have been successfully proven to predict RNA function from secondary structure information. Here we show that RNA function can be predicted with good accuracy from a lightweight representation of sequence information without the necessity of computing secondary structure features which is computationally expensive. This finding appears to go against the dogma of secondary structure being a key determinant of function in RNA. Compared to recent secondary structure based methods, the proposed solution is more robust to sequence boundary noise and reduces drastically the computational cost allowing for large data volume annotations.

{"title": "Can fuzzy mathematics enrich the assessment of software maintainability?\n", "abstract": " Software maintainability depends both on qualitative and quantitative data. Existing maintainability models aggregate data into hierarchies of characteristics with given dependencies. However, data used to score the characteristics can be uncertain or even completely unknown. Therefore, it would be meaningful to evaluate sensitivity of the aggregated result, ie the maintainability, with respect to the uncertainty and incompleteness of data. In addition, real cases require an aggregation model able to evaluate the impact of changing the dependencies among the characteristics in the hierarchy on the maintainability. In this paper we argue that fuzzy mathematics can help to solve these problems. In particular, we show how a fuzzy aggregation model can be adopted to evaluate maintainability according to a hierarchical model.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["201"]}
{"title": "Transforming quantities into qualities in assessment of software systems\n", "abstract": " The assessment of software systems often requires to consider together qualitative and quantitative aspects. Because of the different nature, measures belong to different domains. The main problem is to aggregate such information into a derived measure able to provide an overall estimation. This problem has been traditionally solved trough the transformation of qualitative assessments into quantitative measures. Indeed, such a transformation implicitly assumes a conceptual equivalence between the terms quantitative and objective on one side, and qualitative and subjective on the other side. An alternative approach is to consider logical aggregation models, able to infer the overall evaluation based on the assessment of individual attributes. This approach requires an early transformation of quantitative measures in qualitative assessments. Such a transformation is possible trough the use of judgment functions\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["201"]}

Beside traditional unsupervised techniques, a supervised classifier learns, from known examples, a function that is able to recognize new relationships for new data. In the context of gene regulatory inference a supervised classifier is coerced to learn from positive and unlabeled examples, as the counter negative examples are unavailable or hard to collect. Such a condition could limit the performance of the classifier especially when the amount of training examples is low. In this paper we improve the supervised identification of transcriptional targets by selecting reliable counter negative examples from the unlabeled set.

{"title": "Infer gene regulatory networks from time series data with formal methods\n", "abstract": " Reverse engineering of regulatory relationships from genomics data is emerging as crucial to dissect the complex underlying regulatory mechanism occurring in a cell. In this paper we propose a novel reverse engineering algorithm that makes use of formal methods, usually adopted in engineering to specify and verify concurrent software and hardware systems. With a formal specification of gene regulatory hypotheses we are able to prove mathematically whether a time course experiment belongs or not to the formal specification, determining in fact whether a gene regulation exists or not. The method is capable to detect both direction and sign (inhibition/activation) of regulations whereas most of literature methods which are limited to undirected and/or unsigned relationships. The method, empirically evaluated on experimental and synthetic datasets, reaches high levels of accuracy, outperforming literature\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["201"]}

This study evaluated whether circulating miRNAs display differential expression profiles in peripheral blood of CML-Chronic Phase (CML-CP) patients newly diagnosed in comparison with CML-CP treated with imatinib. We obtained peripheral blood samples from CML-CP Ph+ patients divided among group 1 (untreated newly diagnosed) and group 2 (treated with imatinib). A pool of total leukocytes from healthy donors was considered as control group. Expression analyses were performed for 768 miRNAs by RT-qPCR array.

{"title": "Centrosome Dynamics and Its Role in Inflammatory Response and Metastatic Process\n", "abstract": " Metastasis is a process by which cancer cells escape from the location of the primary tumor invading normal tissues at distant organs. Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a hallmark of human cancer, associated with metastasis and therapeutic resistance. The centrosome plays a major role in organizing the microtubule cytoskeleton in animal cells regulating cellular architecture and cell division. Loss of centrosome integrity activates the p38-p53-p21 pathway, which results in cell-cycle arrest or senescence and acts as a cell-cycle checkpoint pathway. Structural and numerical centrosome abnormalities can lead to aneuploidy and CIN. New findings derived from studies on cancer and rare genetic disorders suggest that centrosome dysfunction alters the cellular microenvironment through Rho GTPases, p38, and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal Kinase)-dependent signaling in a way that is favorable for pro-invasive secretory phenotypes and aneuploidy tolerance. We here review recent data on how centrosomes act as complex molecular platforms for Rho GTPases and p38 MAPK (Mitogen activated kinase) signaling at the crossroads of CIN, cytoskeleton remodeling, and immune evasion via both cell-autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms.

Several genes has been found to be implicated as miRNA targets in different types of malignant tumors suggesting their involvement in cancer pathogenesis.

Indirect regulons of miRNA and Transcription Factors (TFs) are compared with the Fisher\u2019s exact test to identify potential co-regulations which may constitute potential miRNA\u2013TF direct associations.

{"title": "Labeling negative examples in supervised learning of new gene regulatory connections\n", "abstract": " Supervised learning methods have been recently exploited to learn gene regulatory networks from gene expression data. The basic approach consists into building a binary classifier from feature vectors composed by expression levels of a set of known regulatory connections, available in public databases or known in literature. Such a classifier is then used to predict new unknown connections.               The quality of the training set plays a crucial role in such an inference scheme. In binary classification the training set should be composed of positive and negative examples, but in Biology literature the only collected information is whether two genes interact. Instead, the counterpart information is usually not reported, as Biologists are not aware to state whether two genes are not interacting.
