The k-NN method uses the well-known principle of Cicero pares cum paribus facillime congregantur (birds of a feather flock together or literally equals with equals easily associate). It tries to classify an unknown sample based on the known classification of its neighbors. Let us suppose that a set of samples with known classification is available, the so-called training set. Intuitively, each sample should be classified similarly to its surrounding samples. Therefore, if the classification of a sample is unknown, then it could be predicted by considering the classification of its nearest neighbor samples. Given an unknown sample and a training set, all the distances between the unknown sample and all the samples in the training set can be computed.

{"title": "Software engineering techniques applied to agricultural systems\n", "abstract": " Currently, UML is widely accepted by the software industry to be the modeling language used to construct models. Several UML diagrams are used to present the dynamic and the static aspects of a software system. Although UML diagrams enormously facilitate the process of designing flexible and complex systems, they are not precise enough to express without ambiguity all aspects of the problem in study. Thus, in order to fill this vacuum in UML models, a precise language is needed to express without ambiguities the dynamic and static aspects of a UML model. The object constraint language (OCL) was created in 1995 by some IBM engineers in Europe [100]. OCL is part of formal languages and it is very much influenced by Syntropy [23].

{"title": "Advances in modeling agricultural systems\n", "abstract": " Agriculture has experienced a dramatic change during the past decades. The change has been structural and technological. Structural changes can be seen in the size of current farms; not long ago, agricultural production was organized around small farms, whereas nowadays the agricultural landscape is dominated by large farms. Large farms have better means of applying new technologies, and therefore technological advances have been a driving force in changing the farming structure. New technologies continue to emerge, and their mastery and use in requires that farmers gather more information and make more complex technological choices. In particular, the advent of the Internet has opened vast opportunities for communication and business opportunities within the agricultural com-nity. But at the same time, it has created another class of complex issues that need to be addressed sooner rather than later. Farmers and agricultural researchers are faced with an overwhelming amount of information they need to analyze and synthesize to successfully manage all the facets of agricultural production. This daunting challenge requires new and complex approaches to farm management. A new type of agricultural management system requires active cooperation among multidisciplinary and multi-institutional teams and ref-ing of existing and creation of new analytical theories with potential use in agriculture. Therefore, new management agricultural systems must combine the newest achievements in many scientific domains such as agronomy, economics, mathematics, and computer science, to name a few.", "num_citations": "32\n", "authors": ["602"]}

Data on 120 SMEs for 2017\u20132018 were analyzed using multivariate regressions and multilayer perceptron artificial neural networks. Initially, the data were analyzed using multivariate regression analyses to find the correlation between firms\u2019 growth measured by three different indicators: return on equity, return on assets and business size. In this approach, growth takes into consideration a firm\u2019s liquidity, its op\u2010erational efficiency, and leverage indicators in addition to organizational characteristics. The results obtained during the initial phase were fed to the multilayer perceptron artificial neural networks model to evaluate SMEs growth and further their sustainable growth process by using the age of the firm, classified into start\u2010up, grown, and matured stages. The model results showed that SMEs in the start\u2010up stage assume a risk\u2010taker approach toward sustainable growth. In the grown stage, they implement a market\u2010timing strategy in selecting investments toward a sustainable growth perspective. Those in matured stage replicate the liberal managerial style of the SMEs in start\u2010up stage, but employ a less aggressive strategy.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["602"]}
{"title": "Using Mind Genomics to advertise tourism in Albania\n", "abstract": " The advent of the Internet has changed the advertisement paradigm. Nowadays, companies must have not only a solid presence in the web but also the right tools for online advertisement. In this paper the new technology of Minds Genomics is used to advertise tourism in Albania. An online experiment is conceived based on Experimental Design principles. Participants evaluate combinations of messages (elements) about tourism, rate each combination and then select an emotion that they feel when reading the messages, thus combining a quantitative and a qualitative approach in one study. The collected data are used to create simple models using regression to show the statistical relevance of each of the messages to the degree of total participant\u2018s appreciation and to evaluate their perceived positive, neutral or negative emotion. Ordinary least squares regression models and advanced data mining techniques (k\u2014means clustering) to analyze the data and classify the users accordingly. At the end of the analyses, a set of two or three mind sets are presented to show how participants in the study are clustered in different mind sets.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["602"]}
{"title": "Linking Food Endorsement Labels & Messaging to Perceived Price and Emotions. A Mind Genomics\u00ae Exploration\n", "abstract": " Respondents evaluated systematically created vignettes (short combinations), comprising actual logos, along with messages. The approach, Mind Genomics, allows each respondent to evaluate a unique set of combinations, rating each combination on two attributes, appropriate price and feeling/emotion best describing one\u2019s feeling after reading the vignette. The experimental design uncovers the relation between the presence/absence of the 36 elements (including logos and messaging), and both the selected price and linkage to positive and negative emotions, respectively. The results were analyzed for total panel, gender, those who identified themselves as halal or kosher, respectively, and emergent mind-sets.The authors concluded that the use of the Mind Genomics approach did not produce clear segmentation when the respondent made a judgment of price or emotion. They were just different. Halal users were willing to pay much more for halal food and those with labels that stress the Muslin Qur\u2019anic origin than were kosher users. The Torah origin of kosher did not dramatically increase the price willing-to-pay of kosher users. Halal users appeared to be more positive toward halal food, than kosher users including when they read about halal. Thus, the strongest relations emerged from respondents who identified themselves as halal users. The application of Mind Genomics to any aspect of everyday life expands many types of scientific studies.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["602"]}
{"title": "Research Open\n", "abstract": " The paper introduces a case study aiming to answer the question of what concerns healthy people about the prospect of cancer? The results suggest two distinct mind-sets. The mind-set is Life-Quality Pursuers, who are concerned the result is temporary and think cancer is chronic disease. The second mind-set is Outcome-Worriers, who fear the outcome, and worry about no recovery. The Outcome-Worriers are concerned a lot about physical pains and symptoms like nausea and joint pain. Incorporating the results of Mind Genomics and the mind-sets into a short, online personal viewpoint identifier, permits the use of these scientific results to assign a new patient to one of the two mind-sets. The benefit is the ability to better communicate information and instructions to the patients, based on the nature of the messages to which they are like to be most receptive.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["602"]}

Almost every decade brings a new programming environment that forces software engineers to rewrite their systems to take into account new developments. The software industry faces other considerable challenges as it tries to build larger, more complex software systems with fewer resources. Although modern programming languages such as C++ and Java have in general improved the software development process, they have failed to significantly increase developer\u2019s productivity [88]. On the other hand, the complexity of the systems to be developed is constantly increasing; customers expect more complex and sophisticated systems that often exceed the abilities of the software industry to develop them.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["602"]}

{"title": "Support vector machines\n", "abstract": " Support vector machines (SVMs) are supervised learning methods used for classification [30, 41, 232]. This is one of the techniques among the top 10 for data mining [237]. In their basic form, SVMs are used for classifying sets of samples into two disjoint classes, which are separated by a hyperplane defined in a suitable space. Note that, as consequence, a single SVM can only discriminate between two different classifications. However, as we will discuss later, there are strategies that allow one to extend SVMs for classification problems with more than two classes [232, 220]. The hyperplane used for separating the two classes can be defined on the basis of the information contained in a training set.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["602"]}
{"title": "A UML-based Plug&Play version of RothC\n", "abstract": " This chapter presents the stepwise conversion of the FORTRAN-based RothC Soil Organic Carbon model into a plug&play component amenable to use as part of larger modeling frameworks. As a first step, RothC was converted into a stand-alone Java modular application to ensure consistency with the parent model. The plug&play component was then developed based on the Unified Modeling Language (UML). The plug&play component provides services that other system/components can easily use. The behavior of RothC is presented through interfaces that other system/components can implement. The use of interfaces to express behavior of components facilitates the collaboration of teams located in different geographic regions. Various UML diagrams present static and dynamic aspects of the system. UML facilitates model documentation, and the plug&play architecture facilitates implementation by\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["602"]}

{"title": "The Plug and Play Architecture\n", "abstract": " Software engineers are facing increasing pressure from clients to provide architectural solutions that can be built with today's requirements and be flexible enough to meet future needs. It is common practice in the domain of software development to see customers constantly modifying and expanding the requirements of the future system. Faced with the reality of everchanging requirements, it is desirable to use an architecture that allows for easy modifications of existing functionalities and easy adoption of new ones. An architecture that is designed to minimize the impact of future changes is the\" plug and play\" architecture.

{"title": "Model Driven Architecture for Software Application Generation\n", "abstract": " Modeling software system is a common aid to the software development process. There are many advantages to modeling, however, these are limited by the fact that modeling is typically only descriptive, and can not be used to generate code. Model Driven Architecture (MDA), an OMG initiative, allows for the creation of declarative models that can be used as the specification for the generation of entire software systems. Using such an approach has significant advantages, especially with regard to agricultural and environmental simulations which are often complex and evolve over time.This paper presents an overview of Model Driven Architecture and how it can be used to drive application generation. Platform Independent Model, Platform Specific Model, and transformation definition concepts are discussed, the MDA process is reviewed, and key advantages of the MDA approach are presented, with special emphasis on the generation of applications that simulate agricultural systems.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["602"]}
{"title": "Object-oriented approach to crop modeling: Concepts and Examples\n", "abstract": " This research was initiated to learn what the crop modeling community could do to facilitate an evolution from existing crop models toward more modular ones that can meet increasing demands. Specific objectives are to 1) use UML to design and implement a modular crop model using an object oriented language, and 2) to compare the characteristics of this model and its development with a modular model written in FORTRAN. To better understand issues and challenges of using an object oriented (OO) paradigm relative to a Fortran-based model, we investigated the process with a simple, generic crop model. The complexity of the model is minimal hence allowing the focus to be more on model structure (the real issue) instead of the model itself. Two critical issues were considered throughout this study: 1) the exchangeability of modules and 2) the independence of the structure from a specific programming language.From our experience of converting a simple crop model developed in FORTRAN into an object-oriented environment we found that UML can be useful to bring modelers to discuss modeling issues without considering any particular programming language. Modelers can exchange diagrams and convert them into particular programming languages.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["602"]}
