{"title": "Formally verified implementation of an idealized model of virtualization\n", "abstract": " VirtualCert is a machine-checked model of virtualization that can be used to reason about isolation between operating systems in presence of cache-based side-channels. In contrast to most prominent projects on operating systems verification, where such guarantees are proved directly on concrete implementations of hypervisors, VirtualCert abstracts away most implementations issues and specifies the effects of hypervisor actions axiomatically, in terms of preconditions and postconditions. Unfortunately, seemingly innocuous implementation issues are often relevant for security. Incorporating the treatment of errors into VirtualCert is therefore an important step towards strengthening the isolation theorems proved in earlier work. In this paper, we extend our earlier model with errors, and prove that isolation theorems still apply. In addition, we provide an executable specification of the hypervisor, and prove that it correctly implements the axiomatic model. The executable specification constitutes a first step towards a more realistic implementation of a hypervisor, and provides a useful tool for validating the axiomatic semantics developed in previous work.", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["1687"]}
