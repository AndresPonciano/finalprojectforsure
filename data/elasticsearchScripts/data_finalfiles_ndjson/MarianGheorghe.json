{"title": "A hybrid approach based on differential evolution and tissue membrane systems for solving constrained manufacturing parameter optimization problems\n", "abstract": " This paper presents a hybrid approach based on appropriately combining Differential Evolution algorithms and Tissue P Systems (DETPS for short), used for solving a class of constrained manufacturing parameter optimization problems. DETPS uses a network membrane structure, evolution and communication rules like in a tissue P system to specify five widely used DE variants respectively put inside five cells of the tissue membrane system. Each DE variant independently evolves in a cell according to its own evolutionary mechanism and its parameters are dynamically adjusted in the process of evolution. DETPS applies the channels connecting the five cells of the tissue membrane system to implement communication in the process of evolution. Twenty-one benchmark problems taken from the specialized literature related to constrained manufacturing parameter optimization are used to test the DETPS\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "171\n", "authors": ["1814"]}

{"title": "Language generating by means of P systems with active membranes\n", "abstract": " We propose an alternative approach to generate languages by means of P systems: building up an appropriate representation for a string by means of an appropriate membrane structure and then generating the string by visiting the membrane structure according to a well-specified strategy. To this aim, we consider P systems with active membranes (allowing membrane creation or division or duplication and dissolution) where the output of a computation may be obtained either by visiting the tree associated with the membrane structure, or by following the traces of the objects, or sending out the objects. For each of these ways of defining the output of a computation, we provide characterizations of recursively enumerable languages based on P systems that use different sets of operations for modifying membrane structures.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1814"]}

It is addressed the case of regular components with various derivation modes, and with derivation processes expressed by functions. It is shown that in this case the translation power decreases, but non context free languages still may be obtained from regular languages even for more restrictive mechanisms, namely deterministic and output distinguishable devices. When the derivation process leads to functions, an upper limit of the number of derivation steps used by each component may be provided. Some necessary conditions for transforming an Xmdg device (for= 1) or a stream X-machine into a corresponding deterministic one are also settled.

A model, an abstraction of the real-world onto a mathematical/computational domain, highlights some key features while ignoring others that are assumed to be not relevant. A good model should have four properties: relevance, computability, understandability and extensibility,[23]. A model must be relevant capturing the essential properties of the phenomenon investigated; and computable so it can allow the simulation of its dynamic behavior, and the qualitative and quantitative reasoning about its properties. An understandable model will correspond well to the informal concepts and ideas of molecular biology. Finally, a good model should be extensible to higher levels of organizations, like tissues, organs, organism, etc, in which molecular systems play a key role.In this paper we will deal with models developed within the framework of membrane computing. Membrane computing is an emergent branch of natural computing introduced by G. Paun in [15]. This new model of computation starts from the assumption that the processes taking place in the compartmental structure of a living cell can be interpreted as computations. The devices of this model are called P systems.

We discuss the implementation and present an example of how visualisation rather than formal veri cation could assist the understanding of emergent properties.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1814"]}
{"title": "Timed spiking neural P systems\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we present a new class of spiking neural P systems for handling temporal information and representing temporal knowledge, called timed spiking neural P systems. A new firing principle is introduced into the timed spiking neural P systems instead of original firing and delay mechanisms in spiking neural P systems. The timed spiking neural P systems can effectively represent both qualitative and quantitative temporal information.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1814"]}
{"title": "Measurements of Fidelity from Partial Process Descriptions (Initial Results)\n", "abstract": " There are two principal methods that can be explored for systematic measurement of process fidelity. The first is via a subject reporting questionnaire such as the Shodan (TR-2003-17, 2003), the second method is via a log of the events that the team undertook during the project. In this paper we will concentrate on the use of a log, and more precisely a log that was subject reported and that does contain errors. The purpose of this investigation is to see if metrics proposed to assess the quality of mined process models can also be used to assess fidelity to process, with data from real software engineering teams. Many business processes result in well formed graphs of events that describe various events required to perform a task. This has spawned process mining as an important research area, as it is normally straightforward to identify graphs from logs of this data. Given that we have both a model of the desired\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1814"]}
{"title": "Combined power of X-machines and P systems\n", "abstract": " An overview of the main interactions between X-machines and P systems is presented. It is shown how new variants of P systems can be obtained by using X-machines as internal structures of these systems. Conversions between these models are discussed and ways to test P systems using X-machine based testing techniques are described. Finally, some flexible methods to implement different P system semantics fragments are briefly discussed.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1814"]}
{"title": "P system modelling framework\n", "abstract": " Self-assembling systems are systems whose structure emerges from local interactions at component level and not supervised from any higher level, they are collections of objects that put themselves together. P systems are a modelling paradigm which abstracts from the functionality and structure of living cells and are traditionally used to describe chemically based biological processes. The aim of this project is to investigate the power of P systems and how self-assembling systems can be described and simulated using this modelling paradigm. A framework for creating and simulating P system models is developed and presented.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1814"]}
{"title": "Eilenberg P systems with symbol-objects\n", "abstract": " A class of P systems, called EOP systems, with symbol objects processed by evolution rules distributed alongside the transitions of an Eilenberg machine, is introduced. A parallel variant of EOP systems, called EOPP systems, is also defined and the power of both EOP and EOPP systems is investigated in relationship with three parameters: number of membranes, states and set of distributed rules. It is proven that the family of Parikh sets of vectors of numbers generated by EOP systems with one membrane, one state and one single set of rules coincides with the family of Parikh sets of context-free languages. The hierarchy collapses when at least one membrane, two states and four sets of rules are used and in this case a characterization of the family of Parikh sets of vectors associated with ET0L languages is obtained. It is also shown that every EOP system may be simulated by an EOPP system and EOPP\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1814"]}
{"title": "On counting derivation in grammar systems\n", "abstract": " The paper introduces a variant of grammar systems with prior [1] or zero-sum [2] counting derivation having the associated values constrained to be in some given intervals. The generative capacity is investigated showing the strengths as well as the weaknesses of this restriction.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1814"]}
{"title": "On parsing the sequence syntax diagram according to Hartmann's method.\n", "abstract": " Some observations on parsing the sequence syntax diagrams according to Hartmann's method are given in order to introduce an indicator of the resuming capacity when an error is discovered. Some results concerning this indicator are proved. An algorithm to construct parsing procedures with a given value of the indicator is presented. The correctness of the algorithm is also proved.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1814"]}
