{"title": "Insights into startup ecosystems through exploration of multi-vocal literature\n", "abstract": " Context: Successful startup firms have the ability to create jobs and contribute to economic welfare. A suitable ecosystem developed around startups is important to form and support these firms. In this regard, it is crucial to understand the startup ecosystem, particularly from researchers\u2019 and practitioners\u2019 perspectives. However, a systematic literature research on the startup ecosystem is limited. Objective: In this study, our objective was to conduct a multi-vocal literature review and rigorously find existing studies on the startup ecosystem in order to organize and analyze them, know the definitions and major elements of this ecosystem, and determine the roles of such elements in startups\u2019 product development. Method: We conducted a multi-vocal literature review to analyze relevant articles, which are published technical articles, white papers, and Internet articles that focused on the startup ecosystem.

{"title": "Startup ecosystem effect on minimum viable product development in software startups\n", "abstract": " ContextSoftware startups develop innovative products through which they scale their business rapidly, and thus, provide value to the economy, including job generation. However, most startups fail within two years of their launch because of a poor problem-solution fit and negligence of the learning process during minimum viable product (MVP) development. An ideal startup ecosystem can assist in MVP development by providing the necessary entrepreneurial education and technical skills to founding team members for identifying problem-solution fit for their product idea, allowing them to find the right product-market fit. However, existing knowledge on the effect of the startup ecosystem elements on the MVP development is limited.ObjectiveThe empirical study presented in this article aims to identify the effect of the six ecosystem elements (entrepreneurs, technology, market, support factors, finance, and human\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "34\n", "authors": ["1326"]}
{"title": "Scaling kanban for software development in a multisite organization: Challenges and potential solutions\n", "abstract": " In software development organizations, large-scale distributed projects pose many challenges, such as hierarchical requirements, large team size, and managing workflow. Agile methods, like Scrum, seem to have limitations in addressing those issues. Kanban offers an interesting alternative in this concern by setting work-in-progress (WIP) limits to manage flow and establishing visibility of requirements using a visual signaling system. However, only few empirical studies have investigated scaling Kanban for large organizations. To address this concern, a case study was conducted in a large multisite company to identify the challenges and possible solutions in scaling Kanban. During the study, defining WIP limits, coordinating with distributed teams, and dividing features between teams were found as major challenges.

{"title": "Exploring processes in small software companies: a systematic review\n", "abstract": " Context: To attain an advantage over competitors, small software companies (SSCs) need to have an efficient software development process. However, systematic review studies that have examined the software development process within the context of SSCs are limited. Objective: Therefore, the objective of this paper is to rigorously assess the current state of practice of the software development process of SSCs using ISO/IEC 12207 standard as an analyzing framework. Method: A systematic literature review was conducted to analyze relevant papers published between 2004 and 2014. The selected papers were categorized according to the empirical technique used. A total of 41 primary papers focusing on various aspects of the software development process of SSCs were discovered out of 3841 papers.

{"title": "How are product ideas validated?\n", "abstract": " Although software startups are considered important for economic development due to their ability to quickly create cutting-edge technologies and their potential to scale to a wide market, contextual knowledge about the product idea development process of startups is poorly understood in the literature. This study explores the idea validation process of software startups in an attempt to understand the practices used for idea validation, discover how the process is affected by the founder\u2019s prior competencies, and determine the effect of those practices on requirement gathering. We conducted an exploratory multiple case study in nine software startups to determine the kind of practices they used for idea validation. We identified ten practices used as elements of the idea validation process. Our results show that idea validation is a highly non-linear process in which several validation practices are used in\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1326"]}
{"title": "The effect of competitor interaction on startup\u2019s product development\n", "abstract": " [Context and motivation] Due to lack of resources and teams with low levels of experience, startups face several challenges during their product development, such as product customization, attracting new customers, and mastering the technology uncertainty. To increase their market presence and compensate for their lack of resources, startups need to consider other options such as joint ventures and partnerships. [Question/problem] Some companies that share highly similar resources and businesses can be potential competitors with one another. The effect of interaction with such potential competitors with respect to startups to obtain expertise has not been often reported in the literature to date. [Principal ideas/results] In this study, we simulated two software startups in a controlled experiment to evaluate the effect of interaction with a potential competitor in the effort estimation process.

{"title": "Teaching a global software development course: Student experiences using onsite exercise simulation\n", "abstract": " Over the past decade, major advancements in software development have occurred in the global context. Global software development (GSD) is an effective strategy, and many higher educational institutions have been offering GSD courses. These courses are usually organized together with another institution situated in a different location. However, conducting such a course with more than one institution is not so economical since it involves greater collaboration among various institutions than in the case of a general onsite course. In this paper, we present an onsite simulation that deals with the specifics in the field of GSD training and teaching. We analyzed the students' learning reflections with a phenomenographic approach to validate the relevance of the design science construct of the course model containing an onsite simulation. Based on the analyzed data, it is possible to organize a GSD course on a\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1326"]}
{"title": "The Roles of Incubators, Accelerators,Co-working Spaces, Mentors, and Events in the Startup Development Process\n", "abstract": " This chapter aims to explore supporting factors, such as incubators, accelerators, co-working spaces, mentors, and events in the startup ecosystem. To understand these five aspects and to explore their roles in startups, we investigated an Oulu startup ecosystem. In this case study, we conducted research interviews with practitioners working with startups, accelerators, incubators, venture capital firms, and co-working space organizations. By using real case examples, the results discussed in this chapter can help entrepreneurs understand the commonalities and differences between incubators and accelerators, their types (university-based or profit/nonprofit), the kinds of business ideas, and the entrepreneurs they focus on. Furthermore, the roles of co-working spaces, mentors, and events and their effects on entrepreneurs and startups are discussed.
