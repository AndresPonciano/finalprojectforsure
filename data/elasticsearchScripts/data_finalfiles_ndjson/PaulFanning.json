Typically, bridge vibrations produced from a crowd of pedestrians are estimated by using an enhancement factor applied to the effect caused by a single pedestrian. In this paper, a single pedestrian model, represented by a spring mass damper, which incorporates variables such as pedestrian mass and body stiffness, is used to calibrate a computationally efficient moving force model. This calibrated moving force model is further used in Monte Carlo simulations of non-homogenous crowds to estimate characteristic vertical vibration levels. Enhancement factors, which could be applied to simple single pedestrian moving force models in estimating the response due to a crowd are thus derived. Such enhancement factors are then compared to previously published values. It is found that the greatest difference between the spring mass damper and moving force models respectively occurs when the bridge frequency is at the mean crowd pacing frequency.

{"title": "A novel interactive pedestrian load model for flexible footbridges\n", "abstract": " This paper describes the modelling strategies employed to simulate the interaction between a flexible and perceptibly moving ultra-lightweight composite material footbridge and a crossing pedestrian. Initially a finite element model of the footbridge, validated by comparison with measured modal data, was analysed under transient load conditions, using existing vertical load models, to simulate the measured vertical responses from single pedestrian crossings of this bridge. Comparison of the measured and predicted bridge responses displayed good agreement for most cases. The exceptions were when the pacing frequency of the test subjects was close to the resonant frequency of the bridge, where it was found that the simulations overestimated the actual response. These initial vertical simulations used moving load models, consistent with current codes of practice, which do not consider any interaction between the pedestrian and the excited structure. In this paper a moving spring-mass-damper, representing a pedestrian, with stiffness and damping characteristics based on reported biomechanical studies, is proposed as an improved alternative. This spring-mass-damper approach to modelling the crossing pedestrians allows for interaction between the pedestrian and the footbridge. Using this interactive model the measured and predicted bridge responses are shown to display good agreement for all pacing frequencies.", "num_citations": "34\n", "authors": ["1062"]}

The acoustic input of these excitations, especially the carillon and the orchestra/chorus, was found to approximate a uniform distribution across the bandwidth of interest. System identification was completed by the least squares complex exponential (LSCE) method. In general, the most pronounced of the identified natural frequencies were found to be in agreement for all excitation sources. Certain natural frequencies found by traditional modal analysis, however, were omitted from the sequence of frequencies determined by operational modal analysis.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1062"]}
{"title": "Nonlinear Modelling of a Multi-Span Arch Bridge Under Service Load Conditions\n", "abstract": " The response of a 19th-century multi-span masonry arch bridge, Queen's Bridge in Belfast, Northern Ireland, was studied using a three-dimensional non-linear finite element model under service load conditions. The full five-span bridge, with spandrel walls, fill material and surrounding soil is modelled. The interface between the masonry and the fill is characterised as a frictional contact surface to facilitate sliding or movement of the fill material relative to the arch barrel and the spandrel walls without generating tensile stresses. Physical tests are simulated by modelling passage of the test truck over the bridge model in a series of sequential static loadsteps. The numerical predictions, for crown and abutment deflections, are compared with experimental data and sensitivity analyses are performed by varying both the geometric and material properties of the bridge. While demonstrating the ability of modern analyses techniques in replicating the response of such complex bridge systems the paper also highlights some of the difficulties often encountered in modelling the response of masonry arch bridges; for example the lack of original construction drawings, incomplete knowledge of the geometric and material constituents, and the lack of detail relating to modifications undertaken after construction.

{"title": "A case study in the design and analysis for a 5.0 m deployable composite antenna\n", "abstract": " The demand for larger space-based structures has given rise to intensive research in the field of deployable and erectable systems over the past two decades. The major design drivers for space-based systems are that they are of minimum mass, and that they are dynamically isolated from their supporting spacecraft by ensuring that their first resonant frequency is above a given threshold level. This paper describes a deployable antenna concept currently being developed for use in geosynchronous earth orbit. The natural frequency of vibration of the deployable antenna is predicted using finite element eigenvalue extraction techniques and the experimental analysis of a perspex model is used to identify the optimum experimental test configuration for the manufactured antenna.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1062"]}
{"title": "Structural dynamic parameter identification and the effect of test techniques\n", "abstract": " Ambient and forced excitation test techniques are both widely used to dynamically identify civil engineering structures. Two floor levels of a newly constructed building, the Charles Institute at University College Dublin, were tested using both techniques. Both floor designs were identical although the layout of partitions above and below each were different. The objective of the tests was to determine the most appropriate test procedure and also to identify whether the layout of partitions contributes in a significant manner to dynamic response. It was found that at low levels of excitation, ambient test levels, the dynamic response of both floors was identical. In contrast, at higher vibration excitation levels, during forced vibration testing, the floor responses were substantially different. The differing modal parameters identified are attributed to an amplitude dependent response resulting from engagement, or not, of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1062"]}
{"title": "An examination of backing effects on ratings for masonry arch bridges\n", "abstract": " Many single or multispan arch bridges are strengthened with the addition of some kind of structural support between adjacent arches of multispan or beside the arch barrel of a single span to increase the strength of the overall structure. It was traditionally formed by either placing loose rubble masonry blocks between the arches and beside the arches or using mortar or concrete to construct a more substantial structural bond between the spans. On the other hand backing materials are present in some existing bridges. Existing arch assessment procedures generally ignore the effects of backing materials. In this paper an investigation of the effects of backing on ratings for masonry arch bridges is carried out. It is observed that increasing the overall lateral stability of the arch system through the inclusion of structural backing results in an enhanced failure load by reducing the likelihood of any tension occurring at the top of the arch.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1062"]}

The use of UHPFRC in prefabricated bridge deck design was the focus of recent research program, which has included experimental testing at the Laboratoire Central des Ponts et Chauss\u00e9es (within the French national project MIKTI) and numerical modeling at University College Dublin. The bridge deck system derives from the project designed by the \u201cCETE de Lyon\u201d Engineering office. It is a light two way slabs of only 14 cm in equivalent thickness, pre stressed in the transverse direction, and supported on longitudinal steel beams. A longitudinal post-tensioning system and concrete joints between adjacent modules provide continuity of load transfer in the bridge span direction. The detailed design of this innovative structure has been carried out by applying newly drawn recommendations on UHPFRC. The global response to loading and the fatigue resistance to global/local loading represent major features of the research investigation. A 3D damage model has been implemented in a finite element method to predict the mechanical behavior of the pre-stressed modules during the full-scale experiments, including the contact problem between the post-tensioned segments.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1062"]}
{"title": "Vibration Transmission Through Non-Structural Partitions Between Building Floor Levels\n", "abstract": " An assessment of the extent of vibration transmission, attributable to non-structural partitions, was made using experimental tests and numerical simulations, for a recently constructed multi-storey reinforced concrete building. Mechanical excitation was provided to one floor. The extent of vibration on the floor above was found to be as high as 65\u00a0% of that recorded on the excited floor. A numerical model was also used to simulate the response to a person walking along a corridor. The extent of transmission was 9\u00a0% with partitions and 1.8\u00a0% without them. These findings imply that the vibration level on any given floor level will be due to excitation on that particular floor and also the not insignificant level of vibration that may be transmitted through structural and non-structural components due to concurrent activity from floors above and below. This issue of vibration transmission between floor levels is not\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1062"]}

An understanding of joint stiffness, strength and ductility is required. Eurocode 3 provides guidance for predicting the ultimate strength, rotational capacity and rotational stiffness of steel flush endplate joints. This paper examines in detail the correlation be-tween Eurocode 3 predictions and actual behaviour recorded in full scale tests and validated numerical mod-els.

{"title": "Reliability analysis of footbridge serviceability considering crowd loading\n", "abstract": " The characteristic vertical response of flexible footbridges subjected to single pedestrian and crowd loading is examined in this paper. Typically, bridge vibrations produced from a crowd of pedestrians are estimated by using an enhancement factor applied to the effect caused by a single pedestrian. In this paper a moving force model is used in Monte Carlo simulations of a non-homogeneous sample of single pedestrians and crowds to estimate characteristic vertical vibration levels. Also in this work, statistical distributions of the bridge parameters are considered, these include flexural rigidity, mass and rotational stiffness at the supports. It was previously proven by the authors that the statistical range of pedestrian parameters, most notably the pacing frequency, has a significant effect on the bridge deck vibration. In this paper, probability of failure is calculated for ranges of pedestrian and bridge input parameters and it is found that the addition of statistical ranges for bridge parameters has only a small effect on the vertical acceleration response of the bridge deck. It reduced the probability of serviceability failure for a bridge with a natural frequency of 1.96 Hz and 2.2 Hz subjected to the loading of a characteristic single pedestrian.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1062"]}
{"title": "Identification and health monitoring of an instrumented building using earthquake response data\n", "abstract": " This paper describes the identification of finite dimensional, linear, time-invariant models of a 4-story building in the state space representation using multiple data sets of earthquake response. The building, instrumented with 31 accelerometers, is located on the University of California, Irvine campus. Multiple data sets, recorded during the 2005 Yucaipa, 2005 San Clemente, 2008 Chino Hills, and 2009 Inglewood earthquakes, are used for identification and validation. Considering the response of the building as the output and the ground motion as the input, the state space models that represent the underlying dynamics of the building in the discrete-time domain corresponding to each data set are identified. The four state space models identified demonstrate that the response of the building is amplitude dependent with the response frequency, and damping, being dependent on the magnitude of ground excitation\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1062"]}
{"title": "Interactive horizontal load model for pedestrians crossing footbridges\n", "abstract": " In recent years several theories have been put forward in relation to lateral forces imparted on bridges from crowd movements. It is now widely accepted that the interaction between the crowd and the structure, particularly when the crowd pacing frequency is close to the lateral natural frequency, is the major factor determining the lateral response. However, very little work has been done with individual pedestrians in order to determine the relationship between the lateral force induced by a single pedestrian and the structural response. Equally, most literature concerning lateral forces induced from walking is based on results from fixed force plate tests and hence no assessment of any interaction is made. This paper examines the lateral response of a GRP (glass-fibre reinforced polymer) cable-stayed footbridge to individual pedestrian crossings at a range of pacing frequencies.
