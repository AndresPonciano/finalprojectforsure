We will argue that current efforts are limited by a largely unexamined and unintended allegiance to an idealized view of what libraries have been, rather than what they actually are or could be. Since these limits come from current ways of thinking about the problem, rather than being inherent in the technology or in social practice, expanding our conception of digital libraries should serve to expand\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "407\n", "authors": ["2088"]}

Selective replication of content is essential because devices, especially portable ones, have limited resources for storage and communication. Cimbiosys is a novel replication platform that permits each device to define its own content-based filtering criteria and to share updates directly with other devices. In the face of fluid network connectivity, redefinable content filters, and changing content, Cimbiosys ensures two properties not achieved by previous systems. First, every device eventually stores exactly those items whose latest version matches its filter. Second, every device represents its replication-specific metadata in a compact form, with state proportional to the number of devices rather than the number of items. Such compact representation results in low data synchronization overhead, which permits ad hoc replication between newly encountered devices and frequent replication between established partners, even over low bandwidth wireless networks.", "num_citations": "133\n", "authors": ["2088"]}

A survey of 106 users provided background information about current use of these cloud storage services and identified 19 people for in-depth interviews. Use cases described in the interviews revealed a hierarchy of concepts that participants needed to master to make full use of these services. Five pivotal concepts demonstrate that users make sense of the cloud as a: personal file repository, shared file repository, personal replicated file store, shared replicated file store, and synchronization mechanism that coordinates among replicas. We propose specific ways in which process transparency and interface scaffolding can help users build a more robust model of cloud services.", "num_citations": "79\n", "authors": ["2088"]}

The second article, by Leah Graham and Panagiotis Takis Mataxas, points to experimental evidence that although most of today\u2019s students do research exclusively on the Internet, very few of them double-check the information that they find, or\u2013better yet\u2013locate multiple independent sources to corroborate what they\u2019ve learned from a single source [6].From my point of view, these articles point to two important research questions. First, and most fundamentally, much of what we read when we research a topic now arrives in digital form; how can we ensure that people are able to read it when and where they retrieve it? The second, and more provocative of the two questions is: How will people interact and work with these digital materials in a way that transcends paper to take advantage of digital media and the power of computers? The Graham and Mataxas article implies that there is a need to go beyond simply reading a single digital resource; critical thinking must be taught and the tools to support critical thinking must be available too. In other words, people must be able to interact with what they\u2019ve found.", "num_citations": "79\n", "authors": ["2088"]}

This article discusses CALLE's theoretical basis, its implementation, extensibility issues, pedagogical considerations, and its relationship to ICAI. It is based on a talk given at the CALICO '85 Symposium in Baltimore.", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["2088"]}
{"title": "Exploring the ownership and persistent value of Facebook content\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we present the results of a study examining 244 participants' attitudes about the value, ownership, and control of social network data. We use Facebook-based scenarios to elicit reactions to hypothetical statements about saving social network content that belongs to others, reusing, repurposing, and monetizing social network data, and removing social network content that is not specifically one's own. Participants also report on their own practices in each of these areas. Findings not only address issues related to ownership, but also explore the use of social networks as documentary records, and the discrepancies between participants' perceptions of how they would like their social network content to be used, and how it is actually used.", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["2088"]}
{"title": "Patterns of reading and organizing information in document triage\n", "abstract": " People engaged in knowledge work must often rapidly identify valuable material from within large sets of potentially relevant documents. Document triage is a type of sensemaking task that involves skimming documents to get a sense of their content, evaluating documents to assess their worth in the context of the current activity, and organizing documents to prepare for their subsequent use and more in\u2010depth reading. We have performed a study of document triage by collecting multiple forms of qualitative and quantitative data to characterize how 24 subjects read about a new topic and assessed and organized a set of 40 relevant Web documents. Our results indicate that there are multiple strategies for document triage, each involving different styles of reading, interacting, and organizing. Common strategies include: 1) focused reading early in the task, relegating the organizing until later in the process; 2\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["2088"]}
{"title": "For Richer, for Poorer, in Sickness or in Health... The Long-Term Management of Personal Information\n", "abstract": " People are amassing large personal information stores. These stores present rich opportunities for analysis and use in matters of wealth, health, living and legacy. But these stores also bring with them new challenges for managing information across long periods of time. Hence personal information management (PIM) research increasingly must address the long term. For the seventh PIM workshop in a successful series started in 2005, we propose taking a look at personal information with exactly this longitudinal perspective. We expect the workshop to attract a range of people doing research related to PIM, HCI, personal digital archiving, aging, and the design of informational spaces for later life. Attendees will discuss issues related to storing information for the long run, how stored information can benefit a person throughout their lifetime (and into old age), and the legacy of a person's personal information.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["2088"]}
{"title": "Storage or removal actions based on priority\n", "abstract": " Techniques for providing content management services are described. Managing content services includes determining a value of content and determining storage actions of the content based on the value. The value of the content is determined by weighting factors, such as access frequency, a rating, a size of the content, a type of the content, and a security level of the content. Based on the value of the content, one or more storage actions may be determined for the content to optimize storage. The storage actions may include identifying a version of the content to be saved, compressing the content, determining a back up of the content to store, identifying a location to store the content, performing erasure encoding of the content, and/or removing the content.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["2088"]}
{"title": "Finding the boundaries of the library without walls\n", "abstract": " In the first years of digital library efforts, there was much talk of the\" library without walls.\" The introduction of electronic resources into the traditional library showed promise for bringing about seamless\" anytime, anywhere\" access. How has this seamless access played out as digital collections grow and as an increasing number of institutions and individuals have come to maintain and use them? Contrary to this picture of seamlessness, the practical everyday reality of workplaces and public institutions like libraries is rife with boundaries that shape human interaction and any associated engagement with technology and documents. What do I mean by boundaries? Instead of relying on a hard-and-fast definition, I appeal to the reader's intuition: a boundary is something that tends to separate, to interpose; a boundary is a perceptible seam in the social fabric, the technological infrastructure, or a physical setting or may span all three. 1 Physical and social factors\u2014such as work setting, organizational structure, and the introduction of noninteroperable technologies\u2014produce some of the most noticeable boundaries. For example, studies have demonstrated that people tend to work with those colleagues who are close by (Kraut and Egido 1988). Tightly coupled work performed over a distance (using technology like videoconferencing) may be reorganized so that it is performed by colocated team members (Olsen and Teasley 1996). Distance, then, imposes a perceptible boundary that is not necessarily bridged by videoconferencing technology. On the other hand, complex work situations might have boundaries because, for example, various\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["2088"]}
{"title": "Mitigation of obsolescence for archival services\n", "abstract": " The claimed subject matter relates to an architecture that can determine costs associated with updating file formats. In particular, the architecture can interface with a network-accessible data storage service in order to determine a cost-benefit to the data storage service for a wide variety of conversion scenarios applicable to the particular topology of the data storage service. For example, the cost-benefit can differ for storage services configured according to a client-server model relative to storage services configured according to a distributed topology. Regardless, the architecture can identify a legacy format, select a converter for converting the legacy format to the updated format, and then determine the cost-benefit for a variety of conversion or migration scenarios.", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["2088"]}

Understanding the cloud-based user experience through practices\n", "abstract": " End users have begun to incorporate cloud-based services into their collaborative practices. What spurs and constrains this adoption? Are the cloud services understood adequately and used effectively? How might we intervene to promote a better connection between user practices and cloud services? In this study, we focus on collaborative practices that surround the adoption, use, and understanding of two popular, but sometimes contrasting, cloud services for creating and sharing content: Dropbox and Google Docs. We conducted 22 in-depth interviews with people who used these services, including collaborators who used the services together, and people who had migrated from Google Docs to Google Drive. We found that users thought of the cloud in terms of the practices it helped them accomplish.

{"title": "Supporting research collaboration through bi-level file synchronization\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we describe the design and use of Cimetric, a file synchronization application that supports scholarly collaboration. The system design incorporates results of earlier studies that suggest replicating content on a user's personal devices may have different characteristics than replicating content to share it with collaborators. To realize this distinction, Cimetric performs bi-level synchronization: it synchronizes local copies of a versioned repository among collaborators' computers, while it separately synchronizes private working files between each user's personal devices. Through a year's worth of in-house use of Cimetric in a variety of configurations, we were able to investigate key file synchronization issues, including the role of cloud storage given the ability to sync between peers; the strengths and weaknesses of a bi-level design; and which aspects of the synchronization process to reveal to users.", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["2088"]}

Furthermore, in an effort to explore some fresh territory, I\u2019m not going to take a curatorial perspective (see, for example, Borgman, Wallis, and Mayernik, 2010, or Tibbo et al., 2009), nor address the challenges of data storage and processing (eg Yu et al., 2008) or data sharing (eg Reichman, Jones, and Schildhauer, 2011). Instead, I\u2019m going to look outside of the pool of light, in among the digital dust bunnies, to see if I can tell a slightly different, more personal story about what someone like me (a qualitative researcher) might need to know to be part of a Big Data effort (bearing in mind boyd and Crawford\u2019s (2011) thoughtful scholarly reflections on the implications of manipulating and analyzing Big Data) 1 Big Data is surely the Gold Rush of the Information Age. Researchers across many disciplines have been seduced: currently, mining a carefully-wrought chunk of the Twitter feed can mean a high-visibility (and relatively straightforward) publication in CS or Information Science; an n-gram analysis of Google Books can form the spine of a Digital Humanities study. Every researcher I\u2019ve talked to who does one of these analyses realizes its limitations, but like me, they have been seduced by Big Data\u2019s availability and held in its thrall. 2", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["2088"]}

Now the situation is different. Not only is personal media born-digital, it may also spend its entire life stored online in social media services and cloud stores, and locally on portable devices. Studies have revealed that most people lack the requisite skills to archive their digital belongings, regardless of where they are stored; furthermore people value the context offered by these large-scale, socially intertwined online stores. So why not archive the contents of a major social media service like Facebook to ensure the permanence of a meaningful portion of peoples' personal digital belongings? Rather than being delighted by this idea, participants in a study of digital ownership have expressed squeamishness about institutional efforts to archive social media: Facebook is not only\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["2088"]}

As we gain more experience with video content, social norms about ownership have evolved accordingly, spelling out what people think is appropriate use of content that is not necessarily their own. We use a series of three studies, each centering on a different genre of recordings, to probe 634 participants' attitudes toward video storage, reuse, and remix; we also question participants about their own experiences with online video. The results allow us to characterize current practice and emerging social norms and to establish the relationship between the two.

We describe the effects of varying the genre and recency of the dataset, of testing the reliability of the workers, and of recruiting workers from different crowdsourcing platforms. We also examined the effect of redesigning the work itself, both to make it easier and to potentially improve inter-rater agreement. As a result of the debugging process, we have developed a framework for diagnosing similar efforts and a technique to evaluate worker reliability.
