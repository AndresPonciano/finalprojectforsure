{"title": "The influence of agile methodology (Scrum) on software project management\n", "abstract": " Software project management has main role in the Software industry. It includes different processes and knowledge areas. The triple constraint of the software project like time, cost and scope is directly dependent on the requirement of the project. Agile methodology is the iterative way for developing the software project for frequent changes, fast delivery and reduce risk. Software project management also plays important role in agile based software project. Agile methodology influence software project management at 10 knowledge areas. In this study we carried out survey from different software companies and it shows that almost every software company uses agile development (Scrum) and has a positive impact on the software project management.", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["1289"]}
{"title": "Software project management and its tools in practice in IT industry of Pakistan\n", "abstract": " This paper analyzes and evaluate the current level of Software Project Management And its tolls in practice in IT Industry of Pakistan. 90% IT project in Pakistan are outsourced and many international companies have built their off-shore IT companies in Pakistan due to cheap employment. As mostly projects are from developed countries and are large and complex IT projects so there is high demand of local Software Project Manager to manage these projects. Due to this high demand there are an increase in institutes which start providing Software Project Management courses and certifications and this is how Software Project Management become an integral part of IT industry of Pakistan but in small companies the roll of Project Manager varies. The introduction of this paper describes the importance and essence of Software Project Management and its tools in practice and their characteristics.

{"title": "Mobile Application testing tools and their challenges: A comparative study\n", "abstract": " Mobile Applications are turn out to be very important part of technology in recent years. These applications are very much different from desktop and web applications, and are progressively moving to be used in mission critical fields. Mobile Application needs a different methodology for assuring their quality and also needs an efficient testing approach to develop high quality product. Assuring the quality of Mobile Applications is a highly related issue since the application failure may leads to some serious consequences, i.e. damage of organization repute or maybe fiscal loss. In this study, we conducted a short survey from software development organizations of Pakistan software industry. We ask them which testing types they focus the most for Mobile Application testing and what different testing tools widely used for Mobile Application testing. On the basis of survey result we analyzed how effective the different\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1289"]}
{"title": "Risk Assessment on Software Development using Fishbone Analysis\n", "abstract": " Risks are intrinsic part of any software project. Most software projects face severe risk during the development process, but some finds minor risks. Vulnerabilities of these risks are threat to a quality of a software product. One of the main causes that may lead to failure of the project is negligence to perform risk assessment due to lack of knowledge about risk factors. The objective of this paper is to identify, classify and assess the risks that may cause negative impact to software project. We first analyze the root cause which may lead to terrible risk. Then we classified and prioritized the risks according to their nature. For this purpose, Fishbone Analysis is used. To find out risk factors probability and severity we have done questionnaire-based survey and interviews from various organizations. We collect data from different organization and perform Quantitative and Qualitative Risk Assessment. Through this assessment\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1289"]}
{"title": "A hybrid scheme for feature selection of high dimensional educational data\n", "abstract": " Now a days, in educational data sets, the gigantic amounts of records can be the problem in generating good quality data. Lately, a lot of educational researchers are using the data mining methodology to analyze the data. But, several research studies focus on the selection of right learning algorithm rather than carrying out the feature selection on data. Therefore, the dataset has problem like high computational complexity and performing classification on such data requires a lot of computational time. This paper will give a summary of the feature selection methods which are being used for analysis of features of data. The proposed hybrid methodology is a combination of both feature selection and wrapper based technique, which helps to enhance the quality of students' data set.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1289"]}
{"title": "Building a Biomedical Ontology for Chronic Liver Disease\n", "abstract": " This research aims for the creation of a core biomedical ontology for chronic liver disease using UMLS as data source. As users cannot work on the accessible information by themselves due to unstructured format of biomedical data and literature, ontologies helps to create structure for the existing information. Resource description framework (RDF) is used in prot\u00e9g\u00e9 tool for creation of schemas and on the basis of these schemas ontology is developed to describe the concepts and their respective relations within chronic liver disease. It is further evaluated by domain experts.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1289"]}
{"title": "Building a Biomedical Ontology for Respiratory Tract Infection\n", "abstract": " Respiratory tract infections are most common disease which can affect any human during any part of their age. According to sources almost 60% of all antibiotic prescription is due to Respiratory tract infection. The concepts and their relations related to Respiratory tract infection are need to be explained with the help of biomedical literature as well as historical records. But these literature or records cannot be efficiently managed by users due to their unstructured representation. Biomedical Ontologies are best way to identify the concepts and their respective relations from huge amount of unstructured data. Our research aimed to create a biomedical Ontology for the domain of Respiratory tract infection using UMLS as a data source, which contains concepts, subtypes, their relationships, and semantic types. As a result ontology contains 26 main and sub types of Respiratory tract infections, also 234 broad relations\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1289"]}
