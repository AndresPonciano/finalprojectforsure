To improve the testing process, fault prediction approaches identify parts of the system that are more defect prone.

In order to detect defect proneness of modules in software projects with high accuracy and improve detection model generalization ability, we propose an automated software fault detection model using semi-supervised hybrid self-organizing map (HySOM).

Fault prediction models use software metrics and defect data of earlier or similar versions of the project in order to improve software quality and exploit available resources.

In such cases, researchers focus on unsupervised techniques such as clustering and they use experts or thresholds for labeling modules as faulty or not faulty. In this paper, we propose a prediction model by utilizing self-organizing map (SOM) with threshold to build a better prediction model that could help testers in labeling process and does not need experts to label the modules any more.

{"title": "A lightweight Anomaly detection model using SVM for WSNs in IoT through a hybrid feature selection algorithm based on GA and GWO\n", "abstract": " As a result of an incredibly fast growth of the number and diversity of smart devices connectable to the internet, commonly through open wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in internet of things (IoT), the access of attackers to the network traffic in the form of intercepting, eavesdropping and rebroadcasting has become much easier. Anomaly or intrusion detection system (IDS) is an efficient security mechanism, however despite the maturity of anomaly detection technologies for wired networks, current technologies with high computational complexity are improper for resource-limited WSNs in IoT and they also fail to detect new WSN attacks. Furthermore, dealing with the huge amount of intrusion wireless traffic collected by sensors, causing slow detecting process, higher resource usage and inaccurate detection. Hence, considering WSN limitations for developing an IDS in IoT, establishes a significant challenge for security researchers. This paper proposes a new model to develop a support vector machine (SVM)-based lightweight IDS (LIDS) using combination concepts of genetic algorithm (GA) and mathematical equations of grey wolf optimizer (GWO) which is called GABGWO. The GABGWO through applying two new crossover and mutation operators tries to find the most relevant traffic features and eliminate worthless ones, in order to increase the performance of the LIDS. The performance of LIDS is evaluated using AWID real-world wireless dataset under two scenarios with and without using GABGWO.
