{"title": "Usability evaluation of user interfaces generated with a model-driven architecture tool\n", "abstract": " Model-driven architecture (MDA) has recently attracted the interest of both the research community and industry corporations. It specifies an automated process for developing interactive applications from high-level models to code generation. This approach can play a key role in the fields of software engineering (SE) and human-computer interaction (HCI). Although there are some MDA-compliant methods for developing user interfaces, none of them explicitly integrates usability engineering with user interface engineering. This chapter addresses this issue by showing how the usability of user interfaces that are generated automatically by an industrial MDA-compliant CASE tool can be assessed. The goal is to investigate whether MDA-compliant methods improve software usability through model transformations. To accomplish this, two usability evaluations were conducted in the code model (final user\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "74\n", "authors": ["1140"]}

The capability to accurately quantify the size of software in an early stage of the development lifecycle is critical to software project managers for evaluating risks, developing project estimates and having early project indicators. In this paper, we present OO-Method Function Points (OOmFP), which is a new FSM method for object-oriented systems that is based on measuring conceptual schemas. OOmFP is presented following the steps of a process model for software measurement. Using this process model, we present the design of the measurement method, its application in a case study, and the analysis of different evaluation types that can be carried out to validate the method and to verify its application and results.", "num_citations": "60\n", "authors": ["1140"]}
{"title": "Measuring the functional size of web applications\n", "abstract": " Today, more and more Web sites and Applications (WebApps) are becoming mission-critical systems. Measures of functional size are a prerequisite to successful quantitative management of software projects. However, the nature of the web has recently imposed new and challenging characteristics, which are not supported by the existing estimation metric and models. In order to avoid the Web crisis, we urge the use of web engineering approaches for developing and estimating web projects in a systematic way. To achieve this goal, we present a novel size metric for accurately measuring the functional size of web applications early in the development life cycle. The main contribution of this work is the introduction of a measurement process that is embedded in the conceptual modelling phase of a model-driven approach for developing web applications.

It is expected that DSLs improve the maintainability of artifacts otherwise produced with general-purpose languages. However, the maintainability of the DSL artifacts and, hence, their adoption in mainstream development, is largely dependent on the usability of the language itself. Unfortunately, it is often hard to identify their usability strengths and weaknesses early, as there is no guidance on how to objectively reveal them. Usability is a multi-faceted quality characteristic, which is challenging to quantify beforehand by DSL stakeholders. There is even less support on how to quantitatively evaluate the usability of DSLs used in maintenance tasks. In this context, this paper reports a study to compare the usability of textual DSLs under the perspective of software maintenance.

This paper presents a systematic review that investigates what methods and techniques have been employed (in the last 10 years) to evaluate the quality of software product lines and how they were employed. A total of 39 research papers have been reviewed from an initial set of 1388 papers. The results show that 25% of the papers reported evaluations at the Design phase of the Domain Engineering phase. The most widely used mechanism for modeling quality attributes was extended feature models and the most evaluated artifact was the base architecture. In addition, the results of the review have identified several research gaps. Specifically, 77% of the papers employed case studies as a \u201cproof of concept\u201d whereas 23% of the papers did not perform any type of validation.

{"title": "Comparative evaluation of functional size measurement methods: An experimental analysis\n", "abstract": " A number of Functional Size Measurement (FSM) methods have been proposed in the literature, but so far there has been no systematic evaluation of these methods. A major criticism is that little attention has been paid to the empirical validation of FSM methods. By empirical validation we refer to the evaluation of the efficacy of the method and its likely adoption in practice using experimental techniques and statistical data analysis. This paper describes a laboratory experiment which compares Function Points Analysis, a standard FSM method supported by the International Functional Point Users Group (IFPUG FPA) and OO-Method Function Points (OOmFP), a recently proposed FSM method for sizing object-oriented (OO) software systems that are developed using the OO-Method approach. The goal is to investigate whether OOmFP results in better size assessments and is more likely to be adopted in practice, within the context of an OO-Method development process. As OOmFP and IFPUG FPA are FSM methods, only the functional size of a software system is quantified, meaning that only the functional system requirements as seen from the user\u2019s perspective are considered as contributing to system size. The methods are compared using a range of performance-based and perception-based variables, including efficiency (effort required to apply the methods), reproducibility, accuracy, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and intention to use. An important contribution is the development and empirical testing of a theoretical model for evaluating FSM methods in general.
