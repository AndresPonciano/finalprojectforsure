However, a systematic service-oriented design modeling method for composite services is still in its infancy as most of the existing approaches provide the modeling of atomic services only. For these reasons, a new method (ComSDM) is proposed in this work for modeling the concept of service-oriented design to increase the reusability and decrease the complexity of system while keeping the service composition considerations in mind. Furthermore, the ComSDM method provides the mathematical representation of the components of service-oriented design using the graph-based theoryto facilitate the design quality measurement. To demonstrate that the ComSDM method is also suitable for composite service design modeling of distributed embedded real-time systems along with enterprise software development, it is implemented in the case study of a smart home. The results of the case study not only check the applicability of ComSDM, but can also be used to validate the complexity and reusability of ComSDM.

Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) paradigm is one of the established paradigms used for building and developing flexible, reusable, rapid and low cost software products. Consequently, the use of SOC to develop software systems is increasing. Software quality measurement has considerable importance in the context of SOC since it determines how the quality requirements for composite service should be achieved.

However, these metrics were constructed based on previous development approaches, give insufficient focus and need modification to be applied to service-oriented systems. Furthermore, the existing metrics do not consider the composite service as building blocks and also they do not consider the indirect relationships.

With an ever-increasing number of similar Web services in UDDI, a functional description of Web services is not sufficient for the discovery process. It is also difficult to rank the similar services based on their functionality.

The existing research on MWS discovery mostly focused on applying coarse-grained search space reduction that fails to deal with cold-start and data sparsity challenges at the expense of large computing resources. The proposed search space reduction is achieved by subsuming k-means in the modified negative selection algorithm (M-NSA) to place the service in an appropriate category so that the matching is only performed on the MWS in the target category.

{"title": "Context-Aware ontology and web services discovery for distributed embedded real-time systems\n", "abstract": " Distributed Embedded Real-Time Systems (DERTS) consists of hundreds of interconnected devices, typically small and wirelessly-connected, which are designed to work for a long period of time. The massive interconnection of devices and the usage of heterogeneous languages, operating platforms and data standards make DERTS a competitive and complex system. In addition, the DERTS program is setting a trend of moving away from centralized, high-cost products towards lower cost and high volume products. In this regard, there is nothing more natural than considering the use of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to assist in the development of DERTS. This is because SOA enables different devices to exchange data regardless of issues of complexity. Moreover, context-awareness, which is widely studied for DERTS, also plays an important role for effective communication among devices. Thus, to build service-based DERTS while managing the complexity, context-aware ontologies are the best solution. In this paper, we developed a context-aware ontology for DERTS which is known as ConOntDERTS. To evaluate ConOntDERTS, we used two methods. In the first method, a criteria-based ontology evaluation was used; while in the second method, a survey was conducted to show that the results produced by ConOntDERTS were almost the same as human perception. Results of the evaluation show the consistency and feasibility of our ontology and the statistical test results show that ConOntDERTS ontology can produce consistent results with human perception.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["2195"]}
