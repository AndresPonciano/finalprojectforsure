In order to make the strata internally homogenous, the strata should be constructed in such a way that the strata variances for the characteristic under study be as small as possible. This could be achieved effectively by having the distribution of the main study variable known and create strata by cutting the range of the distribution at suitable points. If the frequency distribution of the study variable is unknown, it may be approximated from the past experience or some prior knowledge obtained at a recent study. In this paper the problem of finding Optimum Strata Boundaries (OSB) is considered as the problem of determining Optimum Strata Widths (OSW). The problem is formulated as a Mathematical Programming Problem (MPP), which minimizes the variance of the estimated population parameter under Neyman allocation subject to the restriction that sum of the widths of all the strata is equal to the total range of the distribution. The distributions of the study variable are considered as continuous with Triangular and Standard Normal density functions. The formulated MPPs, which turn out to be multistage decision problems, can then be solved using dynamic programming technique proposed by B\u00fchler and Deutler (1975). Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the computational details.

The asymptotic variance of the maximum likelihood estimator of qth quantile at the design stress is derived as an optimality criterion with equally spaced inspection times and the optimal allocation of units for two stress levels are determined. Optimality results show that the asymptotic variance of qth quantile at the design stress is insensitive to the number of inspection times and to misspecifications of guessed failure probabilities at design and high test stresses. Procedures for planning an accelerated life test, including selection of sample size, have been discussed through an example.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["434"]}
{"title": "Optimal compromise allocation in two-stage and stratified two-stage sampling design for multivariate study\n", "abstract": " When two-stage and stratified two-stage sampling designs are to be used and more than one characteristic are under study, usually it is not possible to use the individual optimal allocation of first-stage and second-stage sampling units to each stage and to various strata for one reason or the other. In such situations some criterion is needed to work out an acceptable allocation which is optimal for all characteristics in some sense. Such an allocation may be called an optimal compromised allocation. In this paper we discuss the problems of determining the optimal compromise allocation in multivariate two-stage and multivariate stratified two-stage sampling. These problems are formulated as Nonlinear Programming Problems (NLPP). The NLPPs are then solved using Lagrange multiplier technique and explicit formulae are obtained for the optimum allocation of the first-stage and second-stage sampling units.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["434"]}

{"title": "An effective software reliability growth model\n", "abstract": " Reliability is an end-user quality feature related to system usage. Software reliability modelling has gained a lot of importance due to the growing need for high-quality software. The paper presents a new Software reliability growth model (SRGM) following the structure of the logistic growth model. As testing progresses, the skill of testing team will improve which will lead to higher fault detection rate. We incorporate this factor with the help of a time-dependent fault detection rate function suggested in Generalised Goel model. The model is applied to three different widely used software failure datasets. Four different performance criteria namely MSE (Mean Square Error), Variance, PRR (Predictive Ratio Risk) and R2 have been used to analyse the model. The model fits significantly better than other existing models.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["434"]}
{"title": "A Software Reliability Growth Model Considering Mutual Fault Dependency\n", "abstract": " Many software reliability growth models (SRGMs) have been introduced since 1970s. Most of the models consider that the faults are independent and debugging method is perfect. In this paper, we present a new SRGM under the assumption that the faults are mutually dependent i.e. repairing a detected fault may introduce new faults or it may simultaneously correct some future faults without any additional effort. The model is validated on two real datasets that are widely used in many studies to demonstrate its applicability. The comparisons with eight established models in terms of Mean Square Error (MSE), Variance, Predictive Ratio Risk (PRR) and R2 have been presented.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["434"]}

Log-logistic testing effort function (LLTEF) is incorporated into software reliability growth model (SRGM). The parameters of LLTEF and SRGM are estimated by using least square and maximum likelihood methods. Also, uncertainties involved in estimated parameters of proposed SRGM due to human conduct are investigated for trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Computational analysis is performed at different level of uncertainties to compute various measures of software reliability. The results obtained are then comparing with other existing SRGM. It is shown that the proposed SRGM with LLTEF gives reasonable prediction of software reliability under the fuzzy model. Further, under optimal release policy, software cost based on reliability criteria is calculated under the fuzzy condition.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["434"]}
{"title": "Testing effort dependent delayed S-shaped software reliability growth model with imperfect debugging\n", "abstract": " In software development process, testing is one of the most important aspects and hence, software reliably is very important factor of software systems. In the last four decades many software reliability growth model based on non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) have been developed which incorporates testing effort function. However, the previous models are quite helpful for software engineers/developers and commonly applicable in the industries and research institution. Still more testing-effort functions are required to incorporate into software reliability growth model. In this paper, we develop delayed S-shaped software reliability growth model with imperfect debugging which incorporates new modified Weibull testing\u2013effort function (NMWTEF). We estimate the testing effort model parameters by least square and S-shaped software reliability growth parameters by maximum likelihood estimation techniques. We also present confidence interval of the software reliability growth parameters. Various software reliability measures are investigated through three numerical experiments.

{"title": "Analysis of Software Fault Detection and Correction Processes with Log-Logistic Testing-Effort\n", "abstract": " Software reliability growth models are helping the software society in predicting and analyzing the software product in term of quality. During the software-testing phase, software reliability is highly related to the amount of development resources spent on detecting and correcting latent software errors, i.e. the amount of testing effort expenditures. Some researches proposed in the literature to study in the fault detection and fault correction processes. However software reliability can be enhanced considerably during testing with faults being detected and corrected by testers. The allocation of testing resources such as man power and CPU hours during testing phase can largely influence fault detection speed and the time to correct a detected fault. The testing resource allocation is usually depicted by testing effort function, which has been incorporated into software reliability model.

{"title": "Optimal accelerated life test plans for exponentiated Weibull failure model\n", "abstract": " Statistically optimal accelerated life test plans are suggested for items whose lifetime follows the exponentiated Weibull (EW) distribution under periodic inspection and Type I censoring. It is assumed that the mean lifetime (the EW distribution scale parameter) is a log-linear function of stress and that the shape parameters are independent of stress. Given shape parameters, design stress and high test stress, the test plan is optimized with respect to the low test stress and the proportion of test units are also allocated to this test stress. The asymptotic variance of the maximum likelihood estimator of log mean life at the design stress is used as an optimality criterion with equally spaced inspection times. A FORTRAN program was written to calculate the optimal plans. Computational results for various values of the shape parameters indicate that the asymptotic variance of log mean life at the design stress is insensitive to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["434"]}

The accurate reliability prediction is the main challenges of software engineers. It is also an important task to develop software with high reliability. The precise quantification of parameter is not always possible, nor is it always necessary. When the values of parameters and variables cannot be precisely specified, they are said to be uncertain or fuzzy. To make the model more reliable, developer need to introduce some degree of uncertainty in the models. In this paper we discuss software reliability growth model considering Burr Type-XII testing effort function and fuzzy logic.

{"title": "Determination of the Optimal Allocation of Testing Resource for Modular Software Reliability Growth Using LINGO.\n", "abstract": " It is quite natural to produce reliable software systems since the breakdown of the computer systems, which is caused by software faults, results in a tremendous loss and damage for social life. Hence, software reliability is a key factor in software development process. Testing phase of software begins with module testing whereby, modules are tested independently to remove substantial amount of faults within a specified testing resource. Therefore, in this paper four optimization problems are discussed for optimal allocation of testing resources for a modular software system. These optimization problems are formulated as nonlinear programming problems (NLPP), which incorporates log-logistic testing-effort function into inflection S-shaped software reliability growth model based on a non-homogeneous Poisson process. The NLPPs are solved using LINGO, a user-friendly software package for optimization. Finally, numerical example is given to demonstrate and to validate the performance of proposed strategies. In addition, the results of the strategies proposed in this paper are compared with [1]. It is revealed that the proposed strategies yield a gain in efficiency.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["434"]}
