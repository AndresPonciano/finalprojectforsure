{"title": "A topos for algebraic quantum theory\n", "abstract": " The aim of this paper is to relate algebraic quantum mechanics to topos theory, so as to construct new foundations for quantum logic and quantum spaces. Motivated by Bohr\u2019s idea that the empirical content of quantum physics is accessible only through classical physics, we show how a noncommutative C*-algebra of observables A induces a topos  in which the amalgamation of all of its commutative subalgebras comprises a single commutative C*-algebra  . According to the constructive Gelfand duality theorem of Banaschewski and Mulvey, the latter has an internal spectrum  in  , which in our approach plays the role of the quantum phase space of the system. Thus we associate a locale (which is the topos-theoretical notion of a space and which intrinsically carries the intuitionistic logical structure of a Heyting algebra) to a C*-algebra (which is the noncommutative notion of a space).

Thus, we address traditional proof engineering challenges as well as new ones resulting from our ambition to build upon this development a library of constructive analysis in which any abstraction penalties inhibiting efficient computation are reduced to a minimum.The basis of our development consists of type classes representing a standard algebraic hierarchy, as well as portions of category theory and universal algebra.

{"title": "Homotopy type theory: Univalent foundations of mathematics\n", "abstract": " Homotopy type theory is a new branch of mathematics, based on a recently discovered connection between homotopy theory and type theory, which brings new ideas into the very foundation of mathematics. On the one hand, Voevodsky's subtle and beautiful \"univalence axiom\" implies that isomorphic structures can be identified. On the other hand, \"higher inductive types\" provide direct, logical descriptions of some of the basic spaces and constructions of homotopy theory. Both are impossible to capture directly in classical set-theoretic foundations, but when combined in homotopy type theory, they permit an entirely new kind of \"logic of homotopy types\". This suggests a new conception of foundations of mathematics, with intrinsic homotopical content, an \"invariant\" conception of the objects of mathematics -- and convenient machine implementations, which can serve as a practical aid to the working mathematician. This book is intended as a first systematic exposition of the basics of the resulting \"Univalent Foundations\" program, and a collection of examples of this new style of reasoning -- but without requiring the reader to know or learn any formal logic, or to use any computer proof assistant.", "num_citations": "89\n", "authors": ["1775"]}

This burden can be shifted away from the user by providing a library of exact analysis in which the computer handles the error estimates. Previously, we [Krebbers/Spitters 2011] provided a fast implementation of the exact real numbers in the Coq proof assistant. Our implementation improved on an earlier implementation by O'Connor by using type classes to describe an abstract specification of the underlying dense set from which the real numbers are built. In particular, we used dyadic rationals built from Coq's machine integers to obtain a 100 times speed up of the basic operations already. This article is a substantially expanded version of [Krebbers/Spitters 2011] in which the implementation is extended in the various ways. First, we implement and verify the sine and cosine function. Secondly, we create an additional implementation of the dense set based on Coq's fast rational numbers. Thirdly, we extend the hierarchy to capture order on undecidable structures, while it was limited to decidable structures before. This hierarchy, based on type classes, allows us to share theory on the naturals, integers, rationals, dyadics, and reals in a convenient way.

We get around this problem by extending the internal language with a modal operator for expressing properties of global elements. In this setting we show how to construct a universe that classifies the Cohen-Coquand-Huber-M\\\"ortberg (CCHM) notion of fibration from their cubical sets model, starting from the assumption that the interval is tiny - a property that the interval in cubical sets does indeed have.

We wish to implement GDTT with decidable type-checking, while still supporting non-trivial equality proofs that reason about the extensions of guarded recursive constructions. CTT is a variation of Martin-L\\\"of type theory in which the identity type is replaced by abstract paths between terms. CTT provides a computational interpretation of functional extensionality, is conjectured to have decidable type checking, and has an implemented type-checker. Our new type theory, called guarded cubical type theory, provides a computational interpretation of extensionality for guarded recursive types.

{"title": "Bohrification.\n", "abstract": " New foundations for quantum logic and quantum spaces are constructed by merging algebraic quantum theory and topos theory. Interpreting Bohr's \"doctrine of classical concepts\" mathematically, given a quantum theory described by a noncommutative C*-algebra A, we construct a topos T(A), which contains the \"Bohrification\" B of A as an internal commutative C*-algebra. Then B has a spectrum, a locale internal to T(A), the external description S(A) of which we interpret as the \"Bohrified\" phase space of the physical system. As in classical physics, the open subsets of S(A) correspond to (atomic) propositions, so that the \"Bohrified\" quantum logic of A is given by the Heyting algebra structure of S(A). The key difference between this logic and its classical counterpart is that the former does not satisfy the law of the excluded middle, and hence is intuitionistic. When A contains sufficiently many projections (e.g. when A is a von Neumann algebra, or, more generally, a Rickart C*-algebra), the intuitionistic quantum logic S(A) of A may also be compared with the traditional quantum logic, i.e. the orthomodular lattice of projections in A. This time, the main difference is that the former is distributive (even when A is noncommutative), while the latter is not.

We show that a possible resolution of these difficulties, suggested by the ideas of Bohr, emerges if instead of single projections one considers elementary propositions to be families of projections indexed by a partially ordered set  of appropriate commutative subalgebras of A. In fact, to achieve both maximal generality and ease of use within topos theory, we assume that A is a so-called Rickart C*-algebra and that  consists of all unital commutative Rickart C*-subalgebras of A.

But is it possible to do advanced mathematics constructively? Bishop and his followers showed that large parts of abstract analysis and algebra can be developed constructively. But nevertheless the discussion about the applicability of constructive mathematics to mathematical physics started again.  This discussion gave rise to a number of precise mathematical problems. Some of these problems have already been solved, others will be answered in this thesis. These problems all belong to functional analysis, part of which is developed constructively in this thesis. To be more precise, the thesis contains a constructive substitute for the ergodic theorem, a constructive Peter-Weyl theorem for representations of compact groups, approximation theorems for almost periodic functions and a spectral theorem for unbounded normal operators on Hilbert spaces. Moreover, parts of the theory of algebras of operators are developed constructively: two representation theorems are proved, one for finite dimensional and one for Abelian von Neumann algebras. A simple proof is given that the spectral measure is independent of the choice of the basis of the underlying Hilbert space. Finally, a representation theorem for normal functionals is proved.

{"title": "An application of computable distributions to the semantics of probabilistic programs\n", "abstract": " In this chapter, we explore how (Type-2) computable distributions can be used to give both (algorithmic) sampling and distributional semantics to probabilistic programs with continuous distributions. Towards this end, we sketch an encoding of computable distributions in a fragment of Haskell and show how topological domains can be used to model the resulting PCF-like language. We also examine the implications that a (Type-2) computable semantics has for implementing conditioning. We hope to draw out the connection between an approach based on (Type-2) computability and ordinary programming throughout the chapter as well as highlight the relation with constructive mathematics (via realizability).", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1775"]}

{"title": "Ssprove: A foundational framework for modular cryptographic proofs in coq\n", "abstract": " State-separating proofs (SSP) is a recent methodology for structuring game-based cryptographic proofs in a modular way. While very promising, this methodology was previously not fully formalized and came with little tool support. We address this by introducing SSProve, the first general verification framework for machine-checked state-separating proofs. SSProve combines high-level modular proofs about composed protocols, as proposed in SSP, with a probabilistic relational program logic for formalizing the lower-level details, which together enable constructing fully machine-checked crypto proofs in the Coq proof assistant. Moreover, SSProve is itself formalized in Coq, including the algebraic laws of SSP, the soundness of the program logic, and the connection between these two verification styles.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1775"]}

{"title": "Locating the range of an operator with an adjoint\n", "abstract": " In this paper we consider the following question: given a linear operator1 on a Hilbert space, can we compute the projection on the closure of its range? Instead of making the notion of computation precise, we use Bishop\u2019s informal approach [1], in which \u2018there exists\u2019 is interpreted strictly as \u2018we can compute\u2019. It turns out that the reasoning we use to capture this interpretation can be described by intuitionistic logic. This logic differs from classical logic by not recognising certain principles, such as the scheme \u2018P or not P\u2019, as generally valid. Since we do not adopt axioms that are classically false, all our theorems are acceptable in classical mathematics. To answer our initial question affirmatively, it is enough to show that the range ran (T) of the operator T on the Hilbert space H is located\u2014that is, the distance \u03c1 (x, ran (T))= inf {x\u2212 Ty: y\u2208 H} exists (is computable) for each x\u2208 H ([2], pages 366 and 371). The locatedness of the kernel ker (T\u2217) of the adjoint T\u2217 of T is easily seen to be a necessary\u2014but according to Example 1 of [6], not sufficient\u2014condition for ran (T) to be located. Theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions under which the locatedness of ker (T\u2217) ensures that of ran (T). Proposition 9 below shows that (despite an earlier claim by Bridges\u2013Ishihara [6]) in recursive mathematics, and hence in Bishop\u2013style mathematics, a condition known as well\u2013behavedness is not sufficient for the locatedness of ran (T). As we saw in [6, 15, 16], sequential versions of boundedness and openness play an important role for linear operators; for example, the Hellinger\u2013Toeplitz theorem [6] holds for sequential continuity.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1775"]}
{"title": "Congruence Closure in Cubical Type Theory\n", "abstract": " Interactive theorem provers can be a powerful tool for doing mathematics, but support from proving tedious lemmas can be improved. Decision procedures are very useful to automate such tasks. The congruence closure algorithm automates proofs that can be constructed using basic properties of equality: reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity and congruence. Congruence closure is a key algorithm in SMT solvers [2]. Coq contains the algorithm as a tactic to solve first order equational goals. In 2017 Selsam and de Moura presented an efficient procedure [5] to extend the algorithm to the Intensional Type Theory (ITT) of the Lean [3] proof assistant. To do so, they use UIP to find a workaround for the absence of the ideal congruence lemma (defined below). Instead, we observe that the ideal congruence lemma is well-typed and provable in Cubical Type Theory [1](CTT) and this allows us to make a natural modification of their procedure and moreover eliminate the need for the UIP axiom.

We present the first machine checked proof that guarantees both safety and liveness for a consensus algorithm. We verify a Proof of Stake (PoS) Nakamoto-style blockchain (NSB) protocol, using the foundational proof assistant Coq. In particular, we consider a PoS NSB in a synchronous network with a static set of corrupted parties.

{"title": "High-assurance field inversion for curve-based cryptography.\n", "abstract": " Modern cryptography must satisfy a myriad of security properties, ranging from sound hardness assumptions to correct and secure implementations that resist side-channel cryptanalysis. Curve-based cryptography is not different in this regard, and substantial progress in the last few decades has been achieved in both selecting parameters and devising secure implementation strategies. In this context, the security of implementations of field inversion is sometimes overlooked in the research literature, because (i) the approach based on Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem (FLT) suffices performance-wise for many parameters used in practice;(ii) it is typically invoked only at the very end of scalar multiplication or pairing computation, with a small impact in performance;(iii) it is challenging to implement securely for general parameters without a significant performance penalty. However, field inversion can process sensitive information and must be protected with side-channel countermeasures like any other cryptographic operation, as illustrated by recent attacks [ASS17, AGTB18, AGB20]. In this work, we focus on timing attacks against field inversion for primes of cryptographic interest, both in the case when FLT-based inversion can be efficiently implemented or not. We extend the Fiat-Cryptography framework, which synthesizes provably correct-by-construction implementations, to implement the Bernstein-Yang constant-time inversion algorithm as a step toward this goal. This allows a correct implementation of prime field inversion to be conveniently synthesized for any prime. We benchmark the implementations across a range of primes for curve-based\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1775"]}
{"title": "Formal security analysis of MPC-in-the-head zero-knowledge protocols.\n", "abstract": " Zero-knowledge proofs allow a prover to convince a verifier of the veracity of a statement without revealing any other information. An interesting class of zero-knowledge protocols are those following the MPC-in-the-head paradigm (Ishai et al., STOC\u201907) which use secure multiparty computation (MPC) protocols as the basis. Efficient instances of this paradigm have emerged as an active research topic in the last years, starting with ZKBoo (Giacomelli et al., USENIX\u201916). Zero-knowledge protocols are a vital building block in the design of privacypreserving technologies as well as cryptographic primitives like digital signature schemes that provide post-quantum security. This work investigates the security of zero-knowledge protocols following the MPC-in-the-head paradigm. We provide the first machine-checked security proof of such a protocol on the example of ZKBoo. Our proofs are checked in the EasyCrypt proof assistant. To enable a modular security proof, we develop a new security notion for the MPC protocols used in MPC-in-thehead zero-knowledge protocols.
