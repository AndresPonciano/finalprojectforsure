We present a (distributed) application as consisting of a minimal functional core, implemented as a component based system, and an unbound set of potential extensions that can be selectively integrated within this core functionality. An extension to this core may be a new service due to new requirements of end users. Another important category of extensions we consider are non-functional services such as authentication, which typically introduce interaction refinements at the application level. In accordance with the separation of concerns principle, each extension is implemented as a layer of mixin-like wrappers.

For example, wrongly configured setpoints or building equipment, or misplaced sensors and actuators, can contribute to deviations of the real energy consumption from the predicted one. Our paper is motivated by these posed challenges and aims at pinpointing the types of problems in the BMS components that can affect the energy efficiency of a building, as well as review the methods that can be utilized for their discovery and diagnosis.

However, energy flexibility provided by buildings can be very complex and depend on many factors. The immaturity of the current aggregation market with unclear incentives is still a challenge for buildings to participate in the aggregation market. However, few studies have investigated business models for building participation in the aggregation market. Therefore, this paper develops four business models for buildings to participate in the energy aggregation market:(1) buildings participate in the implicit Demand Response (DR) program via retailers;(2) buildings with small energy consumption participate in the explicit DR via aggregators;(3) buildings directly access the explicit DR program;(4) buildings access energy market via Virtual Power Plant (VPP) aggregators by providing Distributed Energy Resources (DER) s. This paper also determines that it is essential to understand building owners\u2019 needs, comforts, and behaviours to develop feasible market access strategies for different types of buildings. Meanwhile, the incentive programs, national regulations and energy market structures strongly influence buildings\u2019 participation in the aggregation market. Under the current Nordic market regulation, business model one is the most feasible one, and business model two faces more challenges due to regulation barriers and limited monetary incentives.

Thus, convergence is guaranteed under the common convexity assumptions. The islanded microgrid operates with the standard hierarchical control scheme, where two control modes are considered for the DG units: a voltage control mode, with an active droop control loop, and a power control mode, which allows setting the output power in advance.

Active involvement of industrial consumers in the development of smart grid solutions is important to ensure the energy system transformation. Despite the importance of industrial consumers has been identified, the empirical studies on the smart grid still mainly address residential and commercial consumers. Therefore, based on four case studies with two industrial consumers, one energy consulting company and one electricity retailer, this paper investigates the factors that influence industrial consumers\u2019 acceptance of smart grid solutions, and how the influential factors are relevant to the smart grid adoption phases. Eleven influential factors are identified that impact on four stages for industrial consumers\u2019 adoption of smart grid solutions (inscription, translation, framing, and stabilization stages).

To support integration with specific frameworks, component systems and application servers, Javeleon currently provides tight integration with the NetBeans Platform, facilitating dynamic updating for applications built on top of the NetBeans Platform in an unconstrained manner. Javeleon supports state-preserving unanticipated runtime evolution including dynamic changes to the type hierarchy of classes without modifying a JVM and without utilizing new language constructs. In addition to the obvious benefits of using Javeleon during development, we argue that Javeleon is a strong candidate for being useful in other research fields.

{"title": "Agent-Based Modelling of Demand-Side Flexibility Adoption in Reservoir Pumping\n", "abstract": " As wind and solar power displace conventional generation in the electricity grid, there is an urgent need for technologies that can deal with the variation in supply. Demand response technology has been proposed as a solution to make the demand-side flexible and able to effectively adjust to variations in supply. However, consumers do not simply invest in demand response technologies without insurance that their investment will pay back. This paper applies agent-based simulation to investigate consumer adoption behaviour of implicit demand response solutions that allow consumers to adjust their electricity use to the hourly prices in day-ahead spot markets. The simulation uses the case study of a water supply system to show that the adoption speed of implicit demand response technology depends on both technical characteristics of the system and the business model of the implicit demand response solution\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["128"]}

MESI 1.0 is now coming to its end, and in a recent development, the government has announced the commencement of the next series of MESI reform, MESI 2.0. The objectives of MESI 2.0 are to increase the industry efficiency, to future proof the industry, structure, regulations and key processes, and to empower the consumers. MESI 2.0 is obviously the continuation of MESI 1.0. Thus, prior to the start of MESI 2.0, it is important to review the progress and achievements of MESI 1.0 in such a way that enables informed decisions to be made in designing MESI 2.0. This paper therefore presents a review on the progress and achievements of MESI 1.0, focusing on the initiatives undertaken and evaluating the extent to which the objectives of MESI 1.0 have been addressed by the initiatives. Analysis performed on the review results shows that the second objective of having competitive tariffs is mostly addressed by the initiatives whereas more work needs to be done to address the other objectives, particularly on being environmentally sustainable.

However, this ideal scenario has yet to become reality! Today, the majority of all applications are still developed from scratch, and there are still relatively few ready-made components that can be easily reused in the construction of new applications. In this paper, we argue that the present situation is primary caused by the conventional object-oriented programming languages in which we try to assemble components.

Different fish feed types are subjected to mechanical stress in the DORIS tester, to measure their mechanical durability. The same feeds are also subjected to texture analyses (texture profile analyses and stress relaxation tests), where mechanical attributes of the pellets are investigated for different orientation of the pellets. A screening test for the different mechanical properties showed that a linear model including \u2018cohesiveness\u2019, elastic modulus and hardness are able to describe 68% of the variation in mechanical durability. Individual correlations against mechanical durability showed that the cohesiveness was particular important, which is a measure of the pellet\u2019s ability to return its original state after deformation. The elasticity of a pellet was also found to be of importance. Higher cohesiveness and modulus of elasticity is shown to increase the mechanical durability, while the elasticity should be low. From these results it is proposed that the pellets should be able to relax the force applied at the surface as deformation in non-elastic type behaviour. Also, a durable feed pellet should have a high elastic modulus and a viscoelastic nature promoting stress relaxation and reversible deformation.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["128"]}

{"title": "Combining Performance Testing and Metadata Models to Support Fault Detection and Diagnostics in Smart Buildings\n", "abstract": " Performance testing of components and subsystems of buildings is a promising practice for increasing energy efficiency and closing gaps between intended and actual performance of buildings. A typical shortcoming of performance testing is the difficulty of linking a failing test to a faulty or underperforming component. Furthermore, a failing test can also be linked to a wrongly configured performance test. In this paper, we present Building Metadata Performance Testing (BuMPeT), a method that addresses this shortcoming by using building metadata models to extend performance testing with fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) capabilities. We present four different procedures that apply BuMPeT to different data sources and components. We have applied the proposed method to a case study building, located in Denmark, to test its capacity and benefits. Additionally, we use two real case scenarios to showcase examples of failing performance tests in the building, as well as discovery of causes of underperformance. Finally, to examine the limits to the benefits of the applied procedure, a detailed elaboration of a hypothetical scenario is presented. Our findings demonstrate that the method has potential and it can serve to increase the energy efficiency of a wide range of buildings. View Full-Text", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["128"]}

{"title": "Technical, Economic, Social and Regulatory Feasibility Evaluation of Dynamic Distribution Tariff Designs\n", "abstract": " The increasing number of distributed energy resources in the distribution grids creates the risk of grid congestion and the high cost of grid expansion. The implementation of the dynamic distribution grid tariffs can potentially avoid grid congestion. Meanwhile, the design and implementation of any distribution tariff need to consider and match the regional/national requirements. However, there is no sufficient evaluation method available to review and evaluate the feasibility of the dynamic distribution tariffs. Therefore, this paper introduces a feasibility evaluation method with four dimensions of technical, economic, social, and regulatory to review dynamic distribution tariffs. The literature on dynamic distribution tariffs is collected, and 29 dynamic distribution tariffs are selected and further categorized into five attributes of rationale, cost drivers, dynamics, events, and active demand. The evaluation results show that the time-of-use tariff is the most feasible dynamic distribution tariff, and the review of a proposed future distribution tariff model in Denmark verifies the evaluation method and results. The developed feasibility evaluation method for dynamic distribution tariffs can ensure the design and implementation of a dynamic distribution tariff to be feasible and applicable in a region.

{"title": "Impact of Social Welfare Metrics on Energy Allocation in Multi-Objective Optimization\n", "abstract": " Resource allocation problems are at the core of the smart grid where energy supply and demand must match. Multi-objective optimization can be applied in such cases to find the optimal allocation of energy resources among consumers considering energy domain factors such as variable and intermittent production, market prices, or demand response events. In this regard, this paper considers consumer energy demand and system-wide energy constraints to be individual objectives and optimization variables to be the allocation of energy over time to each of the consumers. This paper considers a case in which multi-objective optimization is used to generate Pareto sets of solutions containing possible allocations for multiple energy intensive consumers constituted by commercial greenhouse growers. We consider the problem of selecting a final solution from these Pareto sets, one of maximizing the social welfare between objectives. Social welfare is a set of metrics often applied to multi-agent systems to evaluate the overall system performance. We introduce and apply social welfare ordering using different social welfare metrics to select solutions from these sets to investigate the impact of the type of social welfare metric on the optimization outcome. The results of our experiments indicate how different social welfare metrics affect the optimization outcome and how that translates to general resource allocation strategies.

In this paper we study and discuss different notions of social welfare and investigate their impact on the optimization outcome specifically for the problems comprising multiple conflicting objectives with interdependent issues. To this end, we implement and apply different notions of social welfare to a real-world, complex problem, where a resource domain is responsible for making allocation of energy resources to multiple energy intensive consumers (Commercial Greenhouse Growers).

The framework optimizes building control by firstly identifying the Pareto frontier with respect to multiple objectives considered, and then selecting the final strategy based on the user-defined priorities for the respective objectives. Although the approach requires more computing resources than the more traditional constrained convex optimization, it is more flexible in terms of the optimization problem formulation. New objectives can be easily added, and the objective priorities altered during the operation of the system. This flexibility makes the framework attractive for global optimization of multiple systems, including systems based on on/off control.

{"title": "An agent based approach for coordination of energy allocation and demand in cyber-physical systems\n", "abstract": " Energy efficient systems are receiving worldwide attention in response to the negative effects of global warming. Energy efficient systems are concerned with allocation of adequate resources in the Energy Domain to meet the energy demand in possibly several Process Domains. In allocation, a balancing problem arises when the energy resources demanded by the Process Domains do not match the resources allocated in the Energy Domain. This situation may lead to suboptimal process performance and inefficient usage of energy. Solving this allocation problem requires a coordination and control mechanism that can balance allocation and demand between multiple coupled subsystems. In this paper, we propose a novel agent-based software system for solving this type of cooperative control problem. The system performs energy allocation for several Process Domains while considering the individual requirements of each domain. In case of resource inadequacy the proposed solution is able to handle the resulting conflicts according to domain specific requirements for system operation. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulation. Our results show that it is possible to create a coordination mechanism that can achieve a global stable state for energy allocation and demand between multiple coupled systems.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["128"]}

It originates from the demand side management regime, which for decades has been applied by the designers and operators to foster stable and bottleneck-free operation of the electrical energy systems. However, as the transition of both the demand and supply side of the energy system imposes new challenges to the management of the whole energy system, such as the variability and limited control of energy supply from renewables or the increasing load variations over the day, the energy Flexible Building concept has gained more international attention. However, despite the given attention, a uniform understanding and a commonly accepted definition is still not in place for this building concept. The lack of a clear international framework for the requirements and properties of energy Flexible Buildings leads to numerous definitions that are being developed in parallel and are applied to specific cases when evaluating and/or quantifying energy flexibility. Although the concept of energy flexibility of buildings is relatively simple to understand, its application in reality can be complex and difficult to explain in simple terms.

A way to deal with this problem is to make the electricity demand flexible by introducing demand response, which leads to new business opportunities and stakeholders in the market. Furthermore, the business opportunities for demand response and new stakeholders, like the so called aggregators (a service company that pools flexibility from customers and converts it into electricity market services), are strongly influenced by national and international policies and regulation. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the business opportunities of aggregators and how aggregators, in the smart energy business ecosystem, are influenced by the changes in policy and regulation.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["128"]}
{"title": "Adverse condition and critical event prediction in commercial buildings: Danish case study\n", "abstract": " Over the last two decades, there has been a growing realization that the actual energy performances of many buildings fail to meet the original intent of building design. Faults in systems and equipment, incorrectly configured control systems and inappropriate operating procedures increase the energy consumption about 20% and therefore compromise the building energy performance. To improve the energy performance of buildings and to prevent occupant discomfort, adverse condition and critical event prediction plays an important role. The Adverse Condition and Critical Event Prediction Toolbox (ACCEPT) is a generic framework to compare and contrast methods that enable prediction of an adverse event, with low false alarm and missed detection rates. In this paper, ACCEPT is used for fault detection and prediction in a real building at the University of Southern Denmark. To make fault detection and prediction possible, machine learning methods such as Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are used. A new PCA\u2013based method is developed for artificial fault generation. While the proposed method finds applications in different areas, it has been used primarily for analysis purposes in this work. The results are evaluated, discussed and compared with results from Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA) with KDE. The results show that ACCEPT is more powerful than CVA with KDE which is known to be one of the best multivariate data-driven techniques in particular, under dynamically changing operational conditions.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["128"]}

Business companies (acting as client systems of these services) that are able to integrate such services effectively within their internal workflow will become leaders in their business markets. This however introduces the situation where multiple independent client systems are simultaneously accessing the same on-line service instance. This introduces a new research challenge concerning client-specific customization of an on-line service: different client systems may have different\u2013possibly conflicting-customization needs with respect to the functional and non-functional features of the on-line service. The problem with this is that all the different clientspecific views must be simultaneously imposed on the same distributed service instance; thus after the distributed service has become operational. We propose a dynamic customization model, Lasagne, that supports such client-specific combination of features at the instance level. In Lasagne a distributed service is structured as consisting of a minimal functional core\u2013implemented as a component-based system, and an unbound set of potential extensions that can be selectively integrated within this core functionality. An extension to this core may be a new service, due to new requirements of end users. Another important category of extensions we consider, are non-functional services such as authentication, which typically introduce interaction refinements at the application level. Each extension is implemented as a layer of mixin-like wrappers.

Information and communication technology is fundamental for achieving these goals by enabling among others new methods and systems for data collection and decision support. This book chapter covers new data collection options exemplified in the concrete case of a living lab for smart grid technologies. Furthermore, the chapter covers the use of visualisation to design decision support for such collected data. We formulate energy management based on energy data as a visualisation problem in the nested model for information visualisation. We prototype a visualisation tool chain to produce a rich set of visualisations based on energy data from five commercial and industrial buildings. Finally, we present qualitative study results for the value of visualisations as\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["128"]}

{"title": "Coordinating energy allocation and process performance using an agent-based approach\n", "abstract": " Energy efficient systems are receiving worldwide attention in response to the negative effects of global warming. Energy efficient systems are concerned with allocation of adequate resources in the energy domain to meet the energy demand in the process domain. In allocation, a balancing problem arises when the energy resources demanded by the process domain are either lesser or greater than the resources allocated in the energy domain. This situation may lead to suboptimal process performance and inefficient usage of energy. Solving this allocation problem requires a coordination and control mechanism that can balance allocation and demand. In this paper, we propose a novel agent-based software system for solving cooperative control problems. The system produces a Pareto-optimal energy allocation for the process domain while striving to achieve a group objective for balancing the individual requirements of the coupled domains. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulation. Our preliminary results show that it is possible to create a cooperative coordination mechanism that can achieve a group objective without risking sub-optimality or sub-optimization of individual domains.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["128"]}
{"title": "Modularization compass navigating the white waters of feature-oriented modularity\n", "abstract": " Successful software systems have to adapt to the evolving needs of their users. However, adding and extending functional features often becomes more difficult over time due to aggregated complexity and eroded modularity. This erosion can be quantified by measuring scattering and tangling of feature implementations in the source code, to track long-term regressions and to plan refactorings. This paper argues that the traditional usage of only the absolute values of modularity metrics is, however, insufficient and proposes to use their relative values instead. These relative values are referred to as the drift of feature-oriented modularity, and are defined as the distance between the actual metric values for a given source code and their values achievable for the source code's ideally modularized counterpart. The proposed approach, called modularization compass, computes the modularity drift by optimizing the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["128"]}

In this paper, we show how a multi-layered multi-agent system can be used to implement a satisficing decision-making process for allocation of production resources.

{"title": "Using Agent Satisfiability to Identify and Explain Interactions among Independent Greenhouse Climate Control Requirements\n", "abstract": " The slow adoption pace of new control strategies for sustainable greenhouse climate control by industrial growers, is mainly due to the complexity of identifying and explaining potentially conflicts when integrating independently climate control requirements. In this paper, we show how the satisfiability of agents, implementing independent climate control requirements, can be used to identify and explain conflicting control interactions, which emerge because the agents share the same resources in the controlled environment. Potential conflicts due to unfulfilled climate control requirements correspond to low agent satisfiability. Low satisfiability indicates that an agent\u2019s goal is conflicting with the proposed settings of the greenhouse climate. This allows us to explain to which degree independent climate control requirements are fulfilled by visualizing the satisfiability of the corresponding agents.

{"title": "Decouplink: dynamic links for Java\n", "abstract": " Software entities should be open for extension, but closed to modification. Unfortunately, unanticipated requirements emerging during software evolution makes it difficult to always enforce this principle. This situation poses a dilemma that is particularly important when considering component-based systems: On the one hand, violating the open/closed principle by allowing for modification compromises independent extensibility. On the other hand, trying to enforce the open/closed principle by prohibiting modification precludes unanticipated dimensions of extension. Dynamic links increase the number of dimensions of extension that can be exploited without performing modification of existing types. Thus, dynamic links make it possible to enforce the open/closed principle in situations where it would otherwise not be possible.

The evaluation of the example demonstrates that the protocol is able to find acceptable solutions between competing software agents, if they exist. The focus of this paper is to present the design and implementation of the protocol.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["128"]}

{"title": "Object oriented C++ programming in SIMULINK\u00ae-A reengineered simulation architecture for the control algorithm code view\n", "abstract": " By the use of MATLAB tools Simulink\u00ae models of control algorithms can be translated into an equivalent C-program. This paper treats a different approach of building control algorithm block components in C++ for use both in Simulink\u00ae models and in application code development. The object oriented reengineering has been applied to a subset of the present simulation library of control algorithms at Danfoss Drives, one of the world\u2019s largest producers of frequency converters. A frequency converter is an electronic device controlling the rotational speed of an electrical AC motor. By the use of object orientation, the chosen subset of control algorithms was transformed from a collection of C-functions into a collection of C++ components. Thus by confining control algorithm state variables and functions to objects and Simulink\u00ae specific code to Simulink\u00ae S-function wrapper files an entangling of the code has been achieved. Thus control algorithm clarity has improved. By utilizing advanced features in C++ the same control code text could be simulated using a fixed-point calculation library and a library of calculations with physical units (Volt, Ampere, Ohm, Radians etc), where improper use of physical units are caught on compile-time. Furthermore calculations can be monitored on runtime for overflow, underflow and the degree of precision when dealing with fixed-point calculations. As control algorithm blocks are represented as C++ objects, inter connected control algorithm blocks can be synthesized in a new class, which in turn becomes a building block of a higher abstraction level. Such high level building blocks can be handed out to be used in\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["128"]}

{"title": "A metadata-driven approach that combines family polymorphism, delegation and flexible composition semantics\n", "abstract": " The Lasagne object and component model enables customizations that create multiple, independent context-specific views on an application. Applications are collaborating objects and customizations are refining multiple points in an application in a non-invasive way. We achieve this goal by supporting selective combination of behavioral extensions. Different customizations can be deployed and activated simultaneously without jeopardizing the consistency of the core applications or its clients. The Lasagne primitives are generic building blocks that support the execution of high-level language constructs such as class qualification, delegation and predicate dispatching. In this paper, we show how these primitives support object-based inheritance (delegation) and family polymorphism, while leaving flexibility to fine-tune the composition semantics of the inheritance link.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["128"]}
