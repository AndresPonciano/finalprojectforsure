The adaptation is performed using r-adaptation to move the mesh nodes in the domain in an attempt to reduce the truncation error since it is the local source of discretization error. Here, we present a new set of r-adaptation methods called mesh optimization along with three different ways of performing this type of adaptation. Each of these techniques uses a finite difference gradient-based local optimization technique with different sets of design variables to create a mesh that minimizes a functional based on truncation error. These new truncation error based mesh optimization techniques are compared to a more common truncation error based mesh equidistribution technique.

Comparisons to LES studies are also generally favorable, suggesting DES provides an adequate subgrid scale model.

In this work, we demonstrate that convergence rates for error estimates deteriorate when the reconstruction matches the underlying finite-volume data as closely as possible. Grid-induced solution variations on the order of discretization error are exactly captured and induce small, non-physical oscillations in the reconstruction. Consequently, the accuracy of truncation error estimates, and ultimately discretization error estimates, degrades due to excessively large interelement jumps in the reconstruction.

{"title": "A Multi-Model Approach for Uncertainty Propagation and Model Calibration in CFD Applications\n", "abstract": " Proper quantification and propagation of uncertainties in computational simulations are of critical importance. This issue is especially challenging for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applications. A particular obstacle for uncertainty quantifications in CFD problems is the large model discrepancies associated with the CFD models (eg, Reynolds averaged Navier\u2013Stokes equations) used for uncertainty propagation. Neglecting or improperly representing the model discrepancies leads to inaccurate and distorted uncertainty distribution for the Quantities of Interest. High-fidelity models, being accurate yet expensive, can accommodate only a small ensemble of simulations and thus lead to large interpolation errors and/or sampling errors; low-fidelity models can propagate a large ensemble, but can introduce large modeling errors. In this work, we propose a multi-model strategy to account for the influences of model discrepancies in uncertainty propagation and to reduce their impact on the predictions. Specifically, we take advantage of CFD models of multiple fidelities to estimate the model discrepancies associated with the lower-fidelity model in the parameter space. A Gaussian process is adopted to construct the model discrepancy function, and a Bayesian approach is used to infer the discrepancies and corresponding uncertainties in the regions of the parameter space where the high-fidelity simulations are not performed. The proposed multi-model strategy combines information from models with different fidelities and computational costs, and is of particular relevance for CFD applications, where a hierarchy of models with a wide range of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1395"]}
{"title": "Defect correction and error transport discretization error estimation for applications in CFD\n", "abstract": " Discretization error is usually the largest and most difficult numerical error to estimate in a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation. Development and evaluation of discretization error estimators ideally requires exact solutions to the PDEs which are only available for relatively simple cases. An alternative is to use numerical benchmarks which require a verified code and numerical solutions on a mesh which is sufficiently fine so that the discretization error in the benchmark solution is (essentially) negligible. The focus of this work is to use several numerical benchmark solutions to evaluate residual-based discretization error estimation methods which include defect correction and error transport equations for the Euler equations. This class of discretization error estimation methods requires accurate estimation of a residual/truncation error which will also be evaluated because the residual is the primary factor\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1395"]}
{"title": "Effect of Intra-Bed Flow Maldistribution on Chemical Conversion in Microfibrous Materials using Computational Fluid Dynamics\n", "abstract": " In packed beds at low Reynolds numbers, flow maldistribution can adversely affect the chemical conversion rates due to the fluid's tendency to preferentially flow through open regions of the bed. These effects can be minimized by increasing the voidage and allow uniform flow distribution. High voidages and uniform flow distribution are possible by using Microfibrous entrapped sorbents (MFES). MFES consists of small particles (100-200 \u75e0) of adsorbent entrapped in sintered bonded micro-fibers (2-10 \u75e0). These materials have been developed by Auburn's Center for Microfibrous Materials Manufacturing (CM3) using a simple wet-layup process. These materials showed improvement in chemical conversion rates over packed beds. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is being used to understand the physical and chemical phenomena involved in the enhancement of chemical conversion rates. In this study, particles are uniformly clustered in all directions in the material to analyze the effects of flow maldistribution. Clustering of particles is varied by using a dimensionless parameter called clustering parameter which goes from 0 (uniformly distributed particles) to 1 (highly clustered particles). The effect of flow maldistribution on chemical conversion is studied by varying the dimensionless numbers which characterize different gas-phase reactions: viscosity, diffusivity, and reaction rates. The dimensionless numbers that are varied in this study are Reynolds number, Peclet number, and Damkohler number.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1395"]}
{"title": "Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulations of Gas Flow through Microfibrous Materials: Analysis of Dilution of Packed Beds\n", "abstract": " The Center for Microfibrous Materials Manufacturing at Auburn University has developed a new class of composite materials consisting of adsorbent/reactant particles embedded in a matrix of sinter-bonded micro-fibers with diameters of order 100 and 10 \u75e0, respectively. These materials have demonstrated remarkable chemical reactivity properties, enhancing net reaction rates by up to a factor of five. Classical chemical engineering approaches do not accurately predict the reactive flow characteristics. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is being used to analyze the flow through these materials and to investigate the underlying mechanisms behind the enhancement in chemical reactivity. One of the effects of the microfibrous matrix is to physically separate the particles, thus allowing much smaller particles to be used compared to a standard packed bed. In order to study the effect of particle separation on chemical conversion rates, packed beds are diluted with void, diluted with inert particles, and diluted with inert fibers. The effects of different types of dilution on chemical conversion are studied by varying the dimensionless numbers which characterize different gas-phase reactions: viscosity, diffusivity, and reaction rates. The dimensionless numbers that are varied in this study are Reynolds number, Peclet number, and Damkohler number.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1395"]}
{"title": "Advanced Boundary Simulations of an Aeroacoustic and Aerodynamic Wind Tunnel\n", "abstract": " This study presents the first 3D two-way coupled fluid structure interaction (FSI) simulation of a hybrid anechoic wind tunnel (HAWT) test section with modeling all important effects, such as turbulence, Kevlar wall porosity and deflection, and reveals for the first time the complete 3D flow structure associated with a lifting model placed into a HAWT. The Kevlar deflections are captured using finite element analysis (FEA) with shell elements operated under a membrane condition. Three-dimensional RANS CFD simulations are used to resolve the flow field. Aerodynamic experimental results are available and are compared against the FSI results. Quantitatively, the pressure coefficients on the airfoil are in good agreement with experimental results. The lift coefficient was slightly underpredicted while the drag was overpredicted by the CFD simulations. The flow structure downstream of the airfoil showed good agreement with the experiments, particularly over the wind tunnel walls where the Kevlar windows interact with the flow field. A discrepancy between previous experimental observations and juncture flow-induced vortices at the ends of the airfoil is found to stem from the limited ability of turbulence models. The qualitative behavior of the flow, including airfoil pressures and cross-sectional flow structure is well captured in the CFD. From the structural side, the behavior of the Kevlar windows and the flow developing over them is closely related to the aerodynamic pressure field induced by the airfoil. The Kevlar displacement and the transpiration velocity across the material is dominated by flow blockage effects, generated aerodynamic lift, and the wake\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1395"]}

In order to prove the credibility of CFD techniques, it is important to have estimates of the numerical error produced while using it.

{"title": "A Multilevel Parallelism Approach with MPI and OpenACC for Complex CFD Codes\n", "abstract": " One of the challenges in GPU computing today is the extensive work required to transform an existing program that runs on the CPU to one that runs on the GPU. This research studies the ability of OpenACC to develop a portable GPU-accelerated CFD code while maintaining the same code base as an existing code that runs on the CPU. The code used is a second-order accurate, structured, finite volume CFD solver for the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. MPI is used to communicate between GPUs for a multi-GPU implementation of the code base. Test cases of a NACA 0012 airfoil and lid-driven cavity are used to test the performance and scalability of the multi-CPU and multi-GPU implementations compiled from the same code base.

{"title": "Joint Numerical\u2013Experimental Investigation of Enhanced Chemical Reactivity in Microfibrous Materials for Desulfurization\n", "abstract": " Ultra-pure hydrogen is very much required for a healthy operation of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells.

H2S sorbent or catalysts coated on the particles that are in the order of 100\u2009\u03bcm diameters entrapped into a high void volume carrier structure of sintered microfibers are observed to possess significantly higher heterogeneous reaction rates than packed beds of the small particle size. Fundamental reasons for this difference are investigated in this study to determine if such differences are caused by: (1) bed channeling, (2) microscale interstitial/interparticle velocity distributions, and/or (3) effect of presence of fibers.

{"title": "Viability of the diagonal implicit algorithm for hypersonic flowfields with finite rate chemistry\n", "abstract": " The diagonal implicit algorithm has been examined for high speed, moderate density flows. In this flight regime, nonequilibrium thermal, chemical, and radiative effects are important and the determination of these finite rate processes, coupled with a three dimensional flowfield solver, can require large co MP utational resources. In order to minimize computational costs, Irfflay et al. proposed a diagonal implicit solution algorithm. For the extreme conditions of planetary return examined in this report, the avalanche ionization phenomenon gave rise to fast chemical reactions in the stagnation region. The diagonal implicit algorithm was found to give unsafisfactory convergence rates in this region due to numerical instabilities, even at reduced CFL numbers. Thus, the diagonal implicit approximation is not feasible for flows with fast chemical reactions. In addition, changes in the atom impact ionization rates for nitrogen were found to significantly affect the flowfield properties and radiative heat transfer.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1395"]}
