{"title": "Need analysis of culture-based genealogy software for indigenous communities\n", "abstract": " This paper presents the results of a need analysis study of culture-based genealogy software for indigenous communities in Borneo and the challenges while introducing a software application proposal to the communities. Introducing a new software application to the indigenous communities which may change their way of living is not an easy task as they have been practicing their norm of life from generation to generation. Therefore, initial study is necessary to assess their readiness and understanding on how new technology may affect their daily life, cultures and beliefs. Their cultures relate to every stage of their life. It is a very complex body of knowledge, which needs a proper technique in order to capture, analyse, preserve and interpret it. At this stage of research, the work is focused on the marriage culture which is strongly related to genealogy. However, comprehensive component of the proposed software\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["409"]}
{"title": "Integrate cultures and beliefs into genealogy software for remote communities in Borneo\n", "abstract": " The biggest challenge to precisely model the remote communities cultures in Borneo is to elicit the reliable documentary sources or historical data, as almost of it is not recorded. This is partly due to the accessibility to education, ICT technologies and the development of infrastructure was a bit late by the remote communities in Borneo. Therefore, the possible source of historical data is through oral tradition, which is have limited trace only to several generations back. In order to preserve their cultures and beliefs, a thorough study on remote communities is required in order to present a precise software architecture that can represent their cultures and beliefs in digital form. This paper will discuss the elicitation process and techniques on remote community cultures which related to marriage process, including preparations, events and beliefs before and during the marriage ceremony. These cultures are integrated into\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["409"]}
{"title": "Understanding Technology Changes for ICT4D Projects through Modelling\n", "abstract": " ICT4D involves the study of design and development of ICT technology to the community. Based on our experience, most of the ICT4D projects are happening in one off solution. The projects will deliver with off the shelf products or services and hand over to the community upon the deployment and training. There is neither plan nor development to deal with changes. Hence, it may lead to the failure and unsustainable projects. We believe that dealing with technology changes is essential for sustaining the ICT4D projects. However, how to handle the changes in technology on ICT projects? This paper introduces a preliminary study on technique to handle the changes of technology through modelling. From the modelling, it showcases how the requirements have led to the technology change and how the business models affect the decision in designing the technology or solution for ICT4D projects. We adopt actor network theory to study the technology changes on ICT4D projects. We extend the actor network theory with networked actor modelling to study the actors\u2019 needs and the impact of cost (eg business models) to deal with the technology adoption, translation and development for ICT4D projects. The agent oriented modelling is introduced as the modelling process for actor network theory. The agent modelling consists of models based on the integration of agent models and e3Value model. In order to evaluate the work, we demonstrate how the model can understand the technology changes (eg adoption and adaptation) for an electronic health record system (EHR).", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["409"]}
{"title": "Chemistry modelling and simulation through agent oriented modelling and Netlogo\n", "abstract": " Education technology is used to enhance students\u2019 understanding on science subject. Within the Faculty of Resource Science and Technology (FRST) at Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS) students face difficulty to visualize on the composition of atoms or molecule due to complexity of the topics. Although, students can attend Chemistry labs, the usage of labs are insufficient due to lack of instruments and lab materials. Hence, it is always a challenge to deliver some Chemistry topics and students always feel difficulty on understanding some Chemistry subjects. We believe that simulation can fill this gap. However, how to model the Chemistry theory and develop the Chemistry simulation model is challenging. This paper introduces an Agent Oriented Modelling (AOM) and Netlogo for chemistry modelling and simulation. The AOM is investigated in Chemistry domain and the potential usage is reported. From the finding, the AOM can help the modeller to understand the Chemistry theory and conceptualize the Chemistry theory into agent model and simulation. On the other hand, the agent model (eg domain model) has enabling the communication between researchers from two disciplines. Although we have successful model the Chemistry theory, how the simulation can support the Chemistry learning will be explored in the coming periods.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["409"]}
{"title": "Modelling Human Decision in Fire Evacuation Simulation through BDI Based Cognitive Architecture\n", "abstract": " Fire evacuation is important to save people live during disaster. During evacuation, people are unable to make adequate decision due to stress. Understanding human decision making in fire evacuation is needed to ensure people understand how to behave in an emergency when an unpredictable fire incident happens. Works have been done to model the human decision making in fire evacuation through mathematical modelling. We take the software model approach in which the model can reuse, ease of extension, ease of maintenance, understandable or comprehensiveness etc. Meanwhile, the models can reduce the complexity in human behaviour modelling. This paper presents the modelling of human decision making in fire evacuation through BDI based cognitive architecture. Cognitive architecture is based on cognitive sciences and aim at describing human cognitive processes as precisely as possible\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["409"]}
{"title": "From A Shared Single Display Application to Shared Virtual Space Learning Application\n", "abstract": " Shared single display support the learning environment through multiple devices like mouse, keyboard or mobile phone. To what extend it is useful for university learning? We had identified some challenges in using shared single display. This paper reports the challenges in using a shared single display for learning activity in university. From the challenges, we explored a shared virtual space and the finding is reported in this paper. It is interesting to claim that shared virtual space is more promising in term of learning activities and development. The shared virtual space is easy to manage. However, creating sustainable and collaborative, scalable learning virtual space is a challenge and worth to explore in future.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["409"]}
