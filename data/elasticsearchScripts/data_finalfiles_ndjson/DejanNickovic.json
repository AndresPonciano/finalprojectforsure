{"title": "From Mtl to Deterministic Timed Automata\n", "abstract": " In this paper we propose a novel technique for constructing timed automata from properties expressed in the logic mtl, under bounded-variability assumptions. We handle full mtl and include all future operators. Our construction is based on separation of the continuous time monitoring of the input sequence and discrete predictions regarding the future. The separation of the continuous from the discrete allows us to determinize our automata in an exponential construction that does not increase the number of clocks. This leads to a doubly exponential construction from mtl to deterministic timed automata, compared with triply exponential using existing approaches. We offer an alternative to the existing approach to linear real-time model checking, which has never been implemented. It further offers a unified framework for model checking, runtime monitoring, and synthesis, in an approach that can reuse tools\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "62\n", "authors": ["1650"]}
{"title": "Contracts for systems design: Theory\n", "abstract": " Aircrafts, trains, cars, plants, distributed telecommunication military or health care systems, and more, involve systems design as a critical step. Complexity has caused system design times and costs to go severely over budget so as to threaten the health of entire industrial sectors. Heuristic methods and standard practices do not seem to scale with complexity so that novel design methods and tools based on a strong theoretical foundation are sorely needed. Model-based design as well as other methodologies such as layered and compositional design have been used recently but a unified intellectual framework with a complete design flow supported by formal tools is still lacking. Recently an \u201corthogonal\u201d approach has been proposed that can be applied to all methodologies introduced thus far to provide a rigorous scaffolding for verification, analysis and abstraction/refinement: contractbased design. Several results have been obtained in this domain but a unified treatment of the topic that can help in putting contract-based design in perspective is missing. This paper intends to provide such treatment where contracts are precisely defined and characterized so that they can be used in design methodologies such as the ones mentioned above with no ambiguity. In addition, the paper provides an important link between interface and contract theories to show similarities and correspondences. This paper is complemented by a companion paper where contract based design is illustrated through use cases.", "num_citations": "53\n", "authors": ["1650"]}

The essence of this approach is the automatic construction of an observer from the specification in the form of a program that can be interfaced with a simulator and alert the user if the property is violated by a simulation trace. Although not complete, this lighter approach to formal verification has been effectively used in software and digital hardware to detect errors. Recently, the idea of property checkers has been extended to analog and mixed-signal systems.

{"title": "Robustness of sequential circuits\n", "abstract": " Digital components play a central role in the design of complex embedded systems. These components are interconnected with other, possibly analog, devices and the physical environment. This environment cannot be entirely captured and can provide inaccurate input data to the component. It is thus important for digital components to have a robust behavior, i.e. the presence of a small change in the input sequences should not result in a drastic change in the output sequences. In this paper, we study a notion of robustness for sequential circuits. However, since sequential circuits may have parts that are naturally discontinuous (e.g., digital controllers with switching behavior), we need a flexible framework that accommodates this fact and leaves discontinuous parts of the circuit out from the robustness analysis. As a consequence, we consider sequential circuits that have their input variables partitioned into two\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "34\n", "authors": ["1650"]}
{"title": "Checking timed and hybrid properties: Theory and applications\n", "abstract": " The growth of consumer embedded devices, where digital, analog and software components are often combined together on a single chip, results in an increase of complexity of the design and verification processes. The validation of such analog and mixed-signal systems largely relies on simulation-based techniques combined with often ad-hoc analysis methods. This thesis is motivated by the export of property-based formal techniques to the validation of analog and mixed-signal systems, at their continuous and timed levels of abstraction. Since the formal verification of non-trivial continuous systems remains very difficult, we resort to a lighter validation technique, that is, property-based monitoring.We define signal temporal logic STL as a high-level specification language that allows expressing temporal properties of continuous and timed signals. STL is as an extension of the realtime metric interval temporal logic MITL, where continuous signals are transformed into Boolean ones using numerical predicates, and the temporal relations between them are expressed using standard real-time temporal operators whose atomic propositions correspond to those predicates.We develop two monitoring procedures, offline and incremental, for checking the correctness of simulation traces with respect to STL properties and implement them into a stand alone analog monitoring tool (AMT). The property-based monitoring framework is applied, using the AMT tool, to two real-world case studies, considering properties of a FLASH memory cell and a DDR2 memory interface. We also consider the problem of property-based formal verification of timed systems\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "28\n", "authors": ["1650"]}

Nowadays, systems typically consist of multiple interacting components and, due to their complexity, testing presents a considerable portion of the effort and cost in the design process. Exploiting the compositional structure of system specifications can considerably reduce the effort in model-based testing. Moreover, inferring properties about the system from testing its individual components allows the designer to reduce the amount of integration testing. In this paper, we study compositional properties of the ioco-testing theory. We propose a new approach to composition and hiding operations, inspired by contract-based design and interface theories.

The first application case illustrates the use of contracts in requirement engineering, an area of system design where formal methods were scarcely considered, yet are stringently needed. We focus in particular to the critical design step by which sub-contracts are generated for suppliers from a set of different viewpoints (specified as contracts) on the global system. We also discuss important issues regarding certification in requirement engineering, such as consistency, compatibility, and completeness of requirements. The second example is developed in the context of the Autosar methodology now widely advocated in the automotive sector. We propose a contract framework to support schedulability analysis, a key step in Autosar methodology.

We first show that while the satisfiability problem for SFO is undecidable, its membership and monitoring problems are decidable. We develop an offline monitoring procedure for SFO that has polynomial complexity in the size of the input trace and the specification, for a fixed number of quantifiers and function symbols. We show that the algorithm has computation time linear in the size of the input trace for the important fragment of bounded-response specifications interpreted over input traces with finite variability. We can use our results to extend signal temporal logic with first-order quantifiers over time and value parameters, while preserving its efficient monitoring.

Unfortunately, the conjunction operator does not allow independent implementability in general.

This makes elastic systems difficult to design and hard to specify. In this paper we propose a novel formalization of elasticity and related concepts that is based on timed patterns written using timed regular expressions.

Much progress has been made towards developing efficient and scalable reachability algorithms tailored to hybrid automata. However, it is not easy to encode rich formal specifications such that they can be interpreted by existing tools for reachability.

{"title": "Compositional contract abstraction for system design\n", "abstract": " Contract-based design has been recently proposed as a framework for concurrent system design in the context of complex supplier chains, where sub-system design can be sub-contracted to suppliers while guaranteeing correct system integration. A unifying meta-theory of contracts was proposed in [Benveniste et al. 2012], which subsumes known frameworks such as interface theories, modal interfaces, and Assume/Guarantee contracts. This report proposes, for this meta-theory of contracts, a generic abstraction technique allowing to prove contract properties based on their abstractions. More precisely, we show how to lift abstractions, from components to contracts, in a systematic way. In doing so, fundamental relations such as being a correct implementation or a valid environment, refining, can be checked on abstractions. Our abstraction technique is fully compositional with respect to contract conjunction. Compositionality of abstraction with respect to contract composition is only partially achieved. We believe that the results we obtain are the best achievable ones and we explain the obstructions we see against improving them. Our abstraction technique complements observers, proposed as a testing technique adapted to contracts in [6]. The latter allow disproving properties, whereas abstraction allows proving them.
