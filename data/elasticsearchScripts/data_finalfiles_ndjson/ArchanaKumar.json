A total of 411 college students in India participated in the survey. Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), this study finds that Indian consumers' need for uniqueness positively influences attitudes toward American products. Attitudes toward American products positively affect perceived quality and emotional value for a U.S. brand while this effect is negative in the case of a local brand. Emotional value is an important factor influencing purchase intention toward a U.S. brand and a local brand as well.

{"title": "Shop while you talk: Determinants of purchase intentions through a mobile device\n", "abstract": " As mobile devices become ubiquitous in consumers@ lives they are starting to play a ma. or role in consumers@ shopping experiences. However, the relatively slow off-take in mobile purchasing has perplexed researchers. Research in marketing and retailing has predominantly focused on consumer characteristics to predict mobile shopping without considering the interdependencies between user personality, perceptions and attitudes toward technology in general and mobile shopping in particular. This study adopts an integrative approach by combining TAM and TRI to predict attitudes toward mobile shopping and purchase behavior through mobile devices. The authors argue that user personality traits toward technology influence user perception toward mobile shopping, which in turn impact user attitudes toward mobile shopping leading to purchase behavior. The study not only demonstrates support for this three-stage process, but also identifies key personality and perception variables that marketers could use to segment and target consumers that have a greater proclivity toward mobile shopping.", "num_citations": "64\n", "authors": ["458"]}

In addition to the coefficient of friction between the reinforcement and soil in pullout, there are other parameters affecting the behaviour of strip footings on reinforced sand. The parametric study was carried out for number of layers of reinforcement, depth of first layer of reinforcement, vertical spacing between the layers of reinforcement, length of reinforcement, depth of reinforcement, tensile strength of reinforcement and size of footing. An empirical method is suggested to find out the ultimate bearing capacity of footing on reinforced soil.", "num_citations": "30\n", "authors": ["458"]}

Hence, in the present study computational approaches have been employed alongside KINOMEscan profiling technique to reveal the mechanism behind crizotinib resistance in ALK at a molecular level. The results of our analysis indicate that C1156Y mutation alters the conformation of the ALK binding pocket residues which results in a marked decrease in hydrogen bond interactions between crizotinib and ALK. This indicates that hydrogen bonding was a crucial effector of decreased binding affinity.

We confirm that bacterial clearance is a slow process. The time taken for each log-unit decline in BI is between 13.6 to 24 months probably depending on initial BI level. The rate of smear negativity appears to be dependent on immune competence of the patients as reflected by a rapid BI decline in borderline BT-BB patients vis-\u00e0-vis BL-LL lepromatous patients both in the low and high BI group.

{"title": "Effects of vitamin A and cortisone on healing of corneal penetrating wounds.\n", "abstract": " The effect of the administration of vitamin A drops on neutralizing the inhibitory role of cortisone in penetrating corneal wound healing was studied on 24 albino rabbits (48 eyes). The rate of healing of the wound was determined by the fluorescein strain technique and the tensile strength of the affected cornea was determined on the 11th day after the wound was made. It was observed that in the group of eyes in which only cortisone in any form was administered, not only was the rate of healing delayed (with statistical significance) but there was also a statistically significant lowering of the tensile strength of the wound. However, in the eyes in which vitamin A was also administered simultaneously with cortisone, the rate of healing of the wound was enhanced and there was also a statistically significant increase in the tensile strength of wound. Therefore in this study it was confirmed that by simultaneous use of vitamin A drops, the inhibitory role of cortisone is neutralized even in penetrating corneal wounds.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["458"]}

{"title": "Analytical technologies for genotoxic impurities in pharmaceutical compounds\n", "abstract": " Genotoxic impurities (GTIs) have gained considerable attention from health authorities as well as from the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. Analysis and control of these impurities in pharmaceutical compounds pose a significant challenge, often requiring selective, sensitive, and robust trace-level methods for analysis. This article focuses on the method development strategy and associated technologies for the analysis of GTIs. GTIs typically have a wide range of physicochemical properties such as volatility, stability, presence of UV chromophores, ionizable groups, and derivatizable functional groups. Various separation and detection technologies are available and can be used to identify and analyze. Choosing the appropriate analytical technique depends on the GTI physicochemical properties, required sensitivity, and the consideration of the matrix interference.Genotoxic impurities (GTIs) belong to a class of compounds that interact with DNA and induce genetic mutations. These compounds add significant risk without adding any benefit to patients and are also known as mutagenic impurities.

Rising labor costs for manual transplanting of rice, concerns about depleting underground water, and increasing costs of irrigation have made transplanting less appealing to farmers. DSR is an alternative method that could reduce the labor and irrigation water requirements for crop establishment. During CSISA Phase I, the project conducted numerous training activities for farmers and service providers. To evaluate the CSISA training and identify constraints to farmers in adopting DSR, we conducted a survey of farmers who have used DSR in the 4-year period of 2009 to 2012 and conducted a study on their continuous use of DSR in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Some of the sample farmers evaluated DSR in their own fields, often with project support, and documented what happened in subsequent years as they gained more experience with the technology.To identify sample farmers, we obtained the list of farmers who participated in DSR training conducted by CSISA from 2009 to 2012 and farmers who received DSR services from CSISA-assisted service providers in the same period. The aggregated list consists of 2,386 farmers.

An aliquot from each group was centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 minute at 4 oC to separate the seminal plasma for estimation of enzymes {Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)}. Plasma membrane integrity and lipid peroxidation status were estimated in all the three stages. The progressive motility was significantly (p< 0.05) higher at both prefreeze and post thaw stages in 4 ppm group as compared to all other groups. The average seminal plasma content of lactate LDH was the lowest in Group-III indicating low LDH leakages over the control as well as in 2 and 8 ppm groups. Also, the level of activities of ALP was highest in Group-III than the rest of treatment and control groups.

{"title": "Data centric based routing protocols for wireless sensor networks: A survey\n", "abstract": " Sensor networks are quite different from traditional networks in different ways: sensor networks have severe energy concerns, redundant low-rate data, and many-to-one flows. Routing protocols developed for other adhoc networks cannot be applied directly in WSN because of the energy constraint of the sensor nodes. Data-centric technologies are needed to perform in-network aggregation of data to yield energy-efficient dissemination. Sensor networks are used in many applications like environment monitoring, health, industrial control units, military applications and in the various computing environments. Since sensor the entire sensor node are battery powered devices, energy consumption of nodes during transmission or reception of packets affects the life-time of the entire network. In this paper we model data-centric routing and compare its performance with traditional end-to-end routing schemes.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["458"]}

Common risk factors include pulmonary infections, a past history of pneumothorax and asthma. 1 In pregnant women with sudden onset of respiratory distress, tension pneumothorax must be considered in the differential diagnosis. 4 Risk of recurrence is 30%-40% particularly during labor. 1 The risk of recurrence following the initial episode is almost 30% and the risk thereafter is about 50% and overall incidence of recurrence is about 33%-44%. 2, 5 Management of pneumothorax should follow standard protocol for drainage, which is indicated in large symptomatic primary pneumothorax, similar to that followed in a non-pregnant woman. Generally small bore needle tube is preferred over large bore tube as it is equally effective and is more tolerable for the patient. In the presence of persistent air leaks/recurrent pneumothorax in pregnancy, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with pleurectomy or pleural abrasion would be the ideal procedure to be undertaken. Chemical pleurodesis is an alternative procedure. 6 In this scenario, vaginal delivery is the preferred mode of delivery. To prevent an increase in intrathoracic pressure during labor, epidural analgesics and instrumental delivery to cut-short second stage are recommended for those who have not undergone definitive surgical management. 7", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["458"]}

{"title": "Multiple CCAAT binding proteins regulate the expression of the angiotensinogen gene.\n", "abstract": " Angiotensinogen is a serum glycoprotein which is primarily synthesized in the liver and converted into the octapeptide hormone angiotensin-II in circulation. Transient transfection studies have identified a cis-acting DNA element located between 115 and 145 bp upstream from the transcriptional initiation site in the promoter of the rat angiotensinogen gene which is involved in the regulation of its transcription. This region of the promoter has sequence homology with NF-1/CCAT, C/EBP, and CP1 binding sites. We show here by DNase-I footprint and gel shift assay in presence of recombinant transcription factors and their antibodies that NF-1/CAAT and C/EBP like transcription factors bind to this region of the promoter. Our DNase footprint assay with recombinant NF-1/CAAT has also identified another NF-1 binding site between-180 and-190. Since our previous studies have identified a NF-1 site in the proximal promoter region and two C/EBP binding sites in the distal promoter region of the angiotensinogen gene, our data suggests that multiple CAAT binding factors regulate the expression of the angiotensinogen gene in liver cells. In accordance with these results, we show that cotransfection of mammalian expression vectors containing NF-1/CAAT or C/EBP coding sequence increases the promoter activity of the angiotensinogen gene in human hepatoma cells.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["458"]}

The main target for the crizotinib is anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). Evidences available indicate that double mutant ALK (L1196M and G1269A) confers resistance to crizotinib. However, how mutation confers drug resistance is not well-understood. Hence, in the present study, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation approach was employed to study the impact of crizotinib binding efficacy with ALK structures at a molecular level. Docking results indicated that ALK double mutant (L1196M and G1269A) significantly affected the binding affinity for crizotinib. Furthermore, MD studies revealed that mutant ALK-crizotinib complex showed higher deviation, higher fluctuation and decreased number of intermolecular H-bonds, when compared to the native ALK-crizotinib complex.

Seed yield and yield-attributes data were collected to identify the important traits forming the yield and related with genotypic diversity in stability of productivity across the seasons. The cumulative temperatures from sowing to podding (mean across three seasons) in cultivars were within 1076.8-1553.5 C contributing to the estimation of seed yield per plant with a reasonable precision (R 2= 0.43). The number of pods/plant, which showed a highest correlation coefficient with seed yield was well predicted (R 2= 0.57) by multiple regression equations in which cumulative temperature from sowing to podding and duration from flowering to emergence were used as independent variables. The cultivars' Ishigaki 2','Haibushi'and'Kurodane Kinugasa'which gave the highest seed yield were the shortest in development and with the highest number of pods/plant.

Ecosystem health integrates the factors like ecological, economic, social and human health. The services provided by these ecosystems are extremely important to human welfare and therefore, it is essential to assess the ecological health of water bodies. The paper reviews the indices and indicators used by researchers for assessing the ecological health. Out of the large number of indices, few indices developed like IMEERA, HEHI, etc. are reported to provide precise results, but are time consuming and needs lengthy proceed. In the present paper, the ecological health index methodology (EHIM) along with/without tropical state index (TSI), being less time consuming and provide precise results, has been applied as a tool to assess the ecological health of Baiyangdian Lake (China) and found to have results similar to that obtained by Xu et al.[25] using eco-exergy based index (EBI) with TSI. The results indicated that the ecological health of Baiyangdian Lake is of middle health category ie (EHIM, 40-60), indicating bad quality of water with no life supporting ability. EHIM, therefore, as an important tool based on eco-exergy to assess the ecological health of water body in any geographical region and can recommended for ecological health assessment of water ecosystems.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["458"]}

Materials and Methods: Case records of 184 previously untreated children (age 0-18yr) diagnosed to have HL at our centre between 1994 and 2012 were reviewed. The clinical characteristics, treatments offered and outcomes of these children were analyzed. Results: There were 162 boys and 22 girls with a median age of 8yrs. Sixty two percent children came from rural areas and 60% children were malnourished. Median duration of symptoms prior to treatment was 12 months (range 1-96 months). Eighty two percent children had advanced disease (Stage IIB-IV) at presentation. Abandonment rates were high (20%) and 12% children died during treatment. Treatment related complications were seen in a large number of patients and there was a high incidence of acquiring Hepatitis B and C during the treatment course. The 5-year overall survival and event-free survival rates were 79.4% and 53.1%, respectively. Conclusions: Children with HL coming to our centre tend to have a delayed presentation with advanced disease. Abandonment rates are high and a large proportion of patients experience complications during treatment.

{"title": "Particulate/cell separations using macroporous monolithic matrices\n", "abstract": " Particle-based stationary phases have been used in chromatographic techniques such as high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), anion-exchange chromatography, and capillary liquid chromatography (CLC). Despite high stability and load-bearing capacity, a large void volume between the particles and high mass transfer resistance in flow of large macromolecules makes them inappropriate in separation processes (Bisjak et al. 2005, Podgornik and Strancar 2005, Unger et al. 2008). These limitations can be overcome by the use of monolithic stationary phases based on silica or polymers. Polymeric monoliths are generally made of synthetic, natural organic polymers, or a combination of natural and synthetic polymers. Polymer macroporous monoliths can be easily prepared by in situ polymerization of monomers with suitable cross-linkers directly in chromatographic units.

This study attempts three kinds of analysis of acoustic data in the far-field of two CD nozzles at under, ideal and over expanded conditions and an aerospike nozzle at identical conditions. Firstly, the angular variation of spatial correlation with the reference microphone being placed at 900 and 150 to the jet inlet axis, secondly, auto-correlograms at the two reference locations and thirdly, cross-correlograms of the reference microphone with those at other angular locations. The effect of spike truncation on the correlation was also investigated. The results of the spatial correlation exhibits a broadening of the correlation distribution from under to over expansion for CD nozzles, but no such trend is observed for aerospike nozzles where the condition at the cowl lip seems to be the criteria. The autocorrelogram results for the aerospike reflect the shock associated noise when the flow changes from open to closed wake regimes for microphones locations near nozzle exit. The frequencies of the wriggles in cross-correlograms match the screech tones for CD nozzles but fail to match the tones seen at off-design conditions of the aerospike nozzles. The results show the significant acoustic differences due to the aerospike nozzle configuration despite operating at conditions identical to CD nozzles which are captured in the correlation analysis of far-field acoustic data.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["458"]}

{"title": "Management of Epilepsy During Pregnancy\n", "abstract": " Pregnant women with epilepsy are at serious risk of various complications. These may constitute high obstetric risk because of reduced fertility, risk of seizures during pregnancy, perinatal death, fetal malformation, miscarriage and increased seizure frequency. Preconception counselling and coordination of care is what can help to reduce these risks. A careful reappraisal of each case should ascertain the diagnosis, the need for continued Anti-epileptic drugs (AED) therapy, selection of appropriate AEDs, optimization of the dosage form and folic acid supplementation. Pregnancy has been found to influence the natural history of epilepsy and seizures and is often found likely to worsen seizure frequency in about one-third of them. The bioavailability of AEDs may change considerably owing to alterations in its pharmacodynamics and kinetics. Most of the AEDs are potentially teratogenic. Hence they may increase the risk of fetal malformations. During pregnancy, the fetal status needs to be monitored with estimation of serum a-fetoprotein and ultrasound screening for malformations. The dosage of AEDs can be adjusted according to clinical requirement and blood levels of AEDs.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["458"]}

Five out of the seven mountain zones within Kathmandu\u2019s UNESCO World Heritage Sites suffered damage ranging from the complete collapse of several temples near Hanumandhoka\u2019s Durbar Square to partial damage at Changu Narayan. This study presents the results of reconnaissance surveys conducted in December 2017 and June 2018 within the Pashupati and Changu Narayan monument zones investigating the plausible causes of damage incurred. Geotechnical assessment of soils reveals the presence of gravelly sand at Pashupati and clayey silt at Changu Narayan. The soil-water retention characteristics and strength parameters of these soil were also obtained in the laboratory. Evidence of rotation and differential settlements in the foundations of the ancient structures was not observed suggesting that soil liquefaction had not taken place at these locations. Structural damage patterns observed at these sites indicated a lack of periodic maintenance and low bending and shear stiffness of the masonry walls of the temples. This study suggests engineering interventions and monitoring systems that could safeguard these structures in the event of future earthquakes.R\u00c9SUM\u00c9: Katmandou, la capitale du N\u00e9pal, a connu une catastrophe culturelle \u00e0 la suite du tremblement de terre de Gorkha en 2015 (Mw= 7, 8), qui a d\u00e9truit des centaines de monuments historiques et culturels.

In present work, a device CoolBot\u201d was tested along with selection of low cost insulation technology. CoolBot is a device, which turns a conventional room air conditioner into a produce cooler. The air conditioner thermostat is heated so that the unit keeps running until the room temperature reaches the CoolBot set point. To prevent icing of the fins, the CoolBot measures the fin temperature and stops the compressor (through the thermostat heater) when ice builds up. The ice on the fins continues to cool the room air until it melts and the compressor turns on again. The developed setup can go close to 00 C of room temperature within 2 hour of running", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["458"]}

The ethanol extract of the leaf of C. tamala was used for investigating its effect against diabetes using a rat model. Different doses of the ethanol extract of C. tamala was administered orally to alloxan-induced diabetic rats for 15 d and the effect of treatment on blood glucose level, glycosylated haemoglobin and peroxidation products such as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and serum lipids were monitored. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy and high performance liquid chromatography techniques were used for identification and quantification of the active principles of the ethanol extract responsible for exerting antioxidant and antidiabetic effects. Oral administration of the ethanol extract of C. tamala resulted in significant decrease in the blood glucose levels, glycosylated haemoglobin, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and serum lipids in diabetic rats under investigation. It was also observed that the oral administration of ethanol extract of C. tamala significantly decreased the levels of reduced glutathione and superoxide dismutase in the hepatic and renal tissues of alloxan-induced diabetic rats. These results provided evidence for the  antidiabetic, antioxidant and antihyperlipidemic effects of the ethanol extract of C. tamala when administered orally. On the basis of these findings it can be concluded that extracts of C. tamala should be investigated further for predicting their clinical potential as a phytomedicine for treating diabetes mellitus.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["458"]}

Fungicides from seven chemical classes were evaluated for their effect on Cg, Cp and PNVC on 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th and 14th day after spray. Two sprays were given under each treatment at 7 days interval. All the fungicides significantly reduced Cg, Cp and PNVC with control at all the times of observation. Inhibitory effect on Cp, Cg and PNVC was recorded highest on the first day of observation after each spray thereafter, gradual decrease was recorded. It was observed that under higher disease pressure this pathogen requires repeated applications of fungicides to bring down the level of PNVC for further spread of the disease. All the treatments inhibited Cp and Cg to greater extent after second spray as compared to after their first application. The quinine outside inhibitor (QoI) fungicide (kresoxim methyl) exhibited significantly lowest Cp, Cg and PNVC over control with no phytotoxicity on apple leaves at used concentrations (0.025, 0.05 and 0.1%).

The Cu/CHA based SCR catalysts were shown to have robust NOx conversion, compared to conventional zeolite based catalysts, even after extreme hydrothermal treatments, making Cu/CHA catalyst a prime candidate in aftertreatment applications where actively regenerated DPF approach is employed. Even though the NOx conversion is minimally impacted over the real-world operated Cu/CHA catalysts, due to aftertreatment system design, the redox and acid sites were found to change significantly from laboratory simulated studies. Hydrothermal aging and sulfur poisoning were identified as two key mechanistic routes responsible for change in the nature and the amount of redox and acid site species.The impact of hydrothermal treatment and sulfur poisoning on NOx conversion, redox species and acid sites in Cu/CHA catalysts were empirically evaluated, mainly through the SCR related reaction studies. There are limited but rapidly growing number of publications on the spectroscopic characterization of the active species in Cu/CHA catalysts [2, 3], ie DRIFTs characterization studies indicated that Cu ions primarily positioned in the sixmembered rings at low ion exchange levels and the cages at high ion exchange levels [3].

By this coupling, underflow recharge can be represented as time-dependent boundary condition to avoid an error of calculation due to defining both vertical side of slope as fixed head boundary. Another advantage of this coupling is that the material conductance can bc assigned through calibration process of transicnt problem with a higher confidence than using a fixed head boundary. However, application of this method in snow season needs to count time lag between rainfall event and snow melting", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["458"]}

Geant4 provides an estimate of detector response (sensitivity) based on an accurate description of detector geometry, material composition and interaction of particles with the various detector layers.

{"title": "Disclosure of Disease among Women affected by Leprosy: A Qualitative Study\n", "abstract": " Purpose: Although leprosy is completely curable with multidrug therapy, it is unfortunate that the stigma attached to leprosy persists even today. Fear of social exclusion prevents disclosure of the disease to the family and community. This study aimed to evaluate the extent of disclosure of disease among women affected by leprosy in a tertiary referral hospital in Chhattisgarh State, India.Method: A qualitative study was conducted with 57 women affected by leprosy who reported at a tertiary referral hospital in Champa, Chhattisgarh State. The respondents were 18 years of age or older, and had completed multidrug therapy for leprosy. They were asked whether the disclosure of disease had affected their interactions with family, neighbours and community members.Results: Of the 57 women, 48 (84%) had disclosed their disease to their family, 17 (30%) to their neighbours and 13 (23%) to the community members. Thirty women (53%) reported that they experienced problems after revealing the ailment to their family, friends and neighbours. The qualitative analysis found that negative behaviour towards people affected by leprosy still persists in the community. Consequently, women affected by leprosy try to hide their disease due to fear of negative community reactions.Conclusion: This study emphasises the need to spread awareness about the disease and its transmission, by educating the people affected by leprosy, their families and the community. This should be a continuous process in order to reduce or remove the stigma and discrimination against women affected by leprosy, in particular.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["458"]}

{"title": "Crustal Seismic Anisotropy in the Garhwal Lesser Himalaya\n", "abstract": " Seismic anisotropy in the crust of the underthrusting Indian plate and the Garhwal Lesser Himalaya has been estimated using local earthquake data from short-period seismic stations operated in the region. Local events (M\u2264 3) with incidence angle ic\u2264 45 which occurred between January 2008 and December 2008 have been used in this study. S-wave splitting measurements have been performed for estimation of two anisotropic parameters (a) anisotropic fast axis azimuth (\u03a6) and (b) delay time (\u2202 t) between Sfast and Sslow. The method of cross-correlation has been used to estimate the anisotropic parameters. The NS and EW components are rotated to find the correlation between two seismograms and grid searched is applied to pick the optimum value of the fast axes and delay times. A total of 105 pairs of anisotropy parameters (\u03a6 and\u2202 t) are calculated from 85 shallow focus earthquakes with 25 null measurements. The spatial variations, both in \u03a6 and\u2202 t, suggest a complex anisotropic upper crust beneath the region. This is caused by a combination of structural and stressinduced mechanisms. The average \u03a6 is oriented in the NW-SE direction (N121) sub-parallel to the local and regional stress directions. These fault-parallel \u03a6 distributions suggest that the observed anisotropy is mostly controlled by the local fault-related structures. In the central part of the study area near SNT and to the west of Tehri, the fast axes are oriented NE\u2013SW. We interpret this orientation to be due to the presence of over-pressurized rock volume which should be responsible for the flips in \u03a6 and the increase in\u2202 t.

These interfacial charges include charges dislocated from shallow and deep sites at interfacial region. The charge residing at deep locations takes more time to dislodge themselves compared to charge residing at shallow sites. As dipole present in cellulose has large relaxation time, there might be some relation between deep charge and paper insulation sensitive parameters.

{"title": "Automation for Measuring the Surface Resistivity of RPC by Arduino Motor Shield\n", "abstract": " India Based Neutrino Observatory (INO) is planning to use~ 30,000 Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC) detectors of size 2m x 2m. Each resistive plate chamber is made up of glass or Bakelite whose resistance is of the order 1012 \u2126/cm2, and two pick-up panels. Both glass electrodes of the detector have one side (outer) painted with thin and uniform coating of graphite paint. This provides the resistivity of range 100-300 k\u2126 per square. This range of resistivity provides distribution of voltage over the surface of glass electrodes. Uniform coating will provide uniform electric field inside the glass plate chamber and high resistivity value will help in confining the induced charge on the surface. It is one of the necessary criteria for good RPC detector that the coating of graphite paint should be uniform. Therefore it is required to measure the resistivity for the verification of uniformity. Last few years we have been focusing our efforts in this direction. In this connection, we made sequential improvement from the previous work. The present system is cost effective, automatically recording measurement in the computer, fast and accurate. Earlier MOTOR BEE ver. 5.0 microcontroller was used which was an imported and costly material. After massive search in the local market Arduino microcontroller was discovered, which controls the movement of all motors and it also saves the value of resistivity in the computer automatically.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["458"]}

The discovery of concepts and relationships from unstructured text is a crucial and challenging task in constructing ontology (s). A pragmatic solution is offered by a metaontology as it supplements the ontology with related concept pairs and relationships. An ideal approach to construct a metaontology is to employ databases as they save on the time required to store, retrieve and update data. The relationships in the database are augmented by converting them into a graph to determine transitive relationships. Accuracy is ensured by integrating only those relationships with the ontology which have a high degree of certainty.

However, the field of TMDs and other causes of orofacial pain is undergoing a radical change, primarily because of an explosion of knowledge about pain management in general. As a result, etiological theories about TMDs are evolving toward a biopsychosocial medical model from the traditional dental framework. Conservative and reversible management approaches (especially of chronic pain conditions) are becoming the norm rather than the exception in treating TMD patients, and already certain biological and psychosocial factors are known to affect the outcomes. Current research in this field is focused on genetic and environmental susceptibility factors as well as individual adaptive potentials.

In this regard, metaontology can be constructed using databases which assist by enriching the latter with a set of possible relationships between concepts pairs in the given document(s). Databases are selected to store the relationships since they are known to make information retrieval and updations swift. This technique significantly improves on the time and scalability factors when compared to existing methods. Relationships stored in the database is further converted into a graph to obtain inter transitive relationships.

Dry matter partitioning contributed to differential heat tolerance of the two cultivars rather than leaf area and total biomass. The major differences between the two cultivars in 24/20 to 30/26 C were that dry matter accumulation and partition was higher to pods in heat-tolerant cv. Haibushi, while to the vegetative parts in heat-sensitive cv. Kentucky Wonder. The dry matter partition to vegetative parts displayed decreasing trend towards maturity in the former while no such trend was found in the latter indicating that the photo-assimilates from the vegetative parts were mobilized to pods in Haibushi while no such translocation occurred in Kentucky Wonder resulting in lower pods dry weight and harvest index. Dry matter partitioning was independent of temperature in heat-tolerant and temperature-dependent in heat-sensitive cultivar. Within temperature regimes, there was no difference in growth rates in Haibushi while in Kentucky Wonder the growth rates in pods dry weight and harvest index differed, significantly higher in 27/23 than 24/20 C. The differences in growth rates contributed to similar variations in pods dry weight and harvest index, which were temperaturedependent in Kentucky Wonder and independent of temperature in Haibushi. The better harvest index achieved in heat-tolerant cultivar was due to a greater\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["458"]}

In this investigation, 2\u03bcg AR grade o-endosulfan/egg (40% of LD50 for embryos) was injected through the CAM in 12-dayold chicken embryos and the activities of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase, EC 3.1. 3.9), fructose 1, 6-diphosphatase (FDPase, EC 3.1. 3.11), adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase, EC 3.6. 1.3) and succinic dehydrogenase (SDH, EC 1.3. 99.1) and DNA and RNA content in liver and brain tissues and acetyl cholinesterase (AChE, EC 3.1. 1.7) in the latter were determined at 24, 48, and 72 h post-exposure. The wet weight of the embryos did not differ between groups. Following endosulfan exposure, except increase in the hepatic ATPase activity (P< 0.01), there was a significant decrease in the following parameters: G6Pase activity in both the liver and brain (P< 0.01), SDH activity in the brain (P< 0.01), brain overall DNA and RNA concentration (P< 0.05), brain AChE activity (P< 0.01).

{"title": "Emission rate modeling and risk assessment at an automobile plant from painting operations\n", "abstract": " Pollution from automobile plants from painting operations has been addressed in the Clean Act Amendments (1990). The estimation of pollutant emissions from automobile painting operation were done mostly by approximate procedures than by actual calculations. The purpose of this study was to develop a methodology for calculating the emissions of the pollutants from painting operation in an automobile plant. Five scenarios involving an automobile painting operation, located in Columbus (Ohio), were studied for pollutant emission and concomitant risk associated with that. In the study of risk, a sensitivity analysis was done using Crystal Ball{reg{underscore}sign} on the parameters involved in risk. This software uses the Monte Carlo principle. The most sensitive factor in the risk analysis was the ground level concentration of the pollutants. All scenarios studied met the safety goal (a risk value of 1 x 10{sup {minus}6}) with different confidence levels. The highest level of confidence in meeting the safety goal was displayed by Scenario 1 (Alpha Industries). The results from the scenarios suggest that risk is associated with the quantity of released toxic pollutants. The sensitivity analysis of the various parameter shows that average spray rate of paint is the most important parameter in the estimation of pollutants from the painting operations. The entire study is a complete module that can be used by the environmental pollution control agencies for estimation of pollution levels and estimation of associated risk. The study can be further extended to other operations in an automobile industry or to different industries.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["458"]}
{"title": "EFFECT OF PH, TEMPERATURE\n", "abstract": " Dunaliella species is known to produce three major products, namely glycerol, B-carotene and protein (Ben-Amotz and Avron 1990). Bc arotene is reported to amount to about 14% of dry weight of the cells (Milko 1963) one of the main reasons for the attraction of mass cultivating Dunaliella for commercial purposes (Ben-Amotz and Avron 1990). The first attempt of mass cultivation of Dunaliella salina is attributed to Massyuk (1966), who proposed commercial exploitation of the alga for \u00df-carotene production. B-carotene is used in health food products, multivitamin pills, erythropoietic protoporphyria (Ziegler 1989), and anticancer-ous treatments (Krinsky 1989).Currently B-carotene rich Dunaliella cells are marketed as capsules or tablets with 3\u20135% of \u00df-carotene and in form of edible oil containing 1.5\u201330% \u00df-ca-rotene.

The screening of these MAb against a wide range of neuronal and non-neuronal cell lines and tissues of diverse origin indicated the presence of oncofoetal, onconeural and widely distributed antigens on human neuroblastoma. Results of cell attachment and complement dependent cytotoxicity assays suggested the expression of cellular oncofoetal and onconeural antigens which might be involved in cell attachment, proliferation and differentiation. The widely distributed antigen showed nuclear localization, and might not be a differentiation related antigen. Preliminary biochemical characterization of these antigens revealed the glycoprotein nature of the oncofoetal and onconeural antigen, and that the widely distributed antigen was a peptide.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["458"]}

FJT bears close resemblance to the wavelet transform technique which is enjoying much attention lately (Science, August 1990). The theory of frames has been shown to subsume the FJ and the wavelet transforms (Heil and Walnut, 1989). It is now widely believed that these new time-frequency techniques may replace the Fourier transform and older time-frequency techniques in some applications in future.

Simple correlation coefficients revealed a positive association of seed yield with secondary branches/plant, siliquas/plant and biological yield, and a negative association with seeds/siliqua. However, only secondary branches/plant and biological yield contributed to seed yield when these correlations were partitioned to direct and indirect effects using modified path coefficient analysis. The effects of seeds/siliqua and siliquas/plant were counterbalanced by osmotic adjustment. Path coefficient analysis also revealed that days to 50% flowering, height of fertility zone, transpirational cooling and turgor potential contributed to plant yield indirectly via one or more main components. Concomitant selection criteria based on all these associated characters would be effective in improving yield per plant.

In a subsequent monsoon season, cultivar PS 116 together with standard check K 851 were tested under field conditions intercropped with pearl millet. The experiment was conducted in drought plots of 30 x 120 cm and 30 x 170 cm crop geometries. Two paired rows of pearl millet at 30 cm spacing accommodated two rows of mungbean in a 120-cm, and three rows of mungbean in a 170-cm open area available in the two crop geometries. The results revealed that mungbean genotype PS 116 had a distinct advantage in the 30 x 120 cm spacing over standard check, K 851. Cultivar PS 116 maintained a higher plant-water potential, stomatal conductance, transpirational cooling, pod density and seed yield than K 851. There were no marked differences for physiological traits or for seed yield between the two cultivars, however, at the 30 x 170 cm spacing.

The behavior in the change of abnormal and binucleate cells was studied at various post-irradiation times. The percentage of abnormal cells increased in both the groups, but it was lesser in the MPG-treated animals and the recovery also took place earlier. A biphasic increase in binucleate cells was observed in the control group, whereas in the MPG-treated animals the percentage increased at earlier intervals only.(author)", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["458"]}

The analogue inhibited growth and heterocyst differentiation at a concentration as low as 1 \u03bcM. The treated algal cells lacked conspicuous granular inclusions, whereas treatment with chloramphenicol led to increased synthesis of granules (probably cyanophycin granules). Exogenously added arginine completely reversed the effect of the analogue but lysine could only partially relieve the effect. A time course study with canavanine indicated inhibition of fresh protein(s) synthesis at all steps where a new class of proteins is synthesized so that the action of the analogue does not seem to be specific for a particular kind of protein. A mutant resistant to this analogue has been successfully isolated indicating that this alga does not show mutational immunity at\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["458"]}

In 27.9% of the population, the diphtheria antitoxin level (lU/ml) varied between 0.02 and 0.22, in 25.2% between 0.22 and 0.44 and 43.5% contained more than 0.44; only 3.4% population contained less than 0.02 of the antitoxin. Significant differences were found between indirect haemagglutination (IHA) and neutralization neutralization Subject Category: Miscellaneoussee more details titres. Therefore, the need for calculating the correlation constant between IHA and neutralizing titres has been emphasised. As 97% of the population tested showed an antitoxin titre of more than 0.02 IU/ml, the present conditions do not warrant the preparation of a special adult type of diphtheria vaccine.
