The broadest way in which we can define them is' to denote one set of forces as technical factors expressed through production functions and the other set as market factors expressed through allocation functions. Though technical factors influence production, it is widely recognised that there are various alternative technical combinations in any economy and under different market situations different combinations are actually taken up. An input-output matrix then represents an equilibrium solution for two sets of equations somewhat analogous to demand and supply functions.", "num_citations": "1007\n", "authors": ["1163"]}

Manipulating or introducing an auto-reproducing predator into the ecosystem may provide sustained biological control of pest populations. The selection of a biological agent should be based on its selfreplicating capacity, preference for the target pest population in the presence of alternate natural prey, adaptability to the introduced environment, and overall interaction with indigenous organisms. In order to achieve an acceptable range of control, a sound knowledge of various attributes of interactions between the pest population and the predator to be introduced is desirable. Biological larviciding for the control of mosquito borne diseases is feasible and effective only when breeding sites are relatively few or are easily identified and treated. Larval control appears to be promising in urban areas, given that the density of humans needing protection is higher than the limited number of breeding sites. Since 1937, fish have been employed for controlling mosquito larvae. Different types of fish have been used so far in this operational technique. However, use of fish of indigenous origin is found to be more appropriate in this operation.

Increasing evidence showing that dysfunction of the vascular endothelium, the inner lining of the blood vessels, is the key player in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. In this review, we aimed to summarize the roles and the underlying mechanisms using the evidence collected from clinical and experimental studies about free fatty acid-mediated endothelial dysfunction. Because of the multifaceted roles of plasma free fatty acids in mediating endothelial dysfunction, elevated free fatty acid level is now considered as an important link in the onset of endothelial dysfunction due to metabolic syndromes such as diabetes and obesity. Free fatty acid-mediated endothelial dysfunction involves several mechanisms including impaired insulin signaling and nitric oxide production, oxidative stress, inflammation and the activation of the renin-angiotensin system and apoptosis in the endothelial cells. Therefore, targeting the signaling pathways involved in free fatty acid-induced endothelial dysfunction could serve as a preventive approach to protect against the occurrence of endothelial dysfunction and the subsequent complications such as atherosclerosis.", "num_citations": "203\n", "authors": ["1163"]}

Although the purchase and sale of private data has already begun on a large scale, a theory of privacy as a commodity is missing. In this paper, we propose to build such a theory.

The analyst wishes to obtain an accurate estimate cheaply, while the owners of the private data experience some cost for their loss of privacy, and must be compensated for this loss. Agents are selfish, and wish to maximize their profit, so our goal is to design truthful mechanisms.

Accurately estimating the slowdown of each application has several benefits: e.g., it can enable shared resource allocation in a manner that avoids unfair application slowdowns or provides slowdown guarantees. Unfortunately, prior works on estimating slowdowns either lead to inaccurate estimates, do not take into account shared caches, or rely on a priori application knowledge. This severely limits their applicability. In this work, we propose the Application Slowdown Model (ASM), a new technique that accurately estimates application slowdowns due to interference at both the shared cache and main memory, in the absence of a priori application knowledge.

Solanum villosum is a common weed distributed in many parts of India with medicinal properties, but the larvicidal activity of this plant has not been reported so far. Aqueous and polar/non-polar solvent extract of fresh, mature, green berries of S. villosum was tested against Stegomyia aegypti, a common vector of dengue fever.

The problem is particularly difficult because the space of choices is infinite. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new algorithm compared to related active learning methods.

The analysis is based on the input-output table for 1948 which was prepared at the Department of Applied Economics [14], reproduced in table B. 1, and its form is largely of the generalised multiplier variety made familiar by Leontief. The utility of a model in which the interactions between the component industries of the productive process are set out in detail rather than being lost in an aggregate called total production hardly needs emphasis. But the difficulties of building such a model are considerable. In this monograph the analysis is restricted to the interactions of current flows and no attempt is made to develop the theoretical framework beyond the point at which data cease to be available without a major new enquiry. But within this restricted field, an attempt is made to develop the tra-ditional approach in as flexible a way as possible. The idea behind this is that an input-output table is the best starting point for the generalanalysis of production but that care is needed to avoid the dangers of a rigid theoretical model. We have tried to show that a flexible theoretical framework is preferable to a rigid one for a practical application of input-output models. Only thus can we hope to move towards our ideal of a model which is manageable and at the same time capable of representing some important features of the real world, and thus help to bring the facts and theories of the productive process closer together.", "num_citations": "142\n", "authors": ["1163"]}

Further, our analysis reveals that the peak data rate does not depend on the base station density and transmit powers; this strongly motivates other approaches e.g. CA to increase the peak data rate.

{"title": "Coverage and connectivity issues in wireless sensor networks\n", "abstract": " Wireless sensor networks [33, 34] have inspired tremendous research interest in since the mid-1990s. Advancement in wireless communication and microelectromechanical systems (MEMSs) have enabled the development of low-cost, lowpower, multifunctional, tiny sensor nodes that can sense the environment, perform data processing, and communicate with each other untethered over short distances. A typical wireless sensor network consists of thousands of sensor nodes, deployed either randomly or according to some predefined statistical distribution, over a geographic region of interest. A sensor node by itself has severe resource constraints, such as low battery power, limited signal processing, limited computation and communication capabilities, and a small amount of memory; hence it can sense only a limited portion of the environment. However, when a group of sensor nodes collaborate with each other, they can accomplish a much bigger task efficiently. One of the primary advantages of deploying a wireless sensor network is its low deployment cost and freedom from requiring a messy wired communication backbone, which is often infeasible or economically inconvenient. Wireless sensor networks ensure a wide range of applications [2], starting from security surveillance in military and battlefields, monitoring previously unobserved environmental phenomena, smart homes and offices, improved healthcare, industrial diagnosis, and many more. For instance, a sensor network can be deployed in a remote island for monitoring wildlife habitat and animal behavior [25], or near the crater of a volcano to measure temperature, pressure\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "114\n", "authors": ["1163"]}

The Gd (n, r) has been of great interest due to its success as a model for ad-hoc wireless networks. It is well known that the connectivity of Gd (n, r) exhibits a threshold property: there exists a constant \u03b1d such that for any \u03f5> 0, for rd< \u03b1d (1\u2212 \u03f5) log n/n the Gd (n, r) is not connected with high probability1 and for rd> \u03b1d (1+ \u03f5) log n/n the Gd (n, r) is connected whp. In this paper, we study mixing properties of random walks on Gd (n, r) for rd (n)= \u03c9 (log n/n). Specifically, we study the scaling of mixing times of the fastest-mixing reversible random walk, and the natural random walk. We find that the mixing time of both of these random walks have the same scaling laws and scale proportional to r\u2212 2 (for all d). These results hold for Gd (n, r) when distance is defined using any Lp norm. Though the results of this paper are not so surprising, they are nontrivial and require new methods.To obtain the scaling law for the fastest-mixing reversible random walk, we first explicitly characterize the fastest-mixing reversible random walk on a regular (grid-type) graph in d dimensions. We subsequently use this to bound the mixing time of the fastest-mixing random walk on Gd (n, r). In the course of our analysis, we obtain a tight relation between the mixing time of the fastest-mixing symmetric random walk and the fastest-mixing reversible random walk with a specified equilibrium distribution on an arbitrary graph.", "num_citations": "107\n", "authors": ["1163"]}

We derive an orthonormal basis over spherical zones that is ideally suited for this task. BRDF values outside the zonal directions are extrapolated by re-projecting the zonal measurements into a spherical harmonics basis, or by fitting analytical reflection models to the data.

The most commonly used measure of joint roughness in rock engineering practice is the joint roughness coefficient (JRC), proposed by Barton [1] and adopted by the International Society for Rock Mechanics [2].

The azimuthal opening angle is also measured as a function of the invariant mass of the  system. The measured differential cross-sections are compared to predictions by several NLO Monte Carlo generators and fixed-order calculations. The observed degree of spin correlation is somewhat higher than predicted by the generators used. The data are consistent with the prediction of one of the fixed-order calculations at NLO, but agree less well with higher-order predictions.

In this paper, we describe a novel high speed approach for the acquisition of bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs). We develop a new theory for directly measuring BRDFs in a basis representation by projecting incident light as a sequence of basis functions from a spherical zone of directions. We derive an orthonormal basis over spherical zones that is ideally suited for this task. BRDF values outside the zonal directions are extrapolated by re-projecting the zonal measurements into a spherical harmonics basis, or by fitting analytical reflection models to the data. For specular materials, we experiment with alternative basis acquisition approaches such as compressive sensing with a random subset of the higher order orthonormal zonal basis functions, as\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "58\n", "authors": ["1163"]}

Frequently, applying a symmetry breaking field stabilizes excitations whose properties reflect certain aspects of the anomalous state without LRO.

We demonstrate that free entry in an industry producing a homogeneous final product leads to a socially insufficient number of firms when the suppliers of the intermediate products have sufficiently strong bargaining power. This is in contrast to previous findings in the theoretical industrial organization literature, which demonstrate that in homogeneous final-product markets with Cournot oligopoly and fixed set-up costs, level of entry in the free-entry equilibrium is always socially excessive.

An advantage of theoretically based equations of state is that the theory can be systematically improved to address weaknesses or to extend the theory to more complex fluid systems. Recent developments beyond SAFT allow us to predict the effects of multiple polar groups on the phase behavior of polar copolymers, model the effects of intramolecular association, and efficiently calculate phase equilibrium for polydisperse polymer solutions.

This search focuses on a topology in which one long-lived particle decays in the ATLAS inner detector and the other decays in the muon spectrometer. Special techniques are employed to reconstruct the displaced tracks and vertices in the inner detector and in the muon spectrometer. One event is observed that passes the full event selection, which is consistent with the estimated background. Limits are placed on scalar boson propagators with masses from 125 GeV to 1000 GeV decaying into pairs of long-lived hidden-sector scalars with masses from 8 GeV to 400 GeV.

This book argues that many recent efforts to theorise interculturality restrict themselves to a variety of interpretations within a Western framework of knowledge, which does not necessarily account for the epistemological diversity of the world. The book suggests an alternative definition of interculturality, framed not in terms of cultural differences, but in terms of colonial difference. It brings analysis of the Latin American concept of interculturalidad into the picture and explores the possibility of decentring the discourse of interculturality and its Eurocentric outlook, seeing interculturality as inter-epistemic rather than simply inter-cultural.

When applied to network trafic, these laws imply the following 80-20 rule: 80% of the work is brought by 20% of the flows; in particular, 80% of Internet packets are generated by 20% of the flows. Heavy advantage could be taken of such a statistic if we could identify the packets of these dominant flows with minimal overhead. This motivates us to develop SIFT, a simple randomized algorithm for indentifying the packets of large flows. SIFT is based on the inspection paradox: A low-bias coin will quite likely choose a packet from a large flow while simultaneously missing the packets of small flows.We describe the basic algorithm and some variations. We then list some uses of SIFT that we are currently exploring, and focus on one particular use in this paper\u2014a mechanism for allowing a router to differentially allocate link bandwidth and buffer space to large and small flows. We compare SIFT\u2019s performance with the current practice in Internet routers via ns simulations.

Effects of varying the concentration of electron donor and acceptor molecules such as tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) and tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) on SG produced by mechanical exfoliation as well as by the reduction of single-layer graphene oxide have been investigated. TTF softens the G-band in the Raman spectrum, whereas TCNE stiffens the G-band. The full-width-at-half-maximum of the G-band increases on interaction with both TTF and TCNE. These effects are similar to those found with few-layer graphene, but in contrast to those found with electrochemical doping. A common feature between the two types of doping is found in the case of the 2-D band, which shows softening and stiffening on electron and hole\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "41\n", "authors": ["1163"]}

At 550\u00a0\u00b0C temperature extensive \u025b-Cu precipitates have been observed. The increased strength value retained in the temperature range of 450\u2013600\u00a0\u00b0C and a secondary hardening peak obtained at 600\u00a0\u00b0C is probably due to the formation of fine Mo carbide precipitates. The decrease in strength at 650\u00a0\u00b0C along with an increase in percentage elongation, percentage reduction in area and toughness is due to the coarsening of Cu particles and a partial recovery of matrix.

{"title": "A rate adaptation algorithm for tile-based 360-degree video streaming\n", "abstract": " In the 360-degree immersive video, a user only views a part of the entire raw video frame based on her viewing direction. However, today's 360-degree video players always fetch the entire panoramic view regardless of users' head movement, leading to significant bandwidth waste that can be potentially avoided. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive streaming scheme for 360-degree videos. The basic idea is to fetch the invisible portion of a video at the lowest quality based on users' head movement prediction and to adaptively decide the video playback quality for the visible portion based on bandwidth prediction. Doing both in a robust manner requires overcome a series of challenges, such as jointly considering the spatial and temporal domains, tolerating prediction errors, and achieving low complexity. To overcome these challenges, we first define quality of experience (QoE) metrics for adaptive 360-degree video streaming. We then formulate an optimization problem and solve it at a low complexity. The algorithm strategically leverages both future bandwidth and the distribution of users' head positions to determine the quality level of each tile (i.e., a sub-area of a raw frame). We further provide theoretical proof showing that our algorithm achieves optimality under practical assumptions. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms significantly boost the user QoE by at least 20\\% compared to baseline algorithms.", "num_citations": "40\n", "authors": ["1163"]}

The 3-D CBTC technique proposed by Bahramgiri  et   al.  [7] has a complexity of  O  ( d   3  log  d ), where  d  represents the average number of neighbors per node. We present two efficient alternatives. The first is a heuristic based on 2-D orthographic projections that provides excellent performance in practice, but is theoretically not guaranteed to produce a connected network. The second is a more rigorous approach based on spherical Delaunay triangulation (SDT). Both have significantly better running times that scale as O ( d  log  d ).

{"title": "Inferential privacy guarantees for differentially private mechanisms\n", "abstract": " The correlations and network structure amongst individuals in datasets today---whether explicitly articulated, or deduced from biological or behavioral connections---pose new issues around privacy guarantees, because of inferences that can be made about one individual from another's data. This motivates quantifying privacy in networked contexts in terms of \"inferential privacy\"---which measures the change in beliefs about an individual's data from the result of a computation---as originally proposed by Dalenius in the 1970's. Inferential privacy is implied by differential privacy when data are independent, but can be much worse when data are correlated; indeed, simple examples, as well as a general impossibility theorem of Dwork and Naor, preclude the possibility of achieving non-trivial inferential privacy when the adversary can have arbitrary auxiliary information. In this paper, we ask how differential privacy guarantees translate to guarantees on inferential privacy in networked contexts: specifically, under what limitations on the adversary's information about correlations, modeled as a prior distribution over datasets, can we deduce an inferential guarantee from a differential one? We prove two main results. The first result pertains to distributions that satisfy a natural positive-affiliation condition, and gives an upper bound on the inferential privacy guarantee for any differentially private mechanism. This upper bound is matched by a simple mechanism that adds Laplace noise to the sum of the data. The second result pertains to distributions that have weak correlations, defined in terms of a suitable \"influence matrix\".

The most important vectors of B. malayi, in the endemic countries of South-east Asia, are different Mansonia species in the subgenus Mansonioides. The vectors of the parasite causing brugian filariasis in the Western Pacific and South-east Asian regions were reviewed by Chow in 1973 and Ramaliangam in 1975, while Ma. annulifera was reported by Iyengar in 1938, as an agent for transmission of B. malayi in Travancore, India.It has been observed that many species of mosquitoes, particularly under subgenus Mansonioides prefer habitats with well-developed beds of submerged, floating-leaf or emergent aquatic macrophytes because the vegetated regions protect them from physical disturbances and provide mechanical support and favorable conditions for oviposition. Unlike other mosquitoes, the larvae and pupae of Mansonia must attach their breathing tubes to the underwater roots, stems, or leaves of floating aquatic plants if they are to survive (Rajendran et al. 1989). Removal of such plants via mechanical, biological, or chemical control would therefore effectively prevent development of Mansonia.

To provide acceptable end-to-end performance in such a network, it is important to monitor the Quality of Experience (QoE) of the user, since the inherent variability in the wireless channel can undermine the video quality significantly. In this context, this paper undertakes a simulation study to evaluate the user's QoE (using PSNR as the representative metric) when video is streamed from a source to a Mobile Station (MS) via a WiMAX Base Station (BS). The WiMAX Forum's ns-2 simulator is used to carry out all the simulations. In particular, we explore the impact of the following parameters, namely, (1) the reserved rate at the BS for the video stream, (2) the Modulation and Coding Scheme employed, (3) the distance between BS and MS, and (4\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "32\n", "authors": ["1163"]}

Human expertise on stylistics and aesthetics of poetry is generally expensive and scarce. In this work, we delve into the data to automatically extract stylistic and linguistic information which are useful for analysis and comparison of poems. We make use of semantic (word) features to perform subject-based classification of Bangla poems, and various stylistic as well as semantic features for poet identification. We have used a Multiclass SVM classifier to classify Tagore\u2019s collection of poetry into four categories: devotional, love, nature and nationalism. We identified the most useful word features for each category of poems. The overall accuracy of the classifier was 56.8%, and the analysis led us to conclude that for poetry classification, word features alone do not suffice, due to allusions often being used as a poetic device. We, next, used these features along with stylistic features (syntactic, orthographic and phonemic), for poet identification on a dataset of poems from four poets and achieved a performance of 92.3% using a Multiclass SVM classifier. While contentbased and stylometric analysis of prose in Bangla has been done in the past, this is a first such attempt for poetry.", "num_citations": "31\n", "authors": ["1163"]}

A multidisciplinary study involving sedimentology, micropalaeontology (benthic foraminifers and ostracods), geochemistry (major, minor and trace elements) and radiocarbon dating (14C) on a 40m-long core (240-S5) retrieved inland of the Holocene beach ridges, allowed the reconstruction of articulate coastal scenarios and dynamics-including stages of drainage reorganization. An alluvial plain nourished by the Apenninic Savio River developed in response to low sea-level conditions during the last glacial period. During the first stages of deglaciation (Lateglacial period) the study area was flooded and a coastal plain evolved near the coeval lagoon basin. Subtle change in microfossil content documents the occurrence of a short-term progradational episode that led to the temporary establishment of more terrestrial conditions (likely attributed to the Younger Dryas event-ca. 12,500 cal years BP). Complex and unstable Lateglacial palaeoenvironmental scenarios, and a mixed contribution from two Apenninic rivers (Savio River and Fiumi Uniti system), are suggested by the geochemical composition of coastal sediments. A distinctive flooding event, possibly related to the MWP-1B, caused the abrupt replacement of the coastal plain by a barrier-lagoon system. This landward shift of facies was synchronous with a source area change from the Savio River to the Fiumi Uniti\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "31\n", "authors": ["1163"]}

Ranking of individual predatory efficacy showed the sequence: P. tropheops > B. splendens > O. gorami > P. scalare against larva/form and B. splendens > O. gorami > P. tropheops > P. scalare against pupal form of Anopheles stephensi during 24 hours experiment in laboratory condition. Predation under co-existence in interspecific and intraspecific combinations revealed the significance of predatory efficacy with reference to prey density and water volume (search area).", "num_citations": "27\n", "authors": ["1163"]}
{"title": "Kinetic control of tunable multi-state switching in ferroelectric thin films\n", "abstract": " Deterministic creation of multiple ferroelectric states with intermediate values of polarization remains challenging due to the inherent bi-stability of ferroelectric switching. Here we show the ability to select any desired intermediate polarization value via control of the switching pathway in (111)-oriented PbZr 0.2 Ti 0.8 O 3 films. Such switching phenomena are driven by kinetic control of the volume fraction of two geometrically different domain structures which are generated by two distinct switching pathways: one direct, bipolar-like switching and another multi-step switching process with the formation of a thermodynamically-stable intermediate twinning structure. Such control of switching pathways is enabled by the competition between elastic and electrostatic energies which favors different types of ferroelastic switching that can occur. Overall, our work demonstrates an alternative approach that transcends the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "27\n", "authors": ["1163"]}
{"title": "Effectiveness, safety and tolerability of cyclosporine versus supportive treatment in Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis: a record-based study\n", "abstract": " Background: Toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome comprise life\u2011threatening, drug\u2011induced mucocutaneous disease spectrum. Interest in cyclosporine, a calcineurin inhibitor that can block the function of T\u2011cells, has increased with the discovery of the importance of granulysin in apoptosis in toxic epidermal necrolysis. In our hospital, cyclosporine is given to Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis patients as an adjunctive therapy.Aims: This study is an observational, record\u2011based study comparing the effectiveness and safety of patients receiving cyclosporine versus only supportive therapy.Methodology: Medical records as bed\u2011head tickets and laboratory investigation reports of Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis patients admitted in the hospital over a period of 1 year were collected. Data regarding clinico\u2011demographic profile, suspected drug causing Stevens\u2013Johnson\u2019s syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, SCORTEN, body surface area involved, treatment received and outcome were obtained. Results: Twenty\u2011eight patients were analyzed. Nineteen belonged to the cyclosporine group (supportive treatment+ cyclosporine), nine to supportive treatment only group. Among the suspected drugs, antiepileptics formed the major group (28.6%). Five patients in the supportive only group and one in the cyclosporine group died. Time for stabilization and reepithelialization and duration of recovery were significantly lower in the cyclosporine group (P< 0.001, P= 0.007, P= 0.01, respectively). The standardized mortality ratio was 0.32 in cyclosporine group which is nearly 3.3 times lower than the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "27\n", "authors": ["1163"]}
{"title": "Contextual rnn-gans for abstract reasoning diagram generation\n", "abstract": " Understanding, predicting, and generating object motions and transformations is a core problem in artificial intelligence. Modeling sequences of evolving images may provide better representations and models of motion and may ultimately be used for forecasting, simulation, or video generation. Diagrammatic Abstract Reasoning is an avenue in which diagrams evolve in complex patterns and one needs to infer the underlying pattern sequence and generate the next image in the sequence. For this, we develop a novel Contextual Generative Adversarial Network based on Recurrent Neural Networks (Context-RNN-GANs), where both the generator and the discriminator modules are based on contextual history (modeled as RNNs) and the adversarial discriminator guides the generator to produce realistic images for the particular time step in the image sequence. We evaluate the Context-RNN-GAN model (and its variants) on a novel dataset of Diagrammatic Abstract Reasoning, where it performs competitively with 10th-grade human performance but there is still scope for interesting improvements as compared to college-grade human performance. We also evaluate our model on a standard video next-frame prediction task, achieving improved performance over comparable state-of-the-art.", "num_citations": "27\n", "authors": ["1163"]}
{"title": "A survey-based assessment of the prevalence and severity of chronic hand dermatitis in a managed care organization\n", "abstract": " MethodsA 13-item questionnaire was developed by a clinical dermatology professor (JFF) to measure the signs and symptoms of chronic hand dermatitis, location of affected skin, use of prescription and over-thecounter medications, duration and temporality of symptoms, and differential diagnoses. The questionnaire was designed to be self-administered by members. Chronic hand dermatitis was diagnosed and its severity was graded (mild to moderate, moderate, moderate to severe, severe) based on predefined clinical algorithms.The clinical questionnaire was part of a larger 14-page survey with 102 items and sections relating to over-the-counter drug use, quality of life, work productivity, sociodemographics, and general health status as measured by the Medical Outcomes Study 8-Item Short Form Health Survey. 30 This article focuses on the clinical questionnaire of the survey and how the results were used to identify and grade the severity of chronic hand dermatitis. The questionnaire was validated in a dermatology practice in Louisville, Kentucky, with 40 randomly selected adult patients (mean age, 46.60\ue036 14.81 years; 30%[12] men) during their clinic visits between November 19, 2003, and December 2, 2003.

{"title": "Finite difference solution for circular plates on elastic foundations\n", "abstract": " In the present work the authors have developed a finite difference method of analysis for any circular plate with any kind of loading on semi\u2010infinite elastic foundations. No assumption regarding the contact pressure distribution has been made. The equations have been developed in non\u2010dimensional form and also the results have been obtained in non\u2010dimensional form. These results have been compared with the available experimental results and the agreement between them is found to be much better than that of the previous works. The same method with slight modification can be applied for Winkler type foundations and problems of circular plates with varying thickness.", "num_citations": "27\n", "authors": ["1163"]}
{"title": "Lattice statics and dynamics of the NaF crystal\n", "abstract": " The present work is an attempt to unify the lattice statics and dynamics of an alkali halide crystal through a phenomenological approach. A particular variant of the shell model, namely the deformable shell model has been chosen for the purpose. The different lattice static and dynamic properties of the NaF crystal have been calculated on the model, the same set of parameters being used throughout. The results of the calculation are compared with experiment and the possible source of improvement is suggested. In view of the limited number of parameters used and the drastic approximation introduced in the calculation of certain properties, the overall agreement seems to be quite encouraging and gives some confidence in this approach of considering an alkali halide crystal in all its entirety.", "num_citations": "27\n", "authors": ["1163"]}

{"title": "Investigation on improved performance of Erbium doped TiO2 nanowire based UV detector\n", "abstract": " Undoped TiO2 and Erbium doped TiO2 nanowires (Er:TiO2 NWs) were synthesized on respective thin films using e-beam cum glancing angle deposition technique onto n-type silicon substrates. The length of the NWs was \u223c182\u202fnm as calculated from field emission gun scanning electron microscopy images. Transmission electron microscopy showed an average NW length of 173\u202fnm. Polycrystalline nature of both samples was obtained from the selected area electron diffraction analysis as well as from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and variation in the grain size (calculated from XRD) confirmed the doping of Erbium in case of Er:TiO2 NWs. Increased absorption, as well as enhanced bandgap, was observed for Er:TiO2 NWs compared to the undoped TiO2 NWs. Superior device performance in terms of detectivity, sensitivity and photoswitching was obtained for Er:TiO2\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "26\n", "authors": ["1163"]}
