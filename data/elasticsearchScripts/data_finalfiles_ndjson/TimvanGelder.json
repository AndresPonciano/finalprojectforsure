{"title": "Mind as motion: Explorations in the dynamics of cognition\n", "abstract": " Mind as Motion is the first comprehensive presentation of the dynamical approach to cognition. It contains a representative sampling of original, current research on topics such as perception, motor control, speech and language, decision making, and development. Included are chapters by pioneers of the approach, as well as others applying the tools of dynamics to a wide range of new problems. Throughout, particular attention is paid to the philosophical foundations of this radical new research program. Cognitive science has traditionally been dominated by an AI-based computational paradigm in which cognition is taken to be the manipulation of internal symbols. Even as the potential of this paradigm continues to be explored, limitations are becoming increasingly apparent. Researchers throughout cognitive science have been casting around for alternative theoretical frameworks. Out of this flux has emerged the dynamical concept, according to which cognitive processes are the behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems and are best studied using the mathematics of dynamical modeling and dynamical systems theory. Mind as Motion provides a conceptual and historical overview of the dynamical approach, a tutorial introduction to dynamics for cognitive scientists, and a glossary covering the most frequently used terms. Each chapter includes an introduction by the editors, outlining its main ideas and placing it in context, and a guide to further reading.

This target article attempts to articulate and support the dynamical hypothesis. The dynamical hypothesis has two major components: the nature hypothesis (cognitive agents are dynamical systems) and the knowledge hypothesis (cognitive agents can be understood dynamically). A wide range of objections to this hypothesis can be rebutted. The conclusion is that cognitive systems may well be dynamical systems, and only sustained empirical research in cognitive science will determine the extent to which that is true.", "num_citations": "1256\n", "authors": ["2092"]}
{"title": "It\u2019s about time: An overview of the dynamical approach to cognition\n", "abstract": " How do we do what we do? How do we play tennis, have conversations, go shopping? At a finer grain, how do we recognize familiar objects such as bouncing balls, words, smiles, faces, jokes? Carry out actions such as returning a serve, pronouncing a word, selecting a book off the shelf? Cognitive scientists are interested in explaining how these kinds of extraordinarily sophisticated behaviors come about. They aim to describe cognition: the underlying mechanisms, states, and processes.For decades, cognitive science has been dominated by one broad approach. That approach takes cognition to be the operation of a special mental computer, located in the brain. Sensory organs deliver up to the mental computer representations of the state of its environment. The system computes a specification of an appropriate action. The body carries this action out. According to this approach, when I return a serve in tennis, what happens is roughly as follows. Light from the approaching ball strikes my retina and my brain's visual mechanisms quickly compute what is being seen (a ball) and its direction and rate of approach. This information is fed to a planning system which holds representations of my current goals (win the game, return the serve, etc.) and other background knowledge (court conditions, weaknesses of the other player, etc.). The planning system then infers what I must do: hit the ball deep into my opponent's backhand. This command is issued to the motor system. My arms and legs move as required. In its most familiar and successful applications, the computational approach makes a series of further assumptions.

This is not consciousness of Time itself, nor is it simply consciousness that takes place in time. Rather, to put the point somewhat cryptically, it is consciousness of temporal objects as temporal. A temporal object is anything that exists in time, or endures. Rocks, chairs, conversations, tides, tunes, and empires all endure. In this respect they contrast with, for example, numbers. Time consciousness is a special kind of awareness of temporal objects-an awareness of them as enduring. It is the difference between my thinking abstractly of Nirvana's\" Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" and my hearing it play on the radio. In the latter case, though not the former, the song actually unfolds in time and my awareness is an awareness of it as happening in time. The situation is essentially similar (though less dramatic) in the case of temporal objects such as chairs, which do not depend on change in time to be what they are.[2] A moment's reflection can generate an interesting puzzle about time consciousness. Both the song and my awareness exist in time. They are like parallel tracks in the same time frame. However, as we standardly think about time, only the present and what is in it actually exist; thus, only a momentary stage of the song, and a momentary stage of my awareness, actually exist at any given time. The other stages did exist, or will exist, but do not exist now. It seems plausible, then, that my awareness at this moment of the music must be an awareness of the song now, ie, of the current, momentary stage of the stage. The other stages do not exist, so how could I be aware\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "138\n", "authors": ["2092"]}
{"title": "On being systematically connectionist\n", "abstract": " In 1988 Fodor and Pylyshyn issued a challenge to the newly-popular connectionism: explain the systematicity of cognition without merely implementing a so-called classical architecture. Since that time quite a number of connectionist models have been put forward, either by their designers or by others, as in some measure demonstrating that the challenge can be met (eg, Pollack, 1988, 1990; Smolensky, 1990; Chalmers, 1990; Niklasson and Sharkey, 1992; Brousse, 1993). Unfortunately, it has generally been unclear whether these models actually do have this implication (see, for instance, the extensive philosophical debate in Smolensky, 1988; Fodor and McLaughlin, 1990; van Gelder, 1990, 1991; McLaughlin, 1993a, 1993b; Clark, 1993). Indeed, we know of no major supporter of classical orthodoxy who has felt compelled, by connectionist models and arguments, to concede in print that connectionists have in fact delivered a non-classical explanation of systematicity.Why has it been so unclear whether these models actually show that connectionism meets the challenge? Our view (apparently shared by Matthews,(forthcoming)) is that the most important reason has been obscurity in the concept of systematicity itself. In their 1988 paper Fodor and Pylyshyn discussed systematicity at length, but provided no succinct and precise characterization of it; at best, they gestured at the phenomenon with hints, analogies and anecdotal observations. They claimed that the systematicity argument in favor of the classical approach is a traditional one, but provided no references to previous occurrences, and as far as we can determine there is no occurrence\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "133\n", "authors": ["2092"]}

{"title": "Learning to reason: A Reason! Able approach\n", "abstract": " 1. BackgroundInformal reasoning is negotiating the webs of inferential dependence among sentences of a natural language. It contrasts with formal reasoning, of the kind found in mathematics, computer science, puzzles, and games such as chess. Informal reasoning involves activities such as distinguishing principal claims from the reasons or evidence provided in their support; supporting claims with reasons; evaluating the quality of reasons; challenging reasons, and rebutting challenges; and evaluating the overall case for a claim. Informal reasoning is closely related to informal logic (which tends to focus attention narrowly on the claim/reason relation) and argumentation (the deployment of informal reasoning in attempts to resolve disputes). Informal reasoning is a central component of critical thinking.How good are people are informal reasoning? US studies indicate that although some are quite good at it, average levels are quite poor [13, 27]. For example, in the most thorough study of this topic, Kuhn found that a majority of the population cannot reliably produce genuine evidence for their opinions, entertain counterarguments, or rebut counterarguments. I have not found comparable studies in an Australian context, but it is plausible they would give broadly similar results. This is supported by experience in teaching. For example, I gave 95 University of Melbourne undergraduates a homework exercise in which they were asked to\" analyse and evaluate the main argument\" of a particular book chapter.

There are plausible ways of rendering more precise the systematicity hypothesis (as standardly formulated) in which it is entailed by classical architectures, and other plausible ways in which it is not. Therefore, it is not a determinate issue whether systematicity is entailed, and hence explained, by classical architectures. The general argument is illustrated in a particular domain, the systematicity of deductive inference. In the case of the capacity to carry out the inference modus tollens, the systematicity hypothesis can be made precise in two ways, one entailed by classical architectures, another which is not. Further, the latter, but not the former, accurately describes the actual empirical phenomenon.

Computationalists could thus always fall back on what has become known as the\" what else could it be?\" argument. In recent years, however, this strategic advantage has been diminished, if not eliminated. Within cognitive science an alternative vision of the nature of cognition is emerging, a worthy challenger to computational incumbency. That alternative is not, as many have supposed, connectionism (as such), but rather the dynamical conception of cognition. In a nutshell, if cognition is not computation, it might be the behavior of dynamical systems. This chapter aims to provide an informal introduc-tion to the dynamical conception.

Both contain the same words, but in the printed sentence they are static ink configurations, while in the utterance they are temporally extended sound patterns. In the printed case, words are combined by juxtaposition in space; in the utterance, by juxtaposition in time. The printed words are combined in a very discrete way-there is, quite literally, space between each-and all occurrences of a given word are effectively identical, whatever words happen to surround them. In the utterance, by contrast, juxtaposition is not discrete and context free; words flow into each other, and their physical shape is typically affected by their neighbors. Printed and uttered tokens of the very same sentence, then, are physically constructed or built up in quite different ways. These days, the most common technical term for building up a complex representation out of parts is composition, and so we can say that the two sentences exhibit very different kinds of compositionality, despite being syntactically and semantically identical4. This point has two very important consequences. First, compositionality itself comes in at least two, and possibly many, different kinds. Second, the very notion of compositionality can be a subject of study, quite independent of syntax and semantics. Whereas syntax and semantics focus on a language in the abstract, the study of compositionality focuses on the concrete implementations. How many kinds of compositionality are there?

{"title": "Why distributed representation is inherently non-symbolic\n", "abstract": " There are many conflicting views concerning the nature of distributed representation, its compatibility or otherwise with symbolic representation, and its importance in characterizing the nature of connectionist models and their relationship to more traditional symbolic approaches to understanding cognition. Many have simply assumed that distribution is merely an implementation issue, and that symbolic mechanisms can be designed to take advantage of the virtues of distribution if so desired. Others, meanwhile, see the use of distributed representation as marking a fundamental difference between the two approaches. One reason for this diversity of opinion is the fact that the relevant notions \u2014 especially that of distribution \u2014 are rarely adequately characterized before addressing the issues. At this level of generality, an adequate characterization is one that is sufficiently abstract to subsume most paradigm\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["2092"]}

Ten years later, it seems that the verdict is in. If we suppose that the term connectionism refers to some reasonably coherent research program standing as an alternative to mainstream computational cognitive science, then connectionism has no interesting implications for cognitive science. This is because there is, in fact, no such thing. There are lots of connectionist models, to be sure, but no coherent program. Much connectionist work has signi\ufb01cance for the philosophy of mind, but not as connectionism. The philosophical question has turned out to be the wrong one. The most signi\ufb01-cant theoretical division in cognitive science is not between computationalists and connectionists. Rather, it is the related but importantly different division between computationalists and dynamicists. Both the computational and dynamical approaches to cognition do, in fact, have many interesting implications for the philosophy of mind.

From studying how schemes fall into this space, it is apparent that there is no single crucial difference between AI and connectionist approaches to representation.

Digital ethnographic methods were used to analyze the chat transcripts of analysts as they reasoned with evidence provided in a difficult, fictional intelligence-type problem and produced a final intelligence report. These chat transcripts provided a powerful \u201cmicroscope\u201d into the reasoning processes and interactions involved in complex, collaborative reasoning. We found that Individuals and teams used narrative to solve the kinds of complex problems organizations and intelligence agencies face daily. We observed that team members generated what we term \u201cmicro-narratives\u201d, which provided a means for testing, assessing and weighing alternative hypotheses through mental simulation in the context of collaborative reasoning. The creation of micro-narratives assisted in the teams\u2019 reasoning with evidence, an integral part of collaborative reasoning and intelligence analysis. Micro-narratives were combined into, and compared with, an ideal or \u2018virtual\u2019 narrative which informed the judgements the team came to in their final intelligence report. The case study developed in this paper provides evidence that narrative thought processes play an important role in complex collaborative problem-solving, reasoning with evidence and problem-solving.

In the spirit of that suggestion, we can think of philosophy of mind as the attempt to say how minds hang together\u2014how things fit to form minds, and how minds fit with other things. It can hardly be disputed that there are these kinds of fit; in that respect, at least, the world is a coherent place. The philosophical challenge is to understand and elucidate the nature of the fit, such as it is.The mind-body debate in contemporary Anglo-American analytic philosophy is one among many discourses addressing this challenge. The mind-body debate reduces the general problem of fit to a very specific question: What is the ontological relationship between mental entities, on the one hand, and physical entities, on the other? It has developed a range of candidate answers to this question. These are the official \u201cisms\u201d familiar to any student of the debate: Cartesian dualism, central-state materialism, functionalism, and so forth.

{"title": "Cognitive architecture: what choice do we have?\n", "abstract": " Centrally located in some of the most fiercely contested terrain in the philosophy of cognitive science are questions of the general form of human cognitive architecture. Mainstream orthodoxy, of course, holds that the human mind is some kind of computer (Haugeland, 1978); the task of cognitive science is simply to work out, in more detail, what kind of computer it is, and in particular what its functional architecture is like (Pylyshyn, 1984). Although a wide variety of considerations favor the socalled classical approach, ranging from abstract philosophical arguments to the empirical virtues of particular cognitive models, there is also a wide variety of difficulties. However, the existence of these difficulties has failed to persuade many to abandon the computational model, and one important reason is the perceived lack of decent alternatives. In what follows, rather than try to describe any specific conception of cognitive architecture that might compete with the classical one, I will briefly sketch some of the terrain so as to reveal some of the great amount of room that there actually is for alternative conceptions. In a recent well-known description and defense of the heart of so-called\" classical\" cognitive architectures, it was maintained that mental representations must be symbolic in the sense that they have a combinatorial syntax and compositional semantics, and that mental processes must be structuresensitive in the sense that they are defined over that combinatorial structure (Fodor & Pylyshyn, 1988).

{"title": "What makes a team successful\n", "abstract": " The SWARM project is part of CREATE, a multi-year program launched by IARPA to develop and test online systems to improve collaborative analysis of \u2018intelligence-style\u2019problems. SWARM supports a novel approach in which people share different takes on a problem and then select and further develop the most promising ones. SWARM was tested in the \u20182018 Challenge\u2019, a crowd-sourcing exercise in which 24 online teams tackled four difficult problems. In this paper we investigate user roles, team dynamics and their relation to performance. We find that successful teams create an interactive, supportive, resourceful and large enough environment in which the author of the final report can thrive in a very active role. Less successful teams on the other hand fail to build up the necessary support and exchange, leaving the final report author to struggle in an isolated role. The SWARM project gives an excellent opportunity to study user roles and team structures in the context of crowd-sourced intelligence-style reasoning. Based on the results we give design recommendations to improve performance.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2092"]}

{"title": "\" Heads I win, tails you lose\": A Foray Into the Psychology of Philosophy\n", "abstract": " One of the classic papers of Australian feminist philosophy is G. Lloyd's\" The Man of Reason\"(Lloyd, 1979). The main concern of this paper is the alleged maleness of the Man of Reason, ie, the thesis that our philosophical tradition in some deep way associates the concepts rational and male. Lloyd claims that her main goal is to bring this\" undoubted\" thesis\" into clearer focus\"(p. 18), and indeed she makes no strenuous effort to demonstrate that the to-be-clarified thesis is actually true. There are however a few places where she advances material she seems to be taking as some kind of evidence that the Man of Reason is male. One is on the second page, where she quotes from Augustine:And finally we see man, made in your image and likeness, ruling over all the irrational animals for the very reason that he was made in your image and resembles you, that is because he has the power of reason and understanding. And just as in man's soul there are two forces; on which is dominant because it deliberates and one which obeys because it is subject to such guidance, in the same way in the physical sense, woman has been made for man. In her mind and her rational intelligence she has a nature the equal of man's, but in sex she is physically subject to him in the same way as our natural impulses need to be subjected to the reasoning power of the mind, in order that the actions to which they lead may be inspired by the principles of good conduct.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2092"]}
{"title": "Defending the dynamic hypothesis\n", "abstract": " Cognitive science has always been dominated by the idea that cognition is _computational _in a rather strong and clear sense. Within the mainstream approach, cognitive agents are taken to be what are variously known as _physical symbol_ _systems, digital computers_, _syntactic engines_, or_ symbol manipulators_. Cognitive operations are taken to consist in the shuffling of symbol tokens according to strict rules (programs). Models of cognition are themselves digital computers, implemented on general purpose electronic machines. The basic mathematical framework for understanding cognition is the theory of discrete computation, and the core theoretical tools for developing and understanding models of cognition are those of computer science", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2092"]}
