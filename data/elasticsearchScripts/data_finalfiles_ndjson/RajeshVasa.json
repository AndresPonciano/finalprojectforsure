{"title": "A preliminary analysis of mobile app user reviews\n", "abstract": " The advent of online software distribution channels like Apple Inc.'s App Store and Google Inc.'s Google Play has offered developers a single, low cost, and powerful distribution mechanism. These online stores help users discover apps as well as leave a review. Ratings and reviews add value to both the developer and potential new users by providing a crowd-sourced indicator of app quality. Hence, for developers it is important to get positive reviews and high ratings to ensure that an app has a viable future. But, what exactly do users say on these app stores? And more importantly, what is the experience that compels a user to leave either a positive or a negative rating? Our analysis of 8.7 million reviews from 17,330 apps shows that users tend to leave short, yet informative reviews, and the rating as well as the category influences the length of a review.

By examining a larger data set of open source systems we show that maintenance effort is, in general, spent on addition of new classes. Interestingly, efforts to base new code on stable classes will make those classes less stable as they need to be modified to meet the needs of the new clients.This thesis advances the state of the art in terms of our understanding of how evolving software systems grow and change. We propose an innovative method to better understand growth dynamics in evolving software systems. Rather than relying on the commonly used method of analysing aggregate system size growth over time, we analyze how the probability distribution of a range of software metrics change over time. Using this approach we find that the process of evolution typically drives the popular classes within a software system to gain additional clients over time and the increase in popularity makes these classes change-prone.", "num_citations": "36\n", "authors": ["1909"]}

This, however, is not a straightforward task as the corresponding practices cannot be adjusted easily to a learning environment or may even run counter to educational goals.

IT enabled assistive systems can address this challenge by providing services such as home automation, providing security, identifying potential health risks, and monitoring environmental hazards. However, current solutions often undervalue the effects of user perceptions of, and interactions with, technology when deploying such systems. As a result, current systems do not accurately represent the goals of the elderly users, who often do not identify the potential uses of such systems and perceive them to be too complex, invasive and/or irrelevant. Consequently such solutions frequently fail to be utilised to their full potential, thus deterring the successful adoption of technology for assisted living. This study aims to better understand the role of IT in assisted living by examining case studies in the literature through an affordance lens. We identify IT affordances of such digital assisted living systems based on the existing affordances of the \u2018home environment\u2019, and explore inter-relations between the IT affordances. These findings will form the theoretical foundations of a smart home project currently under development, which aims to help people to remain healthy and safe in their own home as they grow older.

We also highlight features of the current research landscape that recommend the coordinated development of such platforms, including the significant technical and resource costs of development, and we identify specific considerations relevant to the design of platforms for digital phenotyping. In addition, we describe trade-offs relating to data quality and completeness versus the experience for patients and public users who consent to their devices being used to collect data. We summarize distinctive features of the resulting platform, InSTIL (Intelligent Sensing to Inform and Learn), which includes universal (ie, cross-platform) support for both iOS and Android devices and privacy-preserving mechanisms which, by default, collect only anonymized participant data. We conclude with a discussion of recommendations for future work arising from learning during the development of the platform. The development of the InSTIL platform is a key step towards our research vision of a population-scale, international, digital phenotyping bank.

However, there is some anecdotal evidence that in many software projects, the underlying code-base is not necessarily refactored post-release, often due to time constraints or the misconception that refactoring does not add any apparent value.

At the center of these modeling languages we find finite state machines that allow for a fine-grained description how and when specific service requests may interact with other components or the environment. Unfortunately, automata-based approaches suffer from exponential state explosion, a major obstacle to the successful application of these formalisms in modeling real-world scenarios. In order to cope with the complexity of individual specifications we can apply partition refinement, an abstraction technique to alleviate the state explosion problem. But this technique too exhibits exponential time and space complexity and, worse, does not offer any guarantees for success. To better understand as to why partition refinement succeeds in some cases while it fails in others, we conducted an empirical study on the performance of a partition refinement algorithm for Component Interaction Automata specifications. As a result we have identified suitable predictors for the expected effectiveness of partition refinement. It is the structure, not the size, of a specification that weighs heavier on the outcome of partition refinement. In particular, Component Interaction Automata specifications for real-world systems are capable of producing scale-free networks containing structural artifacts that can assist the partition refinement algorithm not only converge earlier, but also yield a significant state space reduction on occasion.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1909"]}

We propose a custom notation for expressing provenance of information in the sport performance analysis domain, and map our notation to concepts in the W3C PROV standard where possible. We evaluate the functionality of W3C PROV (without specialisations) and the VisTrails workflow manager (without extensions), and find that as is, neither are able to fully capture sport performance analysis workflows, notably due to limitations surrounding capture of automated and manual activities respectively. Furthermore, their notations suffer from ineffective use of visual design space, and present potential usability issues as their terminology is unlikely to match that of sport practitioners. Our findings suggest that one-size-fits-all provenance and workflow systems are a poor fit in practice, and that their notation and functionality need to be optimised for the domain of use.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1909"]}

In this paper we will analyse the basic properties that are required by an application and its user interface to achieve such growth. We propose a model that describes the lifecycle of a meme. Furthermore we support this model with a framework, which identifies user interface elements and application features that are the foundation to the meme propagation and classify these based on the stage of the lifecycle they belong to. The goal of this framework is to assist software developers in selecting these elements early on in the application design lifecycle, in order to improve the user experience.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1909"]}
