Due to which the cost of development process increases because it directly affects the validation process. The addition of the new requirements with limited resources of development process in a time constrained environment definitely increase the cost. Efficient and effective test case selection from the available test suite becomes very critical problem in this scenario and this situation makes it important to applying of some techniques which are prioritization of test cases and selection of test cases for re-arrangement of test cases in a particular schedule and these test cases are selected in a particular sequence order to fulfillment of some selected criteria.

{"title": "An optimization model for software quality prediction with case study analysis using MATLAB\n", "abstract": " Stakeholder satisfaction is the main motive of the software industry. Consumer and producer satisfaction means achieving a software-quality product. There are so many techniques, methods, and models are present for the software-quality prediction. Computational intelligence is also playing a crucial role in the prediction of quality characteristics. This paper gives a new optimal mathematical model for the prediction of the degree of stakeholder satisfaction (Q). Optimal models validate the real data using the relationship impacts of various quality attributes. It uses the equations of constraints. The optimal model gives the maximum and minimum values for Q. Constraints constitutes of software quality characteristics. In the given case study example, the idle value of Q is 30 but using optimal model it gives the maximum optimal value of Q = 22.788020075 for xLAB IT consulting services on their project In-Reg Molecule\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["1267"]}
{"title": "New method to find the maximum number of faults by analyzing reliability and reusability in component-based software\n", "abstract": " Component-Based Software Engineering is based on reusability of code. It is an approach through which a customer can get a quality product by paying less amount of money and spending less time to produce in comparison of traditional software engineering process. In CBSE lots of work is present in empirical form regarding SQA. In this paper, we are calculating the maximum number of faults through investigating the reliability and reusability of Component-Based Software. This method is very effective to minimize the cost and time for a CBS by using the Halsted Software Science. This method find the effects on reusability through changes in initial phases of software developing process like requirements analysis, design, coding and simultaneously on reliability of code or program, which would be helpful to find the number of faults.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["1267"]}
{"title": "Improved meta-heuristic technique for test case prioritization\n", "abstract": " Time is a very critical factor for decision of cost of any software. The cost and validity of software is based on the quality and quantity of the existing test cases. A large number of software testing approaches are available having both advantages and limitations. Original test cases are supposed to be reused and the new test cases have to be supplemented in regression testing of the updated software. For effective and efficient test case prioritization, the techniques like test case prioritization and test case selection were introduced for scheduling test cases and implementing test cases for fulfillment of some particular criteria. Test case prioritization supports the most useful test cases to execute first by making software testing cost-effective and efficiently covering most extreme number of faults in least time. But test case prioritization requires huge time and effort. This paper has proposed an improved meta\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1267"]}

{"title": "A smart channel estimation approach for LTE systems using PSO algorithm\n", "abstract": " This study focuses on developing an effective channel estimation approach using swarm Intelligence. The Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing ( OFDM) is a modulation technique used to counter transmission channel frequency selection to reach high data rate without disruption. The theory of OFDM is to gain prominence in the field of wireless communication. OFDM is combined with the transmitter and receiver antenna to amplify the variety gain and improve system capacity on selective time and frequency channels, resulting in a Multiple Input Multiple Output ( MIMO) pattern. The most commonly used channel estimation techniques are the Least Square (LS) approaches and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) approaches. In LS, the estimation1process is simple but the problem is that the square error has a high mean. The MMSE is better in Low SNR than in LS, but its main problem is its high computational complexity. A unique method is proposed in this research study that combines LS and MMSE to overcome the aforementioned problems. Upgraded PSO is introduced in this study to select the best channel. This proposed approach is also more efficient and requires less time compared to other techniques to estimate the best channel.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1267"]}
