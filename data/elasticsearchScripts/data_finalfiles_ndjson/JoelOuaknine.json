This paper addresses the problem of encoding Sudoku puzzles into conjunctive normal form (CNF), and subsequently solving them using polynomial-time propositional satisfiability (SAT) inference techniques. We introduce two straightforward SAT encodings for Sudoku: the minimal encoding and the extended encoding. The minimal encoding suffices to characterize Sudoku puzzles, whereas the extended encoding adds redundant clauses to the minimal encoding. Experimental results demonstrate that, for thousands of very hard puzzles, inference techniques struggle to solve these puzzles when using the minimal encoding. However, using the extended encoding, unit propagation is able to solve about half of our set of puzzles. Nonetheless, for some puzzles more sophisticated inference techniques are required.", "num_citations": "194\n", "authors": ["1633"]}

Hirshfeld and Rabinovich gave a negative answer, showing that first-order logic with binary order relation < and unary function +1 is strictly more expressive than MTL with integer constants. However, a recent result of Hunter, Ouaknine and Worrell shows that with rational timing constants, MTL has the same expressive power as first-order logic, giving a positive answer.

{"title": "A framework for model-checking timed CSP\n", "abstract": " Timed CSP is a well-known process algebra, built as an extension to Hoare's original CSP, designed to handle concurrency combined with timing considerations. It achieves this over a continuous time domain (the non-negative real numbers), which has the drawback of precluding standard model-checking approaches, as the state-space of any process is naturally a priori (uncountably) infinite. This paper shows how to circumvent this problem by translating and reinterpreting timed CSP processes within a new model of standard CSP. In this discrete model, which draws on previous work by A.W. Roscoe (1997) and A. Mukkaram (1993), timing of events is provided by the consistent and regular communication of a special tock event, analogous to the `tick' of a clock. The various parallel components of a process are therefore required to synchronise on tock, ensuring a uniform rate of passage of time.

We give a decision procedure for the latter using Baker\u2019s theorem on linear forms in logarithms of algebraic numbers\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1633"]}
{"title": "O-minimal invariants for discrete-time dynamical systems\n", "abstract": " Termination analysis of linear loops plays a key r\\^{o}le in several areas of computer science, including program verification and abstract interpretation. Already for the simplest variants of linear loops the question of termination relates to deep open problems in number theory, such as the decidability of the Skolem and Positivity Problems for linear recurrence sequences, or equivalently reachability questions for discrete-time linear dynamical systems. In this paper, we introduce the class of \\emph{o-minimal invariants}, which is broader than any previously considered, and study the decidability of the existence and algorithmic synthesis of such invariants as certificates of non-termination for linear loops equipped with a large class of halting conditions. We establish two main decidability results, one of them conditional on Schanuel's conjecture in transcendental number theory.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1633"]}
{"title": "The polyhedral escape problem is decidable\n", "abstract": " The Polyhedral Escape Problem for continuous linear dynamical systems consists of deciding, given an affine function f: Rd\u2192 Rd and a convex polyhedron P\u2282 Rd, whether, for some initial point x0 in P, the trajectory of the unique solution to the differential equation x (t)= f (x (t)), x (0)= x0, t\u2265 0, is entirely contained in P. We show that this problem is decidable, by reducing it in polynomial time to the decision version of linear programming with real algebraic coefficients, thus placing it in\u2203 R, which lies between NP and PSPACE. Our algorithm makes use of spectral techniques and relies among others on tools from Diophantine approximation.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1633"]}
{"title": "Time-bounded reachability for hybrid automata: Complexity and fixpoints\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we study thetime-bounded reachability problem for rectangular hybrid automata with non-negative rates (RHA+). This problem was recently shown to be decidable [Brihaye et al, ICALP11] (even though the unbounded reachability problem for even very simple classes of hybrid automata is well-known to be undecidable). However, [Brihaye et al, ICALP11] does not provide a precise characterisation of the complexity of the time-bounded reachability problem. The contribution of the present paper is threefold. First, we provide a new NExpTime algorithm to solve the timed-bounded reachability problem on RHA+. This algorithm improves on the one of [Brihaye et al, ICALP11] by at least one exponential. Second, we show that this new algorithm is optimal, by establishing a matching lower bound: time-bounded reachability for RHA+ is therefore NExpTime-complete. Third, we extend these results in a practical direction, by showing that we can effectively compute fixpoints that characterise the sets of states that are reachable (resp. co-reachable) within T time units from a given starting state.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1633"]}

{"title": "Patricia bouyer, nicolas markey, jo\u00ebl ouaknine, and james worrell\n", "abstract": " In an influential paper titled \u201cThe Benefits of Relaxing Punctuality\u201d[AFH96], Alur, Feder, and Henzinger introduced Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) as a fragment of the real-time logic Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) in which exact or punctual timing constraints are banned. Their main result showed that model checking and satisfiability for MITL are both EXPSPACE-Complete. Until recently, it was widely believed that admitting even the simplest punctual specifications in any linear-time temporal logic would automatically lead to undecidability. Although this was recently disproved, until now no punctual fragment of MTL was known to have even primitive recursive complexity (with certain decidable fragments having provably non-primitive recursive complexity). In this paper we identify a \u2018co-flat\u2019subset of MTL that is capable of expressing a large class of punctual specifications and for which model checking (although not satisfiability) has no complexity cost over MITL. Our logic is moreover qualitatively different from MITL in that it can express properties that are not timed-regular. Correspondingly, our decision procedures do not involve translating formulas into finite-state automata, but rather into certain kinds of reversal-bounded Turing machines. Using this translation we show that the model checking problem for our logic is EXPSPACE-Complete, and is even PSPACE-Complete if timing constraints are encoded in unary.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1633"]}

{"title": "Model-checking real-time concurrent systems\n", "abstract": " This thesis concerns the relationship between continuous and discrete modelling paradigms for timed concurrent systems, and the exploitation of this relationship towards applications, in particular model checking. The framework we have chosen is Reed and Roscoe\u2019s process algebra Timed CSP, in which semantic issues can be examined from both a denotational and an operational perspective. The continuous-time model we use is the timed failures model; on the discrete-time side, we build a suitable model in a CSP-like setting by incorporating a distinguished tock event to model the passage of time. We study the connections between these two models and show that our framework can be used to verify certain specifications on continuous-time processes, by building upon and extending results of Henzinger, Manna, and Pnueli\u2019s. Moreover, this verification can in many cases be carried out directly on the model checker FDR 1. Results are illustrated with a small railway level crossing case study. We also construct a second, more sophisticated discretetime", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1633"]}
