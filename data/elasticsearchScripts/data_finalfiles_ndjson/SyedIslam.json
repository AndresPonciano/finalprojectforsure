{"title": "Authentication of smartphone users based on activity recognition and mobile sensing\n", "abstract": " Smartphones are context-aware devices that provide a compelling platform for ubiquitous computing and assist users in accomplishing many of their routine tasks anytime and anywhere, such as sending and receiving emails. The nature of tasks conducted with these devices has evolved with the exponential increase in the sensing and computing capabilities of a smartphone. Due to the ease of use and convenience, many users tend to store their private data, such as personal identifiers and bank account details, on their smartphone. However, this sensitive data can be vulnerable if the device gets stolen or lost. A traditional approach for protecting this type of data on mobile devices is to authenticate users with mechanisms such as PINs, passwords, and fingerprint recognition. However, these techniques are vulnerable to user compliance and a plethora of attacks, such as smudge attacks. The work in this paper addresses these challenges by proposing a novel authentication framework, which is based on recognizing the behavioral traits of smartphone users using the embedded sensors of smartphone, such as Accelerometer, Gyroscope and Magnetometer. The proposed framework also provides a platform for carrying out multi-class smart user authentication, which provides different levels of access to a wide range of smartphone users. This work has been validated with a series of experiments, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. View Full-Text", "num_citations": "86\n", "authors": ["934"]}
{"title": "A framework for cloud based e-government from the perspective of developing countries\n", "abstract": " Despite significant efforts to initiate electronic government projects, developing countries are still struggling to reap the benefits of using e-government services. An effective implementation of e-government infrastructure is necessary to increase the efficiency and transparency of the government services. There are several studies that observed causes like lack of infrastructure support, lack of payment gateway and improper e-government service delivery channel as main barriers to a wider adoption of e-government services. The main contribution of this research is to propose a cloud-based G2G (Government-to-government) e-government framework for a viable e-government solution from the perspective of developing countries. We have introduced a list of concepts and a systematic process to guide the implementation of e-government project based on the government\u2019s vision, goals, chosen services through the service delivery channel to the appropriate cloud service and deployment model. We have used Nepal as a context of the case study and applied the framework to a real e-government project of driving licensing department using action research methodology. The results from the study show that the G2G approach of e-government implementation would be the best for providing effective government services to the stakeholders of developing countries. The proposed framework also supports a smooth integration of government services and reduces the time of the overall project. View Full-Text", "num_citations": "29\n", "authors": ["934"]}

Bis (indolyl) methanes and their derivatives are widely recognized as bioactive metabolites of terrestrial and marine origin [2\u20136]. Significant efforts have been made to synthesize such compounds. They are usually prepared by condensation of indole with carbonyl compounds in the presence of a protic [7] or Lewis acid [8]. However, the problem in using Lewis acids is their sensitivity to moisture, and in many cases more than stoichiometric amount is required due to trapping by nitrogen-containing substrate. This problem may be avoided to some extent by using lithium perchlorate [9], but the latter is expensive, and the reaction time is longer. Some other reagents like NaHSO4\u2013SiO2, I2, NBS, and K-10 montmorillonite were also used to catalyze the above reaction [10]. Some syntheses in the presence of rare earths, such as LnCl3, Ln (OTf) 3, and Re (PFO) 3, were recently reported as alternative of conventional Lewis acid catalysis [11, 12]. However, many of these procedures require long reaction time and large amounts of the catalyst. Ionic liquid [13] and surfactant [14] were used very recently to catalyze synthesis of bis (indolyl) methanes, but ionic liquids are expensive and the use of surfactant makes the experimental procedure very tedious.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["934"]}

However, the existing methods mostly classify points into distinct classes like pylons and wires, but hardly into individual pylons or wires. The proposed method extracts standalone pylons, vegetation and wires from LiDAR data. The extraction of individual objects is needed for a detailed PLC mapping. The proposed approach starts off with the separation of ground and non ground points. The non-ground points are then classified into vertical (eg, pylons and vegetation) and non-vertical (eg, wires) object points using the vertical profile feature (VPF) through the binary support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Individual pylons and vegetation are then separated using their shape and area properties. The locations of pylons are further used to extract the span points between two successive pylons. Finally, span points are voxelised and alignment properties of wires in the voxel grid is used to extract individual wires points. The results are evaluated on dataset which has multiple spans with bundled wires in each span. The evaluation results show that the proposed method and features are very effective for extraction of individual wires, pylons and vegetation with 99% correctness and 98% completeness.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["934"]}

Microalbuminuria and overt proteinuria are the markers of the CKD. So detection of microalbuminuria and overt proteinuria in hypertensive subjects will help to identify the patient at risk of developing progressive renal impairment. This cross sectional study was carried out in a rural area of Bangladesh. 1134 adult population (age between 18 and 65 years) were screened. A total of 217 (19.1%) were detected hypertensive; spot urine dipstick test was done among them. Those who where dipstick negative further studied for presence of microalbumin [mg/L]. Blood glucose level, serum creatinine, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were evaluated. A group of normotensive people (n= 245) taken as comparison group. Microalbuminuria and overt proteinuria were present in 26.4% and 9.7% of the hypertensive subjects, respectively. Correlation between microalbuminuria and eGFR showed that two variables exhibited a tendency for negative relationship, although correlation was not statistically significant (P= 0.186, r=-0.064). Overt proteinuric subjects showed no statistically significant deterioration of eGFR (81.6\u00b121.1). Microalbuminuria and overt proteinuria are prevalent among the hypertensive rural Bangladeshi people. So early detection of microalbuminuria and overt proteinuria will help to prevent or delay the development of end stage renal disease.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["934"]}

Guidelines are vague, supported by low level evidence, and hydration is used less often than other clinical settings.To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials assessing intravenous hydration compared with non-hydration for prevention of contrast induced nephropathy (CIN) and In-hospital mortality in patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI. Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane Register were searched to September 2018. Included studies reported the incidence of CIN, In-hospital mortality, requirement for dialysis and heart failure. Relative risks with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for individual trials were pooled using a random effects model. Three moderate quality trials were identified including 1074 patients. Overall, compared with no hydration, intravenous hydration significantly reduced the incidence of CIN by 42% (RR 0.58; 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.74, p\u2009<\u20090.001). The estimated effects upon all-cause mortality (RR 0.56; 95% CI: 0.30 to 1.02, p\u2009=\u20090.057) and the requirement for dialysis (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.14\u20131.88, p\u2009=\u20090.462) were not statistically significant. The outcome of heart failure was not consistently reported. Intravenous hydration likely reduces the incidence of CIN in patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI.

The diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis was based on the presence of characteristic lesions at the examination of the liver biopsy specimen, high titer of anti-smooth muscle antibodies in the serum, and remission obtained by steroid therapy. Erythroid aplasia, which appeared during the course of this treatment, was revealed by a regenerative anemia (4.4 g Hb/100 ml) and proved by bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. In vitro bone marrow culture was normal, suggesting the in vivo presence of an inhibitor of erythroblastic differentiation. Red cell aplasia was cured by cyclophosphamide (100 mg/day during 56 days). No recurrence was noted until the death of the patient, which occurred one year later, due to hepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Action of cyclophosphamide on the pure red cell aplasia suggested the immune origin of this disease.

{"title": "An Experimental Analysis of Random Early Discard (RED) Queue for Congestion Control\n", "abstract": " Active Queue Management (AQM) is receiving wide attention as a promising technique to prevent and avoid congestion collapse in packet-switched networks. By providing advanced warning of incipient congestion, end nodes can respond to congestion before router buffer overflows and hence ensure improved performance. Random Early Discard (RED) is an IETF recommended active queue management scheme that is expected to provide several Internet performance advantages such as minimizing packet loss and router queuing delay, avoiding global synchronization of sources, guaranteeing high link utilization and fairness. It tends to drop packets from each connection in proportion to the transmission rate the flow has on the output link. It does not minimize the number of dropped packets as expected, but it manages to achieve improved performance when compared to the Tail Drop. In this paper, extensive experimental analysis has been carried out on RED using Network Simulator (NS-2) in relation to congestion control and decision has been settled where RED can perform better.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["934"]}

Affordable housing for poor or utilize large portions of the area for industrial purpose is proposed to use these lands for productive purposes. Unfortunately, bring back the wildlife or regenerate the landscape as forest, woodland, savannah, grassland and wetland is rarely discussed as tools to reclaim the mining belt. But this landscape has the possibility to rejuvenate the nature together with solving the contamination problem. Environmental problem can be treated through the use of plants known as' Phytoremediation'that mitigate the problem without the contaminant material excavation and dispose of it elsewhere [2].

{"title": "AN ANALYSIS OF CONTRASTS BETWEEN ENGLISH AND BENGALI VOWEL PHONEMES\n", "abstract": " Both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the English vowel system mark it as distinct from many other vowel systems including that of the Bengali language. With respect to the English pure vowels or monophthongs, tongue height, tongue position and lip rounding are the qualitative features which make English distinctive. The quantitative aspect of the English vowels or vowel length is another feature which makes some Bengali vowels different from their English equivalents the fact being that vowel length in Bengali, though it theoretically exists, is not important in actual pronunciation of Bengali. English diphthongs, or the gliding vowels, on the other hand, have the unique feature that between the constituent vowels, the first vowel component is longer than the second. This paper examines these contrasts underpinned by the CAH (Contrastive Analysis Hypothesis) the proponents of which believe that through contrastive analysis of the L1 and the L2 being learnt, difficulties in the latter\u2019s acquisition can be predicted and materials should be based on the anticipated difficulties. The hypothesis also lends itself to the assumption that degrees of differences correspond to the varying levels of difficulty. This paper adds that contrastive analysis also enhances L2 awareness among learners, help them unlearn L1 habits and aids in the automation and creative use of all aspects of the L2 including phonology. The analysis of the sounds in question has made some interesting discoveries hitherto unknown and unobserved. First, it has been found that with reference to the parameters of vowel articulation, ie tongue height, tongue position, lip rounding and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["934"]}

The region of a slab in the vicinity of a column could fail in shear by developing a failure surface in the form of a truncated cone or pyramid. This type of failure, called a punching shear failure, is usually the source of collapse of flat plate and flat slab buildings. It is one of the topics of intensive research in recent years by various researchers in the field of concrete structure. Numerous tests have been carried out to evaluate the punching shear strength of slabs. Several theories have been put forward to predict the strength observed in these tests. An attempt has been made in this research to study the punching shear of reinforced concrete flat plates. Before carrying out the systematic computational investigation, existing literature on the relevant field based on experimental investigation, analytical methods, numerical models and various Codes of Practice is thoroughly reviewed. A 3-dimensional reinforced concrete flat plate model was generated. The formulation has been checked against experimental results of tests on slabs subjected to punching shear. From a comparison of the numerical and the experimental results, it is concluded that the adopted model of the Finite Element Analysis package (ANSYS)is suitable for analyzing reinforced concrete plates. The good agreement obtained between the numerical and the experimental results establish the validity and accuracy of the computational model.

Inter-lingual errors result from the negative transfer of a learner\u2019s L1 features while intra-lingual errors are due to factors within the L2 itself like overgeneralization, ignorance of rule restrictions, incomplete application of rules, and false concepts hypothesized. Although both inter-and intra-lingual factors act as sources of errors in SLA, there is compelling evidence in the research literature that SLA errors are overwhelmingly L1 driven, ie mainly caused by the negative transfer of the language features of the first language of the learner. There is also strong evidence that first language interference presents itself to the learning of all aspects of a second language, ie morphology, syntax, semantics and discourse. At first, this paper discusses the claims and views on L1 negative transfer to SLA. Next, it presents secondary data and its analysis in support of and as evidence for the claims made for L1 interference in the acquisition of the English syntactic properties of word order, subject-verb agreement, tense, copula BE, subject omission, the subordinate clause, expletive pronouns, positions of adverbs, and plurals among other things.

Based on the above assumptions about contrastive analysis of languages, English and Bengali consonant phonemes are analyzed in detail in this paper in terms of the features of articulation, namely place or articulation, manner of articulation, voicing and, also, aspiration because it is a distinctive feature of some Bengali consonants which are likely to interfere with the acquisition of their counterparts in English. After a detailed analysis of the differences and a very few similarities that exist between the two consonant systems, an inventory of the difficult English consonants is made according to the respective severity of difficulty the consonants pose.

Immunochromatography (Ict) based rapid HbsAg kits are popular for the screening of HbV infection as they are faster, cheaper and easier to perform than other methods. this study was aimed to evaluate two rapid HbsAg detection Ict kits for the screening of HbV infection by comparing them with the gold standard real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) system that quantifies HBV-DNA.Materials and Methods: the study comprised 203 samples, of which 103 had detectable and 100 had no detectable HbV-DNA by real time Pcr. these samples were tested with Ict kits from two companies: Onsite HbsAg rapid test (ctK biotech, Inc., UsA) and HbsAg test Device (EXcEL\u00ae, UsA).Results: sensitivity of ctK and EXcEL were found to be 97.1% and 95.1% respectively. Negative predictive value (NPV) of CTK and EXCEL were 97.1% and 95.2% respectively. Both kits showed 100% specificity and 100% positive predictive value (PPV). HbV-DNA status strongly correlated with ctK (r= 0.971, p< 0.001) and with EXcEL (r= 0.952, p< 0.001). Three and five moderate to high HBV load containing samples were undetected by CTK and EXCEL respectively.Conclusions: the study demonstrates that Ict based rapid test Devices might be considered suitable for screening of HbV infection as a point of care test. However, Nucleic Acid testing for hepatitis b virus (NAt-HbV) should be implemented for donor\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["934"]}

Therefore, the study was undertaken to discern about the inclusive market status by employing PRP tools for a period of six months from June-November 2015. The study revealed that in supply chain about 5% consumers received fish and fishery products from fish farmers directly and rest 95% fishes reached to the consumer levels through intermediaries. About 55% fish species were found as local origin and 45% came from different parts of the country. The gross margin of paiker, wholesaler and retailer was 800, 400, 1100 taka/quintal whereas net margin was 600, 320 and 960 taka/quintal, respectively. It was found that 45% consumer not prefers to take fish in fillet form and rest 55% accepted fish fillet for consumption. Major constraints of the study areas were poor drainage, transportation, icing facilities, unhygienic environment.

{"title": "Investment Pattern for Required Economic Growth to Achieve Poverty Reduction Targets\n", "abstract": " According to the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) document, an enhanced economic growth rate of 8 to10 percent per annum is required to achieve the poverty reduction targets set by Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in Bangladesh. During 2006-09, the economic growth of Bangladesh is averaged 6.16 percent per annum. The economy is estimated to have grown at a rate of 6 percent in FY10, slightly above the growth rate (5.9 percent) of FY09, but still it falls short of an economic growth of 8 to 10 percent as would be consistent with PRSP. Therefore, poverty reduction targets will remain unrealized unless the factors responsible for lower economic growth are identified accordingly and managed, one of which is the lower investment spending.Even though current investment spending in Bangladesh is considerably higher than earlier, still our economy is operating far below the targeted growth rate as mentioned in PRSP. It may be the result of insufficient investment spending to attain and maintain the required growth rate set by the MDGs. It is therefore the major challenge of Bangladesh to raise investment to a certain level so that the required growth can be achieved.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["934"]}
{"title": "Species availability and marketing system of traditionally dried fish in Rangpur division of Bangladesh\n", "abstract": " A survey was conducted on traditionally dried fish marketing of Rangpur division. The present study found that there are 22 species of dry fishes available in Rangpur division of which 15 are freshwater species and 7 are marine water species. Prices of the dried fishes in wholesale or retail markets were found to vary on the basis of species, size and quality of the final product. In Rangpur retail markets the maximum net profit was calculated as 12.14 Tk/kg for (Trichiurus lepturus) Churi dried fish. On the other hand, the minimum net profit was found in small indigenous species such as Chela (Salmostoma acinaces) fishes. Whereas, in Dinajpur and Thakurgaon retail market the maximum net profit was found higher in case of Mola (Amblypharyngodon mola) as 18.77 Tk/kg and 32.60 Tk/kg respectively. Two wholesale markets are reported in Rangpur division; the Ghaghatpara arat and Saidpur arat. The retailers of this region usually collect dry fish from those arats and consumers get the dry fishes from the retailers. Locally produced dry fishes are sold to the wholesalers of Rangpur and Saidpur arat and finally go to the consumers through retailers. Several marketing problems were found which include lack of capital, higher transportation cost, storage problem, lower market demand and higher loan interest rate etc.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["934"]}
{"title": "Process centric work breakdown structure for easing Software Project management challenges: Business case analysis example\n", "abstract": " Software project management involves coordinating various aspects of a project in order to bring forth a positive result. There have been increasing challenges faced by project managers. The major challenges of project management include unrealistic deadlines, communication deficit, uncertain dependencies, failure to manage risk, not well-defined vision and goals, and invisibility of the final product. Meeting these challenges is very difficult and in many cases they are not met which eventually leads to the project failure. This situation is even worse where project dispersion is higher. Different studies reveal that an IT project is more likely to be unsuccessful than successful and 7 out of 10 IT projects fail in some respect. The process centric work breakdown structure (WBS) can play a very vital role in this regard to improve the situations significantly.

{"title": "Dependence Cluster Analysis\n", "abstract": " Although the presence of dependence structures within code was established a long time ago it was primarily used for the purpose of slicing which aided code modification, maintenance and debugging process. The use of dependence structure of code for the purpose of categorization and analysis of software quality is a very recent approach. The notions of dependence cluster and dependence pollution was recently introduced through an empirical study which also suggested that global variables were one of the primary causes of dependence clusters within code. The project takes these notions of dependence cluster and dependence pollution to analyze their existence in depth.This project involved development of a technique which could be used to locate and identify global variables that are responsible for formation of large dependence clusters in programs. The technique was implemented with the aid of a tool that allows the automation of the removal process of individual global variables. Other major contributions of the project include proposing framework for categorizing programs according to level of dependence present in them, framework for classifying dependence clusters according to their detection and measurement criteria, techniques that may be used to compare different characteristics of clusters and a framework for categorization of programs according to the likelihood of them containing global variables that are responsible for causing dependence clusters. The framework which uses the likelihood of presence of global variables responsible for causing dependence clusters is given the name Global Dependence Category\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["934"]}

Four varieties of mango such as Langra, Fazli, Laksmanbhog and Kalibhog were used in the experiment. Low temperatures used in this experiment were 9, 11, 13 and 15C including a control (room temperature). There were significant variations among the varieties and also among the storage temperature treatments in respect of shelf life, pulp to peel ratio, total weight loss and total sugar content. Although longer shelf life was recorded in fruits stored at lower temperatures (9 and 11C), the fruits did not ripen properly at these temperatures even after keeping at room temperature and also the edible qualities of those fruits were not satisfactory. In case of cv. Fazli, the longest shelf life was obtained in fruits stored at 13C which was statistically identical with those stored at 15C.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["934"]}

The strains were isolated on xylan agar media and screening was carried out by xylanolysis method. The xylanase-producing capacity of the isolates was further confirmed by DNS (dinitrosalisylic acid) method. The isolated strains were identified as Aeromonas on the basis of morphological and colonical characteristics and different biochemical tests. Aeromonas is one of the most important strains producing xylanase that are used for degrading the xylosidic bonds of xylan in plant kingdom. Multi-drug resistant of these strains was confirmed by disc diffusion and antibiotic spread plate method. Plasmid DNA was isolated from maximum xylanase-producing isolate. Agarose gel electrophoresis of the isolated plasmid DNA in 0.8% agarose showed the presence of only one 28 kb plasmid. The plasmid DNA was transformed into nonxylanase-producing sensitive E. coli LE392. The transformants showed xylanase activity as well as multi-drug resistance. Xylanase activity and multi-drug resistance in Aeromonas strain was proposed to be plasmid mediated.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["934"]}

This technology has advanced rapidly. This paper is aimed at making suggestions on things to consider when deploying VoIP onto a small enterprise network. Though the suggestions to be presented are centered on small network, some of the issues are applicable to a bigger network. These suggestions are based on some theoretical analysis, which are supported with some experimental work. An experiment was conducted for about 24 hours in order to capture the network measurement of a small LAN. The results obtained from the measurement were used in analyzing the whole network based on queuing theory; this provides ground for making judicious modifications to the network in order to support the deployment of Voice over IP.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["934"]}
