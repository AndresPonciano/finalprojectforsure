{"title": "Written and Computer-Mediated Accounting Communication Skills: An Employer Perspective\n", "abstract": " Communication skills are a fundamental personal competency for a successful career in accounting. What is not so obvious is the specific written communication skill set employers look for and the extent those skills are computer mediated. Using survey research, this article explores the particular skills employers desire and their satisfaction level with new hires. Results indicate that basic writing mechanics are the skills in highest demand, followed by effective documentation. Except for email proficiency, employers do not consider computer-mediated communication competencies as important as traditional business communication skills. The article concludes with curricular implications for accounting communication.", "num_citations": "102\n", "authors": ["2250"]}
{"title": "The effect of interaction levels on student performance: A comparative analysis of web-mediated versus traditional delivery\n", "abstract": " This analysis examined the contrasts between online and traditional delivery methods in terms of the impact on student learning and satisfaction for similar course material. It built on the work of other researchers who have asked these types of questions for individual courses and relatively small sample sizes. However, this analysis expanded the number of courses under review and has drawn a larger sample of students than previous studies. The analysis sought to control for student and teacher characteristics, course content, assessment procedures, and so forth, and evaluate student's perceptions of interaction in the two delivery modes. It asked questions about whether varied types of interaction make a difference in a student's performance and satisfaction with the course.", "num_citations": "45\n", "authors": ["2250"]}
{"title": "Test-driven development goes to school\n", "abstract": " In industry experiments using test-driven development (TDD), some researchers report significantly increased code quality over traditional test-last approaches. Not surprisingly computing and information technology educators have begun to call for the introduction of TDD into the curriculum. This paper explores the pedagogical experience to date in using a test-first approach in the classroom. Selected studies include four experience reports, one conceptual paper, and three experiments comparing TDD against control groups. Issues in operationalizing TDD across the curriculum are examined, including programming language assertion mechanisms, the feasibility of employing test frameworks, and the automated verification of student test plans. Recommendations derived from the literature are presented.", "num_citations": "43\n", "authors": ["2250"]}
{"title": "Role preference: are handheld computers an educational or personal technology?\n", "abstract": " As an educational delivery platform, current handheld computer technology provides a low-cost, networked, small-form factor appliance with sufficient machine resources to support instruction, learning, assessment, and collaboration. Yet, except in the fields of medicine and law, handheld adoption for collegiate classroom use has been minimal. This study presents the results of an empirical investigation of users and non-users of handheld technology in higher education. Faculty and student personal technology preferences, handheld usage practices, and experience profiles are presented. Results confirm handhelds are peripheral to most collegiate instruction with usage confined primarily to performing personal information management. When handhelds are used for education, they function as a portable extension of the personal computer. Implications for educational practice are presented.", "num_citations": "30\n", "authors": ["2250"]}
{"title": "Student perceptions of the impact of web-based homework on course interaction and learning in introductory accounting\n", "abstract": " According to Laurillard\u2019s Conversational Framework, teaching and learning are a dialogic activity in which the student attempts to re-construct the teacher\u2019s mental model of the material. An essential part of that dialog between teacher and student is the feedback teachers provide to help students adapt their understanding of the concepts presented. Providing this individualized feedback is time consuming and often beyond the resources available to faculty. To address the need for a more efficient and effective approach to offering feedback, textbook publishers, commercial vendors, and the open source community have developed web-based homework (WBH) systems that provide automated grading. This paper examines the use of a commercial web application (WileyPLUS) to automate grading of multi-part accounting exercises and problems in an introductory accounting course for business majors. A survey research methodology was used. Results indicate that web-based homework systems enhance learning but do not increase perceived course interaction levels. Immediate feedback and allowing for multiple attempts encourages practice with the material. Students are mixed on whether restructuring textbook problems to operationalize online grading adequately prepares them for exams.", "num_citations": "23\n", "authors": ["2250"]}

{"title": "Approaches to Incorporating IT Entrepreneurship into the Information Systems Curriculum\n", "abstract": " The success of tech company IPOs such as Facebook, Twitter, and Snap has not been lost on today\u2019s Information Systems (IS) majors. The demand for entrepreneurship education has grown rapidly from a just a few college classes in entrepreneurship in the 1970s to the over 3,000 colleges and universities providing entrepreneurship curriculum today (Davidson, White, and Taylor, 2012; Morris, Kuratko, and Cornwall, 2013). Information Systems (IS) students interested in launching their own tech startup can benefit from the common body of knowledge found in general entrepreneurship coursework. However, such coursework generally does not take into account the specific characteristics of IT services and software. This translates into the need for a special set of entrepreneurial skills for developing and launching an IT startup. While there has been some research into software and IT entrepreneurship in the fields of software engineering and computer science, little curricular guidance exists for IS students wishing to launch their own tech startup. This paper explores current approaches to teaching the IT and software entrepreneurial skill set. Experience with a dedicated course in tech startup entrepreneurship is described. A sample syllabus for IS majors is provided. The paper concludes with lessons learned and suggestions for implementing an entrepreneurship component as part of an undergraduate IS program.", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["2250"]}
{"title": "Employer expectations of accounting undergraduates' entry-level knowledge and skills in global financial reporting\n", "abstract": " The globalization of business has led to the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) around the world. Recently, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a roadmap for IFRS implementation starting in 2014, with earlier adoption permitted. Yet according to recent surveys, few US universities have a strategy in place to integrate IFRS into the undergraduate accounting curriculum. Using survey research, this paper explores the entry-level knowledge and skills employers expect of new hires in the near term and five years from now. Results indicate that employers already require accounting graduates to have some awareness of IFRS and its relationship to US GAAP. By 2013 students should be able to apply IFRS in recording transactions, prepare IFRS-based financials, and reconcile IFRS to US GAAP. The paper concludes with recommendations based on survey results for incorporating IFRS into the undergraduate accounting curriculum.", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["2250"]}
{"title": "Strategies for improving systems development project success\n", "abstract": " Sixteen years after the publication of the Standish Group\u2019s first CHAOS report in 1994, there is little cause for celebration. True, system development project (SDP) success rates have improved to 32% from the benchmark low of 16.2%; however, when 68% of projects are either cancelled or seriously challenged with regard to budget, schedule, or project scope, there is considerable room for improvement in the SDP process. This research examines the critical risk factors responsible for system development failure with an eye toward the role internal auditors could take in increasing the likelihood of SDP success. In this paper we provide an overview of our efforts to identify a relevant set of critical factors by synthesizing the voluminous practitioner and academic literature. From the hundreds of potential factors identified, we conclude with a preliminary list of 16 strategies for improving SDP success that are the subject of an ongoing investigation.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["2250"]}
{"title": "IFRS Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities: A Follow-Up Study of Employer Expectations for Undergraduate Accounting Majors\n", "abstract": " Although the most recent International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) work plan report from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission no longer includes a timetable for the U.S. adoption of global financial accounting standards, experts predict that the United States will transition to some form of convergence later this decade. In anticipation of the likely change, explicit coverage of IFRS was added to the Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination in 2011. To identify what it will take for students to become IFRS-ready, this research continues a multiyear exploration into key IFRS student learning objectives, their relative importance, and strategies for incorporating them into the undergraduate accounting curriculum. Survey results suggest employer expectations have evolved.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["2250"]}

{"title": "Using a forensic accounting novel to increase student engagement with accounting ethics and the profession\n", "abstract": " The use of educational novels has become an increasingly popular teaching strategy for engaging students in technical subjects and fostering critical thinking (DL Crumbley, Smith, and Smith, 1998; Stone, 2001). Dorocak and Purvis suggest that requiring students to read and write reflectively on literary fiction that has been designed as a teaching tool may \u201cincrease the literate quality of technical writing\u201d(2004, p. 73). Likewise, Kerr, and Smith (1995) maintain that \u201ceducational novels provide a unique approach\u201d to ethics education by \u201cpresenting complex technical concepts in an entertaining and understandable format\u201d(1995, p. 991).The purpose of this research was to investigate whether the use of a pedagogical novel can improve student written communication skills and increase understanding of accounting ethics. Along with a traditional textbook, advanced accounting students were asked to read a full-length forensic mystery novel and write weekly reflective journal entries regarding ethical dilemmas faced by the major characters. At the end of the course, students were surveyed on the effectiveness of the assignment, their journaling experience, and their perceptions regarding improvement in writing skills and ethics understanding.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["2250"]}
{"title": "Discovering objects: Which identification and refinement strategies do analysts really use?\n", "abstract": " In the near future industry experts predict the object paradigm will be adopted as the dominant approach to systems analysis, design, and implementation. The promise of the object-oriented approach to systems analysis hinges on correctly partitioning the problem domain into essential classes and objects. Most developers agree that this is no easy task. Limited research has been done to date regarding class and object identification and refinement. This paper presents the findings of an empirical study that (a) assesses the frequency of use of various strategies for identifying and refining classes and objects during systems analysis and (b) tests the hypothesized relationships between strategy usage and several respondent characteristics. Results suggest analysts should learn a base strategic repertoire complemented by selected strategies targeted to the application type and the analyst\u2019s previous background.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["2250"]}
