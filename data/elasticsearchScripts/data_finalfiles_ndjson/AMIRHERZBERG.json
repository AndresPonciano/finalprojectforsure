Both port and name server randomisation are popular and standardised defenses, recommended in [RFC5452], against attacks by off-path adversaries.

IPsec is designed to provide privacy and authentication against MITM attackers, and employs an anti-replay mechanism to ensure performance. For our analysis, we define a new family of adversaries, the stealth denial and degradation of service (DoS) adversaries. These adversaries are weaker than the classical MITM adversary, and may be of interest in other works. We analyse their ability to launch (DoS) attacks on secure channels, and show realistic amplification attacks, disrupting TCP communication over secure VPNs using IPsec. In particular, we show that antireplay mechanism is critical for performance by launching a DoS attack on communication over IPsec without antireplay window. We present attacks exploiting insufficient IPsec anti-replay window size, and show how to calculate correct window size. Finally we present attacks on IPsec with correctly adjusted anti-replay window size thus showing that even large anti-replay window does not ensure performance to TCP flows. We then suggest a fix to TCP in IPsec gateway designed to prevent the above attacks, and to provide secure channel immune to degradation and other DoS attacks. Our solution involves changes (only) to the sending gateway machines running IPsec. In addition to their practical importance, our results also raise the challenge of formally defining secure channels immune to DoS and degradation attacks, and providing provably-secure\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["329"]}

The adversary may then learn secrets, corrupt data, or send erroneous messages. In practice, such an adversary may be more prevalent than one would like to admit. It may be a malicious hacker, a virus in an application program, or an unscrupulous system administrator.Proactive security is a novel approach to the server security problem. It uses the distribution of data and control to multiple servers and periodic refreshes between servers. By distributing data and control, one or more servers may be compromised without compromising the system. Periodic refreshes between servers allow a compromised server to\\recover\" after the attacker leaves, thereby contributing to the system security. A fraction (in some cases all) of the servers must be compromised simultaneously in order to compromise the system. This paper describes the Network Randomization Protocol (NRP)| a proactive protocol for generating cryptographically secure pseudo-random numbers. The protocol is designed for operation in the Internet and includes defenses against clogging attacks. Issues related to the design and implementation of the protocol are discussed. As virtually no cryptographic task is possible without a source of randomness or pseudorandomness, NRP is an important basic building block for many cryptographic functions.

Additionally, the presented protocol uses a trustworthy supervisor that checks if the auctioneer deviated from the protocol and fines him accordingly. By making sure the expected utility of the auctioneer when deviating from the protocol is lower than his expected utility when abiding by the protocol we ascertain that a rational auctioneer will abide by the protocol.

This is an interesting difference between rCCA and gCCA.We also analyze few other basic, folklore tolerant combiners, including the parallel combiner for one-way functions, and the copy combiner for integrity tasks such as Message Authentication Codes (MAC) and signature schemes. Cascade is also tolerant for the hiding property of commitment schemes, and the copy combiner is tolerant for the binding property, but neither provides tolerant for both properties. We present (new) tolerant combiners for commitment schemes; these new combiners can be viewed as a composition of the cascade and the copy combiners. We prove tolerance of the composite combiners via a general Composition Lemma, possibly applicable for other tasks. Our combiners are simple, efficient and practical.

{"title": "Perfect is the Enemy of Good: Setting Realistic Goals for Interdomain Routing Security\n", "abstract": " Interdomain routing security is not yet in sight. Arguably, the most glaring security vulnerability of today\u2019s Internet infrastructure is the insecurity of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which establishes routes between the independentlyadministered Autonomous Systems (ASes) that make up the Internet. BGP\u2019s susceptibility to configuration errors and designated attacks is the cause for repeated major Internet outages [27, 31, 32] and traffic hijacking attacks [1, 3, 33]. Consequently, much effort is devoted by both researchers and practitioners to secure BGP. A crucial step in this direction is deploying the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), which binds IP address blocks to \u201cowner\u201d ASes via cryptographic signatures. RPKI enables ASes to perform Route-Origin Validation (ROV), ie, discard BGP advertisements originating in an attacker (or a misconfigured router) that advertises an IP address block that belongs to another entity (\u201cIP-prefix-hijacks\u201d). RPKI also underlies both longstanding [34] and recent [7, 21] proposals for protecting BGP from more sophisticated \u201cpath-manipulation attacks\u201d[6]. Unfortunately, despite its significance for protecting the Internet from devastating attacks, the deployment of RPKI is discouragingly slow [10, 15, 24, 26] and, worse yet, even the fairly few adopters are not necessarily secure [10]. Prior studies (see [13] and references within) revealed two fundamental reasons for this dismal state of affairs.(1) Human error. Roughly a third of the records in RPKI repositories are erroneous.

{"title": "Design, Implementation and Deployment of IKP: A Secure Account-based Electronic Payment System\n", "abstract": " This paper discusses the design, implementation and deployment of a secure and practical payment system for electronic commerce on the Internet. The system is based on the iKP family of protocols {iKP (i= 1; 2; 3){developed at IBM Research. The protocols implement credit card-based transactions between buyers and merchants while the existing nancial network is used for payment clearing and authorization. The protocols are extensible and can be readily applied to other account-based payment model, such as debit cards. They are based on careful and minimal use of public-key cryptography and can be implemented in either software or hardware. Individual protocols di er in both complexity and degree of security. In addition to being both a pre-cursor and a direct ancestor of the well-known SET standard, iKP-based payment systems have been in continuous operation on the Internet since mid-1996. This longevity {as well as the security and relative simplicity of the underlying mechanisms {make our experience with iKP unique. For this reason, this paper also reports on, and addresses, a number of practical issues arising in the course of implementation and real-world deployment of a secure payment system.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["329"]}
{"title": "Robust combiners for white-box security\n", "abstract": " White-box security techniques are employed to protect programs so that they can be executed securely in untrusted environments, eg for copyright protection. We present the first robust combiner for white-box primitive, specifically for White-Box Remote Program Execution (WBRPE) schemes. The WBRPE combiner takes two input candidate WBRPE schemes, W and W, and outputs a third candidate W= W\u25e6 W. The combiner is (1, 2)-robust, namely, W is secure as long as either W or W is secure. The security of the combined scheme is established by presenting a reduction to the security of the white-box candidates.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["329"]}

{"title": "Securing power distribution grid against power botnet attacks\n", "abstract": " A botnet is a collection of internet-facing devices that are compromised and controlled by a malicious hacker. In this paper, we propose an attack utilising a botnet of high-wattage internet-facing devices, which we call a power botnet. Power botnet attacks can decrease the reliability of power supply, damage the power quality and even cause catastrophic consequences in power distribution grid. To study the effects on power distribution systems, we simulate three different types of power botnet attacks using OpenDSS, and show the change of OLTC lifespans under attacks. We then use deep learning methods to detect these attacks. We show successful detection for two of these attacks and a low detection rate for the third attack. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to consider power botnet attacks, and leverage deep learning methods to detect these attacks on power distribution grids.

The system allows writing documents by several collaborating individuals. Provenance allows recovery of information about the sequence of significant events relevant to the documents. Existing provenance systems focus on editing events, such as creation or removal of document parts. In this work, we introduce provenance of exposure events, allowing identification of one, or more, individuals which are possible sources of the exposure to external source of a particular version of documents. Our design provides a practical solution for provenance of documents via not-fully-trusted cloud systems, with support for provenance of both exposure and editing events.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["329"]}
{"title": "Cryptographic Protocols to Prevent Spam.\n", "abstract": " Email\u2019s main (and initial) use is professional and personal communication. Email is very efficient, convenient and low-cost, especially when automatically sent by programs to many recipients (\u2018bulk email\u2019). Therefore, email is also used to distribute other messages: from unsolicited offerings and ads, to malicious content such as viruses and scams. Users are rarely interested in these messages; the result it that the vast majority of email messages are undesirable and discarded. These unwanted messages are often referred to as spam. Spam is very annoying to users, and wastes considerable time and resources of email users and service providers.There are few conventions for content labels, used to identify advertising or other potentially undesired messages. For example, some anti-spam legislation requires advertisers to use special prefixes such as \u2018ADV:\u2019in the subject line [42, 43]. Messages that present correct content labels are not problematic, since they can be efficiently discarded by (most) users, who are not interested in them; therefore, we will exclude them from our definition of spam. Unfortunately, most messages containing potentially-undesired content do not contain appropriate content label, ie are spam.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["329"]}

{"title": "ROV++: Improved deployable defense against BGP hijacking\n", "abstract": " We study and extend Route Origin Validation (ROV), the basis for the IETF defenses of interdomain routing. We focus on two important hijack attacks: subprefix hijacks and non-routed prefix hijacks. For both attacks, we show that, with partial deployment, ROV provides disappointing security benefits. We also present a new attack, superprefix hijacks, which completely circumvent ROV\u2019s defense for non-routed prefix hijacks.We then present ROV++, a novel extension of ROV, with significantly improved security benefits even with partial adoption. For example, with uniform 5% adoption for edge ASes (ASes with no customers or peers), ROV prevents less than 5% of subprefix hijacks, while ROV++ prevents more than 90% of subprefix hijacks. ROV++ also defends well against non-routed prefix attacks and the novel superprefix attacks.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["329"]}

{"title": "Intercepting a stealthy network\n", "abstract": " We investigate an understudied threat: networks of stealthy routers (S-Routers), communicating across a restricted area. S-Routers use short-range, low-energy communication, detectable only by nearby devices.               We examine algorithms to intercept S-Routers, using one or more mobile devices, called Interceptors. We focus on Destination-Search scenarios, in which the goal of the Interceptors is to find a (single) destination S-Router, by detecting transmissions along one or more paths from a given (single) source S-Router. We evaluate the algorithms analytically and experimentally (simulations), including against a parametric, optimized S-Routers algorithm.               Our main result is an Interceptors algorithm which bounds the expected time until the destination is found to , where  is the number of S-Routers and  is the average rate of transmission.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["329"]}

Specifically, we present the TopKeyS protocol, that uses such known-topology to allow easier, plug and play key distribution. Furthermore,, TopKeyS improves security by limiting impact of key exposures: it ensures both perfect forward secrecy and proactive key refresh, re-establishing security after exposure. TopKeyS assumes a trusted the authentication server device, whose public key is known to all devices. This server is initialized with the network topology.We analyze the properties of the TopKeyS protocol and show sufficient topology conditions for its applicability. We prove its security against an attacker that is able control some of the devices in the network. We further present AR-TopKeyS, an improvement of TopKeyS that is secure even for Adversarial Routing.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["329"]}

{"title": "TCP injections for fun and clogging\n", "abstract": " We present a new type of clogging DoS attacks, with the highest amplification factors achieved by off-path attackers, using only puppets, i.e., sandboxed malware on victim machines. Specifically, we present off-path variants of the Opt-ack, Ack-storm and Coremelt DoS attacks, achieving results comparable to these achieved previously achieved by eavesdropping/MitM attackers and (unrestricted) malware. In contrast to previous off-path attacks, which attacked the client (machine) running the malware, our attacks address a very different goal: large-scale clogging DoS of a third party, or even of backbone connections. Our clogging attacks are based on off-path TCP injections. Indeed, as an additional contribution, we present improved off-path TCP injection attacks. Our new attacks significantly relax the requirements cf. to the known attacks; specifically, our injection attack requires only a Java script in browser sandbox (not 'restricted malware'), does not depend on specific operating system properties, and is efficient even when client's port is determined using recommended algorithm. Our attacks are constructed modularly, allowing reuse of modules for other scenarios and replacing modules as necessary. We present specific defenses, however, this work is further proof to the need to base security on sound foundations, using cryptography to provide security even against MitM attackers.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["329"]}
{"title": "Camouflaged Private Communication\n", "abstract": " Communication such as web browsing is often monitored and restricted by organizations and governments. Users who wish to bypass the monitoring and restrictions often relay their (encrypted) communication via proxy servers or anonym zing networks such as Tor. While this type of solution allows users to hide the content of their communication and often bypass the restrictions, the mere use of a proxy may alert authorities, placing the users at risk. We introduce a simple and efficient construction, leveraging general purpose services, which allows users to hide their communication from active adversaries without relying on prior trust. Finally, we implement a proof of concept showing that camouflaged web browsing is possible using legitimate services such as Gmail without requiring software installation on the client side.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["329"]}

However existing formal methods for security analysis assume simplified completely synchronous or completely asynchronous models, and cannot deal with the timing aspects of these (and other e-commerce) protocols. We present model for realistic, \u0394-synchronized adversarial settings. We then present a simple, efficient and provably-secure protocol for certified, time-stamped message delivery, providing precise guarantees of delay and timestamps. Our model and analysis use concrete (rather than asymptotic) notions of security.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["329"]}

We present a simplified three layers model for secure commerce: network layer, transport layer and application layer. For each layer, we discuss security and payments objectives, considerations and approaches. We review the important technologies for each layer, including Bluetooth, WAP/WTLS and IBM Micro Payments. Where necessary, we identify weaknesses and suggest improvements. We also show how mobile personal trusted devices could be enhanced to provide secure non-repudiation, theholy grailof secure commerce. We argue that some financial (esp. brokerage) services offered today, without a reasonably secure PTD solution, are creating a serious risk to the economy.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["329"]}
{"title": "On traveling incognito\n", "abstract": " User mobility is rapidly becoming an important and popular network feature. This is especially evident in wireless/cellular networks where user mobility raises a number of important security issues and concerns. Foremost among them is the ability to track mobile users' movements and whereabouts. Ideally, no entity other than the user himself and a responsible authority in the user's home domain (if any) should know both the real identity and the current location of the mobile user. At present, most environments supporting user mobility either do not address the problem at all or base their solutions on assumptions that are speci c to today's cellular phone networks.This paper discusses a number of issues related to anonymity and location privacy in mobile networks. It reviews current state-of-the-art approaches, identi es their exposures of anonymity and proposes several low-cost solutions which vary in complexity, degree of protection and assumptions about the underlying environment.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["329"]}
{"title": "Maintaining security in the presence of transient faults\n", "abstract": " Consider a multiparty system where parties may occasionally be\\infected\" by malicious, coordinated agents, called viruses. After some time the virus is expelled and the party wishes to regain its security. Since the leaving virus knows the entire contents of the infected party's memory, a source of\\fresh\" randomness seems essential for regaining security (eg, for selecting new keys). However, such an\\on-line\" source of randomness may not be always readily available. We describe a scheme which, using randomness only at the beginning of the computation, supplies each party with a new pseudorandom number at each round of communication. Each generated number is unpredictable by an adversary controlling the viruses, even if the party was infected in previous rounds. Our scheme is valid as long as in each round there is at least one noninfected party, and some of the communication links are secure. We describe an important application of our scheme to secure sign-on protocols.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["329"]}
{"title": "Quantitative analysis of dynamic network protocols\n", "abstract": " We present a quantitative approach to the analysis of dynamic network protocols. Dynamic networks, extensively studied in the last decade, are asynchronous communication networks in which links repeatedly fail and recover. Loosely speaking, we quantify the reliability of a link at a given moment as the time since the link last recovered. This corresponds to the intuition that a link isuseful'only after somewarming up'period since it recovered. To compare the quantitative approach to the existing (qualitative) approaches, we consider the broadcast task, used extensively in actual networks. The existing formulations of broadcast seem too di cult for dynamic networks. In particular, protocols with bounded storage must have unbounded time complexity. Our quantitative formulation of broadcast seems to be closer to the realistic requirements, and escapes such di culties.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["329"]}
