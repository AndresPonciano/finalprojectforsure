The focus is on the impact of visual design factors on the feeling of trustworthiness because of its significant effect upon the behavior of customers using electronic commerce systems. Four empirical studies were conducted in the domain of cyber-banking systems. The subjects were cyber-banking system developers, bank personnel and potential customers of cyber-banking systems in Korea ranging in age from late teens to early forties. The first study was directed at developing the self-report questionnaire that faithfully reflects the emotional factors related to cyber-banking systems. The resulting questionnaire consisted of the forty bipolar emotive differential scales representative of the emotions most important in interacting with cyber-banking systems, e.g\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "634\n", "authors": ["902"]}

Each focuses on different critical factors in its success at the individual, group, and community levels. The technical and management decisions of Linus Torvalds were critical in laying the groundwork for a collaborative software development project that has lasted almost a decade. The contributions of volunteer programmers distributed worldwide enabled the development of an operating system on a par with proprietary operating systems. The Linux electronic community was the organizing structure that coordinated the efforts of the individual programmers. The chapter concludes by summarizing the factors important in the successful distributed development of the Linux kernel and the implications for organizationally managed distributed work arrangements.Complex tasks plus a global economy have impelled the creation of many distributed engineering and development groups supported by information and communication technologies. Distributed groups range in duration from weeks to years, they range in size from fewer than ten people to more than a thousand, and they may have members located in two locations or many locations. Distributed engineering and development depends on careful planning, coordination, and supervision. Careful does not necessarily imply micromanagement. Contributors who are geographically distant from one another inevitably operate under some degree of autonomy.

The economic gains derived from subscription-based tariffs diminish as consumers renew their subscriptions under the same contract duration.

Thanks to the advancement of medical technology and ever-increasing life expectancy, there may be more differences than we thought in terms of cognitive and behavioral patterns among the elderly population. In order to further investigate this question, this study focuses on technology acceptance behavior of 132 participants over the age of 60 towards a wearable healthcare device. The results show that there were interesting behavioral differences among participants depending on their cognitive capabilities. More specifically, participants with high cognitive capability (Superagers) consider the usefulness and the social aspects (social norm and image) of using wearable healthcare technology. Whereas for those with relatively low cognitive capability (non-Superagers), usefulness of using the technology was not a significant factor, and they mainly considered social norm and image. Our findings imply that the current monolithic application of chronological age to classify the elderly population should be carefully reconsidered because people aged over 60 years old may not always share homogeneous cognitive and behavioral patterns.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["902"]}

However, contrary to such assertions, the open source software development (OSSD) approach, in which software developers in digital social networks coordinate to voluntarily contribute programming code, has recently emerged as a promising alternative. Although many high profile cases of successful OSSD projects exist, the harsh reality is that the vast majority of OSS projects fail to take off and become abandoned. A commonly cited reason for the failure of OSS projects is the inability of the software project to bring together a critical mass of developers. This paper empirically examines the role of prior collaborative ties on how OSSD project teams are formed. Using software project data from real world OSSD projects, we find that the existence and the amount of prior collaborative relations in the developer network do increase the probability that an OSS project will attract more developers and that a developer\u2019s prior relationships with a project initiator do increase the likelihood that a developer will join a project initiated by a past collaborator.
