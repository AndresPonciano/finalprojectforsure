This study aims to investigate the action of curcumin in the hippocampus subjected to glutamate neurotoxicity. Glutamate stimulation induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome activation, leading to damage in the hippocampus. Curcumin treatment in the hippocampus or SH-SY5Y cells inhibited IRE1\u03b1 and PERK phosphorylation with suppression of intracellular ROS production. Curcumin increased AMPK activity and knockdown of AMPK\u03b1 with specific siRNA abrogated its inhibitory effects on IRE1\u03b1 and PERK phosphorylation, indicating that AMPK activity was essential for the suppression of ER stress.

First, a genome-scale metabolic model of S. tsukubaensis was constructed based on its annotated genome and biochemical information. Subsequently, several potential genetic targets (knockout or overexpression) that guaranteed an improved yield of FK506 were identified by the recently developed methodology. To validate the model predictions, each target gene was manipulated in the parent strain D852, respectively. All the engineered strains showed a higher FK506 production, compared with D852. Furthermore, the combined effect of the genetic modifications was evaluated. Results showed that the strain HT-\u0394GDH-DAZ with gdhA-deletion and dahp-, accA2-, zwf2-overexpression enhanced FK506 concentration up to 398.9 mg/L, compared with 143.5 mg/L of the parent strain D852.

A support vector machine (SVM) classifier, integrated with a subspace projection method to address the problems of mixed pixels and noise, is first used to model the posterior distributions of the classes based on the spectral information. Then, the spatial information of the image pixels is modeled using an adaptive Markov random field (MRF) method. Finally, the maximum posterior probability classification is computed via the simulated annealing (SA) optimization algorithm. The combination of subspace-based SVMs and adaptive MRFs is the main contribution of this paper.

The metabolic flux distribution of strains with different isobutanol production capacity (BSUL03, BSUL04 and BSUL05) drops a hint of the importance of NADPH on isobutanol biosynthesis. Therefore, the redox pathways were redesigned in this study. To increase NADPH concentration, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase was inactivated (BSUL06) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was overexpressed (BSUL07) successively. As expected, NADPH pool size in BSUL07 was 4.4-fold higher than that in parental strain BSUL05. However, cell growth, isobutanol yield and production were decreased by 46%, 22%, and 80%, respectively. Metabolic profiling analysis suggested that the severely imbalanced redox status might be the primary reason. To solve this problem, gene udhA of Escherichia coli encoding transhydrogenase was further overexpressed (BSUL08), which not only well balanced the cellular ratio of NAD(P)H/NAD(P)+, but also increased NADH and ATP concentration.

Although GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter of LC neurons, the modulation of LC neuronal firing activity by local GABAergic interneurons remains poorly understood with respect to their precise location, intrinsic membrane properties and synaptic modulation. Here, we took an optogenetic approach to address these questions. Channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in a tandem with the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) was expressed in GABAergic neurons under the control of glutamic acid decarboxylase 2 (GAD2) promoter. Immediately dorsomedial to the LC nucleus, a group of GABAergic neurons was observed. They had small soma and were densely packed in a small area, which we named the dorsomedial LC or dmLC nucleus. These GABAergic neurons showed fast firing activity, strong inward rectification and spike frequency adaptation. Lateral inhibition among these GABAergic neurons was observed. Optostimulation of the dmLC area drastically inhibited LC neuronal firing frequency, expanded the spike intervals, and reset their pacemaking activity. Analysis of the light evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) indicated that they were monosynaptic. Such light evoked IPSCs were not seen in slices where this group of GABAergic neurons was absent.

{"title": "Congestion avoidance, detection and mitigation in wireless sensor networks\n", "abstract": " Congestion is an essential problem in wireless sensor networks. It occurs when the offered traffic load exceeds available capacity at any point in a network. Congestion causes overall channel quality to degrade and drop rates to rise. Furthermore, redundant transmissions are always adopted to guarantee reliable data delivery, which may deteriorate congestion since they bring about more contention and in return hampers the reliability. In this paper, a framework is proposed to avoid, detect and mitigate congestion effectively. Compared with previous works, this work doesn't control congestion at the cost of desired reliability, instead, both goals can be achieved. There are mainly two parts in this framework: congestion aware traffic allocation (COTA) and congestion detection and mitigation (CODEM). COTA is used in multipath routing to balance traffic around the whole network. COTA uses some heuristic information to analyze the potential congestion region and avoid traversing these regions. Once congestion happens inevitably, CODEM is presented to detect congestion using accurate metric and reallocate traffic among multiple paths to mitigate congestion. The multi-frequency characteristic of CC2420 radio is used to minimize contention between control packets and data packets.

{"title": "Bacurd2 is a novel interacting partner to Rnd2 which controls radial migration within the developing mammalian cerebral cortex\n", "abstract": " During fetal brain development in mammals, newborn neurons undergo cell migration to reach their appropriate positions and form functional circuits. We previously reported that the atypical RhoA GTPase Rnd2 promotes the radial migration of mouse cerebral cortical neurons (Nature 455(7209):114\u20138, 2008; Neuron 69(6):1069\u201384, 2011), but its downstream signalling pathway is not well understood. We have identified BTB-domain containing adaptor for Cul3-mediated RhoA degradation 2 (Bacurd2) as a novel interacting partner to Rnd2, which promotes radial migration within the developing cerebral cortex. We find that Bacurd2 binds Rnd2 at its C-terminus, and this interaction is critical to its cell migration function. We show that forced expression or knockdown of Bacurd2 impairs neuronal migration within the embryonic cortex and alters the morphology of immature neurons. Our in vivo cellular analysis reveals that Bacurd2 influences the multipolar-to-bipolar transition of radially migrating neurons in a cell autonomous fashion. When we addressed the potential signalling relationship between Bacurd2 and Rnd2 using a Bacurd2-Rnd2 chimeric construct, our results suggest that Bacurd2 and Rnd2 could interact to promote radial migration within the embryonic cortex. Our studies demonstrate that Bacurd2 is a novel player in neuronal development and influences radial migration within the embryonic cerebral cortex.", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["463"]}

First, a new noise estimation method, named residual-scaled local standard deviations, is used to analyze the noise condition of HJ-1A hyperspectral images. Then, an optimized maximum noise fraction (OMNF) transform is proposed for dimensionality reduction of HJ-1A images, which adopts an accurately estimated noise covariance matrix for noise whitening. The proposed OMNF method is less sensitive to noise distribution and interference existence, thus it can more efficiently compact useful data information in a low-dimensional space.

Previous studies mainly focus on designing efficient algorithms or heuristics on a static social network.

In this paper, we propose an incremental approach, IncInf, which can efficiently locate the top- influential individuals in evolving social networks based on previous information instead of calculation from scratch. In particular, IncInf quantitatively analyzes the influence spread changes of nodes by localizing the impact of topology evolution to only local regions, and a pruning strategy is further proposed to narrow the search space into nodes experiencing major increases or with high degrees. To evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness, we carried out extensive experiments on real-world dynamic social networks: Facebook, NetHEPT, and Flickr.

Vitamin D deficiency during development causes rickets and in adults can result in osteomalacia and increased risk of fracture. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), the hormonally active form of vitamin D, is responsible for the biological actions of vitamin D which are mediated by the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Mutations in the VDR result in early-onset rickets and low calcium and phosphate, indicating the essential role of 1,25(OH)2D3/VDR signaling in the regulation of mineral homeostasis and skeletal health. This chapter summarizes our current understanding of the production of the vitamin D endocrine hormone, 1,25(OH)2D3, and the actions of 1,25(OH)2D3 which result in the maintenance of skeletal homeostasis.

Another is random data layout policy like in GFS and HDFS where its property is precisely opposite to that of the sequential policy.

The present study investigated gene expression changes and behavioural pharmacology in male and female R6/1 transgenic HD mice at an early time-point in HD progression associated with onset of cognitive and affective abnormalities, following EE and exercise (wheel running) interventions. We have demonstrated changes in expression levels of the serotonin (5-HT) receptor Htr1a, Htr1b, Htr2a and Htr2c genes (encoding the 5-HT1A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors respectively) in HD brains at 8 weeks of age, using quantitative real-time PCR.

Furthermore, we identified region-specific, sex-specific and environmentally regulated (comparing EE, exercise and standard housing conditions) impacts on gene expression of particular 5-HT receptors, as well as SerT. For example, SerT gene expression was upregulated by exercise (wheel running from 6-8 weeks of age) in the hippocampus.

There are mainly two reasons. First, there are no rigorous specifications or systematic processes to instruct logging practices. Second, logging code evolves with bug fixes or feature updates. Without considering the impact of software evolution, previous works on log enhancement can partially release the first problem but are hard to solve the latter. To fill this gap, this paper proposes to guide log revisions by learning from evolution history. Motivated by code clones, we assume that logging code with similar context is pervasive and deserves similar modifications and conduct an empirical study on 12 open-source projects to validate our assumption.

Case-crossover design with daily environmental exposure and health outcomes (eg, deaths and hospitalisations) is one of the most common study designs. It allows researchers to examine the acute health effects due to short-term environmental exposure.A case-crossover design utilizes the ID as a stratum, comparing individuals to themselves at different times. To examine whether the events are associated with a particular exposure, it compares exposure level in the day when the health event occurs (case day) with the levels in nearby days (control days). The control days represent the counterfactual exposure experience of each case, independently of the exposure on case day. With this design, the long-term trend and seasonality of unmeasured variables are controlled for [2]. Several strategies for choosing control days are proposed (Figures 1 (a)\u20131 (e))[3, 4]. However, unidirectional and bidirectional strategies introduce biases from various sources, such as time trends and seasonal patterns in exposure or health events and nonindependent selection of control days [5]. Time-stratified case-crossover design is the best approach to control the above biases.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["463"]}

However, no indicator of the level of air pollution control efficacy has yet been developed. We aimed to develop such an indicator, and to evaluate its global and temporal distribution and its association with country-level health metrics.  Method: A novel indicator, ground level population-weighted average PM2.5 concentration per unit CO2 emission per capita, (written as PC in abbreviation ), was developed to assess country-specific air pollution control efficacy. We estimated and mapped the global average distribution of PC and PC changes during 2000-2016 across 196 countries. Pearson correlation coefficients and Generalized Additive Mixed Model (GAMM) were used to evaluate the relationship between PC and health metrics.  Results: PC varied by country with an inverse association with the economic development. PC showed an almost stable trend globally from 2000 to 2016 with the low income groups increased. The Pearson correlation coefficients between PC and life expectancy at birth (LE), Infant-mortality rate (IMR), Under-five mortality rate (U5MR) and logarithm of GDP per capita (LPGDP) were -0.566, 0.646, 0.659, -0.585 respectively (all P-values <0.001). Compared with PM2.5 or CO2 , PC could explain more variation of LE, IMR and U5MR. The association between PC and health metrics was independent of GDP per capita.

{"title": "Revisiting Resource Management for Deep Learning Framework\n", "abstract": " The recent adoption of deep learning for diverse applications has required infrastructures to be scaled horizontally and hybrid configured vertically. As a result, efficient resource management for distributed deep learning (DDL) frameworks is becoming increasingly important. However, existing techniques for scaling DDL applications rely on general-purpose resource managers originally designed for data intensive applications. In contrast, DDL applications present unique challenges for resource management as compared to traditional big data frameworks, such as a different master\u2013slave communication paradigm, deeper ML models that are more computationally and network bounded than I/O, the use of heterogeneous resources (eg, GPUs, TPUs) and the variable memory requirement. In addition, most DDL frameworks require data scientists to manually configure the task placement and resource assignment to execute DDL models. In this paper, we present Dike, an automatic resource management framework that transparently makes scheduling decisions for placement and resource assignment to DDL workers and parameter servers, based on the unique characteristics of the DDL model (number and type of parameters and neural network layers), node heterogeneity (CPU/GPU ratios), and input dataset. We implemented Dike as a resource manager for DDL jobs in Tensorflow on top of Apache Mesos. We show that Dike significantly outperformed both manual and static assignment of resource offers to Tensorflow tasks, and achieved at least 95% of the optimal throughput for different DDL models such as ResNet and Inception.

The first one can control the total number of replicas and branch adaptively to diffuse data as soon as possible. The second one can guarantee each node accepts a packet in the same probability according to the area of its own Voronoi cell. These two can diffuse replicas and queries accurately, fast, uniformly, and robust. Simulations show that BubbleGeocast provide reduced 30% communication costs, 30% delay on replicas diffusion, and 50% delay on query on average, within the bound of successful query.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["463"]}
{"title": "Keta\u2019s Web QoS Mechanism and Implementation\n", "abstract": " With the phenomenal growth of Web applications, in order to increase the serving ability of Web servers, many kinds of Web server architectures are proposed and implemented. In this case, it is urgent to realize a Web QoS controlling mechanism to supply performance guarantee and dipartite services for Web applications. Keta is a new asymmetrical multi-thread pipeline Web server. This paper implements the classifying and scheduling mechanism of requests and supplies content-adaptive degraded services when the Web server is overloaded. The data of experiments verify the mechanism.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["463"]}
