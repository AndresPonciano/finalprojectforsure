These can include sketches, technical drawings, and computer models, as well as mock-ups and previous products. Researchers have for a long time been aware of the importance of representations and reference points in the generation and representation of designs, and have often studied particular types of representation, for example sketching (see Purcell and Gero, 1998, for an overview of research on the role of sketching in design).

In this experiment we wanted to create a design situation where four distant designers had to communicate using commercial software and standard hardware configurations. Our methodological approach gave us the opportunity to examine two main lines of research questions concerning: (1) the specificities of technology-mediated design meetings that contrast to those of face-to-face design meetings; (2) the differences between synchronous and asynchronous collaborative work in mediated design engineering situations. Our approach stresses on some important aspects related to the management of the synchronous activity in a distant mediated situation.

While this approach is suitable for software, it appears to be over-simplistic for complex hardware products. Whether such a product can be labelled as open source is not only a question of licence but a question of documentation, i.e. what is the information that sufficiently describes it? Or in other words, what is the \u201csource\u201d of open source hardware? To date there is no simple answer to this question, leaving large room for interpretation in the usage of the term. Based on analysis of public documentation of 132 products, this paper provides an overview of how practitioners tend to interpret the concept of open source hardware. It specifically focuses on the recent evolution of the open source movement outside the domain of electronics and DIY to that of non-electronic and complex open source hardware products. The empirical results strongly indicate the existence of two main usages of open source principles in the context of tangible products: publication of product-related documentation as a means to support community-based product development and to disseminate privately developed innovations. It also underlines the high variety of interpretations and even misuses of the concept of open source hardware. This reveals in turn that this concept may not even be clear to practitioners and calls for more narrowed down definitions of what has to be shared for a product to be called open source.

We define two types of annotations in the engineering design context, locutionary and illocutionary annotations. The annotations we describe in this paper are materialised by a set of digital artefacts, which have a semantic dimension allowing express/record elements of technical justifications, traces of contradictory debates, etc. In this paper, we first clarify the semantic annotation concept, and we define general properties of annotations in the engineering design context, and the role of annotations in different design project situations. After the description of the case study, where we observe and analyse annotations usage during the design reviews and minute making, the last section is dedicated to present our approach.

We show how a CAD application, integrating specific know-how, can enable co-design between the different actors involved. We develop two dimensions of activity, i.e., a technical aspect and a human aspect. On the technical side, we present the application structure and the un derlying mechanical models. On the human side we draw mainly from our industrial experience in the field of forging. This led us to build two models of the design phase. These models are illustrated by two typical case studies. We then show how the design of closed die parts can be distributed among three main actors. These actors are: the design actor, the manufacturing actor and the forging actor. They can be lo cated in the same company, or in different departments or located in distant companies. From\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["864"]}

We show that semantic annotations can be considered to improve the semiotic richness in 3D CAD representations.

Especially the design of products or systems dedicated to expert users requires the active participation of the users themselves. The aim of this paper is to explore the design collaboration process between designers and expert users in the specific case of new surgical instruments. Two design meetings have been studied; one technical design review without the user, and one design validation meeting with the expert user. Designers were using an annotation tool as a communication support during the design process, before and during the first meeting. Our observations showed that the designers were not able to make decisions about the technical solutions that contained user related issues. Moreover, the expert user's comments during the validation meeting altered the proposed solution. In conclusion, it seemed that the actual design organization should be changed in order to integrate the expert user more actively. Annotation as a communication tool proved to be useful for technical exchanges, but we found important limitations for non technical users, we then propose solutions for further improvement of the tool.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["864"]}

In co-operative processes, where achieving a shared understanding between the participants from different domains is crucial, sharing the decisions and argumentations which lead to a solution is as important as sharing the solution itself.

Then, within a conceptual design scenario, we show how semantic annotations can create a shared environment to help to reduce this gap, where all actors are able to elicit domain-specific constraints and engage discussions on design solution during the asynchronous phase.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["864"]}

We distinguish between two modes of representations: iconic, where the signifier is perceived as resembling or imitating the signified, and symbolic, where the relationship between representation and target object is fundamentally arbitrary or purely conventional, so that the relationship must be learnt. The design cases are discussed according to this approach, in order to show how mode of representation of design artefacts has evolved according to the different sharing contexts, and the advantages that their modes offer respectively in their context of use. This analysis shows how iconic 3D representations must be enhanced by symbolic annotations, in order to support asynchronous argumentative design communication.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["864"]}

This model has been used for characterising the cognitive synchronisation mechanisms involved in a distributed collective design process. More precisely the analysis of two design protocols highlight a specific 'sequential effect' in distributed design situations where video facilities are poor or missing.

We shall outline a methodological framework for structuring the deployment of scenarios according to the different design phases: the COSU  method. This method implements the scenario concept in an original way. It comprises four types of scenario whose aim is to create interaction between designers and users in order to foster a shared understanding of both the problem and the solutions.

It describes a framework to capture the early dependencies between the components and stakeholders of an enterprise organization that faces a wide array of uncertainty in a start-up environment. The methodology consists of two steps: 1) a layered DSM representation, and 2) flexibility analysis. The first step provides a systems-level representation of the enterprise, and enables quick identification of opportunities for flexibility. The second step enables thorough and quantitative analysis of opportunities for flexibility to support strategic design and management decision-making. The concept of flexibility, often associated to real options, is exploited as a way to deal pro-actively with uncertainty, which is prevalent in a startup environment. It provides entrepreneurial systems with the \u201cright, but not the obligation, to change and adapt over time as uncertainty unfolds.\u201d The proposed methodology is applied as demonstration to the analysis of a startup system in the sector of mobility on-demand transportation.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["864"]}

This paper proposes an interface model that aims to grasp the complexity of engineering management situations. Based on hologramic and recursive principles of complexity, a transactional model of the interface is proposed with the types of interfaces that derive from it. Nine types of translations are described together with six types of inward and outward transactions, as well as the exchange spaces established through the interface actor.

In this chapter our aim is not to address this question in a theoretical and general way. Rather, we prefer to go deeper in a case study to understand the detailed workings of a specific design situation when a new technology is introduced. In our case, we have witnessed the introduction of a new material (a composite material called SMC1) in a design department of an industrial company. In the following we will call it the'composite project'. The aim of this project was twofold: testing the capacity of this material in a semi-structural application, and changing the design practices and organization through the introduction of a new material. The challenge was on the two aspects: moving the technical limits of the technology and making the organization and the actors evolve in the same time. This chapter deals with the second aspect. After presenting the context of this study we will analyse the different aspects of this innovation process in this particular design situation. We observed that design habits were deeply rooted in the history of the product and especially they were shaped by the underlying technology used in this industry since the beginning, that is, the steel and its related manufacturing processes.

This paper is an attempt to contribute a theoretical framework through the modelling of the process of creating a mutual understanding during remote synchronous design sessions. We present here some reflections based on a review of the available literature in engineering design, on the experience accumulated in field studies and on a distributed design protocol we have recently carried out. We propose a model of an elementary design interaction between two participants of the design process. We take the Situated FBS Framework as a basic individual cognitive model and we propose to extend it through the concept of design intermediary objects and cognitive synchronisation.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["864"]}
{"title": "Analysis of the use of intermediary objects involved the design of food processing equipment in developing countries: The case of a peanut procesing plant in Benin\n", "abstract": " The design intermediary objects (DIO) that steered the design process of a peanut processing plant have been analysed in the aim of understanding how the design process worked, and also to discover the outcome of the use by Developing country designers of a design method based on a cooperative structure, which helped to frame the design task: the CESAM method. This study shows that the role of DIO's in the food equipment design process is one of translation, mediation and representation of the future product (at different stages of the process). They function on many different levels: supporting knowledge creation, interesting or motivating actors to the process, presenting and sharing the knowledge produced, etc. For example, some DIO's play a crucial role in key stages of the design process, linking the analysis of requirements and the perception of these requirements by the designers, or indeed in understanding the practices of the women who process the peanuts manually and in developing solutions that cater for their requirements. These DIO's favour a cooperative design approach and their contribution must be described more explicitly in the next version of CESAM.(R\u00e9sum\u00e9 d'auteur)", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["864"]}

In the specific field of forging part design, i.e. the modification of the initial shape of the tooled part into a forgeable shape, our recent developments show the necessity of knowing the way the material flows during the process. To this end, we are developing a fast-simulation deformation tool (two dimensional, isothermal) based on the extension of Chamouard's model. This tool allows us to simulate the evolution of the forging force, as well as to visualise the intermediate shapes during the operation in order to identify the critical zones in terms of filling.

It is an increasing phenomenon that goes hand in hand with the developments of the makers movements and the underpinning societal changes that are at stake today. However, poorly structured communities are sometimes struggling with problems inherent to the reuse of exiting designs. Besides, the exponential number of web-sites and platforms hosting open-source projects makes it almost impossible to properly find similar products or designs to get inspiration from. Design reuse has been an important practice in industry since decades. This paper looks for exiting design reuse research work and makes an attempt to elicit the main characteristics of design reuse identified in the literature. From this, we discuss the conditions of the application of design reuse\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["864"]}

The method is particularly useful for exploring the introduction of augmented reality (AR) environments since AR application representations combine both digital content and physical content, transforming the way users interact with the design object. Although protocol analysis is extensively used in cognitive studies of design, it is a time-consuming and cumbersome method and hence unsuitable for extensive analysis in industrial environments. Our real-time coding method makes it possible to perform \u201con-the-fly\u201d coding of physical interactions in co-design sessions. Focusing on quantifying interaction occurrences, our results are consistent with those obtained with post-session coding. Internal validity was assessed using relevant statistical tests.

Soon the design has to be shared, released or approved, either for prototyping or manufacturing, and the PDM system has to fulfil the not always explicit requirements of the users. This paper describes what has to be implemented at the early stage of a new design project in order to get an actual use of PDM. It is based on a real case study in 2010 for a new project in a new organisational structure, with new tools and new processes applying to new team members. The process of implementing and using a PDM system is described, covering not only the classical title blocks for 2D drawings, but the release of 3D models and the relationship with the item approval. The proposed item-centric approach helps the designers, engineers and managers to make a proper distinction between the life cycle of the item and the life cycles of the CAD-entities that describe it, to assign the adequate status to these entities, depending on their maturity level, and to build up a common shared representation.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["864"]}

During its life cycle, engineers and designers make many representations of a product. The information and knowledge used to create the product are usually represented visually in sketches, models, (technical) drawings, and images. Linguistic information is complementary to graphic information and essential to create the corporate memory of products.

This innovative organisation of product development based on a new conception of copyright as well as decentralised and voluntary work offers a disruptive alternative to conventional industrial product development. It provides a great opportunity for continuous improvement of products as well as formidable potentials for product innovation and incubation of new businesses. However, the emergence of open source hardware design still suffers from a limited availability of supporting methods and online tools helping to face the organizational challenges raised by distributed collaboration of non-contractually engaged volunteers. Because of a lack of adapted structuring mechanisms, open source hardware design projects are still restricted to the development of products of low complexity and quality, i.e. prototypes or toys for do-it-yourself hobbyists. In order to compete with today's standards of industrial product design, open design shall be provided with adapted methods that ensure significant process efficiency and economic viability. In this presentation we will introduce the concept of open source hardware design and explain how it is different for open source software design.

Through the qualitative analysis of a case, observed in an open innovation center called Ideas Lab, we will explain the use, the nature and the functions of representations developed during a creativity session. We aim at articulating Duval  s representational cognitive functions and the mode of attribution of meaning, polysemic versus monosemic, in creativity sessions as specific situations. In addition to the classical cognitive functions of Duval  s framework, we propose a new cognitive function of representation that we call the modulation of ambiguity specific to the creative process. The representation allows the adjustment of the ambiguity level to give way to a variety of interpretations. This potential of the modulation of polysemy supports the idea generation activity by introducing or preserving a variety of interpretations, and prepares the idea evaluation phase by reducing polysemy and supporting the construction of a common understanding.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["864"]}

To address this problem, we describe a new methodology for modelling the conflict management process and its implementation in a Web-based multi-agent system for advanced concurrent design and manufacturing with emphasize on the concept of \u201ccognitive synchronisation\u201d and \u201cdesign rational\u201d for building a shared point of view and thus reaching a \u201csatisfying\u201d solution.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["864"]}
