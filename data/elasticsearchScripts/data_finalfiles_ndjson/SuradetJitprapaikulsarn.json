{"title": "Analysis of the value for unit commitment of improved load forecasts\n", "abstract": " Load forecast errors can yield suboptimal unit commitment decisions. The economic cost of inaccurate forecasts is assessed by a combination of forecast simulation, unit commitment optimization, and economic dispatch modeling for several different generation/load systems. The forecast simulation preserves the error distributions and correlations actually experienced by users of a neural net-based forecasting system. Underforecasts result in purchases of expensive peaking or spot market power; overforecasts inflate start-up and fixed costs because too much capacity is committed. The value of improved accuracy is found to depend on load and generator characteristics; for the systems considered here, a reduction of 1% in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) decreases variable generation costs by approximately 0.1%-0.3% when MAPE is in the range of 3%-5%. These values are broadly consistent with the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "215\n", "authors": ["1391"]}
{"title": "Artificial neural networks for short-term energy forecasting: Accuracy and economic value\n", "abstract": " Sixteen electric utilities surveyed state that use of ANNs significantly reduced errors in daily electric load forecasts, while only three found otherwise. Data for five gas utilities reinforces this result: the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for ANN daily gas demand forecasts was 6.4%, a 1.9% improvement over previous methods. Yet ANNs were not always best, implying opportunities for further improvement. The economic value of error reduction for electric utilities was assessed by examining operating decisions. For 19 utilities surveyed, an average of $800\u2008000/year per utility is estimated to be saved from use of ANN-based forecasts. Most benefits resulted from improved generating unit scheduling; the utilities estimated such benefits to be up to $143 annually per peak MW of demand for each 1% improvement in MAPE. This estimated worth of accuracy improvement (roughly 0.1% of annual generation O&M\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "98\n", "authors": ["1391"]}
{"title": "Real\u2010time inverse planning for Gamma Knife radiosurgery\n", "abstract": " The challenges of real\u2010time Gamma Knife\u2122 inverse planning are the large number of variables involved and the unknown search space a priori. With limited collimator sizes, shots have to be heavily overlapped to form a smooth prescription isodose line that conforms to the irregular target shape. Such overlaps greatly influence the total number of shots per plan, making pre\u2010determination of the total number of shots impractical. However, this total number of shots usually defines the search space, a pre\u2010requisite for most of the optimization methods. Since each shot only covers part of the target, a collection of shots in different locations and various collimator sizes selected makes up the global dose distribution that conforms to the target. Hence, planning or placing these shots is a combinatorial optimization process that is computationally expensive by nature. We have previously developed a theory of shot\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "45\n", "authors": ["1391"]}
{"title": "Clinical evaluation of a Gamma Knife inverse planning system\n", "abstract": " The clinical evaluation of an in-house developed gamma knife inverse planning system is presented. This system utilizes morphological characteristics (skeleton) of a target to search for optimal shots. The planning process is very efficient and accurate as it determines shot locations and shot sizes (i.e., collimator size and weight combination) simultaneously, taking into consideration the target size as well as its shape. In addition, the process guarantees an optimal spatial arrangement among shots so that excessive \u2018hot spots\u2019 are avoided and the global dose distribution conforms to the target shape. Patient cases with different target volumes and shapes were tested retrospectively using this inverse planning system. For the patient cases presented, the number of shots used ranges from 7 to 20, the planning time is in the range of 1\u20133 min (2-GHz Pentium 4 workstation). The dose conformity indices range from 1.36\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["1391"]}
{"title": "An optimization-based treatment planner for gamma knife radiosurgery\n", "abstract": " This research addresses the planning of Gamma Knife radiotherapy, which is an alternative to treating a variety of brain abnormalities with surgery. The principal aim of this work is to develop an automated planning system that will make it simpler, less time consuming and hopefully more effective for the clinical personnel to develop treatment plans. Currently, treatment planning is a time-consuming task that involves an iterative process of shot selection, placement, and adjustment. Our goal is to replace the iterative part of the planning with an optimization-based real-time planner. Our strategy is to:(1) automate initial shot selection and placement using a combined process of skeletonization and bin-covering,(2) optimize the exposure time for each shot to improve the target coverage while minimizing toxicity to the surrounding tissues, and (3) fine-tune the shot configuration by adjusting shot locations, and adding or\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1391"]}
{"title": "An asymmetric cryptography using Gaussian integers\n", "abstract": " In this paper, the already strong McEliece cryptosystem is enhanced with a two-dimensional finite Gaussian integer. By substituting the one-dimensional linear code with a two-dimensional code employing a finite Gaussian integer, a new system simultaneously increases the key space and the errors to be correct by syndrome decoding. We compare the proposed system against the classic McEliece system in three aspects: the work factors performing the trial of the attacks, the computational complexity cost, and the empirical running time of the system. Compared to the classic McEliece cryptosystem, the enhanced cryptosystem achieves a higher security level against key recovering and decoding attacks. By carefully selecting parameters, a small code element can improve the key strength without compromising the runtime efficiency.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1391"]}
