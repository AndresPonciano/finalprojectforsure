{"title": "Reliability-based design optimization using confidence-based model validation for insufficient experimental data\n", "abstract": " The conventional reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) methods assume that a simulation model is able to represent the real physics accurately. However, this assumption may not always hold as the simulation model could be biased. Accordingly, designed product based on the conventional RBDO optimum may either not satisfy the target reliability or be overly conservative design. Therefore, simulation model validation using output experimental data, which corrects model bias, should be integrated in the RBDO process. With particular focus on RBDO, the model validation needs to account for the uncertainty induced by insufficient experimental data as well as the inherent variability of the products. In this paper, a confidence-based model validation method that captures the variability and the uncertainty, and that corrects model bias at a user-specified target confidence level, has been developed.

{"title": "Treating epistemic uncertainty using bootstrapping selection of input distribution model for confidence-based reliability assessment\n", "abstract": " Accurately predicting the reliability of a physical system under aleatory uncertainty requires a very large number of physical output testing. Alternatively, a simulation-based method can be used, but it would involve epistemic uncertainties due to imperfections in input distribution models, simulation models, and surrogate models, as well as a limited number of output testing due to cost. Thus, the estimated output distributions and their corresponding reliabilities would become uncertain. One way to treat epistemic uncertainty is to use a hierarchical Bayesian approach; however, this could result in an overly conservative reliability by integrating possible candidates of input distribution. In this paper, a new confidence-based reliability assessment method that reduces unnecessary conservativeness is developed.

{"title": "Adjoint design sensitivity analysis of dynamic crack propagation using peridynamic theory\n", "abstract": " Based on the peridynamics of the reformulated continuum theory, an adjoint design sensitivity analysis (DSA) method is developed for the solution of dynamic crack propagation problems using the explicit scheme of time integration. Non-shape DSA problems are considered for the dynamic crack propagation including the successive branching of cracks. The adjoint variable method is generally suitable for path-independent problems but employed in this bond-based peridynamics since its path is readily available. Since both original and adjoint systems possess time-reversal symmetry, the trajectories of systems are symmetric about the u-axis. We take advantage of the time-reversal symmetry for the efficient and concurrent computation of original and adjoint systems. Also, to improve the numerical efficiency of large scale problems, a parallel computation scheme is employed using a binary space\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1439"]}
{"title": "Target output distribution and distribution of bias for statistical model validation given a limited number of test data\n", "abstract": " Simulation model must be validated with experimental data to correctly predict the outputs of engineered systems before they can be used with confidence. While doing so, pointwise comparison between predicted output by simulation model and experimental data for model verification and validation (V&V) is not appropriate since real-world phenomena are not deterministic due to existence of irreducible uncertainty. Thus, the output prediction by a simulation model needs to be represented by a certain probability density function (PDF). Statistical model validation methods are necessary to compare the model prediction and physical test data. The validation of a simulation model entails the acquisition of extraordinarily detailed test data, which is expensive to generate, and practicing engineers can afford only a very limited number of test data.

{"title": "Development of a Conservative Model Validation Approach for Reliable Analysis\n", "abstract": " Simulation models are approximations of real-world physical systems. Therefore, simulation model validation is necessary for the simulation-based design process to provide reliable products. However, due to the cost of product testing, experimental data in the context of model validation is limited for a given design. When the experimental data is limited, a true output PDF cannot be correctly obtained. Therefore, reliable target output PDF needs to be used to update the simulation model. In this paper, a new model validation approach is proposed to obtain a conservative estimation of the target output PDF for validation of the simulation model in reliability analysis. The proposed method considers the uncertainty induced by insufficient experimental data in estimation of predicted output PDFs by using Bayesian analysis. Then, a target output PDF and a probability of failure are selected from these predicted output\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1439"]}

{"title": "Uncertainty quantification and statistical model validation for an offshore jacket structure panel given limited test data and simulation model\n", "abstract": " Due to inherent variability (ie, aleatory uncertainty) in material properties, loading conditions, manufacturing processes, etc., simulation output responses should follow certain distributions, which are the outcome of input distribution models and simulation models. Thus, uncertainty quantification (UQ) using simulation-based methods is accurate only if we have (1) accurate input distribution models and (2) an accurate simulation model. However, in practical engineering applications, only limited numbers of input test data are available for modeling input distributions. Moreover, the simulation model could be biased due to assumptions and idealizations in the modeling process. Thus, the simulation model needs to be validated to correctly predict the output response of the physical system.

{"title": "Confidence-Based Uncertainty Quantification and Reliability Assessment Using Limited Numbers of Input and Output Test Data and Validated Simulation Model\n", "abstract": " Accurate reliability assessment requires accurate output distribution. To obtain correct output distribution, a very large number of output physical test data is required, which is prohibitively expensive. Regarding this, simulation-based methods have been developed under the assumption that:(1) accurate input distribution models obtained from large number of input test data; and (2) accurate simulation model (including surrogate model if utilized) that correctly represents physical phenomena. However, in real application, only limited numbers of input test data are available. Thus, input distribution models are uncertain. In addition, the simulation model could be biased due to assumptions and idealizations. Furthermore, only a limited number of physical output test data is available. As a result, a target output distribution to which simulation model can be validated is uncertain and the corresponding reliability is also uncertain. This paper proposes a confidence-based reliability assessment that combines uncertainty due to insufficient input/output test data and biased simulation model. To do that, a hierarchical Bayesian analysis is formulated to obtain uncertainty distribution of reliability. After that, confidence-based reliability is selected at the user-specified target confidence level. It has been numerically demonstrated that the proposed method can estimate reliability of a product that satisfies the user-specified target confidence level.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1439"]}
