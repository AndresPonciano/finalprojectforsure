NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves 1 and in the first imaging of a black hole 2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data.

{"title": "Region of interest analysis using an SPM toolbox\n", "abstract": " Most functional imaging studies use analyses that look for effects anywhere in the brain. The standard approach is to calculate a statistic relating the experimental effect of interest to the data for each brain voxel. This method has the advantage that it can detect strong effects without apriori constraint on the area that activation will occur. Problems arise when we wish to ask the question whether a particular brain area has been activated: if we know the shape and location of the expected activity, then voxel by voxel approaches have low power, because of the multiple comparisons across voxels. Whole brain analyses usually use image smoothing in order to increase signal to noise; however, the best smoothing filter will depend on the shape of the activation, which may well not be matched by a standard kernel such as a Gaussian.The most direct answer to the question\" has this area been activated\" is to use a region\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3048\n", "authors": ["879"]}

In addition, lesion position and volume are directly comparable across patients. This article describes freely available software for presenting stereotaxically aligned patient scans.

While some of the resulting inhomogeneity can be corrected by the shimming process, much of it cannot, and this causes distortion (sometimes referred to as geometric distortion) of echo-planar images (EPIs).

To assess awareness more precisely than in previous studies, participants employed a 4-point scale to rate subjective visibility. An event-related fMRI and a high-density ERP study were carried out. Imaging data showed that conscious face detection was linked to activation of fusiform and occipital face areas. Frontal and parietal regions, including the pre-SMA, inferior frontal sulcus, anterior insula/frontal operculum, and intraparietal sulcus, also responded strongly when faces were consciously perceived. In contrast, no brain area showed face-selective activity when participants reported no impression of a face. ERP results showed that conscious face detection was associated with enhanced N170 and also with the presence of a second negativity around 300 msec and a slow positivity around 415\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "39\n", "authors": ["879"]}

Four slice orientations were used; axial, oblique axial, coronal and sagittal. We applied analysis of variance (ANOVA) to suprathreshold voxel statistics to quantify variability in activation between orientations and between subjects. We also assessed signal detection accuracy in voxels across the whole brain by using a finite mixture model to fit receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to the data. Preliminary findings suggest that suprathreshold cluster characteristics demonstrate high motor reproducibility across subjects and orientations, although a significant difference between slice orientations in number of activated voxels was demonstrated in left motor cortex but not cerebellum.

{"title": "Parametric procedures\n", "abstract": " This chapter is an introduction to inference using parametric procedures with focus on the multiple comparison problem in functional imaging, and the way it can be solved using random field theory (RFT). In a standard functional imaging analysis, we fit a statistical model to the data, to give us model parameters. We then use the model parameters to look for an effect we are interested in, such as the difference between a task and baseline. To do this, we usually calculate a statistic for each brain voxel that tests for the effect of interest in that voxel. The result is a large volume of statistic values. We now need to decide if this volume shows any evidence of the effect. To do this, we have to take into account that there are many thousands of voxels and therefore many thousands of statistic values. This is the multiple comparison problem in functional imaging. Random field theory is a recent branch of mathematics that can be used to solve this problem. To explain the use of RFT, we will first go back to the basics of hypothesis testing in statistics. We describe the multiple comparison problem and the usual solution, which is the Bonferroni correction. We explain why spatial correlation in imaging data causes problems for the Bonferroni correction and introduce RFT as a solution. Finally, we discuss the assumptions underlying RFT and the problems that arise when these assumptions do not hold. We hope this chapter will be accessible to those with no specific expertise in mathematics or statistics.

{"title": "Dipy, a library for the analysis of diffusion MRI data\n", "abstract": " Diffusion Imaging in Python (Dipy) is a free and open source software project for the analysis of data from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) experiments. dMRI is an application of MRI that can be used to measure structural features of brain white matter. Many methods have been developed to use dMRI data to model the local configuration of white matter nerve fiber bundles and infer the trajectory of bundles connecting different parts of the brain. Dipy gathers implementations of many different methods in dMRI, including: diffusion signal pre-processing; reconstruction of diffusion distributions in individual voxels; fiber tractography and fiber track post-processing, analysis and visualization. Dipy aims to provide transparent implementations for all the different steps of dMRI analysis with a uniform programming interface. We have implemented classical signal reconstruction techniques, such as the diffusion tensor model and deterministic fiber tractography. In addition, cutting edge novel reconstruction techniques are implemented, such as constrained spherical deconvolution and diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) with deconvolution, as well as methods for probabilistic tracking and original methods for tractography clustering. Many additional utility functions are provided to calculate various statistics, informative visualizations, as well as file-handling routines to assist in the development and use of novel techniques. In contrast to many other scientific software projects, Dipy is not being developed by a single research group.

This endogenous auto-correlation typically exhibits long-range dependence described by a 1/f-like power law. We present a novel wavelet-based methodology for characterising the noise structure in short-medium length (shortish) fMRI time series. Mono-fractality is assessed in terms of the Hurst exponent and the noise variance. We then investigate potential local stationarity of the Hurst exponent in MM data and present a uniformly most powerful test for its time constancy. A novel bootstrap approach is presented as an alternative to the normal assumption and its advantages are discussed. From several datasets investigated, we specifically show that the 1/f model is particularly suited to describe color in MM nose.

{"title": "Teaching computational reproducibility for neuroimaging\n", "abstract": " We describe a project-based introduction to reproducible and collaborative neuroimaging analysis. Traditional teaching on neuroimaging usually consists of a series of lectures that emphasize the big picture rather than the foundations on which the techniques are based. The lectures are often paired with practical workshops in which students run imaging analyses using the graphical interface of specific neuroimaging software packages. Our experience suggests that this combination leaves the student with a superficial understanding of the underlying ideas, and an informal, inefficient, and inaccurate approach to analysis. To address these problems, we based our course around a substantial open-ended group project. This allowed us to teach: (a) computational tools to ensure computationally reproducible work, such as the Unix command line, structured code, version control, automated testing, and code review and (b) a clear understanding of the statistical techniques used for a basic analysis of a single run in an MRI scanner. The emphasis we put on the group project showed the importance of standard computational tools for accuracy, efficiency, and collaboration. The projects were broadly successful in engaging students in working reproducibly on real scientific questions. We propose that a course on this model should be the foundation for future programs in neuroimaging. We believe it will also serve as a model for teaching efficient and reproducible research in other fields of computational science.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["879"]}
{"title": "HBM functional imaging analysis contest data analysis in wavelet space\n", "abstract": " An analysis of the Functional Imaging Analysis Contest (FIAC) data is presented using spatial wavelet processing. This technique allows the image to be filtered adaptively according to the data itself, rather than relying on a predetermined filter. This adaptive filtering leads to better estimation of the parameters and contrasts in terms of mean squared error. It will be shown that by introducing a slight bias into the estimation, a large reduction in the variance can be achieved, leading to better overall mean squared error estimates. As no single filter needs to be preselected, results containing many scales of information can be found. In the FIAC data, it is shown that both small\u2010scale and large\u2010scale (smoother, more dispersed) effects occur. The combination of small\u2010 and large\u2010scale effects detected in the FIAC data would be easy to miss using conventional single filter analysis.

Much of the computational burden of clustering techniques arises from the need for detailed geometric comparisons between pairs of tracks in large datasets often containing hundreds of thousands of tracks. We have developed an approach that leaves this more detailed comparison to a later stage after an initial first pass through the dataset to create prototype bundles. We present a fast method, which in less than 5 minutes generates preliminary clusters from a whole brain tractography dataset of 250,000 tracks. Our algorithm is inspired by the BIRCH algorithm (Zhang et al. 1996).

{"title": "Identification of corresponding tracks in diffusion MRI tractographies\n", "abstract": " Identifying manually corresponding tracks in different brain tractogaphies is a very complicated task, typically requiring lots of expertise, and lots of time. Moreover different local diffusion models and different tractography algorithms generate tractographies with wide differences in numbers of tracks and in shape characteristics. We address these problems by introducing an automatic method for detecting corresponding tracks in different dMRI (diffusion weighted MRI) datasets.Methods For two MNI registered brains, we generated two deterministic tractographies using DTK (Diffusion Toolkit)[1] with imaging model DTI and integration algorithms (a) FACT [5] and (b) second order Runge-Kutta (RK2). The output of DTK is a list of tracks ie curves composed of line segments. In our case each dataset contains~ 200.000 tracks where each track in turn consists of up to several hundred segments. Manipulating this number of segments is computationally demanding. Therefore, we implemented a track approximation method based on the minimum description length principle as described by Lee et. al.[2], with the addition of a smoothing parameter. Using this approximation method we can reduce considerably the number of segments per track while minimally reducing its resolution. Then we calculate distances between tracks using the mean average metric (MAM) as used by Corouge et. al [4] and Zhang et. al [3]. With this metric we identify corresponding tracks from different datasets with high consistency even where the global shapes of the tracks differ markedly eg in length or curvature. We can extend this method to identify corresponding track bundles\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["879"]}

Action generation is external if the choice of action is conditional on some external sensory cue, and internal if the choice of action is not dictated by an external stimulus. An early PET study of paced joystick movements gave only qualified support (2). It found that LPMC did not activate specifically when the direction of movement was conditional on the pitch of a tone cue, but SMA was more activated than other premotor areas during random movements.

{"title": "Large, colourful or noisy? Attribute-and modality-specific activations during retrieval of perceptual attribute knowledge\n", "abstract": " PET was used to investigate whether retrieval of perceptual knowledge from long-term memory activates unique cortical regions associated with the modality and/or attribute type retrieved. Knowledge about the typical colour, size and sound of common objects and animals was probed, in response to written words naming the objects. Relative to a non-semantic control task, all attribute judgements activated similar left temporal and frontal regions. Visual (colour, size) knowledge selectively activated right posterior inferior temporal (PIT) cortex, while sound judgements elicited selective activation in left posterior superior temporal gyrus and adjacent parietal cortex. All of the attribute judgements activated a left PIT region, but colour retrieval generated more activation in this area. Size judgements activated right medial parietal cortex. These results indicate that the retrieval of perceptual semantic information activates not only a general semantic network but also cortical areas specialised for the modality and attribute type of the knowledge retrieved.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["879"]}
