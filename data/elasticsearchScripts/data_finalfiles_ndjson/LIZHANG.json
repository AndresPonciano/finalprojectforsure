It is thought that tumor cells evade immunosurveillance by shedding membrane ligands that bind to the NKG2D-activating receptor on NK cells and/or T cells, and desensitize these cells. In contrast, we show that in mice, a shed form of MULT1, a high-affinity NKG2D ligand, causes NK cell activation and tumor rejection. Recombinant soluble MULT1 stimulated tumor rejection in mice. Soluble MULT1 functions, at least in part, by competitively reversing a global desensitization of NK cells imposed by engagement of membrane NKG2D ligands on tumor-associated cells, such as myeloid cells.

{"title": "An evaluation approach of subjective trust based on cloud model\n", "abstract": " As online trade and interactions on the internet are on the rise, a key issue is how to use simple and effective evaluation methods to accomplish trust decision-making for customers. It is well known that subjective trust holds uncertainty like randomness and fuzziness. However, existing approaches which are commonly based on probability or fuzzy set theory can not attach enough importance to uncertainty. To remedy this problem, a new quantifiable subjective trust evaluation approach is proposed based on the cloud model. Subjective trust is modeled with cloud model in the evaluation approach, and expected value and hyper-entropy of the subjective cloud is used to evaluate the reputation of trust objects. Our experimental data shows that the method can effectively support subjective trust decisions and provide a helpful exploitation for subjective trust evaluation.", "num_citations": "127\n", "authors": ["9"]}

Development of new antibiotics is limited, and pathogens continually generate new antibiotic resistance. Many researchers aim to identify strategies to effectively kill this drug-resistant pathogen. Here, we evaluated the effect of the antimicrobial peptide nisin on the antibacterial activities of 18 antibiotics against E. faecalis. The MIC and MBC results showed that the antibacterial activities of 18 antibiotics against E. faecalis OG1RF, ATCC 29212, and strain E were significantly improved in the presence of 200 U/ml nisin. Statistically significant differences were observed between the results with and without 200 U/ml nisin at the same concentrations of penicillin or chloramphenicol (p<0.05). The checkerboard assay showed that the combination of nisin and penicillin or chloramphenicol had a synergetic effect against the three tested E. faecalis strains. The transmission electron microscope images showed that E. faecalis was not obviously destroyed by penicillin or chloramphenicol alone but was severely disrupted by either antibiotic in combination with nisin. Furthermore, assessing biofilms by a confocal laser scanning microscope showed that penicillin, ciprofloxacin, and chloramphenicol all showed stronger antibiofilm actions in combination with nisin than when these antibiotics were administered alone. Therefore, nisin can significantly improve the antibacterial and antibiofilm activities of many antibiotics, and certain antibiotics in combination with nisin have considerable potential\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "84\n", "authors": ["9"]}

However, choosing a parametric model for the distribution of unmeasured heterogeneity is potentially subject to error and can have profound effects on predictions of abundance at unsampled locations.

Here we studied the function of coexpressed auxiliary subunits belonging to two different classes. We focused on TARP \u256c\u2502-8 and CKAMP44 in dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells, since both subunits are highly expressed in this cell type. TARP \u256c\u2502-8 and CKAMP44 decrease the rate of deactivation but have an opposing influence on receptor desensitization, which accounts for their differential modulation of synaptic short-term plasticity. Furthermore, long-term plasticity (LTP) requires TARP \u256c\u2502-8 but not CKAMP44. The coexpression of both auxiliary subunits is necessary for the efficient targeting of AMPARs to the cell surface of DG granule cells.

{"title": "Identification of gene modules associated with drought response in rice by network-based analysis\n", "abstract": " Understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie plant responses to drought stress is challenging due to the complex interplay of numerous different genes. Here, we used network-based gene clustering to uncover the relationships between drought-responsive genes from large microarray datasets. We identified 2,607 rice genes that showed significant changes in gene expression under drought stress; 1,392 genes were highly intercorrelated to form 15 gene modules. These drought-responsive gene modules are biologically plausible, with enrichments for genes in common functional categories, stress response changes, tissue-specific expression and transcription factor binding sites. We observed that a gene module (referred to as module 4) consisting of 134 genes was significantly associated with drought response in both drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive rice varieties. This module is enriched for genes involved in controlling the response of the plant to water and embryonic development, including a heat shock transcription factor as the key regulator in the expression of ABRE-containing genes. These results suggest that module 4 is highly conserved in the ABA-mediated drought response pathway in different rice varieties. Moreover, our study showed that many hub genes clustered in rice chromosomes had significant associations with QTLs for drought stress tolerance. The relationship between hub gene clusters and drought tolerance QTLs may provide a key to understand the genetic basis of drought tolerance in rice.", "num_citations": "66\n", "authors": ["9"]}

{"title": "Roles of Candida albicans Gat2, a GATA-type zinc finger transcription factor, in biofilm formation, filamentous growth and virulence\n", "abstract": " Candida albicans is the most common human fungal pathogen, causing not only superficial infections, but also life-threatening systemic disease. C. albicans can grow in several morphological forms including unicellular yeast-form, elongated hyphae and pseudohyphae. In certain natural environments, C. albicans also exists as biofilms, which are structured and surface-attached microbial communities. Transcription factors play a critical role in morphogenesis and biofilm development. In this study, we identified four adhesion-promoting transcription factors (Tec1, Cph1, Ume6 and Gat2) by screening a transcription factor overexpression library. Sequence analysis indicates that Gat2 is a GATA-type zinc finger transcription factor. Here we showed that the gat2/gat2 mutant failed to form biofilms on the plastic and silicone surfaces. Overexpression of GAT2 gene promoted filamentous and invasive growth on agar containing Lee's medium, while deletion of this gene had an opposite effect. However, inactivation of Gat2 had no obvious effect on N-acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc) induced hyphal development. In a mouse model of systemic infection, the gat2/gat2 mutant showed strongly attenuated virulence. Our results suggest that Gat2 plays a critical role in C. albicans biofilm formation, filamentous growth and virulence.", "num_citations": "62\n", "authors": ["9"]}

{"title": "Learning gene networks under SNP perturbations using eQTL datasets\n", "abstract": " The standard approach for identifying gene networks is based on experimental perturbations of gene regulatory systems such as gene knock-out experiments, followed by a genome-wide profiling of differential gene expressions. However, this approach is significantly limited in that it is not possible to perturb more than one or two genes simultaneously to discover complex gene interactions or to distinguish between direct and indirect downstream regulations of the differentially-expressed genes. As an alternative, genetical genomics study has been proposed to treat naturally-occurring genetic variants as potential perturbants of gene regulatory system and to recover gene networks via analysis of population gene-expression and genotype data. Despite many advantages of genetical genomics data analysis, the computational challenge that the effects of multifactorial genetic perturbations should be decoded simultaneously from data has prevented a widespread application of genetical genomics analysis. In this article, we propose a statistical framework for learning gene networks that overcomes the limitations of experimental perturbation methods and addresses the challenges of genetical genomics analysis. We introduce a new statistical model, called a sparse conditional Gaussian graphical model, and describe an efficient learning algorithm that simultaneously decodes the perturbations of gene regulatory system by a large number of SNPs to identify a gene network along with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) that perturb this network.

{"title": "Anxiolytic effects of flavonoids in animal models of posttraumatic stress disorder\n", "abstract": " The dysregulation of the serotonergic system has long been recognized as an important factor underlying the pathophysiology of PTSD. To date, SSRIs have already been established as the firstline pharmacotherapeutic agents for treating acute and chronic PTSD. However, SSRIs largely have several disadvantages which limit their utility. Our previous study has also shown that administration of the total flavonoids, isolated from the extract of Xiaobuxin-Tang (XBXT, mild mind-easing decoction), comprising four Chinese medicines including Haematitum, Flos Inulae, Folium Phyllostachydis Henonis, and Semen Sojae Preparatum, exerted significant antidepressant-like effect in chronically mildly stressed rats, possibly mediated by serotonergic activation. Since the central serotonergic dysfunction is an important and well-known cause mediating the pathophysiology of trauma-related symptoms in PTSD, it is reasonable to predict that flavonoids may exert therapeutic effects on PTSD in animal models. Therefore, the present study aims to examine the effect of flavonoids in alleviating the enhanced anxiety and fear response induced in two PTSD animal models. Ser, an SSRI, was administered as a positive control. Furthermore, the changes of brain monoaminergic neurotransmitters after chronic flavonoids administration have also been assessed in SPS-treated rats.", "num_citations": "56\n", "authors": ["9"]}

Nevertheless, when applied for practical use, the coating method and coating stability of are also important factors that will directly affect the removal efficiency. In the present study, a simple and economical spray coating method was developed to effectively immobilize TiO2 nanoparticles onto a polyester fiber filter at low temperature. Colloidal silica was added as a binder in the coating suspension. PCO efficiency evaluation of the coating was carried out using gaseous formaldehyde. The results indicate that the formaldehyde removal rate is associated with the amount of binder added. The highest removal rate was achieved for a coating with the TiO2 to binder (SiO2 equivalent) mass ratio of 1:1, with the results supported by XRF, SEM, FTIR and BET analyses. As compared to the conventional dip coating method, the spray-coated sample showed much higher PCO efficiency and stability, which may be mainly attributed to the more uniform dispersion of the catalyst and the stronger binding formed during high pressure spray coating.

{"title": "Boron sheet adsorbed on metal surfaces: Structures and electronic properties\n", "abstract": " Using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory, we studied the possible geometric configurations and electronic structures of three types of monolayer boron sheets (BSs) on different metal (Mg, Al, Ti, Au, and Ag) surfaces. We find that, when adsorbed on metal surfaces, hexagonal BS (h-BS) is more energy-favorable than triangular BS or mixed hexagonal-triangular BS, and the atop-site adsorption configuration is the most favored. For all h-BS/metal configurations, electrons are observed to transfer from metal to BS, due to the intrinsic electron deficiency of h-BS. Electronic structure analyses show that the substrates could be classified into two types according to the interactions between boron and metal: (1) h-BS on Mg(0001), Al(111), or Ti(0001) shows a relatively larger charge transfer and stronger BS\u0393\u00c7\u00f4metal interactions, and the \u2567\u00e2 (in-plane) bands have the same profile as freestanding h-BS\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "48\n", "authors": ["9"]}

To date, no SVC outbreak has been reported in China. Between 1998 and 2002, outbreaks of SVC were reported in ornamental and wild fish in Europe and America, imported from multiple sources including China. Based on phylogenetic analysis, the viral strain isolated from America was shown to be originated from Asia. These outbreaks not only resulted in huge economic losses, but also raise an interesting question as to whether SVCV really exists in China and if so, is it responsible for SVC outbreaks? From 2002 to 2006, we screened 6700 samples from ornamental fish farms using the cell culture method of the Office International des Epizooties (OIE), and further verified the presence of SVCV by ELISA and real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Two infected samples were found and the complete genome of SVCV was sequenced from one of the isolates, termed SVCV-C1. Several unique hallmarks of SVCV-C1 were identified, including six amino acid (KSLANA) insertion in the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) protein and ten nucleotide insertion in the region between glycoprotein (G) and L genes in European SVCV strains. Phylogenetic tree analysis of the full-length G protein of selected SVCV isolates from the United Kingdom and United States revealed that G proteins could be classified into Ia and Id sub genogroups. The Ia sub genogroup can be further divided into newly defined sub genogroups Ia-A and Ia-B.

Their model is, however, limited because it calculates bed cover in terms of bedload sediment supply rather than local bedload transport. It implicitly assumes that as sediment supply from upstream changes, the transport rate adjusts instantaneously everywhere downstream to match. This assumption is not valid in general, and thus can give rise to unphysical consequences. Here we present a unified morphodynamic formulation of both channel incision and alluviation that specifically tracks the spatiotemporal variation in both bedload transport and alluvial thickness. It does so by relating the bedrock cover fraction to the ratio of alluvium thickness to bedrock macro-roughness, rather than to the ratio of bedload supply rate to capacity bedload transport. The new formulation (MRSAA) predicts waves of alluviation and rarification, in addition to bedrock erosion. Embedded in it are three physical processes: alluvial diffusion, fast downstream advection of alluvial disturbances, and slow upstream migration of incisional disturbances. Solutions of this formulation over a fixed bed are used to demonstrate the stripping of an initial alluvial cover, the emplacement of alluvial cover over an initially bare bed and the advection\u0393\u00c7\u00f4diffusion of a sediment pulse over an alluvial bed.

We report here that KLF9 is downregulated in HCC tissues. Restoration of KLF9 significantly inhibited growth and caused apoptosis in SK-Hep1 and HepG2 cells. We found that KLF9 positively regulated p53 levels by directly binding to GC boxes within the proximal region of the p53 promoter. Moreover, in the presence of cycloheximide, KLF9 significantly increased p53 stability in HCC cells. Remarkably, ectopic expression of KLF9 was sufficient to delay the onset of tumors and to promote regression of the established tumors in vivo, suggesting that KLF9 plays a critical role in HCC development and that pharmacological or genetic activation of KLF9 may have potential in the treatment of HCC.", "num_citations": "44\n", "authors": ["9"]}

{"title": "A cotton annexin protein AnxGb6 regulates fiber elongation through its interaction with actin 1\n", "abstract": " Annexins are assumed to be involved in regulating cotton fiber elongation, but direct evidence remains to be presented. Here we cloned six Annexin genes (AnxGb) abundantly expressed in fiber from sea-island cotton (G. barbadense). qRT-PCR results indicated that all six G. barbadense annexin genes were expressed in elongating cotton fibers, while only the expression of AnxGb6 was cotton fiber-specific. Yeast two hybridization and BiFC analysis revealed that AnxGb6 homodimer interacted with a cotton fiber specific actin GbAct1. Ectopic-expressed AnxGb6 in Arabidopsis enhanced its root elongation without increasing the root cell number. Ectopic AnxGb6 expression resulted in more F-actin accumulation in the basal part of the root cell elongation zone. Analysis of AnxGb6 expression in three cotton genotypes with different fiber length confirmed that AnxGb6 expression was correlated to cotton fiber length, especially fiber elongation rate. Our results demonstrated that AnxGb6 was important for fiber elongation by potentially providing a domain for F-actin organization.", "num_citations": "44\n", "authors": ["9"]}

By flattening the noise amplification due to the waterbed effect in the whole disturbance amplification frequency band intuitively, the designed feedback controller can suppress the disturbance amplification to almost the minimum value for the given disturbance attenuation and ensure good stability of the system. Being compared with the existing approaches, the main advantage of the proposed approach is its simplicity for implementation, which avoids complicated weight function selections and the numerical optimizations of the existing approaches. Detailed design procedures and implementation of the digital controller are illustrated, simulation and experiment results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "num_citations": "44\n", "authors": ["9"]}

The feasibility of applying the method in a specific transformer algorithm is investigated, where the effects of frequency mismatch and secondary path delay on the steady-state behavior of the transformer algorithm are analyzed and compared with the filtered-x least mean square algorithm. It is found that the noise reduction performance degrades with the increase of secondary path delay and frequency mismatch, but can be improved by using a larger convergence step size and a faster update rate. With parameter studies, the feasibility of applying the transformer algorithm with an internally synthesized reference signal to practical transformer noise control is verified by both numerical simulations and experiments.", "num_citations": "44\n", "authors": ["9"]}

{"title": "Graphene oxide as a nano-platform for ATP detection based on aptamer chemistry\n", "abstract": " Because of its rich \u2567\u00c7 electrons, graphene oxide (GO) can bind with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) through \u2567\u00c7-\u2567\u00c7 stacking, but it cannot bind with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). This different binding ability of GO with DNA has found many applications. By combining this ability with aptamer chemistry, we have developed a highly selective method for the detection of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The hybrid of ATP aptamer with fluorescein (FAM)-labelled complementary DNA (FAM-DNA) demonstrates a weak affinity for GO and strong fluorescence of FAM-DNA. If ATP is present the strong fluorescence of FAM-DNA is quenched, because the binding of ATP with its aptamer greatly inhibits hybridization of the aptamer with FAM-DNA, and the unhybridized FAM-DNA is adsorbed on to the surface of GO. The quenched fluorescence intensity was found to be in proportion to the concentration of ATP in the range 3\u0393\u00c7\u00f4320 \u256c\u255dM\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "44\n", "authors": ["9"]}

{"title": "Advances and prospects in tissue-engineered meniscal scaffolds for meniscus regeneration\n", "abstract": " The meniscus plays a crucial role in maintaining knee joint homoeostasis. Meniscal lesions are relatively common in the knee joint and are typically categorized into various types. However, it is difficult for inner avascular meniscal lesions to self-heal. Untreated meniscal lesions lead to meniscal extrusions in the long-term and gradually trigger the development of knee osteoarthritis (OA). The relationship between meniscal lesions and knee OA is complex. Partial meniscectomy, which is the primary method to treat a meniscal injury, only relieves short-term pain; however, it does not prevent the development of knee OA. Similarly, other current therapeutic strategies have intrinsic limitations in clinical practice. Tissue engineering technology will probably address this challenge by reconstructing a meniscus possessing an integrated configuration with competent biomechanical capacity. This review describes normal structure and biomechanical characteristics of the meniscus, discusses the relationship between meniscal lesions and knee OA, and summarizes the classifications and corresponding treatment strategies for meniscal lesions to understand meniscal regeneration from physiological and pathological perspectives.

{"title": "Label-free colorimetric sensing of ascorbic acid based on Fenton reaction with unmodified gold nanoparticle probes and multiple molecular logic gates\n", "abstract": " A label-free strategy based on Fenton reaction with unmodified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as probe is demonstrated for ascorbic acid (AA) sensing. AuNPs is stable in the presence of single stranded DNA (ssDNA) which prevents salt-induced aggregation of AuNPs in solution.

As an efficient biological antioxidant, AA could effectively scavenge free radicals to avoid the cleavage of ssDNA, so that it prevents color change of the AuNPs solution. Thus, the color change of AuNPs in the presence and absence of AA provides a new approach for the detection of AA.

Various carbonaceous precursors and solvents were selected and hundreds of reaction conditions were screened (ca. 15 min on average per condition). Through analyzing the screened conditions, tunable PL emission maxima, from about 330 to 550 nm with respectable PL quantum yields, were achieved. Moreover, the relationship between different developmental stages of the CDs and the PL properties was explored by using the microreactor. The PL emission was observed to be independent of the composition, carbonization extent, and morphology/size of the CDs. This study unambiguously presents that a microreactor could serve as a promising tool for the research of CDs.Since Scrivens and co-workers found luminescent carbon dots (CDs) in 2004,[1] CDs have received great interests due to the huge potential of applications, such as in energy conversion/storage, bioimaging, drug delivery, sensors, diagnostics, and so on.[2] Similar to the widely applied semiconductor quantum dots (CdSe, CdTe, PbS, etc.), CDs show advanced tunable photoluminescent (PL) emission properties, high photostability, broad excitation spectra, and ultrasmall particle sizes.[3] The exceptional biocompatibility and environmental friendliness of CDs, however, could greatly reduce the concerns of cytotoxicity and environmental pollution, and these make CDs an excellent alternative to traditional semiconductor quantum dots.[4]", "num_citations": "41\n", "authors": ["9"]}

The lipid vesicles containing uricase (UOXLVs) were prepared and the process parameters were optimized with the indexes of entrapment efficiency, polydispersion, particle size, and zeta potential. The storage stability of uricase in lipid vesicles was significantly increased compared to that of free uricase at 4\u252c\u2591C. The stability to proteolytic digestion was also increased obviously by entrapping the uricase in the lipid vesicles. In vitro and in vivo pharmacodynamic studies on the hyperuricemia rat model explicitly suggested that the uricase entrapped by UOXLVs possessed high uricolytic activity and distinctively decreased the uric acid level.", "num_citations": "40\n", "authors": ["9"]}

{"title": "MAXSAT heuristics for cost optimal planning\n", "abstract": " The cost of an optimal delete relaxed plan, known as h+, is a powerful admissible heuristic but is in general intractable to compute. In this paper we examine the problem of computing h+ by encoding it as a MAXSAT problem. We develop a new encoding that utilizes constraint generation to support the computation of a sequence of increasing lower bounds on h+. We show a close connection between the computations performed by a recent approach for solving MAXSAT and a hitting set approach recently proposed for computing h+. Using this connection we observe that our MAXSAT computation can be initialized with a set of landmarks computed by LM-cut. By judicious use of MAXSAT solving along with a technique of lazy heuristic evaluation we obtain speedups for finding optimal plans over LM-cut on a number of domains. Our approach enables the exploitation of continued progress in MAXSAT solving, and also makes it possible to consider computing or approximating heuristics that are even more informed that h+ by, for example, adding some information about deletes back into the encoding.", "num_citations": "36\n", "authors": ["9"]}

This Review outlines the role of H2O during the CO2 capture process using CaO\u0393\u00c7\u00c9based sorbents. The role of steam/H2O in sorbent reactivation, the effect of steam on carbonation and calcination, and the influence of steam when simultaneously existing in both carbonation and calcination stages are discussed. It is suggested that injection of steam in both carbonator and calciner is a good strategy to achieve better reactivity of the CaO\u0393\u00c7\u00c9based sorbent for CO2 capture. The mechanisms of the effect of steam in carbonator and calciner on CO2 capture are also\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "33\n", "authors": ["9"]}

{"title": "Exercise training preserves ischemic preconditioning in aged rat hearts by restoring the myocardial polyamine pool\n", "abstract": " Background. Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) strongly protects against myocardial ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury. However, IPC protection is ineffective in aged hearts. Exercise training reduces the incidence of age-related cardiovascular disease and upregulates the ornithine decarboxylase (ODC)/polyamine pathway. The aim of this study was to investigate whether exercise can reestablish IPC protection in aged hearts and whether IPC protection is linked to restoration of the cardiac polyamine pool. Methods. Rats aging 3 or 18 months perform treadmill exercises with or without gradient respectively for 6 weeks. Isolated hearts and isolated cardiomyocytes were exposed to an IR and IPC protocol. Results. IPC induced an increase in myocardial polyamines by regulating ODC and spermidine/spermine acetyltransferase (SSAT) in young rat hearts, but IPC did not affect polyamine metabolism in aged hearts. Exercise training inhibited the loss of preconditioning protection and restored the polyamine pool by activating ODC and inhibiting SSAT in aged hearts. An ODC inhibitor, \u256c\u2592-difluoromethylornithine, abolished the recovery of preconditioning protection mediated by exercise. Moreover, polyamines improved age-associated mitochondrial dysfunction in vitro. Conclusion. Exercise appears to restore preconditioning protection in aged rat hearts, possibly due to an increase in intracellular polyamines and an improvement in mitochondrial function in response to a preconditioning stimulus.", "num_citations": "32\n", "authors": ["9"]}

However, the role of VEZT in tumorigenesis remains elusive. We aimed to clarify its epigenetic regulation and biological functions in gastric cancer. In this study, we show that the expression level of VEZT is involved in lymphatic metastasis, depth of cancer invasion and TNM stage in 104 gastric cancer patients. Bisulfate sequencing polymerase chain reaction (BSP) methods showed that VEZT was hypermethylated in tissues and corresponding blood of gastric cancer patients compared with healthy controls. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection induces the methylation and silencing of VEZT in GES-1 cells. Restoring VEZT expression in MKN-45 and NCI-N87 gastric cancer cells inhibited growth, invasion and tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. Global microarray analysis was applied to analyze the molecular basis of the biological functions of VEZT after VEZT transfection combined with real-time PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. G protein-coupled receptor 56(GPR56), cell growth, cell division cycle 42(CDC42), migration/invasion and transcription factor 19(TCF19), cell cycle progression, were identified as direct VEZT target genes. TCF19, a novel target of VEZT, was functionally validated. Overexpression of TCF19 in MKN-45 cells increased cell cycle progress and growth ability.

This method can make the peptides avoid being trapped in the local minima for a long time and enhance the sampling efficiency in conformational space during the simulation.

However, the mechanisms by which pancreatic cancer cells utilize their extracellular molecules to counteract the proapoptotic signaling mediated by the TNF family are largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that DcR3, a secreted decoy receptor that malignant pancreatic cancer cells express at a high level, acts as an extracellular antiapoptotic molecule by binding to TRAIL and counteracting its death-promoting function. The reduction of DcR3 with siRNA unmasked TRAIL and greatly enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Gemcitabine, a first-line drug for pancreatic cancer, also reduced the level of DcR3. The addition of DcR3 siRNA further enhanced gemcitabine-induced apoptosis. Notably, our in vivo study demonstrated that the therapeutic effect of gemcitabine could be enhanced via further reduction of DcR3, suggesting that downregulation of DcR3 in tumor cells could tip the balance of pancreatic cells towards apoptosis and potentially serve as a new strategy for pancreatic cancer therapy.", "num_citations": "31\n", "authors": ["9"]}

Thus far, no standard chemotherapeutic regimen has been established and related data are scarce, especially in Eastern countries. The purpose of this multicenter study was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of oxaliplatin combined with fluoropyrimidines in Chinese patients with advanced SBA. METHODS: Advanced SBA patients who received FOLFOX (5-fluorouracil/5-FU plus leucovorin and oxaliplatin)/CAPOX (capecitabine plus oxaliplatin) as first-line chemotherapy between February, 2004 and October, 2010 were identified from 3 large medical centers in China. The response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and chemotherapy-associated toxicity were evaluated. Cox models were applied for multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Of 34 patients, with SBA 28 received FOLFOX and 6 CAPOX. The objective response (OR) and disease control (DC) rates were 32.3% and 61.7%, respectively.

While the latter interlayer is dominated by falling silty seams inside mid-channel bars, interbar muds and chute fillings. Moreover, the identification of single-phase channel sand bodies in uninterruptedly distributed thick sand layers revealed the distribution of single-sandbody interface layers. Guided by previous studies on modern deposits and outcrops, we predicted the distribution of inner architecture surfaces within mid-channel bars through multiple wells correlation, and accordingly established a 3D model of inner interlayers of mid-channel bars under control of internal architecture surfaces by stochastic modeling, which demonstrated a discontinuous distribution of and a poor consistency between inner interlayers in mid-channel bars.

To elucidate the role of FLT3/ITD signaling in B-cell development, we studied VDJ recombination in the pro-B cells of FLT3/ITD mice and discovered an increased frequency of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) introduced by the VDJ recombinase. Early pro-B cells from FLT3/ITD mice were found to have a lower efficiency and decreased accuracy of DSB repair by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), which is required for rejoining DSBs during VDJ recombination. Reduced NHEJ repair probably results from reduced expression of Ku86, a key component of the classic DNA-PK-dependent NHEJ pathway.

The expression of MxCS1 was enriched in the leaf rather than in phloem and root, however, its expression was hardly detected in the xylem. The gene expression was strongly induced by Fe stress treatment in the M. xiaojinensis seedlings. Over-expression of MxCS1 improved Fe deficiency tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis.

Feeding sesamin at the dietary level of 0.2% from 14 to 16d resulted in an enlargement of liver weight. Ketone body production was significantly elevated in the livers perfused with oleic acid in comparison with those perfused without an exogenous-free fatty acid, and sesamin feeding caused a stimulation of ketone body production, especially when exogenous oleic acid was provided. On the other hand, the ratio of \u255e\u00c6\u251c\u00c7-hydroxybutyrate to aceto acetate, an index of mitochondrial redox potential, tended to increase in the livers perfused with oleic acid compared with those without fatty acid, though it was consistently lowered by dietary sesamin. The cumulative secretion of triacylglycerol, but not of cholesterol, by the livers from sesamin-fed rats was decreased markedly, especially when exogenous oleic acid was provided, suggesting an inverse relationship between the rates of ketogenesis and triacylglycerol secretion. These results suggest that dietary sesamin exerts its hypotriglyceridemic effect at least in part through an enhanced metabolism of exogenous-free fatty acid to oxidation at the expense of esterification in rat liver.", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["9"]}

Through classical mutagenesis of Wisconsin54-1255, product titers and productivities of penicillin have dramatically increased, but what underlying genome structural variations is still little known. Therefore, genome sequencing of a high-penicillin producing industrial strain is very meaningful. To reveal more insights into the genome structural variations of high-penicillin producing strain, we sequenced an industrial strain P. chrysogenum NCPC10086. By whole genome comparative analysis, we observed a large number of mutations, insertions and deletions, and structural variations. There are 69 new genes that not exist in the genome sequence of Wisconsin54-1255 and some of them are involved in energy metabolism, nitrogen metabolism and glutathione metabolism. Most importantly, we discovered a 53.7 Kb \"new shift fragment\" in a seven copies of determinative penicillin biosynthesis cluster in NCPC10086 and the arrangement type of amplified region is unique. Moreover, we presented two large-scale translocations in NCPC10086, containing genes involved energy, nitrogen metabolism and peroxysome pathway.

{"title": "Optimized feature selection towards functional and non-functional requirements in software product lines\n", "abstract": " As an important research issue in software product line, feature selection is extensively studied. Besides the basic functional requirements (FRs), the non-functional requirements (NFRs) are also critical during feature selection. Some NFRs have numerical constraints, while some have not. Without clear criteria, the latter are always expected to be the best possible. However, most existing selection methods ignore the combination of constrained and unconstrained NFRs and FRs. Meanwhile, the complex constraints and dependencies among features are perpetual challenges for feature selection. To this end, this paper proposes a multi-objective optimization algorithm IVEA to optimize the selection of features with NFRs and FRs by considering the relations among these features. Particularly, we first propose a two-dimensional fitness function. One dimension is to optimize the NFRs without quantitative constraints\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["9"]}

The composite fibers included those of Ag/polybutadiene rubber (BR), Ag/polyisobutylene-isoprene rubber (IIR), and Ag/silicon rubber (SiR). During the study, Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were first generated through reducing the Ag+ ions in rubber/N, N-dimethyformamide/tetrahydrofuran solutions upon ultraviolet-irradiation; subsequently, rubber composite fibers with uniform diameters from hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers were made by electrospinning the above solutions. The electrospinning was carried out with in-situ chemical crosslinking. The results indicated that chemical crosslinking during (and shortly after) electrospinning was able to improve substantially the morphological stability of rubber fibers. As indicated by the results acquired from UV absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscope, Ag nanoparticles with sizes of 10~ 20 nm were uniformly dispersed in rubber fibers. It was believed that, in addition to the protection of polyvinyl pyrrolidone, a rapid solvent evaporation and limited motion space for a very fine fiber during electrospinning could prevent/mitigate the aggregation of Ag NPs, resulting in a very uniform dispersion. The electrospun Ag NPs/BR composite fibers made of the solution containing very low loading amount (3 wt%) of AgNO3 demonstrated strong antimicrobial activity.", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["9"]}

By examining central transfer payments to Chinese counties, which deliver the bulk of the public goods, this paper discusses and tests an alternative set of motivations for transfer payments in autocracies. Given sufficient time horizon, the autocrat has strong incentive to pay off local defenders of the regime, as well as incentive to promote development through awarding growth and supporting education. In sharp contrast to democracies, however, autocracies have little incentive to transfer money to areas with higher shares of the elderly, since they do not vote and their contribution to long-term growth is discounted.

Both exogenous trans fatty acid and dietary sesamin, as compared with respective controls, resulted in a marked increase in hepatic ketogenesis; however, the \u255e\u00c6\u251c\u00c7-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate ratio was elevated by exogenous fatty acid and decreased by dietary sesamin. On the other hand, hepatic secretions of triacylglycerol, phospholipid and cholesterol were markedly lowered in rats fed sesamin, especially when exogenous fatty acid substrate was provided. The relative significance of the exogenous fatty acid was observed in the dietary sesamin-induced decrease in hepatic secretion of triacylglycerol. These results suggest that increased fatty acid oxidation by dietary sesamin, as reflected by enhanced ketone body production, leads to decreased partition of fatty acid substrates to the esterification pathways, and this in turn reduces the synthesis and secretion of triacyl glycerol. The altered metabolism of exogenous fatty acids in the liver was therefore a major determinant for the synthesis and secretion of triacylglycerol.", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["9"]}

It is found that the HM is a rather complex phenomenon, determined by the ligand field splitting of d-orbitals of the transition metal atoms, the exchange splitting and the number of valence electrons. Since most of the conjugated carbon based structures possess ligands with intermediate strength, the ordering of the d-orbital splitting is similar in all structures, and the HM properties evolve according to the number of valence electrons. Based on this insight we predict that Cr-, Fe-and Co-doped graphyne will show HM, while Mn-and Ni-doped graphyne will not.

Finally, we were able to clarify that TNnM classification may provide more precise survival differences among the different TNM sub-stages of GC by using the measure of agreement (Kappa coefficient), the McNemar value, the Akaike information criterion, and the Bayesian Information Criterion compared with the seventh edition of the TNM classification.   ConclusionThe number of negative nodes, as an important prognostic predictor of GC, can improve the prognostic prediction efficiency of the seventh edition of the TNM\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["9"]}

Recently, urokinase receptor (uPAR) and its soluble form have been shown to cause podocyte injury and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Here, our findings showed that 1,25(OH)2D3 did inhibit podocyte uPAR expression and attenuate proteinuria and podocyte injury.  Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, the antiproteinuric effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 was examined in the lipopolysaccharide mice model of transient proteinuria (LPS mice) and in the 5/6 nephrectomy rat FSGS model(NTX rats). uPAR protein expression were tested by flow cytometry, immune cytochemistry and western blot analysis, and uPAR mRNA expression by real-time quantitative PCR in cultured podocytes and kidney glomeruli isolated from mice and rats. Podocyte motility was observed by transwell migration assay and wound healing assay. Podocyte foot processes effacement was identified by transmission electron microscopy. We found that 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibited podocyte uPAR mRNA and protein synthesis in LPS-treated podocytes, LPS mice and NTX rats, along with 1,25(OH)2D3 reducing proteinuria in NTX rats and LPS mice.1,25(OH)2D3 reduced glomerulosclerosis in NTX rats and alleviated podocyte foot processes effacement in LPS mice.

In this study, it was investigated whether ocotillol could enhance the antiproliferation activity of Dox. MTT assays and xenograft tumor model were firstly conducted to evaluate the effect of ocotillol on the antitumor activity of Dox. Flow cytometry and Hoechst staining assays were then performed to assess cell apoptosis. Western blot and real-time PCR were finally used to detect the expression of p53 and its target genes. Our results showed ocotillol to enhance Dox-induced cell death in p53 wild-type cancer cells. Compared with Dox alone, Dox with ocotillol (Dox-O) could induce much more cell apoptosis and activate p53 to a much greater degree, which in turn markedly increased expression of proapoptosis genes. The enhanced cytotoxic activity was partially blocked by pifithrin-\u256c\u2592, which might be through attenuating the increased apoptosis. Furthermore, ocotillol significantly increased the antitumor activity of Dox in A549 xenograft tumor in nude mice.

In this article, we describe a statistical model for testing haplotype-haplotype interactions for human diseases with a case-control genetic association design. The model is formulated on a contingency table in which cases and controls are typed for the same set of molecular markers. By integrating well-established quantitative genetic principles, the model is equipped with a capacity to characterize physiologically meaningful epistasis arising from interactions between haplotypes from different chromosomal regions. The model allows the partition of epistasis into different components due to additive \u251c\u00f9 additive, additive \u251c\u00f9 dominance, dominance \u251c\u00f9 additive, and dominance \u251c\u00f9 dominance interactions. We derive the EM algorithm to estimate and test the effects of each of these components on differences in the pattern of genetic variation between cases and controls and, therefore, examine their role in the pathogenesis of human diseases. The method was further extended to investigate gene-environment interactions expressed at the haplotype level. The statistical properties of the models were investigated through simulation studies and its usefulness and utilization validated by analyzing the genetic association of sarcoidosis from a human genetics project.", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["9"]}

The explicit formulations of the control equations for the BFEM are derived using the modified complementary energy principle. The BFEM is naturally universal for small displacement and large displacement problems. A number of example problems are solved using the BFEM and the results are compared with corresponding analytical solutions.

The present research demonstrates that consumers can make better decisions (i.e., choose what yields a better consumption experience) if objective specifications are removed and direct comparison is inhibited than if not, and this is true even if consumers cannot experience the target products themselves at the time of choice (such as in online shopping). The reason is that consumption is largely subjective and non-comparative, and decisions based on subjective and non-comparative information are often more compatible with consumption.

The solid diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrum of the SnP sensitized TiO2 photocatalyst (SnP-TiO2) indicated that there existed interaction between SnP and TiO2. It was found that SnP-TiO2 exhibited an enhanced visible light photocatalytic activity as compared with that over P25 for the degradation of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) and methyl orange (MO) in aqueous solutions. The mechanism exploration showed that the degradation of MO and 4-NP experienced two different ways, that is, MO was photodegraded by reactive oxygen species and 4-NP was directly photodegraded by the excited state of SnP.

STR markers were amplified by PCR and genotypes were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis in 103 trio families. TDT was used to locate the susceptibility gene in 17q21 region. RESULTS: Because of a low genetic polymorphism, D17S810 and D17S931 loci were removed from the TDT. Transmission disequilibrium was detected at D17S855, D17S858, D17S806, D17S1877, D17S941, D17S752 and D17S790, which overlapped 11.7 cM in 17q21.

Several numerical tests are performed to validate the capability of FLUENT on describing the wind field details over a complex terrain. The results of the numerical tests show that FLUENT can simulate the wind field over extremely complex terrain, which cannot be simulated by mesoscale models. The reason why FLUENT can cope with extremely complex terrain, which can not be coped with by mesoscale models, relies on some particular techniques adopted by FLUENT, such as computer-aided design (CAD) technique, unstructured grid technique and finite volume method. Compared with mesoscale models, FLUENT can describe terrain in much more accurate details and can provide wind simulation results with higher resolution and more accuracy.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["9"]}

The analysis of free-span, including static analysis and dynamic analysis, is an important subject in the study of pipeline integrity management. Static analysis of free span for subsea pipeline is to evaluate the stress distribution of spanning pipeline in the ultimate conditions, and qualify the stress with design codes in the engineering analysis. However, dynamic analysis of subsea spanning pipeline is much complicated due to VIV fatigue. In 2006 DNV-RP-F105 suggested a methodology of dynamic analysis for long spanning pipeline with multi-mode responses, but the fatigue analysis method for multi-modes is not detailed. In addition, the fatigue analysis of multi-spanning pipeline is not clear.

Three indicators-the coefficient of variation (CV), the Gini coefficient and the Theil index-are calculated for analysis. Findings reveal that the trajectory of regional disparities in urbanisation displays a trend that is different from that of regional economic disparity. The inter-provincial disparities in urbanisation narrowed in the study period due to the decline of intra-regional disparity in urbanisation. Since 2000, inter-regional disparity in urbanisation had also been reduced. In contrast, inter-provincial disparity in economic growth was explained mainly by inter-regional disparity.

The phenotypes of white and opaque cells are heritable and bistable. The zinc-finger transcription factor Wor2 (White Opaque Regulator 2) has previously been identified as an important regulator of white-to-opaque switching. Deletion of WOR2 locks cells in the white phase when cultured on media containing glucose as the sole carbon source. In this study, we report that N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) can induce white-to-opaque switching in the wor2/wor2 null mutant and stabilize the opaque phenotype of C. albicans. Moreover, overexpression of RAS1V13 (the activating form of RAS1) hypersensitizes white cells of the wor2/wor2 mutant to GlcNAc.

{"title": "Study on the micro-scale simulation of wind field over complex terrain by RAMS/FLUENT modeling system\n", "abstract": " A meteorological model, RAMS, and a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, FLUENT are combined as a one-way off-line nested modeling system, namely, RAMS/FLUENT system. The system is experimentally applied in the wind simulation over a complex terrain, with which numerical simulations of wind field over Foyeding weather station located in the northwest mountainous area of Beijing metropolis are performed. The results show that the method of combining a meteorological model and a CFD model as a modeling system is reasonable. In RAMS/FLUENT system, more realistic boundary conditions are provided for FLUENT rather than idealized vertical wind profiles, and the finite volume method (FVM) of FLUENT ensures the capability of the modeling system on describing complex terrain in the simulation. Thus, RAMS/FLUENT can provide fine-scale realistic wind data over complex terrains.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["9"]}
{"title": "Mechanical constraint on size-assortative paring success in a temperate frog: an experimental approach\n", "abstract": " In anurans with axillary amplexus, males may be unable to handle females much different in body size from them due to physical limitation. Such mechanical constraint during the grasping processes is thought to be one of the proximate mechanisms leading to pairs to form size-assortively. Using a pairing experiment, the purpose of this study was to test this prediction for a temperate frog (Rana chensinensis) wherein some size-assortative matings occur in natural populations. We found a reduced probability of pairing success as the difference between sexes. When one female was much larger than one male that attempted to grasp her, she tended to dislodge aggressively him, suggesting a role of mechanical constraint in facilitating female choice against small-sized mates. By contrast, when the male was much larger than the female, he often failed to grasp her effectively or remain her in amplexus for longer\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["9"]}

Unlike the coherent signals between different elements in common active array, the transmitted signals from different elements here are spatially orthogonal waveforms which allow for array processing in the transit mode and result in an extension of array aperture. The mathematical derivation of Capon estimator for this sonar system is described in detail. And the performance of this orthogonal-waveform based sonar is analyzed and compared with that of its phased-array counterpart by water tank experiments. Experimental results show that this sonar system could achieve 12 dB\u0393\u00c7\u00f415 dB additional array gain over its phased-array counterpart, which means a doubling of maximum detection range.

{"title": "Optimizing energy-latency trade-off in wireless sensor networks with mobile element\n", "abstract": " Recent research shows that significant energy saving can be achieved in wireless sensor networks by using mobile elements (MEs) capable of carrying data mechanically. Though ME can reduce the energy consumption at each sensor node, it increases the latency from the time the data is generated at a node to the time the base station receives it. To address this issue, we proposed a collection-based approach in which a subset of nodes served as the data collection points (CPs) that buffer data originated from sources and transfer to ME when it arrives. CPs shorten the trajectory of ME which can gather a large volume of data at a time, however, they also increase energy consumption of nodes to transmit data to them. There is a trade-off between the energy consumption of network and the length of trajectory of ME which is determined by the number of CPs.

The results indicated that the leaf osmotic adjustment capability of SX733 was 0.11 MPa, which was higher than the average 0.065 MPa of other 3 cuhivars by 71.6%. Leaf water potential of SX733 was higher than that of H7228 by about 0.1 MPa, and the excised-leaf water loss rate of SX733 was higher than that of other cuhivars when it was well-irrigated. Transpiration rate, net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance of SX733 were similar to those of SM9 and HM9, but higher than those of 117228. There was no remarkable difference among cuhivars in inter-cellular CO_ (2) concentration and transpiration efficiency. The 2 times irrigation treatment maintained almost the same level of leaf water potential and leaf gas exchange parameters as the 5 times irrigation treatment with improved photosynthesis and transpiration efficiency during grain-filling period. Compared with other 3 cultivars, the yield of SX733 was increased by 11.3% and 7.0% in non-irrigation and 2 times irrigation treatments, respectively. The yield of 2 times irrigation treatment at stem elongation and heading for SX733 was 5.6% higher than that of 4 times irrigation treatment.

{"title": "Guided wave focusing potential in hollow cylinders\n", "abstract": " Ultrasonic non-destructive evaluation is generally used in industry because of its excellent defect detection potential. The ultrasonic waves propagating in a bounded waveguide are called guided waves. Long range ultrasonic guided waves have intrigued investigators for years because of an ability to test structures over a long distance from a single sensor position. Guided waves have much more complex wave behavior than bulk waves in infinite media. Plane-strain guided waves in a single layer plate with traction free boundaries are Lamb waves. The Lamb type guided waves in hollow cylinders spread out and wrap around the circumference when propagating in an axial direction. Therefore, except for the guided waves with axisymmetric energy distributions in a tube, there are an infinite number of non-axisymmetric wave modes called flexural modes that have similar particle behavior as the axisymmetric mode in the same group. Focusing at a certain point in a hollow cylinder is implemented by utilizing the non-axisymmetric energy distributions of flexural wave modes. There are two types of focusing in pipes: natural focusing and phased array focusing. When a partially loaded excitation is used to generate guided waves in cylindrical shells, the excited flexural modes lead to ultrasonic energy naturally focused at certain positions. This special natural focusing phenomenon can be used to improve guided wave inspection results in hollow cylinders. By applying input time delays and amplitudes for a multi-channel ultrasonic signal generation system, one can focus the guided waves at a pre-selected position.

Weanling male SD rats were fed diets containing 20% HER or LER for 1 week or 4 weeks, or 5% HER diet for 4 weeks. The hepatic oxidation capacity of butyric acid or palmitic acid was determined by titrating the propanone produced by their oxidation. The results showed that feeding HER to rats led to an increase in the weight of liver and a decrease in the hepatic oxidation capacity of palmitic acid. Hepatic oxidation of butyric acid was not influenced by the intake of HER. The inhibitory action of HER on the oxidation of long-chain fatty acids probably resulted from the incorporation of erucic acid into mitochondrial membranes, interfering the fatty acyl-CoA transferring system on the membranes, but not from the beta-oxidation enzyme system in mitochondria being directly inhibited.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["9"]}

Despite the widespread clinical application, the prototype components and metabolites of SHLI have not been fully elucidated, especially in human body. To discover and screen the constituents or metabolites of Chinese medicine in biofluids tends to be more and more difficult due to the complexity of chemical compositions, metabolic reactions and matrix effects. In this work, a metabolomic strategy to comprehensively elucidate the prototype components and metabolites of SHLI in human serum conducted by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS was developed. Orthogonal partial least squared discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was applied to distinguish the exogenous, namely, drug-induced constituents, from endogenous in human serum. In the S-plot, 35 drug-induced constituents were found, including 23 prototype compounds and 12 metabolites which indicated that SHLI in human body mainly caused phase II metabolite reactions. It was concluded that the metabolomic strategy for identification of herbal constituents and metabolites in biological samples was successfully developed. This identification and structural elucidation of the chemical compounds provided essential data for further pharmacological and pharmacokinetics study of SHLI.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["9"]}

The accumulation of NO peaked earlier than that of GB in shoot tips and leaves. The maximum NO content in root tips was attained earlier than that in leaves, while the reverse was observed with respect to GB content. The concentrations of NO, GB and choline in root tips and leaves of maize seedlings under DS were greater in the plants which received exogenous SNP application as compared to those in plants without SNP application. Exogenous SNP application also increased betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH) activity in leaves. The GB metabolism was negatively influenced by exogenous applications of either PTIO, NaN3 or L-NAME. The combined application of NaN3 and L-NAME had the most serious negative effects. These results demonstrate that GB metabolism in drought stressed maize plants was significantly enhanced by exogenous NO application. The accumulation of greater level of NO in maize seedlings contributed to increase GB accumulation by regulating BADH activity and choline content. This study provides a direct evidence of regulation of GB metabolism in maize plants under drought stress by exogenous application of NO.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["9"]}

By breaking the total resistive loss into three components, i.e., skin effect loss and two independent proximity effect losses, the problem is simplified so that each loss component can be computed separately. A semi-empirical formula for determining the proximity effect loss from a single external source current is established, which is the building block for solving the total proximity effect loss. For a typical three-phase duct bank scenario, the proposed approach achieves good agreement in predicting the total resistive loss when compared to finite-element analysis simulations.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["9"]}

The proposed control scheme can smoothly transit the operation mode of microgrid from grid-connected operation mode to islanded operation mode, and an inverter can share common load not only with other inverters but also with SGs in islanded mode.

In this paper, the complementary energy of an element of the BFEM is constructed by using the base forces. The equilibrium conditions are released by the Lagrange multiplier method, and a modified complementary energy principle described by the base forces is obtained. The formulation of the 4-mid-node plane element of the BFEM is derived by assuming that the stress is uniformly distributed on each edge of the plane elements. A procedure of the BFEM on complementary energy principle is developed using MATLAB language.

{"title": "Correlation between liver cancer occurrence and gene expression profiles in rat liver tissue\n", "abstract": " Liver cancer (LC) is generally characterized by malignant cell proliferation and growth; it normally develops in stages that progress from non-specific injury of the liver to liver fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, dysplasia nodules, and liver carcinoma. We used a rat model of diethylnitrosamine (DENA)-induced LC; a Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array was used to detect gene expression profile of liver tissues from male rats 5, 8, 12, 16, and 18 weeks following the beginning of DENA-induced LC. We found 909 known genes, including 637 upregulated, 270 down-regulated, and two up/down-regulated genes, that were significantly changed in expression. Among them, 108 genes were expressed at the 5th, 213 at the 8th, 516 at the 12th, 698 at the 16th, and 506 at the 18th week of DENA-induced LC. Methods in bioinformatics and systems biology were applied to explore the correlation between the gene expression profile of rat liver tissue and liver cancer occurrence at the transcriptional level; 23 physiological activities were found to be associated with LC. Among these, eight physiological activities, including stimulus response, inflammation and immune response, oxidative reduction, cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, adhesion, and angiogenesis were increased, implying that", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["9"]}
{"title": "Role of Rho-ROCK signaling in MOLT4 cells metastasis induced by CCL25\n", "abstract": " Our previous research has revealed that binding of the chemokine CCL25 to the CCR9 provides chemotactic cues guiding leukemic cells to specific tissues and organs. The RhoA-ROCK pathway might be involved in cancer migration. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of the RhoA-ROCK-MLC axis in leukemic cell migration following exposure to CCL25. The results showed that CCL25 could increase the amount of the GTPase RhoA and activate MLC in MOLT4 cells in a time-dependent manner. C3 exoenzyme and Y-27632 could block MOLT4 cell migration and chemotaxis. Thus, the RhoA-ROCK-MLC axis might play an important role in MOLT4 cell metastasis induced by CCL25.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["9"]}

In this study, the temporal and spatial characteristics of snowstorm are discussed and its risk division is done in this paper. The day-to-day snow data in 78 municipalities (counties) of Heilongjiang Province from 1970 to 2006 were analyzed by integrating GIS technique and probability risk days of different type of snowstorm calculated from information diffuse theory. The results show that: 1) the starting and ending dates of the snowstorm less shift during the 37 years. The first snowstorm appears in early-middle October and the last snowstorm appears in middle-late April. On the whole, snowstorm concentrates in November, December and May, especially in November. 2) temporally, the total days of snowstorm increase year by year. Spatially, the average days of snowstorm in Da Hinggan Mountains and Heihe District in the north, in Yichun District in the middle-north and in Jiamusi District in the northeast are more than that in other regions of the province. 3) there is a good correlation between snowstorm anomaly year and El Nino year in Heilongjiang Province. Snowstorm anomaly year takes place in El Nino year or immediately before and after El Nino year. 4) based on the information diffusion theory and the numbers of snowstorm days in the 78 municipalities (counties) in Heilongjiang Province from 1970 to 2006, the snowstorm risks of different probabilities were calculated for municipalities (counties). It is found that when the snowstorm days equal to or less than 18 d, the probability is once a year or once every two years, and the province is in middle or high\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["9"]}

{"title": "A study of the characteristics and adsorption process of modified attapulgite\n", "abstract": " The attapulgite is modified with HNO_3 of different concentrations to prepare the adsorbents for treating Cu containing wastewaters. The effects of nitric acid concentration, attapulgite dose, absorption time, pH value, etc. on the elimination of Cu (\u0393\u00e0\u00ed) ions through adsorption are investigated. Specific surface area test is adopted to find the causes for increment of specific surface area of the modified attapulgite. The results show that the attapulgite treated in 4 mol/L HNO_3 has the best absorption ability. The adsorption rate of Cu (\u0393\u00e0\u00ed) in wastewater can be close to 99% with 30 g/L of the modified attapulgite, water sample pH value 4 and 20 min of supersonic stirring. The increase of specific surface area is attributed to asymmetry and uncontinuous dissolution of the inner octahedron structure as well as the local corrosion of tetrahedral Si, which uncloses and enlarges the hole-paths of attapulgite.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["9"]}

The water conservation effect of plastic mulch was significant from sowing to the seedling establishment, with WUE being increased by 81.6%-136.4% under mulch as compared with that without mulch. From the seedling to jointing stage, which coincided with the dry period in the region, soil water utilization by the maize under mulch could reach the depth of 80-100 cm, and its WUE was about 17.0%-21.6% lower than the maize without mulch, since the latter was affected by dry stress.

{"title": "Optimal bitumen-aggregate ratio selection method of hot mix asphalt based on closest compaction condition\n", "abstract": " An optimal bitumen-aggregate ratio selection method for hot mix asphalt, based on aggregate closest compact condition, was introduced. According to research, high correlation within dry density, voids in mineral aggregate (VMA) and voids in coarse aggregate (VCA) versus bitumen-aggregate ratio was discovered. Dry density increases with increase of bitumen-aggregate ratio until it reaches a peak, and then decreases. VMA and VCA have the inverse trend. The advantage of the unique extreme point rule of the conic is the relationship of bitumen-aggregate ratio versus dry density and that the VMA and VCA can be indicated by conic regression analysis, and the corresponding bitumen-aggregate ratio can be achieved as well.

METHODS: From March 1999 to October 2006, 105 patients with humeral shaft fractures were treated with locked intramedullary nail and were adequately followed up. There were 82 antegrade nailing and 23 retrograde nailing. The follow-up parameters included operation time, blood loss, fracture healing rate, healing time, complications, Constant-Murley shoulder score and Mayo elbow performance score. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 31.2 months. Antegrade intramedullary nailing had significantly less blood loss than that in retrograde intramedullary nailing (P= 0.002). The differences in operation time, complications, healing time and bone healing rate between he two groups had no statistical significance. Complications in the antegrade intramedullary nail group included 4 patients with nonunions, 1 patient with radial nerve palsy, and 8 patients with shoulder pains and decrement in shoulder range of motion. Complications in the retrograde intramedullary nail group included 1 patient with radial nerve palsy and 3 patients with iatrogenic fractures. For shoulder joints, the difference in the average Constant-Murley shoulder score between the two groups was statistically significant (P= 0.04).

It seems that software scale may be one of the reasons causing different motif SP distribution. Most of middle and large scale software networks have similar local structure with biological networks.

To clarify the exact effects of this compound on reproduction, mice oocytes were treated with different TGA doses. At the end of the culture period, the nuclear status of mice oocytes was assessed under an inverted microscope. After immunofluorescence staining, the chromosomal arrangement and spindle configuration of oocytes were evaluated. The results indicated that TGA decreases the percentage of first polar body formation but does not influence that of germinal vesicle breakdown.

It is found that work hardening due to LSP could be responsible for the improvement of residual fatigue lives for the damaged and undamaged specimens by LSP, and the hardening degree for the damaged specimen by LSP is obviously higher than that for the undamaged specimen by LSP. In this paper, two basic mechanisms were identified. One is the dissipated energy enhancement mechanism, which improves the fatigue life caused by laser shock stress, and the other is the healing mechanism, which leads to a further improvement.

This paper focuses on how to measure the similarity and construct matching relations more effectively between process models. To resolve exponential time complexity to match node compositions, we proposed a graph-edit distance similarity metric based on SESE process fragments, and a greedy algorithm is employed to construct the optimal matching relations. Then a method to construct matching relations of fragments based on process structure tree is proposed. Finally, a comparative experiment based on real-world process models from BPM AI repository is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["9"]}

{"title": "Rapid change in Arctic and Antarctic Oceans and their feedbacks to global climate change\n", "abstract": " This paper analyzes the interaction between polar oceans and global climate change. Global warming could induce rapid changes in the Arctic and Southern Oceans, such as dramatic thinning and retreating of Arctic Ocean sea ice, serious melting of the Greenland ice sheet, decreasing carbon uptake capacity in the Arctic Ocean and the Southern Ocean, and polar ocean acidification. It is pointed out that since sea ice rapidly declined in the summer in the Arctic, the ice surface area hit a record low on 26th, August 2012. Some model predicted that in 2035 there will be no ice in the Arctic. The melting of Greenland ice sheet would affect the global sea level rising and the ocean circulation; the sea level would rise 7 meters if the Greenland ice sheet melts. Based on the last ten years' research, it was found that the capacity of absorbing atmospheric CO2 in the polar ocean decreased, the sea water is tend to be saturated. It is predicted by some models that by the end of 21st century the pH in the Arctic surface water would decrease 0.23 to 0.45, making the Arctic Ocean the most acid in the global oceans. While the pCO2 in the Southern Ocean surface waters would exceed 600\u256c\u255datm in the latter half of the 21st century. The acidification in the polar oceans would induce irreversible damage to marine food chain and ecosystem. Therefore, all these rapid changes in the Arctic and Southern Oceans will create feedbacks to global climate change.[Fund]: \u03c3\u00a2\u255c\u03c3\u00ab\u2562\u03a6\u00e7\u00ac\u03c4\u00e4\u2562\u03c4\u00ba\u00e6\u03c3\u00a1\u00aa\u03c3\u0192\u2551\u0398\u00e7\u00e6\u0398\u00e7\u00ec\u03c4\u00e9\u2563\u03a6\u2561\u00e4\u03c3\u00e8\u2310\u0398\u00ed\u2563\u03c4\u00a2\u00ab (41230529);; \u03c3\u00a2\u255c\u03c3\u00ab\u2562 \u0393\u00c7\u00a3\u03c3\u00ec\u00fc\u03a3\u2551\u00ee\u03a3\u2551\u00f6\u0393\u00c7\u00a5 \u00b5\u20a7\u00fc\u03c3\u00a3\u2591\u03a6\u00c7\u00e2\u03c3\u00bb\u0192\u03a3\u2555\u00f4\u0398\u00ed\u2563\u03a6\u2561\u00e4\u03c3\u00e8\u2310\u0398\u00ed\u2563\u03c4\u00a2\u00ab (CHINARE2012-01-04-02 2012-02-01 2012-03-04-02);; \u03c3\u00a2\u255c\u03c3\u00ab\u2562\u00b5\u2561\u2556\u00b5\u2524\u00ef\u03c3\u2592\u00c7\u00b5\u20a7\u00fc\u03c3\u00a3\u2591\u03c3\u00e8\u20a7\u03c3\u00a2\u255c\u0398\u00d6\u00e0\u03c3\u00c9\u00ea\u03a3\u255c\u00a3\u03a6\u2561\u00e4\u03c3\u00e8\u2310\u0398\u00ed\u2563\u03c4\u00a2\u00ab (IC201201 IC2010013\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["9"]}

We amplified the D-Loop region of mtDNA of 20 hepatocarcinomas and their adjacent tissue by PCR and then sequencing. ROS in tissue was measured by flow cytometry. mtDNA mutations were detected in 40%(8 of 20) tumor samples. 53 point mutations were detected in eight tumour samples, including 2 insertions, 11 deletions and 40 point mutations. 75% point mutations were TC and CT transition. They were four microsatellites among the mutations. Mutations in the adjacent tissues were always companied with mutations in tumour tissues. The mutation frequency in tumour tissues was higher than that in adjacent tissue. There was a larger unidentified deletion. The ROS level in hepatocarcinoma tissue was much higher than control (P< 0.01).

RESULTS: HE staining showed that the model was established successfully. Ultrastructural observation showed that at the 6th week after infection, the necrosis of hepatocytes around the acute granulomas occurred; the number of sinusoidal endothelial fenestrae and vitamin A droplets in fat-storing cells decreased; large phagosomes and rough endoplasmic reticulum could be seen in the cytoplasm of Kupffer's cells. At the 8th week, steatosis was found in some hepatocytes, some microvilli emerged on a few inter-hepatocytic surfaces and the inter-hepatocytic spaces were enlarged. Large collagen fibrillar bundles filled in the perisinusoidal spaces, and capillarization of hepatic sinusoids was observed. Secretory vesicles filled with collagen fibrils appeared in the cytoplasm of fat-storing cells with large amount of collagenous fiber bundles surround the cells. Rough endoplasmic reticulum increased in Kupffer's cells. At the 10th week, fat-storing cells were activated and transformed into myofibroblasts.

METHODOLOGY: The proportions of cluster-of-differentiation (CD)-34+ cells and their receptor-CXCR4 were detected by flow cytometry in patients with different types of chronic HBV infection. The levels of chemokines and cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The proportion of CD34+ cells in patients with cirrhosis was significantly increased compared with the healthy controls (p< 0.05) and was increased obviously after treatment by G-CSF mobilization (p< 0.01). The expression levels of SDF-1, SCF and MMP-9 were significantly elevated in patients with chronic hepatitis B and liver cirrhosis (p< 0.01). The expression levels of SCF and MMP-9 were significantly elevated after treatment with G-CSF (p< 0.05). No significant differences were found in the levels of total bilirubin, albumin and prothrombin time between the treated and control groups; furthermore, no significant differences were observed in the cure and improvement rates between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The basal levels of stem cell mobilization in patients with liver cirrhosis might be associated with the repair of liver injury. G-CSF could promote hematopoietic stem cell mobilization through regulation of the expression levels of stem-cell-mobilization-related factors in patients with liver cirrhosis.

It is found that the operation of upstream reservoirs has a great impact on the hydraulic regime of the river reach, such as decreasing the frequency of overbank flooding, increasing the channel width/depth ratio, and enhancing the horizontal activity in the river reach. In the process of riverbed form adjustment under the influence of reservoir operation, there is a close relation between the incoming sediment coefficient and the fluvial facies coefficient, and also between the average swing speed and the characteristic value of water and sediment. The study on the section configuration change, horizontal swing and the energy dissipation reveals that the river flow can directly impact the evolution of channel cross-section. The correlation among characteristics of runoff and riverbed morphology is constrained by the distribution of river energy dissipation. In this studying reach, it is found that the total water energy can roughly balance the required energy dissipation during the various periods of the year.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["9"]}

{"title": "Two Gln187 mutants of human soluble APRIL inhibit proliferation of lung carcinoma A549 cells.\n", "abstract": " Soluble APRIL (sAPRIL), the active form of a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), is implicated in the proliferation of tumor cells. Suppressing APRIL function has been considered as a potential strategy for the therapy of APRIL-associated tumors. In the present study, we generated human sAPRIL and its two mutants, Gln187-D-sAPRIL (Gln187 deleted) and Gly187-sAPRIL (Gln187 replaced by Gly). In vitro experiments showed that the two mutants had similar specific binding capacity to lung carcinoma A549 cells compared to the wild-type sAPRIL, and both, especially Gly187-sAPRIL, exhibited significant antagonistic effect on sAPRIL-induced tumor cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, which might be predominantly mediated by blocking sAPRIL-induced MEK and ERK phosphorylation but not p38MAPK or JNK signaling. In vivo experiments with nude mice bearing A549 cell-derived xenograft tumor showed that only the Gly187-sAPRIL mutant could significantly suppress the tumor growth. These results suggest that Gln187 may be a crucial amino acid in APRIL-mediated tumor cell proliferation via the MEK-ERK signaling pathway and that the sAPRIL mutants may serve as novel potential antagonists of APRIL for the therapy of APRIL-associated cancers.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["9"]}

A typical single-peak curve was presented for the seasonal dynamics of aboveground biomass and nitrogen-and phosphorus absorption efficiency of the two species. P. australis had the maximum aboveground biomass (2195.33 g X m (-2)) in summer, while S. alterniflora had it (3670.02 g X m (-2)) in autumn. The total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) contents of P. australis reached the peak (21.06 gxm (-2) of TN and 1.12 gxm (-2) of TP) in summer and in autumn, respectively, while those of S. alterniflora all reached the peak (26.76 gxm (-2) of TN and 3.23 gxm (-2) of TP) in autumn. Both of the two species had a higher absorption efficiency in TN than in TP (P< 0.01), and S. alterniflora had a significantly higher absorption efficiency of TN and TP than P. australis (P< 0.05). To some extent, the N/P, C/N, and C/P ratios of plants could indicate the nitrogen-and phosphorus absorption efficiency of the plants.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["9"]}

UV-vis spectroscopy showed that Mb in the films retained its near-native structure. The stable multilayerfilm-modified gold electrodes showed good electroactivity in protein-free buffer solution, which is originated from protein heme Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox couple.

{"title": "A novel bearing estimation method for shallow water targets\n", "abstract": " Aiming at solving the problem of biased bearing estimation of shallow water targets under plane-wave assumption, a novel bearing estimation method for shallow water target localization is proposed. The method adopts the normal modes sound wave theory which can truly reflect the phenomenon of numerous reflections from the bottom and great losses of acoustic energy accompanying sound propagation. The sound pressure at observation point is regarded as the superposition of some normal modes. Under the condition of flat solid seabed and white Gaussian noise, the received signal equation in matrix form is constructed for uniform linear array. The maximum likelihood bearing estimation is given as the solution of the equation by detailed mathematical derivation. Compared with classical matched field techniques, the proposed method is concise and costs much less in computational complexity. Compared with plane-wave subspace methods, the proposed method has less estimation bias. Simulation results show that while the bias of the plane-wave MUSIC grows linearly with the increase of incident angle relative to array normal, the bias of the proposed method doesn't grow evidently and that while the bias of the plane-wave MUSIC doesn't decrease too much and maintains about 2 with the increase of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the bias of the proposed method is quite small and approaches 0. Lake experiments validated the capability of the proposed method of reaching asymptotically unbiased bearing estimates of shallow water targets.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["9"]}

We determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the Cyclemys atripons mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) and found it to be 16,500 base pairs (bp) in length, with the genome organization, gene order and base composition being identical to that of the typical vertebrate. However, unlike for most turtle mtDNA so far reported, an extra base was not found in the NADH3 gene. The C. atripons control region of mtDNA was 981 bp long. Comparisons with three other geoemydids showed that the C. atripons control region contained a highly variable region at the 3' end composed of AT enriched tandem repeats containing a fifteen-unit 5'-A (AT)3-3' variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs).", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["9"]}

In alkyl benzene sulfonate/brine/methyl oleate model oil systems, methyl oleate influences the partition of added surfactants between oil and aqueous phase by changing equivalent alkane carbon number (EACN) value of model oil. In alkyl benzene sulfonate/alkali/methyl oleate model oil systems, methyl oleate in oil phase has two functions: on the one hand, it influences the partition of surfactant between oil and aqueous phase; on the other hand, it directly affects IFT by displacing surfactant molecule or forming mixed film with surfactant molecule at the interface.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["9"]}

A physical interpretation of the significant novel phenomenon is given. First, the microresistors generate a new type of inherent localized structure, the so-called impurity mode. Then, the impurity modes are excited and amplified by the AC drive. Finally, the fluxon gains, through the strong fluxon-impurity mode (microresistor) interactions, kinetic energy to overcome the attractive potentials of the microresistors and the dissipative resistance, and it escapes from the microresistors eventually.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["9"]}

{"title": "Exploiting the prefix information to enhance the performance of FSA-based RFID systems\n", "abstract": " For a radio frequency identification (RFID) system deployed in dense environment, the reader must quickly and reliably extract information from numerous tags. To harmonize the channel access among competing tags and reduce collision probability, conventionally, framed slotted ALOHA (FSA) scheme is employed to resolve the collisions occurring when numerous tags simultaneously respond to the query of the reader. Typically, FSA algorithm consists of two parts: (i) estimating the number of available tags in vicinity, and (ii) base on the estimated value, setting the frame length accordingly. However, in the FSA scheme, when collision happens, it is impossible to estimate how many colliding tags simultaneously reply in a single slot, which, in turn, can lead to inaccuracy of the estimated cardinality and unreasonable setting of the frame length. This will further result in under-utilization of channel resource and the\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["9"]}

Activation of GABAB receptors, one type of inhibitory G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), in PAG neurons results in both presynaptic and postsynaptic inhibition. Acute desensitization is defined as rapid attenuation of receptor-mediated signaling. Recent studies report that multiple inhibitory GPCRs, including GABAB receptors, resist acute desensitization in the presynaptic but not postsynaptic compartments of certain neurons in mammal brains. In the present study, employing whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings on acute PAG slices from adult rats, we found that GABAB receptors resist acute desensitization to prolonged administration of baclofen (GABAB receptor agonist) in both presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments.

Complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) data have many advantages in phylogenetic analyses, but such data are available for only 46 primate species. In this work, we determined the complete mitogenome sequence of the black-capped capuchin (Cebus apella). The genome was 16,538 bp in size and consisted of 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNAs, two rRNAs and a control region. The genome organization, nucleotide composition and codon usage did not differ significantly from those of other primates. The control region contained several distinct repeat motifs, including a putative termination-associated sequence (TAS) and several conserved sequence blocks (CSB-F, E, D, C, B and 1). Among the protein-coding genes, the COII gene had lower nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions rates while the ATP8 and ND4 genes had higher rates. A phylogenetic analysis using Maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods and the complete mitogenome data for platyrrhine species confirmed the basal position of the Callicebinae and the sister relationship between Atelinae and Cebidae, as well as the sister relationship between Aotinae (Aotus) and Cebinae (Cebus/Saimiri) in Cebidae. These conclusions agreed with the most recent molecular phylogenetic investigations on primates.

Whereas some manhole events are caused by failure of primary distribution cable, most are caused by failure of unshielded secondary cable in network systems. Based on analysis and knowledge of field conditions, manhole events can be divided into at least two classes, those in which exothermic chemical reactions dominate and those in which electrical energy dominates [4]. In an electrically driven event, the arcing energy is so great that it causes rapid vaporization of the conductor and nearby polymers, which sweeps the oxygen from the cable duct so the event evolves through electrical fault energy induced pyrolysis. In the more common combustion-driven events, the electric fault energy ignites the cable insulation near the fault, resulting in self\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["9"]}

{"title": "Simultaneous scheduling of import and export containers handling in container terminals\n", "abstract": " This paper studies the simultaneous scheduling of landside container handling operations in a container terminal. Issues addressed include scheduling the sequence of loading (unloading) of containers to (from) the vessels from (to) the quayside, assigning trucks to transport containers between quayside and yard side, and scheduling operations of yard cranes in different yard zones. A mathematical model describing the characteristics of the problem is developed. The objective is to minimize the total completion time for handling all the containers under consideration in the terminal. As optimizing the landside container handling operations in a terminal is known to be NP-hard, a new genetic algorithm with the selection process based on the principle of simulated annealing is developed in this paper to solve the problem. Comparison of the respective results obtained by using the proposed genetic algorithm, the canonical genetic algorithm and the simulated annealing algorithm clearly shows that the total completion times obtained by the proposed algorithm are 12%-18% shorter than that obtained by GA and SA, and the computing times of GA-SA are only 50% of that of GA. The proposed genetic algorithm is indeed superior to the other two algorithms.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["9"]}

The room temperature ferromagnetism in the samples was enhanced after being hydrogenated at 320degC in a forming gas (Ar90%+H 2 10%) and weakened after reheating the sample in air. These variations of the magnetization have been observed for additional cycles by alternately heating in air and Ar/H 2 . Raman spectroscopy study reveals that hydrogenation leads an increase in the amount of oxygen vacancies in these H 2  -annealed samples.

METHODS: Renal transplantation was performed on 117 patients, 85 males and 32 females, aged 9-57, with the kidneys from 117 donors, 63 males and 54 females, aged (47+/-6)(20-65). The cumulative incidence of acute rejection events was respectively evaluated by Kaplan-Meier product-limit method and log-rank test. Cox's proportional hazards model was used to determine the risk factors for acute rejection events. RESULTS: Follow-up was conducted for 16 (3-44) months. The acute rejection rates 2 and 6 weeks after transplantation of the group with the donor aged> or= 50 were 13.0% and 19.5% respectively, both significantly higher than those of the group with the donor aged< 50 (2.8% and 8.5% respectively, P= 0.010). The risk of being female for acute rejection was 2.731 times as that of being male (95% CI: 1.018-7.326, P= 0.046), and the risk of donor aged> or= 50 for acute rejection was 1.054 times as that of the donors aged< 50 (95% CI: 1.004-1.107, P= 0.020).

The results showed that the optimal temperature for the photosynthesis of apricot leaves was around 25 degrees C, and the photosynthetic capacity was reduced greatly by the low temperature and weak light, inducing a markedly increased excitation press (1-qp) and in turn, resulting in photoinhibition. The functions of both PS I and PS II were damaged by the low temperature and weak light. Comparing with those only subjected to low temperature, the leaves subjected to both low temperature and weak light had a decreased activity of PS I, with a decrement of 28.26% within 2 h, but their maximal photochemical effeciency of PS II (Fv/Fm) had little change in the same period, suggesting that under low temperature and weak light, PS I was more suffered from photoinhibition than PS II.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["9"]}

We validated this hypothesis by cloning the cDNA sequences of GHR1 (sd3HR1) and GHR2 (scGHR2) from liver of the Southern catfish Silurus meridionalis by RT-PCR and SmartTM Race. The full-length cDNAs of scGHR1 and scGHR2 are 1 985 bp and 2 300 bp, encoding putative proteins of 602 and 553 amino acids, respectively. Both scGHR1 and scGHR2 have the characteristic landmarks of conventional GHR including the ligand binding motif FGDFS in the extracellular domain and conserved cytoplasmic Boxl and Box2 regions. However, they possess features that are distinctly different from each other. Firstly, the number of extracellular cysteine residues is different. While scGHR1 possesses 7 extracellular cysteine residues forming three disulfide bonds, scGHR2 has only 4 that may form two disulfide bonds. Secondly, the number of intracellular tyrosine residues is different. The scGHR1 contains 8 tyrosine residues, but scGHR2 contains only 5. The expressions of scGHR1 and scGHR2 in different tissues of the Southern catfish were further examined using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Results showed that scGFIR1 and scGI-/R2 were present in all the tissues examined and that expression of scGHR1 and scGHR2 in liver were higher than in other tissues.

Under dynamic compression, the yield strength is increased with the increase of relative density and the relative strength is in direct proportion with the 1.5 order power of the relative density", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["9"]}
{"title": "Effects of daidzein on sperm quality, testis gain and testosterone in mice\n", "abstract": " OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of daidzein on sperm quality of male mice. METHODS: Three different doses of daidzein were supplemented to pubertal male mice for 21 days (5 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, 1,000 mg/kg ration). The viability of sperm was determined by eosin-Y, the acrosome was observed by Wright-Giemsa staining, and the testosterone was measured by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: Daidzein at the dose of 5 mg/kg ration significantly increased serum testosterone levels (P< 0.01), prompted testis gain (P< 0.05), and improved spermatozoa quality. Daidzein at dose of 1,000 mg/kg ration could inhibit the secretion of serum testosterone (P< 0.01), without significant variation in spermatozoa quality. Daidzein at dose of 100 mg/kg ration did not significantly affect sperm quality and other index. CONCLUSIONS: Daidzein can affect sperm quality and in dosage-dependant ways.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["9"]}
{"title": "Dynamic neuro-fuzzy adaptive control for flexible-link manipulators based on dynamic inversion\n", "abstract": " A dynamic neuro-fuzzy (DNF) adaptive control system is presented in this paper for the trajectory tracking of a flexible-link manipulator with poorly known dynamics, where the robot tip vibration is measured by position sensitive detectors (PSDs). Based on the singular perturbation method and two time-scale decompositions, the robot dynamics is approximated by a slow subsystem of an equivalent rigid arm and a fast subsystem of flexible mode. Then, the DNF adaptive controller based on dynamic inversion is designed for the tracking control of the equivalent rigid arm, while a fuzzy proportional derivative (PD) type controller is used to stabilize the elastic dynamics using PSDs measurement feedback. The NF learning algorithm and the stability proof of the closed-loop system are given, and an upper bound for the singular perturbation parameter is also obtained. Finally, the real-time experiment is conducted to show\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["9"]}

A specially-made explosive gun was used to shoot aluminium bullet weighing 3.0 g and 1.4 g to injure both legs of dogs at velocities of 2330 m/s, 3200 m/s and 4250 m/s, respectively, and the soap specially made was also shot. At the same time, steel ball of 1.03 g was shot with a Type 53 smooth chamber gun at a speed of 1280 m/s. Within 30 min after wounding, debridement and pathological anatomy were performed and specimens were taken for light microscope observation. When the dogs were wounded by the 3 g bullet at speed of 2330 m/s, the entrance of the left leg was penetrated explosively with a defect area of 225 cm (2), and the femur trunk was also injured and the residual femur had comminution fracture. The exit of the right leg was blindly wounded with a defect area of 63 cm (2), but only the skin was not penetrated. Both testes and part pelvis were injured too. Under light microscope, degenerative myofibers and bleeding of the spatium between the myofibers could be found at the place 4 cm away from the wounding track.

{"title": "Inhibitory effect of arctigenin on lymphocyte activation stimulated with PMA/ionomycin.\n", "abstract": " This study investigated the effect of arctigenin (Arc) on the cell activation, cytokines expression, proliferation, and cell-cycle distribution of mouse T lymphocytes. Mouse lymphocytes were prepared from lymph node and treated with Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)/Ionimycin (Ion) and/or Arc. CD69, CD25, cytokines, proliferation and cell cycle were assayed by flow cytometry. The results showed that, at concentrations of less than 1.00 micromol x L (-1), Arc expressed non-obvious cell damage to cultured lymphocytes, however, it could significantly down-regulate the expression of CD69 and CD25, as well as TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10 on PMA/Ion stimulated lymphocytes. At the same time, Arc could also inhibit the proliferation of PMA/Ion-activated lymphocytes and exhibited lymphocyte G 0/G1 phase cycle arrest. These results suggest that Arc possesses significant anti-inflammatory effects that may be mediated through the regulation of cell activation, cytokines expression and cell proliferation.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["9"]}

They all have an important effect on the performance of roadheader, which is mainly includes producing dust quantity, cutting specific energy, production efficiency and load fluctuations. Based on the cutting performance analysis of a single cutting parameters, using the fgoalattain function in Matlab optimization toolbox, multi variables multi objectives optimum design of roadheader cutting head is realized, which provide theoretical support for the design and analysis of the roadheader cutting head.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["9"]}
{"title": "Cloud service brokerage: a conceptual ontology-based service description framework\n", "abstract": " Cloud service brokerage has been identified as a key concern for future Cloud technology research and development. Integration, customization, and aggregation are core functions of a Cloud service broker. The need to cater to horizontal and vertical integration in service description languages, horizontally between different providers and vertically across the different Cloud layers, has been well recognized. In this chapter, the authors propose a conceptual framework for a Cloud service broker in two parts: first, a reference architecture for Cloud service brokers; and second, a rich ontology-based template manipulation framework and operator calculus that describes the mediated and integrated Cloud services, facilitates manipulating their descriptions, and allows both horizontal and vertical dimensions to be covered. Structural aspects of that template are identified, formalized in an ontology, and aligned with the\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["9"]}
{"title": "Exploiting multiple features for learning to rank in expert finding\n", "abstract": " Expert finding is the process of identifying experts given a particular topic. In this paper, we propose a method called Learning to Rank for Expert Finding (LREF) attempting to leverage learning to rank to improve the estimation for expert finding. Learning to rank is an established means of predicting ranking and has recently demonstrated high promise in information retrieval. LREF first defines representations for both topics and experts, and then collects the existing popular language models and basic document features to form feature vectors for learning purpose from the representations. Finally, LRER adopts RankSVM, a pair wise learning to rank algorithm, to generate the lists of experts for topics. Extensive experiments in comparison with the language models (profile based model and document based model), which are state-of-the-art expert finding methods, show that LREF enhances expert finding\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["9"]}

MSC were treated and cultured for 3 d, the MSC-CM or MSC overexpressing stem cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) conditioned medium (Ad-SDF-1-MSC-CM) were collected. Subsequently, CRL1730 cells were treated respectively with 2% FBS-DMEM, 15% FBS-DMEM (control group), MSC-CM or Ad-SDF-1-MSC-CM for 24 h, the proliferation of CRL1730 cells was detected by MTT method. CRL1730 cell migration in vitro was performed by using wound healing system. The adhesion ability of CRL1730 cells was analyzed by microscope. The results indicated that the CRL1730 cells treated with Ad-SDF-1-MSC-CM showed greater proliferative capacity than CRL1730 cells treated with MSC-CM. While adding with AMD3100 5 \u252c\u2561mol/L, the blocker of CXCR4, the CRL1730 proliferation mediated by Ad-SDF-1-MSC-CM was significantly reduced. Meanwhile, compared with MSC-CM, Ad-SDF-1-MSC-CM had greater effects for promoting CRL1730 migration and enhancing adhesion ability of CRL1730 cells, these effects were significantly inhibited by AMD3100.

The integrated controller optimizes the signal conditioning, the position controller and the power amplifier as a whole, using a single FPGA chip to implement the rotor position control with unbalance compensation, current control, and the three-level PWM algorithms. The calculation tasks were implemented by means of reusing floating-point IP cores in timepieces. In order to balance the calculation speed and logic resources consumption, a method to select the precision of the A/D converter and the word length of the floating-point IP cores in the control algorithms was proposed. An incremental algorithm was proposed to calculate the trigonometric function online, using only multipliers, accumulators, and lookup tables. The FPGA solution of the three-level PWM and an auto calibration method for the rotor position signals were proposed. Experiment results show that the maximum radial position error at the rotation speeds of 0~ 7 000 r/min is less than 10% of the protection gap. The conclusion is that all the control task for 4-axis flywheel magnetic bearings can be implemented on a single FPGA with less than 0.2 million equivalent logic gates.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["9"]}

{"title": "Adaptive defocus blurred image restoration based on fractional Fourier transform combining with clarity-evaluation-function\n", "abstract": " The key issue to restore the defocus blurred image is how to choose a degradation model of blurred image. Based on the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) combining with the clarity-evaluation-function, we present an approach for the restoration of defocus blurred image. This method constructs a defocused imaging model based on FrFT and estimates the lost phase signals from the intensity signals by an iterative phase retrieval approach, in which the sharp restored image can be acquired by implementing inverse FrFT on complex image signal made from the estimated phase signals and intensity signals. Using this model combing with the clarity-evaluation-function, the FrFT order can be changed adaptively. Consequently, the sharper image can be obtained in the end. Experimental results show the effectiveness, the robustness, and the low complexity of this approach, which make it more suitable for real-time\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["9"]}

More importantly, a conventional nonlinear array receiver is often associated with a high computational complexity that undermines its applicability in practice. In this paper, we present a new approach to adaptive beamforming receiver that provides superior performance in antenna array overloading and in the presence of correlated signals with a low complexity. In particular, the proposed receiver requires a small data\u0393\u00c7\u00c9record size to estimate the beamformer weights, which is beneficial in applications with fast fading channels.

{"title": "Role of AcSDKP on collagen synthesis and degradation in cultured rat cardiac fibroblast\n", "abstract": " OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of AcSDKP on collagen synthesis and degradation in cultured rat cardiac fibroblasts. METHODS: Neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts were isolated and stimulated by PDGF. The cell proliferation was observed by (3) H-TdR incorporation assay. The synthesis of collagen was measured by (3) H-proline incorporation assay. The expression of type I and type III collagen and MMP-1 protein were measured by Western blot. The MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity was evaluated with zymography assay. RESULTS: PDGF stimulated cardiac fibroblasts proliferation with increased collagen synthesis and type I and type III collagen protein expressions as well as MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities and MMP-1 expression. AcSDKP inhibited cardiac fibroblasts proliferation induced by PDGF and reduced collagen synthesis and type I and type III collagen protein expression. AcSDKP also further up-regulated MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities and MMP-1 expression in cardiac fibroblasts induced by PDGF. CONCLUSION: AcSDKP inhibited proliferation and collagen synthesis and up-regulated matrix metalloproteinases activity or expression induced by PDGF, which was possibly related with the effect of AcSDKP anti-fibrosis.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["9"]}

METHOD: Immunohistochemical staining for PR and HER2 was performed on paraffin embedded tumor specimens obtained from 185 patients with breast cancer, and follow-up studies were conducted and the survival time of the patients recorded. RESULTS: In the 120 patients (64.9%) with complete followed-up data, 28 patients died (15%), with the record of the other 65 patients (35.1%) not available for this study. Immunohistochemical detection found that the positivity rates for HER2 and PR were 57.8% and 62.7% respectively in the total specimens examined, and HER2 and PR showed significant difference in their respective associations with the survival rate of the patients (P< 0.01). Specifically, HER2 was inversely associated with the survival rate, to which PR was positively related. The univariant analysis suggested the hazards posed by HER2 expression to reduce the overall survival of the patients (P< 0.01, OR= 1.566), while PR, playing the protective role, was associated with a significantly longer overall survival time (P< 0.01, OR= 0.547). In the multivariate analysis, however, only PR expression was of significant prognostic value in the patients (P 0.012).

{"title": "Stable adaptive control for robot trajectory tracking using dynamic neural networks\n", "abstract": " This paper presents a stable adaptive control approach based on dynamic neural networks (DNNs) for robot manipulators with unknown dynamics nonlinearities. DNNs in the proposed control scheme are used to approximate the whole robot dynamic systems, ie the dynamic behavior of the closed-loop systems, which is distinguished from static feedforward NNs (SNNs) being used to approximate the nonlinear components in robot dynamic systems. One benefit of using DNNs is that the approximation precision and convergence of tracking errors can be improved, and especially, some specific dynamic behaviors, such as limit cycles and chaos, etc. that can not be dealt with SNNs can be approximated in this case. On the other hand, by using the dynamic inversion of the DNN system, the DNN dynamics behavior can be predetermined by design. As a result, the perceptive input of the DNNs will strictly lie in some compact set, this excludes the assumption that is often used in the existing literature, ie, the robot states are assumed to be within a compact set. The robot control is composed of the dynamic inversion of the DNN system, adaptive compensation and a sliding control. The proof of a complete stability and the tracking error convergence is given by using Lyapunov stability theory that results in novel learning algorithms for the DNN systems. Simulations of a two-link manipulator show that stable adaptive control approach using DNNs performs better than that using SNNs.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["9"]}

By adding 0.5 {approximately} 10 wt.%(based on coal) pitch during dry milling coal surface became more hydrophobic and the coal could be easily prepared for CWS which had much lower viscosity compared with CWS of the untreated coal. The reasons of this result is high degree of hydrophobic surface of coal particles made surfactant adsorption easier compared with high degree of hydrophilic surface of coal particles. Another important reason in hydrophobic surface impeded the penetration of water into the inner pores of coal particles which resulted in decreasing swelling ability of coal and enhancing the fluidity of CWS. Four different additives have been investigated including three nonionic ethoxylated surfactants and one mixture of anionic surfactants (sodium humate derivative and naphthalenesulfonic acid-HCHO condensate). Both rheological and thixotropic properties showed that nonionic surfactant G2 was the most efficient additive for preparation of highly concentrated CWS.

To address this problem, we provide a modeling approach to separate the redundancy tactics from the base functional models using aspect-oriented modeling. More specifically, the conceptual models of the redundancy tactics and their semantic constraints are first de- fined for deriving the relevant aspects.

This paper attempts to present adsorption characteristics of Cu2+ on natural zeolite from Baiyin. The results showed that the adsorption depends on lower pH values (pH< 3) is explained by the dissolution of crystal structure and the competitive reaction between copper ions and H+. The results also showed that the reduction in grain size leads to increase in the adsorption capacity of zeolite, in that an increase of zeolite dose results in an increase in the adsorption efficiency. Different electrolytes have different effect on adsorption of Cu2+. The electrolytes employed exhibited the adsorption efficiencies in the order NaNO3> KNO3> Mg (NO3) 2> Ca (NO3) 2. When the concentration of the electrolyte (NaNO3) is between 0.0001 and 1 mol/L, adsorption capacity decreases initially, which will be attributed with increase in ionic concentration. The adsorption capacity of Cu2+ at 35 \u252c\u2551C was about 9% more than at 15 \u252c\u2551C. The results also showed that the adsorption capacity increases with an increase in initial concentration of Cu2+. This paper also discusses the kinetics and adsorption isotherms of Cu2+ on zeolite. The pseudosecond order model was found to be appropriate for kinetic analysis of the adsorption of Cu2+, whiles the Langmuir isotherm was well fitted with the experimental data rather than Freundlich isotherm. Experimental data showed that zeolite has the immense potential of immobilizing heavy metals in the study area.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["9"]}

{"title": "Research on the removal of o-phenylenediamine in water by immobilized laccase\n", "abstract": " Wastewater treatment by using laccase-immobilized chitosan with glutaraldehyde as crosslinking agent was studied. The kinetics and thermodynamic analysis of enzymatic reaction were carried out. The effects of factors such as concentration of glutaraldehyde, crosslinking time, concentration of laccase and immobilizing time on the activity of immobilized laccase were investigated. The immobilization of laccase was optimized in conditions which could be specified as: 5% of glutaraldehyde concentration, 8 h of crosslinking time, 20 g/L of laccase concentration and 6.5 h of immobilizing time. In the combined optimal conditions, laccase showed most promising immobilization where the activity of immobilized laccase was 15 015.4 U per gram carrier. In the second stage of research, the removal of o-phenylenediamine in aqueous solution by laccase immobilized on chitosan was studied. Factors such as pH value, temperature and adsorption on carrier that could influence the reaction were discussed in detail. The results indicated that the optimal pH for o-phenylenediamine removal by immobilized laccase was 6 while the optimum temperature for o-phenylenediamine removal by immobilized laccase was 50\u0393\u00e4\u00e2. The adsorption of o-phenylenediamine on carrier has a minor effect on the reaction and removal rate of o-phenylenediamine. The decrease of o-phenylenediamine level was resulted from the catalyzing capability of laccase in oxidation reaction. On the optimum condition, the removal rate of o-phenylenediamine can reach 94.8% when 100 mL of 200 mg/L o-phenylenediamine solution was oxidized by the aid of immobilized laccase which\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["9"]}

{"title": "Pipe testing with ultrasonic guided wave synthetic focusing techniques\n", "abstract": " Ultrasonic guided waves are routinely incorporated by industries for pipeline testing. Both guided wave energy tuning upon excitation and signal interpretation upon reception are important for discontinuity detection in pipes. Active phased array systems for long-range pipe inspection are available. Choosing active phased array or synthetic focusing is often necessary for improved testing speed, as well as overall penetration power. In this paper, two synthetic focusing techniques were utilized for discontinuity detection in a pipe. One synthetic focusing technique used time delays, while the other technique utilized a mode extraction and backpropagation scheme. Synthetic focusing techniques use either axisymmetric loading or partial loadings to generate guided waves and receive the waves by individual segments. Synthetic focusing is achieved by data analysis of the received signals, so it is faster to carry out a\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["9"]}

The Cu is used as a wetting material for the solder (ball). After reflow the Cu and solder joints are the main contact method for mechanical and electrical interconnection to the pads of the chip. One of the critical factors affecting solder joint reliability is the formation of intermetallic compound (IMC); that is generated at the interface of Cu/solder alloy. The formation of IMC is the merging of the plated copper and solder during the reflow process. The IMC will continue to grow when the structure is subjected to temperature. In this study, different current density (0.5ASD, 1.0ASD, 1.5ASD, 2.0 ASD, 2.5ASD, 3.0 ASD) are used on the Cu plating process, which produces different microstructure in the plated Cu layer.

{"title": "Synergistic effects of microwave doped Ag on the phase transformation and photocatalytic activity of nano-titania\n", "abstract": " The Ag-doped nano-titania with different Ag contents were prepared by the microwave treatment. It was found that the microwave-treated Ag doping played synergistic effect on the phase transformation and the photocatalytic activity of nano-titania. On the basis of the characterization by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectrophotometry, Raman and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, the prepared nano-titania were found to contain the anatase and rutile phases, and the formation of the rutile phase was promoted with the increasing Ag content. The doped Ag species mainly exist as Ag o/Ag+, which can effectively inhibit the recombination of the photoinduced electrons and holes, and the photoresponse of the nano-titania was red-shifted. The drastic enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of the Ag-doped nano-titania was evaluated by measuring the decomposition rates of rhodamine B exposed to the near ultraviolet-visible light radiation. For the Ag-doped nano-titania, the highest degradation ratio was observed with the Ag content (x) of 0.05%.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["9"]}

METHODS: 93 HCC tissues and 5 normal liver tissues were used to investigate the expressions of MIF, cyclin D1, CDK4 and phospho-Rb by tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry methods. RESULTS: The expression rates of MIF, cyclin D1, CDK4 and phospho-Rb in the HCC tissues were 71%, 41%, 82% and 14% respectively, and in the normal liver tissues, they were 0%, 0%, 80% and 20% respectively. The expression rates of MIF and cyclin D1 were significantly different between the tumor and the normal liver tissues and the expression rates of CDK4 and phospho-Rb were not significantly different between the tumor and the normal liver tissues. The rate difference (69% versus 48%) of MIF expression between the larger tumors (> 3.5 cm) and the smaller tumors (< 3.5 cm) was of statistical significance (P< 0.01). The expression rate (62%) of cyclin D1 in the tumors with metastasis was significantly higher than the expression rate (35%) in the tumors without metastasis (P< 0.05). MIF expression was positively correlated with cyclin D1 expression in the tumor tissues (P< 0.01). CDK4 and phospho-Rb expressions were not significantly associated with the tumor sizes and metastasis status.

{"title": "Definition and Digital Algorithm of Instantaneous Dielectric Loss Factor\n", "abstract": " Among the digital algorithms presently available for on-line monitoring of the dielectric loss factor of power apparatus, most of them must meet strictly the synchronous sampling criterion, simultaneously with a precondition that the power frequency must be invariable in the sampling periods. Based on the instantaneous frequency theory, a unique definition and corresponding digital algorithm of instantaneous dielectric loss factor were presented, and a theoretical basis of the algorithm was deduced accordingly. By solving over-determined equations, the parameters of the equivalent parallel circuit can be obtained through recursive iterations, and thereafter the waveform of instantaneous dielectric loss factor can be figured out. Simulations and experimental results show that, under non-stationary signal conditions where power frequencies are randomly variable, the algorithm can accurately track the instantaneous frequency of power signals and recursively calculate the parameters of the equivalent parallel circuit. The proposed algorithm is not constrained by the prerequisite that the traditional algorithms are subjected to and renders good application performance, without being affected by the limitations incurred from synchronous sampling and harmonics. In addition, the acquired monitoring data from this algorithm are preferable for flexible treatment, which presents convenient utilization of mathematical statistics approach for further diagnostic analysis.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["9"]}

The probes from R. niveus and R. ellipticus var. obcordatus gave robust signals at the same region of eight chromosomes. R. ellipticus and R. pinfaensis generated strong signals at the centromeric and sub-terminal parts of six chromosomes. The hybridization signals from the R. tsangii and R. corchorifolius probes existed only at the telomeric parts of four chromosomes.

{"title": "Improvement of an infrared/millimeter wave mirror array beam combiner by the wavefront division imaging technique\n", "abstract": " In order to reduce the complexity of splicing the mirrors of an infrared (IR)/millimeter wave (MMW) beam combiner into a plane, the wavefront division imaging technique (WDIT) was proposed. However, WDIT would lead to the difference of air gap thicknesses among different mirrors, which will further cause the nonuniformity of the MMW field. Simultaneously, there were slots between every two mirrors after the mirror array was spliced and adjusted, which would also affect MMW and IR diffraction. Thus, the aperture field integration method (AFIM) was proposed to compute the MMW near field distribution and the IR far field distribution. The method was validated by comparing the results obtained from the multilevel fast multipole method and experiment. The experimental results showed that the diffraction phenomenon caused by a tilt slot or a hole can approximate that caused by a slot with the width or a hole with\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["9"]}

During transformation in each of the six events, portions of both the right border (RB) and left border (LB) regions of the T-DNA were deleted, ranging from a 7 nucleotide deletion of the LB repeats in event RF1 to a 207 bp deletion of the LB region in event RF2. For the six events, T-DNA integration resulted in a deletion at the target site spanning less than 100 bp. Sequence analysis indicated that the T-DNA was integrated into the coding region of various native rapeseed genes in events RF1 and RF2.

After week-96 of treatment, the ETV group continued to have a higher CVR rate (86.0% vs. LAM: 71.4%), and virology rebound was experienced by significantly less subjects in the ETV group (1.2% vs. LAM: 11.9%, P= 0.005). CONCLUSION: ETV therapy can quickly and continuously suppress HBV replication in chronic hepatitis B patients, and has a lower resistance rate than LAM. Compared to LAM, ETV may be a superior long-term treatment choice for chronic hepatitis B.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["9"]}
{"title": "Providing support for specifying redundancy tactics using aspect-oriented modeling\n", "abstract": " Modelers want to model redundancy tactics in the design phase so as to provide fault-tolerance guidelines for the following development process. However, existing approaches usually interweave redundancy tactics into the functional models and result in complex and cluttered models, which are difficult and time-consuming to be maintained. To address this problem, we provide a modeling approach to separate redundancy tactics from the base functional models using aspect-oriented modeling. First of all, the conceptual models of redundancy tactics and their semantic constraints are provided for deriving the tactic aspects. After mapping the tactic concepts into the concepts of aspect-oriented modeling, UML profiles for specifying the tactic aspects are proposed. Based on our tactic aspects and their configured attributes, we provide a weaving algorithm to associate the tactic aspects with the base functional\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["9"]}

The noise source of the engine is hard to be approximated by a few equivalent point sources, which makes the control of sound power hard with limited number of control sources. An acoustical enclosure around the sides of the engine is adopted to convert the three dimensional noise source of the engine to a simple noise radiation from two ends of an open duct. A model with the equivalent source method is developed to estimate the property of the radiated sound field and predict the performance of active noise control before and after applying passive control to the engine. Preliminary experiment results are also given to verify the simulation results and illustrate the sound power reduction.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["9"]}

{"title": "Experimental research on thermal damage properties of marble at high temperature\n", "abstract": " The mechanical properties of marble were studied using the MTS 810 rock mechanics servo-controlled testing system at 800 C. This was done to analyze the stress-strain curve, peak stress, modulus of elasticity of marble. The results show that the peak stress and elastic modulus decrease with the increase of temperature in different degrees, especially the rock mechanical strength will decrease suddenly in different intervals of temperature. Marble ductility increases greatly at 800 C. Based on the strain strength theory and the random statistical distribution hypothesis of rock strength, a statistical constitutive model for rock damage under uniaxial compression, in which the nonlinear relation of unit volume failure or elastic modulus and the temperature are taken into consideration, is established by adopting the damage constitutive theory of continuous medium and then the parameters for statistical damage constitutive model of marble considering temperature effect are given.

Vascular endothelial growth factor-B (VEGF-B) was used to induce and stimulate hepatocellular carcinoma cell line MHCC97-H. Morphologic changes of MHCC97-H were investigated. The expression of E-cadherin and alpha-catenin (two epithelial markers) and Vimentin and N-cadherin (two mesenchymal markers) was detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blotting, and immunofluorescence staining. Cell invasion and migration test was performed. Treatment of MHCC97-H cells with VEGF-B led to morphologic changes characteristic of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), including loss of polarity, increased intercellular separation, and the presence of pseudopodia. Expression of the epithelial adhesion molecules, including E-cadherin and alpha-catenin, was decreased after VEGF-B treatment. Conversely, an increase in the expression of the mesenchymal cell markers, including N-cadherin and vimentin, was observed after VEGF-B treatment (P less than 0.05). VEGF-B-treated cells exhibited a change in E-cadherin from an organized, membrane-bound structure to a disorganized state in which it was noted to be dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. Pretreatment with VEGFR-1 blocking antibody 18F1 inhibited the change in localization of E-cadherin induced by VEGF-B treatment.

This paper introduces the VIC model and SWAT model from the interdisciplinary aspect of hydrology and meteorology. The two models were applied to Bailian River Valley of Hubei province to discuss its adaptability in flow simulation of the mid-small valley. Combined with DEM, vegetation and soil data, through model pre-processing, the framework of VIC model and SWAT model in Bailian river valley was established. The results show that the simulation difference of the VIC model and SWAT model is very small, the efficiency coefficient and correlation coefficient of the SWAT model are higher than that of the VIC model, and the annual simulation effect of the SWAT model is more average. But the simulation effect of the VIC model is better in 1995 and 1999 than in the other years; especially the flood simulation result is great distinct from the fact measure data in 2002, which lead to the whole lowness efficiency coefficient, the flood simulation result of the SWAT model approaches the actual data.

In this approach no one knows the global state of the system while users try to maximize their own utility. Since the performance of such a blind scheduler is worse than optimal, it induces users to employ strategies that improve their own utilization of the system. One such strategy is that of restarting a request if it is not satisfied in a given time. Since we assume users as noncooperative and selfish, the problem is that of studying the characteristics of the Nash equilibrium in a large distributed system with no omniscient controls. We study this problem through computer experiments and analytical approaches. We obtain exact solutions in situations delimited by two extremes: one in which users never restart an initial request, and another one in which the user\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s requests are restarted infinitely often. Users can switch between these two behaviors.

The results showed that: with grassland degradation aggrivating, the composition, structure and species diversity of plant communities have been changed to a great extent. Dominant species of plant communities successed from primary species such as Levmus secalinus and Poa crvmophila to Stipa purpurea, and companion species obviously successed from each other because of long-term grazing on grassland. With aggravation of grassland degradation, species diversity, richness and evenness of plant communities obviously decreased, while dominance of community gradually increased. However, species diversity, richness and evenness of plant communities of fenced grassland were apparently lower than that of suitable grazing. It is indicated that suitable grazing on grassland could increase species diversity and richness of plant communities, overgrazing on grassland could inevitably result in converse succession, and long-term fencing treatment was unfavorable for increasing species diversity and richness of plant community.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["9"]}

The killing rate was higher obviously than that of TILs not stimulated by DCs and T lymphocytes stimulated by DCs or not on autogenous breast cancer cells, respectively [killing rates:(52.11+/-1.48)%,(51.35+/-1.46)%, and (3.59+/-0.25)%, respectively]. However, their killing activities on Bcap-37 breast cancer cells were lower [killing rates:(40.03+/-1.29)%,(22.09+/-0.87)%,(21.66+/-0.85)%, and (1.76+/-0.14)%, respectively]. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that DC from the patients with breast cancer can induce TIL to produce efficient and specific anti-breast cancer immune response.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["9"]}
{"title": "Dynamic neuro-fuzzy adaptive control for flexible-link manipulators\n", "abstract": " A dynamic neuro-fuzzy (NF) adaptive control system is presented in this paper for the trajectory tracking of a flexible-link robot with poorly known dynamics, where the robot tip vibration is measured by an optical measurement device with position sensitive detectors (PSDs). Based on the singular perturbation method and two time-scale decompositions, the dynamic model of a flexible-link manipulator is first approximated by a slow subsystem of an equivalent rigid-link arm and a fast subsystem of flexible mode. Then, a dynamic NF system is constructed to approximate the slow dynamics of the flexible-link manipulator. The dynamic NF adaptive controller based on dynamic inversion is designed for the tracking control of the equivalent rigid arm, while a fuzzy proportionalderivative (PD) type controller is used to stabilize the elastic dynamics using PSD measurement feedback.

METHODS: G1025C (Try316Ser) polymorphism in apoH gene was determined by PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing in 100 healthy controls, 260 patients with stroke, and 20 stroke pedigrees. Serum antiphospholipid antibody (APA) levels were tested by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Plasma lipid levels were measured by routine methods. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found in frequencies of genotypes and alleles of G1025C (Try316Ser) polymorphism between the controls and stroke patients. The serum levels of TG in the GC genotype of cerebral infarction patients and controls were markedly higher than those in GG genotype.

Methods Normal values of bone mineral density for tot al body (TBMD) and selected regions of interest (BMD), including head, chest, midriff, pelvis, leg s and arms, were derived from measurements on 1025 children and adolescents 6 to 8 years from Beijing city. BMD was determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiomet ry (DEXA). Results Bone mineralization increased gradually in early childhood and accelerated during adolescence and there were significant age and gender effect s on all regions of interest as well as on total body. Although development of b one was heterogene ous in term of sex, magnitude and localization, it seems females had a hi gher BMD than their counterparts between the ages of 10 and 15years, from age 16 years, it is quiet on the contrary except BMD for head. Parts of reasons were d ue to femalesearlier outset of acceleration for increase on BMD. Compared with white-origin children, the subjects were bestowed with less TBMD.

{"title": "Evaluation of Cathra system for identifying gram negative aerobic bacteria.\n", "abstract": " The Cathra system is a commercial multipoint inoculation method for the identification of aerobic Gram negative bacteria. The system uses a replicator technique in which 21 different agar media can be inoculated simultaneously with 36 organisms. Identifications are made by use of a special computer database. The performance of this system was compared with that of the API 20E for the identification of 372 clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and 133 miscellaneous Gram negative bacteria. For enterobacteria, the Cathra system was in 97% agreement with API 20E at species level and 98% at genus level. For miscellaneous Gram negative strains the two systems were in 59% agreement at species level and 77% at genus level. The Cathra system is suitable for use in diagnostic laboratories, especially those with a heavy workload and a wish to use break-point sensitivity testing.

{"title": "Compressive tracking via weighted classification boosted by feature selection\n", "abstract": " The drifting problem of object tracking is efficiently alleviated in our research. In this paper, an advanced compressive tracking algorithm based on a weighted classifier boosted by feature selection is proposed. The compressed features with high discrimination are selected from the target information of previous and current frames by a discrimination evaluating strategy. These discriminating features are used to train a weighted classifier, which is composed of two sub-classifiers based on previous and current samples bags. Finally, the weighted classifier is used to tell the target object from the background. Experimental results show that the performance in terms of accuracy and robustness hugely improves in tracking via the proposed classification method.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["9"]}
{"title": "Efficiently approximate method for near field uniformity evaluation of finite-sized multilayered dielectric plates\n", "abstract": " A method for joint transmission line and aperture field integration (TL-AFIM) is proposed and utilized to efficiently compute the near-field distribution of the finite-sized multilayered dielectric plates. Four indicators Epv, Erms, \u2567\u00e5pv, and \u2567\u00e5rms representing the amplitude and phase variations are proposed to evaluate the near-field uniformity. A multilayered dielectric plate containing three dielectric layers is analyzed and evaluated by TL-AFIM. Compared to the commonly used multilevel fast multipole method (MLFMM), the memory requirement and CPU time consumption are drastically reduced from 61.3\u252c\u00e1GB and 20.2\u252c\u00e1h to 4.4\u252c\u00e1MB and 2.5\u252c\u00e1s, respectively.

{"title": "Regulated Expression of PTPRJ by COX-2/PGE2 Axis in Endothelial Cells\n", "abstract": " Background This study was designed to examine a novel role of COX-2/PGE2 signaling as a regulator of PTPRJ expression in endothelial cells.  Methods A bioinformatics analysis of a whole genome array was carried out to search for regulators of PTPRJ expression in endothelial cells. PTPRJ expression was also measured in endothelial cells derived from a balloon injury-induced neointimal hyperplasia model in male New Zealand Rabbits. Changes in PTPRJ expression in HUVEC cells was examined by RT-PCR and western blotting after transfection of COX-2 plasmids or treatment with varying concentrations of a COX-2 inhibitor.  Results A significant correlation was identified between COX-2 and PTPRJ in GSE39264 (Pearson correlation coefficient = \u0393\u00ea\u00c60.87; n = 22; P<0.01, two-tailed). PTPRJ expression was reduced during the progression of neointimal hyperplasia after balloon injury, which correlated with an increase in COX-2 expression. In HUVECs, after transfection with 1 \u252c\u2561g/ml, 0.5 \u252c\u2561g/ml, or 0.25 \u252c\u2561g/ml COX-2 plasmids, PTPRJ protein expression was reduced to 0.60- (\u252c\u25920.08), 0.75- (\u252c\u25920.09), and 0.88- (\u252c\u25920.04) fold, respectively, while mRNA expression was reduced to 0.15- (\u252c\u25920.03), 0.26- (\u252c\u25920.05), and 0.47- (\u252c\u25920.09) fold, respectively. After treatment of HUVECs with 10 \u252c\u2561mol/L or 20 \u252c\u2561mol/L celecoxib, the reduction in PTPRJ expression induced by COX-2 over-expression was not only rescued but in fact increased by 2.05-fold (\u252c\u25920.28) and 3.34-fold (\u252c\u25920.37), respectively, compared with control.  Conclusions Our results suggest that COX-2/PGE2 signaling may function as a negative regulator of PTPRJ expression in endothelial cells both in vivo\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["9"]}

{"title": "Research progress of effects of strontium ranelate on osteoarthritis\n", "abstract": " OBJECTIVE: To review the research progress focused on the effects of strontium ranelate (SR) on osteoarthritis. METHODS: The relevant literature about the effects and mechanism of SR intervening osteoarthritis in recent years was extensively reviewed and comprehensively analyzed. RESULTS: SR not only could improve the microenvironment of bone metabolism in articular cartilage with osteoarthritis, promote activity of osteoblasts, and inhibit activity of osteoclasts, but also could adjust the expression of key proteases which affect cartilage formation, and therefore it has a potential protective effect on subchondral bone during the progression of osteoarthritis cartilage. CONCLUSION: SR is expected to become a drug of osteoarthritis disease remission, but further studies are needed to clarify the mechanism of SR in osteoarthritis, and finally confirm the best application dosage of SR in osteoarthritis treatment.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["9"]}
{"title": "Risk factors of persistent thrombocytopenia after adult liver transplantation and prophylactic measures\n", "abstract": " OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk factors associated with persistent thrombocytopenia after liver transplantation (LT), and to explore effective measures for prevention. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-eight adult patients, who received liver transplantation in our hospital between January 2009 and June 2012 and met the inclusive criteria, were enrolled in the study. The clinical data were retrospectively analyzed, including pre-LT spleen volume, main portal vein size, coronary vein size, platelet and white blood cell levels, total bilirubin level and model of end stage liver disease score. The risk factors associated with persistent thrombocytopenia after LT were evaluated by logistic regression analysis. The effect of simultaneous splenic artery coarctation for high risk patients was evaluated with \u2567\u00e72 test. RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis showed that per-LT spleen volume larger than 500 ml (P= 0.012, OR= 2.789, 95% CI: 1.249-6.227) and portal vein size beyond 15 mm (P= 0.017, OR= 3.124, 95% CI: 1.230-7.933) were independent risk factors for persistent thrombocytopenia after LT. The incidence rate of persistent thrombocytopenia after LT in patients with or without simultaneous splenic artery coarctation were 16.7%(1/6) and 66.7%(32/48), respectively (P< 0.05). CONCLUSION: Spleen volume larger than 500 ml and portal vein size beyond 15 mm are risk factors for persistent thrombocytopenia after LT. Simultaneous splenic artery coarctation may reduce the occurrence of persistent thrombocytopenia after LT.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["9"]}

{"title": "Resource state monitoring of service transactions in cloud systems\n", "abstract": " In cloud systems, services constituting a transaction may spread over a large number of servers or clusters. Theoretically, these services could consume cloud resources unlimitedly. To avoid financial loss due to resource overuse, clouds have to monitor the state of resources consumed by the services-collect values of consumption, and evaluate whether the combined usage of resources has excessed a pre-defined upper bound or not. The distributed nature of the services introduces a challenge to the monitoring system on how to summarise distributed state information with low cost. We present our resource state monitoring solution to capture the challenge introduced by services hosted in clouds. Our solution tracks the resource consumed by each service constituting a transaction individually whilst ensures the whole transaction does not overuse the allocated resource. It improves availability by avoiding single\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["9"]}
{"title": "In vivo evaluation of magnetic and hydrodynamic suspension centrifugal ventricular assist device\n", "abstract": " OBJECTIVE: To verify the function of magnetic and hydrodynamic suspension centrifugal ventricular assist device in a sheep model. METHODS: The device was implanted into left ventricular apex on beating hearts. The outflow graft of each device was anastomosed to descending aorta in 11 animals. Hematologic, biochemical and blood clotting tests before and after surgery were performed. The data of pump functions were collected continuously. RESULTS: Among them, there were death from ventricular fibrillation (n= 3), acute pulmonary edema (n= 1) and left ventricular thrombus and molar cardiac muscle (n= 5). One animal survived for 75 days and died from bacterial infection after pumping for 59 hours. During assistance for 120 days, the flow rate was 3.0-3.4 L/min. All hematologic and biochemical parameters were within normal ranges in one sheep. The walking sheep wore the controller and lithium battery with a blood pump. Neither mechanical wearing nor thrombus formation was observed for inflow and outflow conduits or pump interior. CONCLUSIONS: The magnetic and hydrodynamic suspension centrifugal ventricular assist device demonstrates excellent hemocompatibility and reliability.

METHODS: The recurrent murine model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after liver transplantation was established by transplanting tumor cells of hind paw pads. MSCs labeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP) were injected into the marrow cavity of 615 mice after successful modeling. And the proliferation of MSCs in marrow cavity was observed under stereoscopic fluorescence microscope. MSCs labeled with red fluorescent protein (RFP) were injected into tail vein of mice during tumor dissection. The migration of GFP and RFP-labeled MSCs were tracked before and after tumor recurrence. After recurrence, the mice were sacrificed and the recurrent lesions harvested for conforming pathological type by biopsy. RESULTS: The rate of success modeling was 37.5%. Both gross morphology and pathological examination corresponded to typical HCC manifestations. Thirty mice were detected by GFP/RFP fluorescence for a recurrence of HCC. The outcomes were GFP+ RFP (n= 4), GFP (n= 1) and neither (n= 25). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of MSCs in host may be one of important reasons for recurrent HCC after liver transplantation. It helps to support the traditional view of residual tumor cells mediating the relapse and metastasis of HCC.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["9"]}

The conventional user-based collaborative filtering (CF) cannot well satisfy users\u0393\u00c7\u00d6 requirements, besides the recommendation results are not accurate enough. To improve the conventional user-based CF, this paper proposes an adaptive CF method based on multiple features. We take four considerations into account: 1) redefining itemitem/ user-user similarity by utilizing item/user vector; 2) making predictions based on the relation between the predicted item and the rated similar items; 3) modifying the rating according to the interest in the type of item; 4) improving the diversity of recommendation. The proposed method is easy to implement, and experimental results based on two well-known datasets have demonstrated the superiority in accuracy and diversity.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["9"]}

Degradation mechanism and volatile products at various temperatures of each sample were studied. The results show that the fibers with higher stabilization were more stable. It is indicated that degradation process of fibers can be divided into three stages and most of the weight loss occurs at the second stage. The gaseous products such as H2 O, NH3, HCN, CO and CO2 are formed, meanwhile, the amount of volatile products of fibers were closely related to stabilization of fibers.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["9"]}
{"title": "Sequential implementing farmland consolidation and replacing cattle with machine to control schistosomiasis\n", "abstract": " OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the schistosomiasis control effect of sequential farmland consolidation and replacing bovine with machine. METHODS: Two farmlands of Qianjiang City were selected as experimental districts, and the sequential implementing farmland consolidation and replacing bovine with machine were carried out. The schistosomiasis epidemic situation was observed continuously. RESULTS: From 2008 to 2012, the human schistosome infection rate decreased by 78.90%, in which the seropositive rate decreased by 47.88%(chi2= 368.58, P< 0.01) and the stool positive rate decreased by 55.88%(chi2= 29.92, P< 0.01). The schistosome infection rate of cattle was 2.54% in 2008, but from 2009, there were no cattle in the area. The Oncomelania snail area decreased by 54.78%, and the rate of frames with living snails and the mean density of living snails decreased by 76.49% and 72.63%(chi2= 11.34, 12.86, P< 0.01) respectively. Since 2009, no infected snails were found. CONCLUSION: The sequential implementing farmland consolidation and replacing cattle with machine can effectively control the transmission of schistosomiasis.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["9"]}
{"title": "Planning with multi-valued landmarks\n", "abstract": " Landmark heuristics are perhaps the most accurate current known admissible heuristics for optimal planning. A disjunctive action landmark can be seen a form of at-least-one constraint on the actions it contains. In many domains, some critical propositions have to be established for a number of times. Propositional landmarks are too weak to express this kind of constraints. In this paper, we propose to generalize landmarks to multi-valued landmarks to represent the more general cardinality constraints. We present a class of local multi-valued landmarks that can be efficiently extracted from propositional landmarks. By encoding multi-valued landmarks into CNF formulas, we can also use SAT solvers to systematically extract multi-valued landmarks.

However, there isn't a generic framework that can guide modelers through the derivation process of a domain-specific architecture modeling method (AMM). This process is usually complicated especially when the system is large-scale. In this paper, we propose a generic framework (named as GCVL) to guide modelers to devise AMMs for various domains. GCVL framework has been evaluated by applying it to derive an AMM (named as SAMM) for the ship command and control systems. SAMM is evaluated through a full-size industrial application.

The test results show that when the reaction temperature is relatively low, there will be almost no carbon dioxide to be produced and the oxidation of CH4 will produce an intermediate product CO. With a rise of the reaction temperature, the CO will be gradually oxidized to CO2. An addition of inert particles will raise the ignition temperature of CH4 and prohibit the conversion efficiency of methane in the high temperature section. A presence of inert particles will lower the temperature corresponding to the CO maximal peak value. With a decrease of the inlet gas speed and an increase of the bed temperature, the conversion rate of methane will increase. However, to change the concentration of methane will basically have no influence on the conversion rate of methane.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["9"]}

Some tensioned cables are attached between the upper and lower skins to control the three-dimensional shape of the wing. Analyzing the stress distribution of the inner tensioned cables, it is beneficial to obtain an intrinsic relationship among the stress of the tensioned cables, the pressure and the thickness of the skin. Based on this relationship, a reasonable design scheme is put forward. In order to grasp the morphing characteristics of LBIW, experimental and numerical simulation approaches are adopted. This paper establishes a detailed finite element model and puts emphasis on solving the intricate nonlinear geometry and the influence on LBIW under different inflation pressure.

The morphology of the YVO4 flowerlike architectures can be easily controlled by adjusting the pH value of the reaction system. Proper reaction temperature and the basic source ammonia are key requirements for the fabrication of the flowerlike architectures. The additive Na2H2L can coordinate with metal ions to form strong complexes and be absorbed on specific crystal surfaces of the initial colloidal precipitates, which serve as seeds for the anisotropic growth. The formation mechanism for the YVO4 assemblies has been discussed on the basis of time-dependent experiments.

{"title": "The Course and Molecular Weight Model for Cationic Emulsion Condensation Polymerization of Polydimethylsiloxanols [J]\n", "abstract": " The reaction course and kinetics model of cationic emulsion condensation polymerization were investigated by using the polydimethylsiloxanols (PDMS) as monomer and benzyldimethyldodecyl-ammonium hydroxide (DBAH) as cationic emulsifying agent and catalyst. The polymerization was carried out in a glass reactor with mechanical stirring, and during the course of reaction, a certain amount of reactant was taken out sever times to measure the molecular weight of the synthesizing polymer (by GPC), the particle size of emulsion and the surface tension of the system. It was found that the particle size and the surface tension at the air-water interface keep essentially unchanged during the whole course of the polymerization reaction. It indicates that the monomers do not undergo a migration in the aqueous phases to form new particles, and the condensation polymerization is performed only on the oil-water interface of particles formed by monomer liquid drops. Based on above understanding, the molecular weight model of the condensation polymerization products was derived; combining with the experimental data of molecular weight, the constants of Arrhenius formula kF in the molecular weight model at various temperatures were obtained. Moreover, according to van\u0393\u00c7\u00d6t Hoff equation, the enthalpy of condensation polymerization reaction \u256c\u00f6H was calculated too.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["9"]}

{"title": "Clinical observation of xenoskin to cover microskin graft in the treatment of patients with deep burns\n", "abstract": " OBJECTIVE: To explore the feasibility of application of xenoskin as microskin graft covering. METHODS: Ten patients with deep and extensive burns were enrolled in the study. A white pig weighing about 50kg was cleaned and shaved (without boiled water treatment) after being slaughtered. After conventional disinfection, two pieces of skin with little amount of fat were removed from the pig and processed to full-thickness or split-thickness skin. Before operation they were perforated and autogeneic microskin was scattered onto it. After escharectomy they were grafted on the wound, and the wound was dressed and bandaged with pressure. The rejection of the xenoskin, the survival of the microskin grafts, the wound healing time, and the functional recovery of the patients 1 year after operation were observed. RESULTS: The porcine skin was intact, and stuck well to the wound within 2 post-operation weeks (POW). But it turned to form a dry scab, and gradually separated from the autogeneic microskin during 4-5 POW. The xenoskin completely fell off and the wound healed during 6-8 POW. The wound healing time of the 10 patients was 42-56 days [(50+/-5) d]. Though there were thin scars 1 year after operation, the elasticity and function of the skin were normal.

Primary cultured HUVECs were randomly divided into control group, hypoxia/reoxygenation group, 11, 12-EET control group, 11, 12-EET hypoxia/reoxygenation group, inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERKI/2) group, and inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) group. Hypoxia/reoxygenation injury model in HUVECs was established by exposure to hypoxia (2% O2, 5% CO2 and 93% N2) for 3 hours, followed by reoxygenation (95% air and 5% CO2) for 1 hour. The evaluation of the endothelial cells were made by immunohistochemistry. The cell viability was monitored by MTT assay. Colorimetry method was used to assay the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malondialdehyde (MDA) and activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in culture medium. Western blot was used to detect the expressions of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and phosphorylated ERK1/2 in HUVECs. 11, 12-EET caused minor injury in normal oxygen incubated HUVECs; however, in hypoxia/reoxygenation HUVECs, it raised the cell viability markedly, decreased the LDH release and MDA content, and increased the activity of SOD and the expressions of eNOS and phosphorylated ERK1/2.11, 12-EET may prevent against endothelial cell hypoxia/reoxygenation injury.

{"title": "Density Functional Theory Investigation of Product Distribution following Reaction of Acrylonitrile on Diamond (001)-2\u251c\u00f9 1 Surface\n", "abstract": " The reaction of acrylonitrile with the C(001)-2\u251c\u00f91 surface has been investigated by employing density functional cluster model calculations. The calculations revealed eight possible reaction pathways for acrylonitrile with the surface dimer. Full geometry optimized structures were obtained for all adducts, including intra- and interdimer reaction products. These results were analyzed in terms of both the total energy values and the detailed optimized geometries. We find that the reaction of acrylonitrile with the diamond (001) surface occurs primarily through its nonpolar CC group and the intradimer [2+2]cc product is the dominant product. All these results are in good agreement with the experimental work by Schwartz. It is noteworthy that the isomerization process plays an important role in the chemisorption process. Both intradimer [4+2] product and interdimer [2+2]cc product can isomerize to the intradimer [2+2]cc\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["9"]}
{"title": "Improved automatic gain control circuit using fuzzy logic\n", "abstract": " A problem that arises in most communication receivers concerns the wide variation in power level of the signals received at the antenna. These variations cause serious problems which are usually be solved in receiver design by using Automatic Gain Control (AGC). AGC is achieved by using an amplifier whose gain can be controlled by using external current or voltage. We have to note that the AGC circuit does not respond to rapid changes in the amplitude of input and multifrequency. Nowadays, with the development of the fuzzy theory, the advantages of the fuzzy logic are recognized widely and deeply. Applying fuzzy logic to AGC circuit is a way to enhance AGC circuit.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["9"]}

Firstly, we input parameters of the processing condition, build the parametric model using APDL and mesh the model. Then calculate the deviation between boundary electric-field intensity of the anode and its theoretical value and transform it to the cathode boundary based on the iteration criterion. Thereafter the model is modified with APDL and a new cathode boundary is defined. The boundary of the cathode is kept being revised again and again until the deviation satisfies the given error scope. Since the iterating algorithm is programmed in Visual C++ 6.0 and the ANSYS 8.0 is only called as subroutine to analyze the distribution of electric field in gap, therefore we can deal with the complex boundary much flexibly and speed up the convergence. After eighteen iterations, the value of object function satisfied the give error scope (O\u0393\u00eb\u00f1 5).

{"title": "Changes in voltage-dependent calcium channel currents of vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from small mesenteric arteries of simulated weightless rats\n", "abstract": " The aim of the present study was to examine the changes in the function of voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDC) of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) isolated from small mesenteric arteries of rats subjected to 1-week or 4-week simulated weightlessness. The whole-cell recording mode was used to record current densities and Ba (2+) was used as charge carrier. Curves and fitting parameters describing steady-state activation and inactivation characteristics of VDC were thus obtained. The inward currents recorded from the VSMCs of small mesenteric arteries were mainly the Ba (2+) currents through the long-lasting type VDC (L-VDC). Compared with that of the control rats, the L-VDC current density of VSMCs from small mesenteric arteries showed a trend toward a decrease in the rats after 1-week, while a significant decrease was observed in the rats after 4-week simulated weightlessness. However, there were no significant differences in the opening and closing rates of L-VDCs, the position of steady-state activation and inactivation curves, and in the parameters, V (0.5) and k, between either of the two groups and its respective control group. The membrane capacitance and the reversal potential of the VSMCs from the small mesenteric arteries of rats after simulated weightlessness also showed no significant changes. These findings suggest that the decreased function of the L-VDC in hindquarter VSMCs might be one of the electrophysiological mechanisms that mediate the depressed vasoreactivity and atrophic change in hindquarter arteries during adaptation to simulated weightlessness in rats.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["9"]}

{"title": "Impact Response of Aluminium and Aluminium Matrix Syntactic Foams\n", "abstract": " The increasing risks of terrorist attacks have prompted more efforts in the materials community to develop materials for the protection of human bodies, buildings, vehicles and machineries against impact and blast. Al foams have attracted an increasing level of interest in both academia and industry as energy absorbing materials because of their good combinations of specific strength, stiffness, ductility, temperature capability and durability. More recently, Al matrix syntactic foams have attracted considerable attention because they potentially have high energy-absorption capacities over a wide range of impact velocities. This paper investigates the energy absorption behaviour of the Al and Al matrix syntactic foams, manufactured by the sintering and dissolution process and/or the melt infiltration method, under static and dynamic compressive conditions. The results show that the energy absorbed by an Al foam in the dynamic condition is normally less than half of that in the static condition at any given strain. The energy absorption capacity is mainly dependent upon the relative density but is also affected by the shape and size of the pores. The Al foams manufactured by SDP and melt infiltration are characteristic of fine and uniform pores and therefore have smooth stress-strain curves. For similar pore sizes and porosities, the Al foams manufactured by melt infiltration are stronger than the Al foams manufactured by SDP. Compared with the Al foams, the Al matrix syntactic foam is much stronger but has a lower porosity. The preliminary tests have indicated that Al matrix syntactic foams have potential for energy absorption applications.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["9"]}

The single array position is beneficial if access to a pipe is limited, e.g. steam pipes onboard U.S. Naval ships, nuclear power plant pipes, oil and natural gas pipelines. The steam pipes have a protective coating which would ordinarily be removed and replaced for an inspection. From a single array position, ultrasonic guided waves propagate under the coating, down the length of the pipe and return information about potential defects. Focusing the ultrasonic energy at a predetermined location along the length of the pipe enhances the ability to detect defects that current state of the art inspection systems cannot. Focusing is achieved by applying excitation time delays to a multi-channel signal generation system.

The results show that the high temperature strength of the composite is significantly higher than that of monolithic MoSi sub 2 . With increasing SiC volume fraction, the yield strength and flow stress of composite increase. The relationship between yield strength sigma sub y and interparticle spacing lambda sub s follows equation as sigma sub y = sigma sub 0 + kappa lambda sub s exp -1/2 .

At room temperature the easy magnetization direction changes from perpendicular to the c-axis to parallel to the c-axis with increasing Ce concentration. A spin-reorientation transition from easy-axis anisotropy at higher temperatures to easy-plane anisotropy at lower temperatures arises at about 600, 530 and 320 K in Ce1.3Y0.7Co17, Ce1.5Y0.5Co17 and Ce1.7Y0.3Co17, respectively.

{"title": "The simulation and modelling of safety systems for construction robots\n", "abstract": " An earlier paper1 discussed the creation of a series of safety zones around a construction robot to ensure the safety of site personnel, of the machine itself and of the other machines and systems with which it must coexist and collaborate and considered possible means for the monitoring of these zones. However, the identification of hazards and associated risk evaluation required to generate a conceptual design for a safety system is only the first stage in the implementation of such a system. In practice, the achievement of a safety system which is both dependable and practicable relies on the provision of the necessary verification and validation features within the design and implementation process2. Safety verification and validation requires the designer to undertake a comprehensive examination of the designed safety system and its behaviour to establish deficiencies and errors. Essential to the verification and validation process are two questions. Firstly, how should the verification be carried out? Secondly, should the safety-related systems be verified discretely or continuously? The answer to the first question is that verification is conventionally achieved by the use of modelling and simulation to increase understanding of system behaviour and to evaluate strategies for system operation3. In relation to the second point, continuous verification is time-consuming and expensive. However, discrete verification is insufficient for systems such as robots carrying out a series of sequential actions. For example, a system carrying out a continuous series of actions under program control might give rise to hazardous situations at any point in the\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["9"]}

{"title": "Cost optimal planning with multi-valued landmarks\n", "abstract": " Landmark based heuristics are among the most accurate current known admissible heuristics for cost optimal planning. A disjunctive action landmark can be seen as a form of at-least-one constraint on the actions it contains. In many domains, there are many critical propositions which have to be established for a number of times. Previous landmarks are too weak to express this kind of general cardinality constraints. In this paper, we propose to generalize landmarks to multi-valued landmarks to model general cardinality constraints in cost optimal planning. We show existence of complete multi-valued landmark sets by explicitly constructing complete multi-valued action landmark sets for general planning tasks. Because exact lower bounds of general multi-valued action landmarks are intractable to extract and exploit, we introduce multi-valued proposition landmarks from which multi-valued action landmarks can be\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["9"]}

{"title": "Therapeutic targeting truncated adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) proteins for the selective killing of colorectal cancer cells\n", "abstract": " The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene is a multifunctional tumor suppressor mutated in over 80% of colorectal cancers (CRC). Mutations in APC are believed to be one of the earliest events that contribute to CRC initiation. APC has been implicated in the negative regulation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, cell cycle control, cell migration, differentiation, and apoptosis. However, there remain many unanswered questions about the precise roles of APC in CRC progression. For example, over 90% of APC mutations result in truncated proteins, among which termination mutations at codons 1309 and 1450 occur the most frequently. It is completely unclear why the vast majority of human colon cancers would retain truncated APC proteins unless there was some survival/growth advantage to the emerging tumor. We hypothesized that these truncated APC proteins may actually play a dominant (gain of function) role in the initiation and/or progression of CRC and have conducted experiments to test this idea. Our rationale for these experiments is there are no disease-specific targeted treatments for CRC and therapeutic agents targeting APC truncations could be beneficial. We developed a unique series of telomerase (TERT) and CDK4 immortalized human colonic epithelial cell (HCEC) lines and experimentally made isogenic derivatives by ectopic expression of the most commonly observed APC truncations found in patients. In addition, we made TERT and CDK4 expressing HCECs with TP53 and APC knockdowns as well as ectopic expression of oncogenic KRASv12.

{"title": "Is a Dendritic Drainage Basin Inevitable?\n", "abstract": " Channel networks in drainage basins take dendritic forms in the absence of structural controls. It has been known for over 20 years that simple numerical models based on a cellular discretization, and starting from a randomized surface that is subject to rainfall and uplift, spontaneously yield dendritic channel networks. Such numerical landscapes usually reach a steady-state configuration, after which uplift and denudation are in balance and the network no longer evolves. Changed initial randomization is expected to yield a steady state that is different in details, but statistically the same. It has been argued that the dendritic nature of the network is a response to various optimality conditions. Optimality, however, requires one or more parameters to deviate from their extremal values were the steady-state equilibrium to be perturbed.

Different formulations of E can cause uncertainties in \u256c\u00a2snow of more than one order of magnitude for all aerosol sizes for typical snowfall intensities. E is the largest source of uncertainty among all the input parameters, similar to rain scavenging of at-10 mospheric aerosols (\u256c\u00a2rain) as was found in a previous study by Wang et al.(2010). However, other parameters can also cause significant uncertainties in \u256c\u00a2snow, and the uncertainties from these parameters are much larger than for \u256c\u00a2rain.

LSS upregulated the expression of TLR4 (2.30\u252c\u25920.66 vs 0.16\u252c\u25920.10, P< 0.05), as well as the mRNA of IL-1\u256c\u2593 (6.52\u252c\u25923.15 vs 1.65\u252c\u25920.45, P< 0.01), IL-6 (16.17\u252c\u25927.49 vs 6.50\u252c\u25921.84, P< 0.01) and TNF-\u256c\u2592 (9.98\u252c\u25923.77 vs 2.72\u252c\u25921.03, P< 0.01) in normal mice. However, only moderate increases in IL-6 and TNF-\u256c\u2592 mRNA were observed in TLR4 (-/-) mice. LSS induced the proliferation in cultured endothelial cells. And it was further enhanced by TLR4 overexpression (177\u252c\u259233 vs 83\u252c\u259215, P< 0.05) but attenuated by TLR4 silencing (40\u252c\u25928 vs 83\u252c\u259215, P< 0.05). CONCLUSION: TLR4 plays an important role in LSS-induced intimal hyperplasia. It is likely that LSS induces the proliferation of endothelial cells through TLR4-mediated inflammatory reaction and ultimately promotes intimal hyperplasia.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["9"]}

China will not be able to maintain its leading position if it solely relies on the traditional advanced events. That requires the potential advanced events to obtain considerable progress by learning valuable experiences from the development of traditional advanced events. China's traditional advanced events, such as table tennis, diving, ect., always get outstanding achievements and in the frontier of events' development. The main reason is that the coaches and players of these events can accurately understand the characteristics and winning rules of the events. Lack of such vision is precisely an important bottleneck in the road of potential advanced event's development. This paper uses literature review, expert investigation and case analysis to explore the characteristics, competitive ability and winning rules of China's 14 potential advanced events so as to find out the gap between China and the international advanced level. The aim is to raise the overall understanding of those events and provide intellectual support to guide the practice of sports training in the preparation for major international competition in the future.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["9"]}

{"title": "Comparison of \u256c\u255c-support vector regression and logistic equation for descriptive modeling of Lactobacillus plantarum growth\n", "abstract": " Due to the complexity and high non-linearity of bioprocess, most simple mathematical models fail to describe the exact behavior of biochemistry systems. As a novel type of learning method, support vector regression (SVR) owns the powerful capability to characterize problems via small sample, nonlinearity, high dimension and local minima. In this paper, we developed a \u256c\u255c-SVR model with genetic algorithms (GA) in the pre-estimate in Lactobacillus plantarum fermentation by comparing the predicting capability of logistic model and SVR model. 5-fold cross validation technique was applied in the SVR train to avoid over-fitting. The information of SVR parameters were obtained in the generation of 150 and the optimal parameters were C= 235.8935, \u2567\u00e2= 8.3608, \u256c\u255c= 0.7587. Correspondingly, the logistic model parameters \u256c\u255d max and x max were estimated as 0.4791 and 0.3498, respectively. The experimental results demonstrated that, SVR model excelled the logistic model based on the normalized mean square error (NMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the Pearson correlation coefficient R.

Bacterial marine natural products are important sources of novel natural products for drug discovery (Blunt et al., 2003; 2004; Faulkner, 2000; Haefner, 2003). Marine bacteria have a common mechanism to incorporate bromine or other halogens into organic compounds that can potentially lead to enhanced bioactivities. Historically, the isolation of new metabolites from marine organisms began in 1960s. In 1966, the first marine bacterial metabolite reported was the highly brominated antibiotic 2, 3, 4-tribromo-5-(l-hydroxy-2, 4-dibromophenyl) pyrrole. This compound was isolated from an Alteromonas species obtained from the surface of the Caribbean seagrass Thalassia by Burkholder and co-workers (Salas et al., 2009). In1977 the same group isolated an antibiotic-producing Pseudomonas from a tidepool in La Jolla, California. Isolation and purification of the metabolites yielded 6-bromo-indole carboxaldehyde, its debromo analog, and a mixture of 2-npentyl-and 2-n-heptylquinolinol. The most interesting of these was 2-n-pentylquinolinol, which had potent activity against Staphylococcus aureus. The unique metabolite 6-bromo-indole carboxaldehyde lacked antimicrobial properties (Fenical, 1993). The isolation of these highly brominated compounds illustrates a unique property that distinguishes marine from terrestrial bacteria. Since then, a broad spectrum of biological activities has been detected, for instance, antibiotic, antifungal, toxic, cytotoxic, neurotoxic, antimitotic, antiviral, antineoplastic, and\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["9"]}

METHODS: From July 2005 to November 2009, 113 diabetics with a sudden hearing loss within an onset of 10 days at our department were recruited. But they received no previous intervention and were assigned to treatment and control groups. Treatment group were made by microcatheter connected with an insulin bump. Microcatheter was placed in a round window niche and methylprednisolone (62.5 mg/ml) infused at a rate of 10 microl/h for 14 days. Then the microcatheter was extracted. Simultaneously vasodilation, neurotrophic, thrombolysis and insulin hypoglycemia were administered in all patients. Pure tone test was conducted at Days 10 and 20 after intervention. RESULTS: The outcome was as follows: cure (n= 6), efficacy (n= 19), effect (n= 12) and no effect (n= 11) respectively. The overall effective rate of 77.08% in the treatment group was superior to that in the control group. And there was statistical difference (P< 0.05). Pure tone average (PTA) of two groups showed no statistical difference. After 10 days, the PTA values were (66\u252c\u259221) versus (76\u252c\u259214) dB in the treatment and control groups respectively. At Day 20, the values were (50\u252c\u259216) and (59\u252c\u259212) dB respectively. The improvement of pure tone threshold at Days 10 and 20 had significant statistical difference (P< 0.05).

{"title": "A MAR-based QoS routing in long-distance wireless networks\n", "abstract": " Long-distance wireless networks are expected to provide multimedia traffic service in addition to basic Internet access, as more and more such networks have been emerged in real life. However, few work has been done on QoS provisioning in this area. 2P MAC has been successfully deployed in many long-distance networks for its efficiency. In this paper, we propose a QoS routing-Maximum Allocation with Reservation-based (MAR) QoS Dynamic Source Routing (MQDSR) on 2P MAC. MQDSR integrates bandwidth reservation and admission control in route discovery mechanism, according to MAR bandwidth constraints model. Simulation results in NS2 show that MQDSR can provide QoS support in terms of end-to-end delay and throughput for traffic with high and normal priority, while avoiding the starvation of the best effort traffic.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["9"]}
{"title": "A Function Model for Predicting the Detectable Deformation Gradient by D-InSAR\n", "abstract": " In this paper, a new function model for determining the minimum and maximum detectable deformation gradient in synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) with Envisat ASAR images is developed. The model incorporates the parameters of both interferometric coherence and multilook operator for 1, 5 and 20, rather than the interferometric coherence only in previous studies. Experimental results with real data sets show that the new model performs very well for interferograms with different look numbers and interferometric coherences. The model is thus an essential extension of the previous model constructed. Nevertheless the simplicity of the modeling processes involved, the model can serve as a preliminary tool to judge whether the InSAR technology can be used to monitor a given ground deformation. In addition, it can possibly reveal which look number will result in better monitoring of a ground\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["9"]}

The research contents included the species composition and distribution of lithofacies seashells (Mollusc). During this survey, 26 species of seashell were identified, belonging to 3 classes, 11 orders, 16 families, 22 genera. In spring, the area of high biomass was the 8th sampling site (499.11 g/m2), the area of high density was the 3rd sampling site (145.67 ind/m2), low biomass and low density located in the 1st station (31.96 g/m2, 36.92 ind/m2). In fall, high biomass and high density points were distributed in the 8th station (206.82 g/m2, 93.00 ind/m2), low biomass and low density were still in the 1st sampling site (26.92 g/m2, 38.91 ind/m2). Dominant species of shellfish were Thais clavigera Kuster, Barbatia obliquata (Wood), Septifer virgatus (Wiegmann) and Nerita albicilla Linnaeus by using combination of biomass and density as the index of dominant species. Seasonal evolution was remarkable. The biomass and density were higher in spring than these in fall. It can be obtained by analyzing air temperature, water temperature, ocean currents and environmental factors. With the water temperature increasing in spring, a large number of the shellfish move from the subtidal zone to the intertidal zone, so the density was higher in spring than in autumn owing to water temperature decreasing, predation, natural mortality and other factors. In addition, the biomass and density were the highest in 8th station, because it was protected by National Marine Nature Reserve Zone\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["9"]}

We establish an analytical method based on the Maxwell equations, to investigate electric field distributions in graded multilayered colloidal crystals. This analytical method agrees very well with an existing numerical method. It convincingly explains and confirms the fact that the peak of electric field distributions is controllable to appear in a specific layer, by tuning the angular frequency of an incident light. Also, this method offers a more convenient way to the understanding of electric field distributions in colloidal crystals.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["9"]}

SMMC-7721 cells were treated with different doses of Poly I: C for 24, 48, and 72 h, and the cell growth inhibition rate was analyzed with CCK-8 assay. The cell cycle and the apoptosis were analyzed using flow cytometry with Annexin-V and PI staining, and quantitative RT-PCR analysis were used to detect the expression of TLR3, TRIF, and IFN-beta mRNA in cells. In the cells exposed to Poly I: C at low, moderate, and high doses, the inhibitory rates was the highest in high-dose Poly I: C group, and at a given Poly I: C dose, prolonged exposure resulted in significantly increased cell growth inhibition rate (P< 0.05). Flow cytometry showed that Poly I: C induced cell apoptosis in a time-and dose-dependent manner and significantly increased the percentage of G1-phase cells as compared with that in the control group. The mRNA level of TLR3, TRIF, and IFN-beta were also increased following Poly I: C treatment in comparison with the control group. Poly I: C can induce significant growth inhibition and apoptosis of SMMC-7721 cells in a dose-and time-dependent manner possibly by causing cell cycle arrest and TLR3 signaling pathway activation that leads to IFN-beta production and cell apoptosis.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["9"]}

{"title": "Optimizing aggregate throughput in 802.11 networks through balancing spatial reuse and transmission rate\n", "abstract": " Traditional medium access control (MAC) protocols utilize temporal mechanism to do contention resolution. This paper explores an alternative approach by adapting the space occupied by a transmission to resolve contention. Each successful transmission in a wireless network needs to occupy a certain part of space in which there are no other simultaneous transmissions. The size of the space occupied depends on the transmission rate and it consequently determines the level of spatial reuse. To optimize the aggregate network throughput needs to balance the transmission rate and the level of spatial reuse. This paper firstly derives the optimal transmission rate by analyzing the relationship between the transmission rate and the occupied space size, then a distributed algorithm is proposed to achieve the optimal spatial allocation approximately through tuning the carrier sense threshold and the transmission rate\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["9"]}

{"title": "Enhance the heating rate of the PECS process by inserting a conducting body into BN powder compact\n", "abstract": " Pulsed electric current sintering (PECS), or the so-called spark plasma sintering (SPS), is a novel sintering process with the characteristic of short firing cycle. The process can be applied to densify metallic or ceramic bodies within a matter of minutes instead of several hours. The process is similar to the conventional hot pressing in the way that the powder compact is heated with the application of an external load. Nevertheless, instead of using an external heating source, a pulsed electric current is passed directly through the electrically conducting, such as graphite, mold.Tokita et al. claimed that the pulsed current generates spark discharge and even plasma between conducting particles [1]. They suggested that the generation of spark discharge or plasma removes the adsorbed species from the surfaces of particles during the initial stage of PECS. The grain boundary diffusion is thus enhanced in the later stage of the process. However, Wang et al.[2] claimed that the pulsed electric current sintering on alumina is similar to that of hot-pressing. The pulsed electric current heated the graphite mold first by Jouel heat, then the heat transferred inside into the powder compact. As the heating rate is fast, a temperature gradient exists. A dense outer region is thus observed within an alumina specimen after PECS [2]. Munir et al. suggested that the presence of pulsed electric field contributes to the fast densification [3]. Shen et al. suggested that the discharge can still take place between the non-conducting particles [4]. Many attempts have been made to explore the sintering mechanism of PECS.

Long range ultrasonic guided waves have intrigued investigators for years because of an ability to test structures over a long distance from a single sensor position. Guided waves have much more complex wave behavior than bulk waves in infinite media. The Lamb type guided waves in hollow cylinders spread out and wrap around the circumference when propagating in an axial direction. Focusing at a certain point in a hollow cylinder is implemented by utilizing the non-axisymmetric energy distributions of flexural wave modes. There are two types of focusing in pipes natural focusing and phased array focusing. When a partially loaded excitation is used to generate guided waves in cylindrical shells, the excited flexural modes lead to ultrasonic energy naturally focused at certain positions. This special natural focusing phenomenon can be used to improve guided wave inspection results in hollow cylinders. By applying input time delays and amplitudes for a multi-channel ultrasonic signal generation system, one can focus the guided waves at a pre-selected position. The input parameters of the ultrasonic phased array are calculated by implementing a deconvolution computations of the displacement angular profiles excited by one excitation channel. Theoretical and experitmental results show the power of focusing in the long range ultrasonic guided wave inspection of pipe. Excellent results and superb inspection potential are shown.Descriptors:", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["9"]}

In this approach, a new way to estimate the asynchronous distortion parameters by using the one or two characteristics of the host image is proposed to make the re-synchronization of watermarking technique.

CML28 can be detected 3 months after HSCT in 1 patient with CML-CP and 3 patients with CML-AP or BC. 2 of them with low level (< 2 x 10 (-2)) survived without relapse, the other 2 case with high level (> 2 x 10 (-2)) relapsed within one year, 1 case died and 1 case received the second time HSCT, CML28 level decreased rapidly after HSCT, but still higher than 2 x 10 (-2) and relapse has taken place. The conclusions was made that CML28 mRNA level is obviously correlated with the development of leukemia. Serial quantification of CML28 mRNA levels are necessary for HSCT recipients, and more informative\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["9"]}

The results showed that in the lineage-related antibodies of acute myelocytic leukemia (AML), the sensitivity of CD13 and CD33 was higher (95.5% and 91.2%, respectively), the specificity of them was deficient (72.5% and 62.2%, respectively); the sensitivity of MPO was low (69.1%), but the specificity was high (100%); the sensitivity and specificity of CD117 were high (88.2% and 100%, respectively); the sensitivity of CD14 and CD15 was low (18.4% and 27.2%, respectively); the specificity of CD14 with monocytes was high. As the lineage-related antibodies of B-lineage ALL were concerned, CD19 showed high sensitivity and low specificity (100% vs 83.4%); the sensitivity and specificity of CD79a (96.4% vs 100%) and CD22 (100% vs 100%) were high; the sensitivity and specificity of CD10 (53.6% vs 82.5%) and CD20 (70.4% vs 87.5%) were low. In T-lineage ALL, the specificity of CD3 was high (97.5%), but the sensitivity was below the mark (80.0%); the sensitivity of CD7 was high (100%), but the specificity was low (77.9%); while the sensitivity and specificity of CD5, CD2 and CD1a were all deficient. In conclusion, the sensitivity and specificity analysis of the lineage-related antibodies in acute leukemia immunophenotyping are coincident with St Jude immunophenotyping project.

By comparing with the cerebral cortical activation during clenching with and without soft occlusal pad we try to detect the central mechanism of the rule of the occlusal pad. METHODS: Ten healthy subjects were selected and scanned by Elscint/GE 2.0 Tesla MR system. Block design was used and the movement pattern was maximum voluntary clenching with soft occlusal pad. The fMRI data were analyzed by SPM99 software and group map analysis was done. RESULTS: The activation areas were found in bilateral or unilateral motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex, premotor cortex, insula, frontal operculum, basal ganglia (putamen), parietal cortex and cingulate. Group map analysis showed activation in bilateral motor cortex, right somatosensory cortex, bilateral basal ganglia, and bilateral insula. The activation of left motor cortex was significantly higher than right side. Compared with cortical activation without occlusal pad, the motor and somatosensory cortex changed a lot. CONCLUSION: The changes of the activation of motor and somatosensory cortex during clenching after wearing the soft occlusal pad might be the central mechanism of the rule of the occlusal pad.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["9"]}

Hi-Nicalon SiC fibres were annealed at 1400, 1600 and 1800 C for 10 h in an argon flow. Their microstructure was characterised by HRTEM and XRD, and the tensile strength was determined by a monofilament tensile testing machine. The results indicate that with increase of the annealing temperature, the grain size of beta-SiC increases, stacking faults are gradually formed and organisation of the free carbon phase increases. In addition, the tensile strength decreases with increase of annealing temperature. The mean strength of the fibres reduces to 1.0 GPa after annealing at 1800 C for 10 h. 9 refs.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["9"]}

{"title": "Characterization of potato plants overexpressing plastidic transporters involved in starch metabolism\n", "abstract": " Kurzfassung in English Potato is one of the most important crops in the world. Starch is the most important carbohydrate used for food and feed purposes and represents the major resource for our diet. Potato tubers represent typical starch-storing storage sinks that accumulate high levels of starch in the amyloplasts. For starch synthesis in potato tubers, amyloplasts depend on the import of carbon and energy. Carbon enters the amyloplasts in form of glucose-6-phosphate via the GPT, and energy is imported as ATP via the NTT. The impact of increasing Glc6P and ATP import into amyloplasts of potato tubers on starch synthesis as well as tuber yield was analyzed. Overexpressing GPT or NTT solely under the control of either CaMV 35S promoter or patatin promoter B33 (EW, BG and BA plants) did not lead to an increase of starch of tubers as well as yield. However, GPT overexpression under control of the CaMV 35S promoter (EW plants) resulted in an increase of leaf starch content. Overexpression of the GPT under control of the CaMV 35S promoter or of the patatin promoter B33 in NTT overexpressor (JT62) plants also did not show increased tuber starch and yield. However, starch amount in tubers and tuber yield were increased when GPT and NTT were overexpressed together under control of the patatin promoter B33. Heterologously synthesized transporter proteins from pea and Arabidopsis were functionally integrated into the plastid envelope of potato tubers. These results suggest that GPT and NTT co-limit starch synthesis in potato tubers.

The 3-year survival rate was 53.85% in patients with micrometastases of lymph nodes and 83. 63% in patients without micrometastases, it showed the significant difference (x2= 7. 24, P0. 05) between them. The univariate analysis and multivariate analysis indicated that T stage tumor and micrometastases were independent progrostic factors. Conclusion Immunohistochemical staining using cytokeratin 19 and mucinl monoclonal antibody is more sensitive than routine histological method for detecting micrometastasis in lymph nodes. The clinical stage based on the micrometastasis is more accurate than that based on routine pathological method. Nodal micrometastasis can be immunohistochemically diagnosed by the detection of CK-19 and MUC1 in lymph nodes of patients with pN0 e-sophageal carcinoma. Lymph node micrometastases may play an important role in the prognosis of esophageal carcinoma.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["9"]}

X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) analysis the value states of Ag and Cu in the implanted composite sample, the results show that Ag and Cu exist in the form of metal state. The optical absorption spectra indicates there is only a single surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak at 442 nm before annealing, which shows the Ag-Cu binary alloy nanoclusters have been formed. After annealing for 1 hour at different temperature from 300\u0393\u00e4\u00e2 to 800\u0393\u00e4\u00e2 with intervals of 100\u0393\u00e4\u00e2, the SPR peaks show a blue shift and two peaks appear when the annealing temperature reaches 500\u0393\u00e4\u00e2 which attributes to the decomposion of alloy nanoclusters and formation of Ag and Cu nanoclusters. Applying the free electron model of metal particles, we calculate average sizes of nanoparticles in the different annealing temperatures, the results show that the sizes of nanoparticles increase gradually with increasing temperature. When the temperature is higher than 600\u0393\u00e4\u00e2 for Cu and 700\u0393\u00e4\u00e2 for Ag, the size becomes smaller, because at high temperatures Ag and Cu migrates to the sample surface and disappears from the surface.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["9"]}

The results suggested that fretting induced remarkable corrosion, and the combination of fretting and crevice-like condition made the material suffer severe corrosion damage. The oxidation of the fretting corrosion product resulted in alkaline deposit on the surface outside of the fretted center, which would play an important role in the fretting process. Debris could play some apparent role on the damage when fretting carried on under high anodic polarization condition. The concentration of debris on the edge of fretting area might accelerate the occurrence of pitting, which made great contribution to the damage and the expansion of fretting scars.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["9"]}
