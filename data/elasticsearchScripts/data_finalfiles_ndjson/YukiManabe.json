{"title": "Where does this code come from and where does it go?\u2014Integrated code history tracker for open source systems\n", "abstract": " When we reuse a code fragment in an open source system, it is very important to know the history of the code, such as the code origin and evolution. In this paper, we propose an integrated approach to code history tracking for open source repositories. This approach takes a query code fragment as its input, and returns the code fragments containing the code clones with the query code. It utilizes publicly available code search engines as external resources. Based on this model, we have designed and implemented a prototype system named Ichi Tracker. Using Ichi Tracker, we have conducted three case studies. These case studies show the ancestors and descendents of the code, and we can recognize their evolution history.", "num_citations": "52\n", "authors": ["2200"]}

{"title": "Can we detect bug report duplication with unfinished bug reports?\n", "abstract": " It is useful if a bug tracking system can detect bug report duplication with unfinished bug reports. To investigate the feasibility, we study relations between accuracy of duplicate bug report detection using features extracted from textual information in bug reports and the number of words in bug reports in this paper. The results show that increasing the number of words to be used in duplicate detection over a certain number does not affect the accuracy very much. The results also indicate that we had better use about 100 and 80 words in Eclipse and OpenOffice, respectively, in the detection because we may have many wrong candidates of duplication if we use words of more than the numbers. We thus think that detecting bug duplication in writing a new bug report has potential of giving duplicate bug report candidates.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["2200"]}
{"title": "Econo-ESA reduction scheme and the impact of its index matrix Density\n", "abstract": " Econo-ESA is an economic scheme of the explicit semantic analysis (ESA). The scheme properly decreases the ESA index matrix dimensions to achieve faster process with similar results. This paper discusses index matrix dimensional reduction schemes of econo-ESA. We did experiments with several schemes: random selection, k-means clustering, norm-based clustering, densest, and sparsest schemes. Each resulted matrix had different element values and density. Our experimental results showed that the random selection scheme, which had the nearest density to the original index matrix, gave the best results. We thus conclude that the index matrix density is an additional feature which has to be considered in econo-ESA.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["2200"]}

Despite the usefulness of fragmentation in improving transmission reliability in poor quality wireless channels, it comes with overhead costs that lead to its energy inefficiency.

{"title": "Clustering OSS License Statements toward Automatic Generation of License Rules\n", "abstract": " Reusing open source software (OSS) components for own software products has become common in the modarn software development. Automated license identification tools has been proposed to help developers identify OSS licenses, since a large number of licenses sometimes must be checked to be reused. Of the existing tools, Ninka can most correctly identify licenses of each source file by using regular expressions. In case Ninka does not have license identification rules for unknown licenses, Ninka reports they are \"unknown licenses\" which must be checked by developers manually. Since completely-new or derived OSS licenses appear nearly every year, a license identification tool should be appropriately maintained by adding regular expressions corresponding to the new licenses. The final goal of our study is to construct a method to automatically create candidates of regular expressions to be added to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["2200"]}
{"title": "Energy-efficient fragmentation scheme for IEEE 802.11 DCF: Delay and fairness considerations\n", "abstract": " The interplay between the internet of things, big data, cloud computing and mobility has brought up a number of challenges. One of them is the reliance of handheld wireless communication devices, eg smartphones, on limited battery power. In this paper we contribute to efforts that address this challenge. We investigate the energy efficiency of MAC layer fragmentation scheme. Despite the usefulness of fragmentation in improving transmission reliability in poor quality wireless channels, it comes with overhead costs that lead to its energy inefficiency. When a fragment transmission fails (due to collisions or channel induced errors), extra contentions are executed and hence extra overheads are incurred. We propose a novel fragmentation scheme called backoff-free fragment retransmission (BFFR). BFFR addresses classical fragmentation overheads. It aims at improving classical fragmentation energy efficiency\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["2200"]}
{"title": "Reducing collisions of a TCP stream on multi-hop wireless networks\n", "abstract": " On the multi-hop wireless networks such as mobile ad hoc networks and mesh networks, each packet is forwarded by intermediate nodes, and the packet is transmitted multiple times. In contrast to the wired networks, any transmissions by different nodes for a TCP stream may collide with each other, even if these nodes sense carrier correctly. In this poster, we propose a method to reduce the number of collisions of a TCP stream on multi-hop wireless networks. The method is designed for IEEE 802.11 MAC with help of TCP protocol stack, and it consists of two parts: packet pacing by a TCP stream source and eager forwarding by intermediate nodes. Referring the round trip time and the window size of the TCP stream, the MAC layer of the TCP stream source postpones a transmission of a TCP segment, until the previous TCP segment would be forwarded to several hops away.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2200"]}
