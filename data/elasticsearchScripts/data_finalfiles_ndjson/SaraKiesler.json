Based on ideas about how social context cues within a communication setting affect information exchange, it argues that electronic mail does not simply speed up the exchange of information but leads to the exchange of new information as well. In a field study in a Fortune 500 company, we used questionnaire data and actual messages to examine electronic mail communication at all levels of the organization. Based on hypotheses from research on social communication, we explored effects of electronic communication related to self-absorption, status equalization, and uninhibited behavior. Consistent with experimental studies, we found that decreasing social context cues has substantial deregulating effects on communication.

Yet a large body of evidence suggests that close proximity is beneficial to relationships and group interaction. We examine these benefits through the lens of research on the mere presence of others, face-to-face communication, shared social settings, and frequency of spontaneous communication. Technological and organizational remedies for the absence of these factors in distributed work groups are popular but often problematic. We propose that communication technology is more likely to be effective when groups are cohesive than when they are not and that structured management (as well as technology) is likely to be needed in groups lacking cohesion.\" Collaboration is a body contact sport.\" The researcher who said this during an interview believes, as many others do, that physical proximity has a tremendous impact on the ability to work together. There is considerable support for this belief in the academic community as well. Research harking back fifty years has demonstrated that close proximity among people is associated with numerous emotional, cognitive, and behavioral changes that affect the work process for the better. In this chapter, we describe these findings, discuss reasons that proximity has been thought very good for group functioning, and consider how well people adapt to working apart.

{"title": "Distributed work\n", "abstract": " Multidisciplinary research on dynamics, problems, and potential of distributed work. Technological advances and changes in the global economy are increasing the geographic distribution of work in industries as diverse as banking, wine production, and clothing design. Many workers communicate regularly with distant coworkers; some monitor and manipulate tools and objects at a distance. Work teams are spread across different cities or countries. Joint ventures and multiorganizational projects entail work in many locations. Two famous examples--the Hudson Bay Company's seventeenth-century fur trading empire and the electronic community that created the original Linux computer operating system--suggest that distributed work arrangements can be flexible, innovative, and highly successful. At the same time, distributed work complicates workers' professional and personal lives. Distributed work alters how people communicate and how they organize themselves and their work, and it changes the nature of employee-employer relationships. This book takes a multidisciplinary approach to the study of distributed work groups and organizations, the challenges inherent in distributed work, and ways to make distributed work more effective. Specific topics include division of labor, incentives, managing group members, facilitating interaction among distant workers, and monitoring performance. The final chapters focus on distributed work in one domain, collaborative scientific research.

Motivated by the observation that important visual concepts tend to appear repeatedly across videos of the same topic, we propose to summarize a video by finding shots that co-occur most frequently across videos collected using a topic keyword. The main technical challenge is dealing with the sparsity of co-occurring patterns, out of hundreds to possibly thousands of irrelevant shots in videos being considered. To deal with this challenge, we developed a Maximal Biclique Finding (MBF) algorithm that is optimized to find sparsely co-occurring patterns, discarding less co-occurring patterns even if they are dominant in one video. Our algorithm is parallelizable with closed-form updates, thus can easily scale up to handle a large number of videos simultaneously. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on motion capture and self-compiled YouTube datasets.

One feature of these new organizations is the distributed work group. Teams whose members are distributed in time or space have tremendous potential, yet they also face great challenges. In this chapter, we focus on conflict as one of the keys to effective group process and performance in distributed teams. We define the special hurdles these teams face in managing conflict, specifically focusing on creating a common social identity and managing compositional diversity. We then examine the antecedents to productive conflict management, including the enactment of swift trust, the development of a shared reality and strong team culture, and the belief in team efficacy derived from a highly developed transactive memory system and a strong sense of psychological safety. We end with a consideration of the role of leadership in distributed team dynamics.Conflict, and its resolution, are fundamental to group functioning. Conflict is an awareness by the parties of differences, discrepancies, incompatible wishes, or irreconcilable desires (Boulding 1963). There has been a debate in organizational research regarding whether agreement or disagreement within groups is advantageous (Eisenhardt and Zbaracki 1992). One key to unlocking this complex relationship lies in the differentiation of conflict as either relationship or task related (Crosier and Rose 1977, Guetzkow and Gyr 1954, Jehn 1995, Pinkley 1990, Wall and Nolan 1986).

Weak group identification may be especially problematic in larger groups, which, in contrast with smaller groups, require more attention to motivating members and coordinating their tasks. We hypothesized that as groups increase in size, productivity would decrease with greater heterogeneity. We studied the longitudinal productivity of 549 research groups varying in disciplinary heterogeneity, institutional heterogeneity, and size. We examined their publication and citation productivity before their projects started and 5 to 9 years later. Larger groups were more productive than smaller groups, but their marginal productivity declined as their heterogeneity increased, either because their members belonged to more disciplines or to more institutions. These results provide evidence that group heterogeneity moderates\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "119\n", "authors": ["1158"]}
{"title": "The mystery of RSI.\n", "abstract": " A computer-related health epidemic known as repetitive strain injury (RSI) is rampant in Australia and threatens to overwhelm the workers' compensation system. RSI is a label given to a variety of painful, debilitating conditions believed to be caused by repetitive movements of the hands or arms. In Australia, the latest wave of RSI complaints is centered among female office workers who develop symptoms as a result of extensive typing at computer keyboards. In an analysis of this epidemic, we examine the nature of RSI and its known correlates with individual health and personality, ergonomics of computing, and work context. Based on available evidence, we speculate as to the reasons for the emergence of RSI in Australia. We argue that RSI is an extreme illustration of how the social context of work and technological change defines and influences the nature of health problems.(PsycINFO Database Record (c\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "116\n", "authors": ["1158"]}

Data were drawn from the contents and access records of two computer-based employee message archives: the peer archive, which contained questions and answers exchanged over a company-wide electronic mailing list by ordinary employees and the expert archive, which contained questions from employees and answers from designated experts. We predicted that archive accesses by employees would increase with their geographic distance from engineering headquarters and that accesses would increase to the extent that the archive contained know-how information. Content analysis demonstrated that the peer exchanges were more informal and more personal, and were more likely to contain specific references to the company's products, tools, and customers, all indicators of know-how information. Analyses of use showed that workers accessed the peer archive more than they did the expert archive; this difference increased with greater geographic distance from engineering headquarters.

Both objectives, however, involve the maintenance or improvement of human health, the basic difference being that extension of the normal period of health is usually involved in efforts to reduce the more global effects of the aging process. More specifically, life-span extension research is aimed toward a more uniform extension or maintenance of good health and vigor, whereas other approaches not normally regarded as life-span extension research are aimed toward the cure or prevention of specific, more localized types of diseases or dysfunctions.The aim of life-span extension research is not simply to enable persons to live older longer but to learn how general good health can be maintained for a longer-than-normal period of time. An individual may not necessarily have a longer-than-normal life-span as a consequence of having a more uniform and healthy life, but it is generally believed that a longer life-span would frequently be the outcome of a prolonged period", "num_citations": "39\n", "authors": ["1158"]}

We do not discuss individual-organizational nor group-organizational linkages, although many of the points we make pertain to those linkages as well.Software development is a kind of technical work found in many organizations: the technical team project. Certain technical tasks transcend the ongoing functions of departments or the capabilities of individuals, and thus organizations create a project group or team to do the work. A software development project group can have two to several hundred members. Membership is typically diverse; the work may require the participation of programmers, software engineers, applications experts, researchers, requirements analysts, software testers, documentation writers, project managers, customer support personnel, and perhaps others. Project members may be drawn from different locations and different departments and may even work on the project in different places.

Collaborative tie strength in distributed interdisciplinary projects\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we illustrate why prior experience working together is critical for collaborations that cross geographic and disciplinary boundaries. In the organizational literature, strong ties are characterized by greater frequency of communication and emotional closeness compared with weak ties. For scientists and engineers on research projects, we introduce the concept of'collaborative tie strength'to emphasize the level of joint intellectual effort. In the context of science and engineering, collaborative strong ties work directly together on a research project and publish together, whereas collaborative weak ties are on a research project together, but do not work directly together or publish together. Using data from 3911 pairs of senior personnel working on 475 research projects funded through the National Science Foundation (NSF), our analyses suggest that prior experience matters to subsequent collaboration, not only because it is a strong predictor of collaborative tie strength, but also because it moderates the relationship between geographic and disciplinary boundaries and collaborative tie strength. That is, the negative impact of geographic and disciplinary boundaries on collaborative tie strength is reduced when prior experience is greater. We discuss implications for e-social science, which often relies on researchers from different universities and disciplines working together.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["1158"]}

{"title": "Predicting human interruptibility with sensors: A Wizard of Oz feasibility study\n", "abstract": " A person seeking another person\u2019s attention is normally able to quickly assess how interruptible the other person currently is. Such assessments allow behavior that we consider natural, socially appropriate, or simply polite. This is in sharp contrast to current computer and communication systems, which are largely unaware of the social situations surrounding their usage and the impact that their actions have on these situations. If systems could model human interruptibility, they could use this information to negotiate interruptions at appropriate times, thus improving human computer interaction. This paper presents a series of studies that quantitatively demonstrate that simple sensors can support the construction of models that estimate human interruptibility as well as people. These models can be constructed without using complex sensors, such as vision-based techniques, and their use in everyday office environments is therefore both practical and affordable. Although currently based on a demographically limited sample, our results indicate a substantial opportunity for future research to validate these results over larger groups of office workers. Our results also motivate the development of systems that use these models to negotiate interruptions at socially appropriate times.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1158"]}

Regrettably, humans are frequently not attuned to these specifics, and inappropriate accommodation is often perceived as patronizing.

These firms often organize around project teams that advise and work under contract for clients. A key problem for management is to deploy expertise in project teams so as to meet the expertise requirements of projects and clients. Because expertise may be geographically distributed across multiple sites, many of these firms create virtual or distributed teams. Doing so gives these firms access to a larger pool of knowledge resources than would be available at one site and helps leverage expertise across the organization. However, geographically distributed collaboration in teams incurs coordination and other costs that local work does not. Is a distributed team worth these costs? We studied a professional service firm with distributed and collocated project teams. In this firm, domain expertise tended to be concentrated within geographic sites, whereas methodological expertise was distributed across the firm. We examined whether a better match of domain and methodological expertise to the needs of projects resulted in more profitable projects, and whether distributed teams matched these two types of expertise to the requirements of projects as well as or better than did collocated teams. We found that most projects were collocated, with members drawn from one site who had domain expertise that matched project requirements as well as when members were drawn from other sites. The profits of projects were unrelated to the match of domain expertise with project requirements.

We studied moves in 548 interdisciplinary research projects with 2691 researchers (PIs). Moves, and thus disruptions, were not rare, especially in large distributed projects. Overall, one-third of all projects experienced at least one member relocating but most moves reflected churn across high-ranking institutions. When collaborators moved, the project was disrupted. Our data suggest that moves exemplify normal disruptions. A design challenge is to help projects adapt to disruption.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1158"]}

We found that local sites developed specializations around frequently-used domain expertise, and that most projects were local.

Explanations of cooperation following discussion in dilemmas draw on theories of human social identity and social contract. We proposed that talking with a computer partner triggers social identity feelings and commitment norms people typically follow in decisions. Subjects played a prisoner's dilemma game over 6 trials with a confederate or a computer partner who always cooperated on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th trials. We varied discussion and inducements to make promises across trials. On trial 1, subjects conversed with the partner, and most proposed cooperation. Subjects kept their promises as much with the text-only computer as with a person; they kept their promises less with a human-like, but imperfectly human, computer, and they gave lower social evaluation ratings to this computer. Cooperation dropped precipitously in all conditions on trial 3, when the partner avoided discussion. We interpret competition with the human-like computer to be consistent with a social identity explanation of ingroup rejection, We interpret the strong impact of commitment to be consistent with a social contract explanation of cooperation following discussion.

The paradox is resolved if we view creativity as one facet of organizational change, and organizational change as arising from mundane processes (March 1981). During the last several years, my colleagues and I have been studying one aspect of organizational change-the introduction of new computer technologies into organizations. We have studied how managers introduce technology and the effects of technology on the organization. In this chapter I discuss only one aspect of our work: the effects of computers and computer networks on organizational communication. Managers spend the majority of their time communicating: talking on the telephone, attending meetings, reviewing and writing reports, visiting and being visited. Because managers stand at the intersection of the organization and the environment, and of different subunits and jobs, communication is an important part of their role. Although the incentive structure, slack resources, and other noncommunication factors determine in large part whether managers act creatively, a communication environment that affords free exchange of data, ideas, and feelings is one which creative management is made more possible.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1158"]}

Its purpose was \u2018\u2018to span the scientific and engineering communities... to generate, model, and represent more complex and cross-disciplinary scientific data from new sources and at enormously varying scales.\u2019\u2019The program was highly competitive. It supported only 40 awards out of 697 proposals in 1998, and 31 awards out of 554 preproposals and 163 full proposals in 1999. These projects were supported at US $1.5 million each over three years. We report the analyses of 62 of the 71 projects awarded this funding.In fall 2001, the NSF asked us to organize a workshop of research grantees to assess what had happened in the KDI research projects. The NSF invited the principal investigator (PI) and one co-PI from each of the 71 KDI projects to the workshop. Researchers from 52 research projects attended the workshop, held in late April 2002. At this workshop we asked researchers, organized into small randomly assigned groups, to discuss with one another how their research projects were organized and managed, the kinds of outcomes they generated, and the ways in which their research experience could inform future program evaluation. During three mornings of group discussion, note takers as well as participants compiled lists of experiences, outcomes, and suggestions. We asked the participants to send us copies of reports they had written and links to their Web sites.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1158"]}
