{"title": "An approximate L 1-difference algorithm for massive data streams\n", "abstract": " Massive data sets are increasingly important in a wide range of applications, including observational sciences, product marketing, and the monitoring and operations of large systems. In network operations, raw data typically arrive in streams, and decisions must be made by algorithms that make one pass over each stream, throw much of the raw data away, and produce \"synopses\" or \"sketches\" for further processing. Moreover, network-generated massive data sets are often distributed: Several different, physically separated network elements may receive or generate data streams that, together, comprise one logical data set; to be of use in operations, the streams must be analyzed locally and their synopses sent to a central operations facility. The enormous scale, distributed nature, and one-pass processing requirement on the data sets of interest must be addressed with new algorithmic techniques.We present one\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "330\n", "authors": ["1801"]}

We then show that the spot-checking model can be applied to problems in a wide range of areas, including problems regarding graphs, sets, and algebra. In particular, we present spot-checkers for sorting, convex hull, element distinctness, set containment, set equality, total orders, and correctness of group and field operations.

These separations are tightly matched by our positive results where a restricted (strong) version of one primitive does imply the other primitive. We also show separations between oblivious transfer and key agreement. Finally, we conclude that neither oblivious transfer nor trapdoor predicates imply trapdoor permutations.

Actors are widely used in modeling real-time and distributed systems. Floating-Time Transition System (FTTS) is proposed as an alternative semantics for timed actors, and schedulability and deadlock-freedom analysis techniques have been developed for it.

Our solution uses a combination of an open-loop controller and a tracking controller, thereby reducing the problem to smaller tractable problems. We show that, once a tracking controller is fixed, the reachable states from an initial neighborhood, subject to any disturbance, can be over-approximated by a sequence of ellipsoids, with sizes that are independent of the open-loop controller. Hence, the open-loop controller can be synthesized independently to meet the reach-avoid specification for an initial neighborhood. Exploiting several techniques for tightening the over-approximations, we reduce the open-loop controller synthesis problem to satisfiability over quantifier-free linear real arithmetic.

Propositional tree automata recognize regular equational tree languages. However, unlike regular equational tree automata, the class of propositional tree automata is closed under Boolean operations. This extra expressiveness does not affect the decidability of the membership problem.

The main difference, between our approach and previous proposals for CEGAR for hybrid automata, is that we consider the abstractions to be hybrid automata as well. We present a counterexample guided abstraction refinement method for systems modelled as initialized rectangular hybrid automata along the lines of the general framework and show the completeness of the method. The advantages of our approach are illustrated by examples where it performs better than existing methods. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by performing several experiments using a prototype tool that implements our CEGAR algorithm.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1801"]}
{"title": "Pose-invariant face recognition using deformation analysis\n", "abstract": " Over the last decade or so, face recognition has become a popular area of research in computer vision and one of the most successful applications of image analysis and understanding. In addition, recognition of faces under varied poses has been a challenging area of research due to the complexity of pose dispersion in feature space. This paper presents a novel and robust pose-invariant face recognition method. In this approach, first, the facial region is detected using the TSL color model. The direction of face or pose is estimated using facial features and the estimated pose vector is decomposed into X-Y-Z axes. Second, the input face is mapped by a deformable template using these vectors and the 3D CANDIDE face model. Finally, the mapped face is transformed to the frontal face which appropriates for face recognition by the estimated pose vector.

{"title": "Conformance testing in the presence of multiple faults.\n", "abstract": " Conformance testing is the problem of determining if a black-box implementation I is equivalent to a specification S, where both are modeled as finite state Mealy machines. The problem involves constructing a checking sequence based on the specification, which is a sequence of inputs that detects all faulty machines. Traditionally, conformance testing algorithms have assumed that the number of states in the implementation does not exceed that in the specification. This is because it is known that, in the absence of this assumption, the length of the checking sequence needs to be at least exponential in the number of extra states in the implementation [41]. However, this has limited the applicability of these techniques in practice where the implementation typically has many more states than the specification. In this paper we relax the constraints on the size of the implementation and investigate the existence of polynomial length checking sequences for implementations with extra states, under the promise that they either have multiple faults or no faults at all. We present randomized algorithms to construct checking sequences that catch faulty implementations with at most\u2206 extra states, having at least r faults (where\u2206 and r are parameters to the algorithm), and pass all correct implementations. We demonstrate the near optimality of our algorithms by presenting lower bounds for this problem. One of the main technical lemmas used in our proof is an estimate of the probability that a random walk on directed graphs will reach a large target set. We believe that this lemma will be of independent interest in the context of verifying safety properties.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1801"]}
{"title": "Bounded model checking of network protocols in network simulators by exploiting protocol-specific heuristics\n", "abstract": " Network simulators perform well in evaluating the performance of network protocols, but lack the capability of verifying their correctness. In order to address this lacuna, we have extended the J- Sim network simulator with a model checking capability to explore the state space of a network protocol to find either an execution where a safety invariant is violated or an exceution where the satisfaction of an eventuality property is witnessed. In this paper, we demonstrate the usefulness of this integrated tool for verification and performance evaluation, by analyzing two widely used and important network protocols: Ad-Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol and directed diffucion protocol. Our analysis discovered a previously unknown bug in the J-Sim implementation of AODV, and a design flaw in directed diffusion, illustrating that our tool can uncover both bugs in the implementation and design of a protocol. To enable the analysis of these fairly complex protocols, we needed to develop search heuristics to explore the state space. We report our preliminary findings on discovering good search heuristics to analyze routing protocols.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1801"]}
{"title": "The processing, storage, and use of attribute information: an investigation of the numerical and verbal modes\n", "abstract": " The focus of this dissertation is on the processing, storage, and utilization of magnitudes along attributes. In particular, two modes of information which represent distinct ways of conveying magnitude information are studied here, namely numerical and verbal information. Several perspectives on issues relating to magnitude information and numerical versus verbal information are reviewed in the dissertation. Past research from several disciplines including psychology, marketing, and the decision sciences suggests a lack of understanding of these issues.A model of storage of attribute magnitudes is proposed here which suggests that attribute information is primarily stored in memory in a relatively coarse-grained and evaluative form. This primary store is argued to consist of well integrated brand information. Further, a secondary store of magnitudes is proposed for the storage of relatively fine-grained information as well as the storage of information as a function of processing goals. The secondary store is argued to consist of information in a relatively isolated form. The proposed model is used to infer the processing and storage of external information in numerical and verbal forms under different task conditions.

{"title": "Relating syntactic and semantic perturbations of hybrid automata\n", "abstract": " We investigate how the semantics of a hybrid automaton deviates with respect to syntactic perturbations on the hybrid automaton. We consider syntactic perturbations of a hybrid automaton, wherein the syntactic representations of its elements, namely, initial sets, invariants, guards, and flows, in some logic are perturbed. Our main result establishes a continuity like property that states that small perturbations in the syntax lead to small perturbations in the semantics. More precisely, we show that for every real number epsilon> 0 and natural number k, there is a real number delta> 0 such that H^ delta, the delta syntactic perturbation of a hybrid automaton H, is epsilon-simulation equivalent to H up to k transition steps. As a byproduct, we obtain a proof that a bounded safety verification tool such as dReach will eventually prove the safety of a safe hybrid automaton design (when only non-strict inequalities are used in all constraints) if dReach iteratively reduces the syntactic parameter delta that is used in checking approximate satisfiability. This has an immediate application in counter-example validation in a CEGAR framework, namely, when a counter-example is spurious, then we have a complete procedure for deducing the same.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1801"]}
{"title": "Reachability under contextual locking\n", "abstract": " The pairwise reachability problem for a multi-threaded program asks, given control locations in two threads, whether they can be simultaneously reached in an execution of the program. The problem is important for static analysis and is used to detect statements that are concurrently enabled. This problem is in general undecidable even when data is abstracted and when the threads (with recursion) synchronize only using a finite set of locks. Popular programming paradigms that limit the lock usage patterns have been identified under which the pairwise reachability problem becomes decidable. In this paper, we consider a new natural programming paradigm, called contextual locking, which ties the lock usage to calling patterns in each thread: we assume that locks are released in the same context that they were acquired and that every lock acquired by a thread in a procedure call is released before the procedure returns. Our main result is that the pairwise reachability problem is polynomial-time decidable for this new programming paradigm as well. The problem becomes undecidable if the locks are reentrant; reentrant locking is a \\emph{recursive locking} mechanism which allows a thread in a multi-threaded program to acquire the reentrant lock multiple times.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1801"]}

In this paper we consider the problem of constructing test suites for boolean programs (or more precisely modular visibly pushdown automata) that are guaranteed to catch all erroneous implementations that have at least R faults, and pass all correct implementations; if the incorrect implementation has fewer than R faults then the test suite may or may not detect it. We present a randomized algorithm for the construction of such test suites, and prove the near optimality of our test suites by proving lower bounds on the size of test suites.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1801"]}

{"title": "Verification Of Simulation Models Of Network Protocols Using State Space Exploration\n", "abstract": " Verifiation and Validation (V&V) is a critically important phase in the development life cycle of a simulation model. In the context of network simulation, traditional network simulators perform well in using a simulation model for evaluating/predicting the performance of a network protocol but lack the capability of verifying the \"correctness\" of the simulation model being used. To address this problem, we have extended J-Sim - an open-source component-based network simulator written entirely in Java - with a state space exploration (SSE) capability that explores the (entire) state space created by a network simulation model in order to find an execution (if any) that violates an assertion; i.e., a property that must always hold true in all states.  In this thesis, we present the design and implementation of the state space exploration framework in J-Sim. Furthermore, we demonstrate its usefulness and effectiveness in verifying complicated simulation models. Specifically, we verify the simulation models of two widely used and fairly complex routing and data dissemination protocols: the Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol for wireless ad-hoc networks and the directed diffusion data dissemination protocol for wireless sensor networks. Moreover, we verify the simulation model of a reliable unicast protocol: the Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) protocol.  To enable the verification of these fairly complex network simulation models, we make use of protocol-specific properties along two orthogonal dimensions: state similarity and state ranking.

Three decades of research has spawned a number of plausible techniques for the selection of models, namely, Akaike's Finite Prediction Error (FPE) and Information Criterion (AIC), Schwartz's criterion (SCH), Generalized Cross Validation (GCV), Wallace's Minimum Message Length (MML), Minimum Description Length (MDL), and Vapnik's Structural Risk Minimization (SRM).

Second, to increase the user's understanding about route (optimal path showing start and destination) and its surroundings, we propose a new method which converts a complex route and its surroundings into a simplified sketch map. A process is also suggested to correct distortion which occurs during the sketch map generation process.
