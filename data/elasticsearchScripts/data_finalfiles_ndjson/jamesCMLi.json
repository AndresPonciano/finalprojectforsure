The B box caused increased secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-12, IL-6, IL-1\u03b1, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, and RANTES. B box up-regulated CD83 expression as well as IL-6 secretion via a p38 MAPK-dependent pathway.

Vegetation coverage, which is an important indicator for evaluating terrestrial environment, is used to monitor vegetation change. MODIS-NDVI data and climate data were used to analyze the vegetation dynamics and its relationship with climate change on different spatial (forest, grassland and desert biome) and temporal (yearly and monthly) scales in Inner Mongolia during 2001-2010.

Here we show that hepatic IRE1\u03b1 functions as a nutrient sensor that regulates the metabolic adaptation to fasting. We find that prolonged deprivation of food or consumption of a ketogenic diet activates the IRE1\u03b1-XBP1 pathway in mouse livers. Hepatocyte-specific abrogation of Ire1\u03b1 results in impairment of fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation and ketogenesis in the liver under chronic fasting or ketogenic conditions, leading to hepatosteatosis; liver-specific restoration of XBP1s reverses the defects in IRE1\u03b1 null mice. XBP1s directly binds to and activates the promoter of PPAR\u03b1, the master regulator of starvation responses. Hence, our results demonstrate that hepatic IRE1\u03b1 promotes the adaptive shift of fuel\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "111\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

Such unique urchin-like hierarchical superstructures make each electroactive NiCo2O4 nanowire building block contacted easily by electrolyte ions and electrons at high rates, ensuring that sufficient Faradaic reactions take place at large current densities for energy storage. Moreover, no obvious SC degradation after 1000 continuous charge\u2013discharge cycles at 2\u00a0A/g demonstrates good electrochemical stability of the urchin\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "76\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

The SLB can penetrate deep into the mainland for about 200 km when it is blooming. MVB can extend to south and cover almost the whole plain area in Beijing. Both MVB and SLB are diurnal periodical; meanwhile the phase of MVB drops behind that of SLB for about six hours. As a local circulation, the UHIC weakens the two circulations above, and it also has a diurnal period.

In green plants, paraquat targets the chloroplast by transferring electrons from photosystem I to molecular oxygen to generate toxic reactive oxygen species, which efficiently induce membrane damage and cell death. A number of paraquat-resistant biotypes of weeds and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants have been identified. The herbicide resistance in Arabidopsis is partly attributed to a reduced uptake of paraquat through plasma membrane-localized transporters. However, the biochemical mechanism of paraquat resistance remains poorly understood.

{"title": "Application of copulas as a new geostatistical tool\n", "abstract": " In most geostatistical analysis, the spatial variability is solely described with a variogram or a covariance function. These measures have three major problems. First of all, they imply a Gaussianity assumption for the spatial dependence structure. This is, however, often violated in reality as manifested by the dataset investigations in this study. Second, they are sensitive to outliers and thus can be easily polluted by measurement anomalies. Third, they describe the spatial dependence as an integral over the whole marginal distribution of the parameter values. The change of the dependence strength with different quantiles of the parameter is not reflected by these measures, hence not considered in the subsequent interpolation or simulation procedures. But this aspect can be of vital importance for some prediction and design purposes. For example, to predict the flow or transport behavior in a heterogeneous subsurface, where cracks or connected paths, whose spatial continuity deviates largely from the mean trend, exist. Or to extend a monitoring network for noncompliance with environmental standards, where analysis of estimation uncertainty plays a central role and the difference in the uncertainties for different parameter values cannot be overlooked.   To overcome the above addressed problems, the concept of copulas is borrowed in this study as an alternative to the traditional geostatistical tools for spatial description and modeling. As a counterpart of the shortcomings of variogram/covariance function, the main advantages of using copula are also threefold.

The results indicate that a high concentration of Mn2+ (e.g. 3.0\u00a0g\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01) in the electrolyte resulted in the formation of a MnO2 layer on the surface of the anode.

When the Mn2+ concentration was low (e.g. 0.1\u00a0g\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01), no MnO2 layer was formed but the structure of the PbO2 anodic layer was modified.

Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) can non-invasively image the internal resistivity distribution within a human body using a ring of external electrodes, and is thus a promising technique to promptly detect the occurrence of intracranial bleedings because blood differs from other brain tissues in resistivity. However, so far there is no experimental study that has determined whether the intracranial resistivity changes in humans could be repeatedly detected and imaged by EIT. Hence, we for the first time attempt to clinically validate this by in vivo imaging the influx and efflux of irrigating fluid (5% dextrose in water, D5W) during the twist-drill drainage operation for the patients with subdural hematoma (SDH). In this study, six patients (four male, two female) with subacute or chronic SDH received the surgical operation in order to evacuate the hematoma around subdural region, and EIT measurements were performed simultaneously on each patient\u2019s head. The results showed that the resistivity significantly increased on the corresponding position of EIT images during the influx of D5W and gradually decreased back to baseline during the efflux. In the quantitative analysis, the average resistivity values demonstrated the similar results and had highly linear correlation (R2 = 0.93\u00b10.06) with the injected D5W volumes, as well as the area of the resistivity gain(R2 = 0.94\u00b10.05). In conclusion, it was clinically validated that intracranial resistivity\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "39\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

The results showed that sediment bioleaching resulted in a sharp decrease in sediment pH from an initial pH \u223c7.6 to pH \u223c2.5 within 10\u201320 days, approximately 65% of the main heavy metals present (Zn\u00a0+\u00a0Cu\u00a0+\u00a0Cr) were solubilized, and most of the unsolubilized metals existed in residual form of sediment. The acidic leachate that resulted from sediment bioleaching was efficiently stripped of metal sulfates using a bioprecipitation reactor when challenged with influent as low as pH \u223c3.7. More than 99% of Zn2+, 99% of Cu2+ and 90% of Cr3+ were removed from the leachate, respectively, due to the formation of ZnS, Cu2S and CrOOH precipitates, as confirmed by SEM-EDS and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "39\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

This technique achieves deterministic diagnosis results by applying thermometer scan input (TSI) patterns, which have only one rising or one falling transition.

In addition to the first fault, this technique diagnoses remaining faults by applying thermometer scan input with padding (TSIP) patterns.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a critical factor involved in modulating cardiac stress response signaling during ischemia and reperfusion. We hypothesize that ISL as a natural antioxidant may protect heart against ischemic injury via modulating cellular redox status and regulating cardioprotective signaling pathways. The fluorescent probe H2DCFDA was used to measure the level of intracellular ROS. The glucose uptake was determined by 2-deoxy-D-glucose-3H accumulation. The IonOptix System measured the contractile function of isolated cardiomyocytes. The results demonstrated that ISL treatment markedly ameliorated cardiomyocytes contractile dysfunction caused by hypoxia. ISL significantly stimulated cardioprotective signaling, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways. The ROS fluorescent probe H2DCFDA determination indicated that ISL significantly reduced cardiac ROS level during hypoxia/reoxygenation. Moreover, ISL reduced the mitochondrial potential (                ) of isolated mouse cardiomyocytes. Taken together, ISL as a natural antioxidant demonstrated the cardioprotection against ischemic injury that may attribute to the activation of AMPK and ERK signaling pathways and balance of cellular redox status.", "num_citations": "38\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

For this reason, the characteristics of stationary and non-stationary wave propagation in the horizontal non-uniform basic flow are researched separately in theory. Some interesting results are as follows. Stationary waves can propagate through the easterlies with a weak meridional wind, so the interactions between the easterlies and westerlies can be turned out in the view of planetary waves. Besides, the variation of the amplitude also depends on the meridional wind and the latitude. The periodic characteristics of non-stationary waves are discussed based on the necessary and sufficient condition of three and one real solutions of the dispersion relationship respectively.

A theoretical model, including shear lag and vibration effects was developed for predicting the magneto-electric (ME) effect in a laminate composite consisting of magnetostrictive and piezoelectric layers.

For finite length symmetrically fabricated laminates, we derived the dynamic strain-stress field and ME coefficients, including shear lag and vibration effects for several boundary conditions. Parametric studies are presented to evaluate the influences of material properties and geometries on the strain distribution and the ME coefficient.

Hydrothermal treatment at high temperature sharply reduced the acidity of the catalyst, on which the direct conversion of ethene or methanol/dimethyl ether was almost completely suppressed. Co-feeding of ethene and methanol over the said catalyst resulted in considerable conversion of both reactants. Meanwhile, high propene selectivity (ca. 80%) was obtained at lower conversions.

Additionally, halo currents flow partly through these structures during the vertical displacement events (VDEs). Under the high magnetic field circumstances, the resulting electromagnetic forces (EMFs) and torques are large. In this paper, eddy currents and EMFs on EAST VV, PFCs and their supports are calculated by analytical and numerical methods.

{"title": "Mechanisms Involved in the Functional Divergence of Duplicated GroEL Chaperonins in Myxococcus xanthus DK1622\n", "abstract": " The gene encoding the GroEL chaperonin is duplicated in nearly 30% of bacterial genomes; and although duplicated groEL genes have been comprehensively determined to have distinct physiological functions in different species, the mechanisms involved have not been characterized to date. Myxococcus xanthus DK1622 has two copies of the groEL gene, each of which can be deleted without affecting cell viability; however, the deletion of either gene does result in distinct defects in the cellular heat-shock response, predation, and development. In this study, we show that, from the expression levels of different groELs, the distinct functions of groEL1 and groEL2 in predation and development are probably the result of the substrate selectivity of the paralogous GroEL chaperonins, whereas the lethal effect of heat shock due to the deletion of groEL1 is caused by a decrease in the total groEL expression level. Following a bioinformatics analysis of the composition characteristics of GroELs from different bacteria, we performed region-swapping assays in M. xanthus, demonstrating that the differences in the apical and the C-terminal equatorial regions determine the substrate specificity of the two GroELs. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments indicated that the GGM repeat sequence at the C-terminus of GroEL1 plays an important role in functional divergence. Divergent functions of duplicated GroELs, which have similar patterns of variation in different bacterial species, have thus evolved mainly via alteration of the apical and the C-terminal equatorial regions.

{"title": "A new inverse algorithm for tomographic reconstruction of damage images using lambwaves\n", "abstract": " Lamb wave tomography (LWT) is a potential and efficient technique for non-destructive tomographic reconstruction of damage images in structural components or materials. A new two-stage inverse algorithm with a small amount of scanning data for quickly reconstructing damage images in aluminum and CFRP laminated plates was proposed in this paper. Due to its high sensitivity to damages, the amplitude decrease of transmitted Lamb waves after travelling through the inspected region was employed as a key signal parameter related to the attenuation of Lamb waves in propagation routes. A through-thickness circular hole and a through-thickness elliptical hole in two aluminum plates, and an impact-induced invisible internal delamination in a CFRP laminated plate were used to validate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method. It was concluded that the present new algorithm was capable of reconstructing the images of the above mentioned various damages successfully with much less experimental data compared with those needed by some traditional techniques.", "num_citations": "25\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

Methods: We conducted a trial of screening with pe, mam, and us among Chinese women 25 years of age and older. All initial screenings using the three modalities were completed within 30 days of each other, and subjects were followed approximately 1 year later. The performances of the three screening methods used alone, in parallel, or in series were compared. Data were analyzed using exact confidence intervals (CIS) and the McNemar test. Results: Between March 2009 and July 2011, 3028 eligible women completed all study examinations. At a mean follow-up of 1.3 years, 33 breast cancers were identified in the study population. Mammography detected 28 cancers; US, 24 cancers; and PE, 22 cancers. During the follow-up period, 2 false-negative cases occurred clinically. The highest sensitivity for breast cancer screening (93.9%) was achieved by paralleling MAM with US, but came at the cost of a higher recall rate (12.15%). Using us alone at the first stage, followed by mam when indicated, offered high specificity (99.4%) and the lowest recall rate (1.82%), which were not reached at the expense of sensitivity (84.8%). Used in series, us and mam achieved a sensitivity similar to that for the same modalities used in parallel (McNemar p> 0.05).

A critical content exists below which the eutectic growth is accelerated within a certain undercooling range due to the third element addition, but slowed down otherwise.

Seventy-two cross-bred (Duroc Landrace Large White) weanling pigs, weighing an average of 7.38 0.06 kg, were randomly assigned to either a corn-soybean meal diet (treatment 1), a corn-brown rice-soybean meal diet (treatment 2) and a brown rice-soybean meal diet (treatment 3). The brown rice used in this experiment was husked from one kind of early, long grain, non-glutinous rice (ELGNR, indica rice). The growth performance of weanling pigs in the experiment was similar during weeks 1 and 2, but feed conversion ratio (FCR) was significantly better in treatment 2 during weeks 3 and 4. During week 2, only the digestibility of organic matter in treatments 2 and 3 was significantly higher than that in treatment 1. During week 4, the digestibility of gross energy, ether extract, organic matter and dry matter in brown rice treatment, especially in treatment 3, were significantly higher than in treatment 1. At the end of the experiment, the concentration of serum urea nitrogen of pigs in treatment 2 was lower than that in treatment 1 and 3 and no difference was found in serum glucose and phosphorus. It could be concluded from this experiment that replacing 50% of corn with brown rice in the corn-soybean meal diet caused no negative effects to weanling pig performance, and apparent fecal digestibility was unaffected.

The contribution of different climate factors to the change in streamflow in each watershed is estimated quantitatively using the water balance equations. Results show that in each watershed, the annual streamflow exhibits an increasing trend from 1961\u20132000. The increases in streamflow by 4.80 m 3 s\u2212 1 yr\u2212 1 and 1.29 m 3 s\u2212 1 yr\u2212 1 at Meigang and Gaosha, respectively, are statistically significant at the 5% level.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the global protein expression profile of the regenerating mouse liver following 50% PH by differential proteomics, and thereby gaining some insights into the hepatic regeneration mechanism(s) under this milder but clinically more relevant condition. Proteins from sham-operated mouse livers and livers regenerating for 24 h after 50% PH were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by nanoUPLC-Q-Tof mass spectrometry. Compared to sham-operated group, there were totally 87 differentially expressed proteins (with 50 up-regulated and 37 down-regulated ones) identified in the regenerating mouse livers, most of which have not been previously related to liver regeneration. Remarkably, over 25 differentially expressed proteins were located at mitochondria. Several of the mitochondria-resident proteins which play important roles in citric acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production were found to be down-regulated, consistent with the recently-proposed model in which the reduction of ATP content in the remnant liver gives rise to early stress signals that contribute to the onset of liver regeneration.

In our method, each joint coordinate is parameterized by its surrounding local surface. In such a way, the character's surface is implicitly bound onto the skeleton. Character animation is achieved by minimizing an energy function that is carefully designed to prevent unnatural volume changes and to guarantee smooth deformations.

The total simulated annual global dust emission is 2500 Tg yr\u22121, and the dust mass load is 19.3 Tg for year 2000. Both are consistent with estimates from other models. Results from simulations are compared with multiple surface measurements near and away from dust source regions, validating the generation, transport and deposition of dust in the model. Most discrepancies between model results and surface measurements are due to unresolved aerosol processes. Biases in long-range transport are also contributing. Radiative properties of dust aerosol are derived from approximated parameters in two size modes using Mie theory. The simulated aerosol optical depth (AOD) is compared with satellite and surface remote sensing measurements and shows general agreement in terms of the dust distribution around sources.

For the uplink transmission with DI, a ~11-dB optical power budget improvement at a bit error ratio of 1e-3 is obtained and the extinction ratio (ER) of signal is also improved from 3.4 dB to 13.75 dB. Owing to this high ER, the upstream burst-mode transmitting is successfully presented in term of time-division multiplexing.

The data suggested that an N-Methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) -dependent LTP was inducible in adult hippocampal slices with a characteristic of synapse input specificity. It also indicated that aging resulted in a reduction in LTP but more importantly a loss of synaptic input specificity.

When remelted 10 times, the BMG sample cast from the master alloy ingot undergoes bending, but it does not fracture even though the bending angle increases to 100\u00b0; the maximum bending stress and elastic strain remain almost constant. The bending plasticity improvement may be attributed to the fact that the increased remelting times result in more free volume and more disorder and homogeneous microstructure in the BMG, which favors the initial nucleation of profuse shear bands and reduces the probability of catastrophic fracture.", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

The electrostatic interaction between Au(\u0428) and the phosphate backbone of DNA formed the netlike coordination compound of Au(\u0428)-DNA, and then the complex was chemically reduced to form Au nanoparticles in this network-like DNA conformation. The negatively charged nanoconjugate was used as the matrix for immobilization of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). A stable and well-defined redox peaks of HRP were observed on the Au-DNA nanoconjugate modified glassy carbon (GC) electrode, which indicated that the modified enzyme electrode displayed good direct electron transfer behavior and excellent reducing ability toward hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) with the apparent Michaelis\u2013Menten constant (Km) estimated to be 0.147\u00a0mM.", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["1023"]}
{"title": "Time-frequency characteristics of partial discharge pulse with Wigner-Ville distributions\n", "abstract": " According to the unstability of partial discharge pulse signals, a joint time-frequency analysis method was put forward to process the signals to obtain their characteristics in time-frequency domain. Since the wigner-ville distribution which belongs to the Cohen class time-frequency energy distribution is commonly used at present for processing unstable signals, a simulated PD pulse was chosen as the object to investigate its original WVD, smoothing pseudo Wigner distribution (SPWVD) and rearranged-smoothing-pseudo Wigner distribution (RSPWVD). The results show that WVD is highly sensitive to the short-variation of unstable PD signal, which is more suitable to extract time-varying information. SPWVD can remove the cross-terms of interference caused by the bilinear function but reduce the time-frequency resolution. For having good time-frequency concentration, RSPWVD provides a powerful tool to evaluate parameters for single PD pulse shape, which can be used in PD pattern recognition and in-depth study of PD mechanism in electrical insulation system.", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

Adventitious shoots occurred at the basal end of the initiated axillary buds that preexisted at the node regions. BAP at 1.25 mg/l was the optimum for shoot induction. The combination of BAP with IBA had worthless effect on shoots proliferation. The number of adventitious buds was promoted when the seeds were preconditioned with appropriate concentrations of BAP (2 to 3 mg/l), whereas was depressed with higher concentrations of BAP (5 to 15 mg/l). The regeneration system was further optimized due to the presence of cotyledons attaching to the cotyledonary node explants.

In the current paper, we present a novel approach to identify admissible tool orientations for collision avoidance in five-axis ball-end milling with complex machining environment. The proposed approach is built upon two techniques: graphics-assisted cubic mapping; and instantaneous visibility and accessibility cones computation. For each colliding cutter location (CL), the graphics-assisted cubic mapping algorithm computes the cutter's instantaneous visibility cone with respect to machining environment and the occlusion depth along each obstructed direction. With the given instantaneous visibility and occlusion depth information, an algorithm of spherical region shrinking is then developed\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

The weathered zone containing coalbed methane is very shallow in the Powder River basin due to the influences of the Quaternary glaciation and secondary biogas. In contrast, the weathered zone containing coalbed methane in Northwest China is very deep due to the dry weather and less secondary biogas.

{"title": "IDDQ data analysis using current signature\n", "abstract": " The goals of this paper are (1) to improve the effectiveness of IDDQ testing, and (2) to find the characteristic current signature for every defect class. Current signature analysis was performed for the IDDQ data collected on the Murphy test chip. A \"total variance\" method is proposed to reduce the test escape of IDDQ testing. Compared to the other three IDDQ testing methods, it has the lowest test escape and the highest yield loss. However, there are still 7.5% non-functional CUTs which could not be detected by any IDDQ testing method. This result shows that it is not possible to replace Boolean tests by IDDQ testing. The distributions of six current signature types over six different classes are analyzed. The results show that \"big-step\" is the dominant signature type among all defect classes.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

Morphological analysis puts this genus in the Fothergilleae sensu Harms, and implies that Shaniodendron is closely related to Parrotia CA Mey. In this study, sequences of the internal transcribed spacers of nuclear ribosomal DNA were analyzed for apetalous genera of the Hamamelidoideae to further evaluate the systematic relationships of Shaniodendron. The ITS-based phylogeny supported the combination of the Distylieae and the Fothergilleae, thus recognizing the Fothergilleae sensu Endress.

Methods: OE-19 cells were cultivated using adherent and suspension culture methods. The tumor stem-like phenotype of CD44 expression was detected using flow cytometry. We examined growth characteristics, cloning capacity in soft agar, and radiation resistance of 2 groups of cells. Results: Suspended cells in serum-free medium formed spheres that were enriched for CD44 expression. CD44 was expressed in 62.5% of suspended cells, but only in 11.7% of adherent cells. The suspended cells had greater capacity for proliferation and colony formation in soft agar than the adherent cells. When the suspended and adherent cells were irradiated at 5 Gy, 10 Gy, or 15 Gy, the proportion of CD44+ suspended cells strongly and weakly positive for CD44 was 77.8%, 66.5%, 57.5%; and 21.7%, 31.6%, 41.4%, respectively. In contrast, the proportion of CD44+ adherent cells strongly positive for CD44 was 18.9%, 14.%, and 9.95%, respectively. When the irradiation dose was increased to 30 Gy, the survival of the suspended and adherent cells was significantly reduced, and viable CD44+ cells were not detected.

Noise measurements show that the minimum detectable voltage change \u0394Vm on the target is less than 10mV. Thus flicker noise in the Zr/W field emitter does not place a serious limit on \u0394Vm. A high brightness field emission liquid metal ion source of Ga+ in conjunction with a simple single-lens focusing column can be used to sputter remove selectively small areas of the insulating passivation layer from ICs.

{"title": "Three-dimensional stability analysis of dam abutment high slope dynamic behaviors considering rock mass unloading\n", "abstract": " A double-curved arch dam is located in Jinshajiang River with a maximum height of 277 m. The excavation height of the left dam abutment is about 300 m, and the right is about 480 m. Because the excavated slopes are high and steep the stability of the slopes has great influence on dam operation and safety. After a detailed analysis of dam site geological data, the 3D elastoplastic finite element model of dam abutment slope is established. And according to the unloading rock mass mechanics theoryt, he degree and areas of unloading can be gained by contrasting the initial stress field with the field after excavation. Then the degree of rock mass quality deterioration after excavation can also be achieved. With the progress of excavation, the areas and degree of unloading change constantly. Thus in order to study the dynamic stability of the high slopes, the rock mass mechanical parameters are adjusted continually according to the changing areas and degree of unloading after each excavation step. The results show that except partial regions near excavation surface, the abutment slopes are stable during and after excavation processes. After taking the effects of dynamic unloading into consideration, the displacement and plastic zones of slope rock mass after excavation decrease; and the rock mass failure regions change with the course of excavation.

However, the performance of join operation using MapReduce is not as good as that of parallel relational database. Thus, how to optimize theta-join operations using MapReduce is an attractive point to which researchers have been paying attention.

Many explosion tests are carried out in the second period engineering project in Ling\u2032 ao Nuclear Power Station, Guangdong Province. The dissemination of vibration wave of blasting is analyzed in concave or protruding topography. The results show that the concave landforms have great effects on decreasing scale of vibration wave of blasting. It is found that the attenuation coefficient of vibration wave in concave landform is relative to its width and depth and to charge weight per delay interval and explosive distance. The protruding topography can enhance scale of vibration wave of blasting The amplification effect is related to orientation in protruding topography, and that the vertical vibration velocity is amplified more than that of the horizontal vibration. The amplified coefficient of vibration wave blasting is augmented with relative altitude, but decreases with the scale distance of explosive in protruding topography. In addition, the scale effect of protruding landform is also related to property of rock mass, and the structure of rock and the growth of cranny.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

The present study was to define the sequence variability based on the sequence divergences of the 5'UTR of the virus. METHODS: Sequences of 91 isolates from patients with chronic hepatitis C from Yunnan, southwest China, were sequenced and genotypes were defined according to the sequence divergences of the 5'UTR of the virus. RESULTS: Eighty-six isolates were classified into 3 clades (previously termed groups or major types) by the methods proposed by Chan et al in 1992 and phylogenetic analysis based on nucleotide sequence divergences within the 5'UTR. Fifty-six percent of the isolates were classified into clade 3, 35% into clade 1, and 34.9% into clade 2. New genotypes 1f, 2h, 3h and 3i were defined. In addition, 3 novel sequences were discovered, respectively with an 18-nt sequence deletion (corresponding to nucleotide position-173 to-156), a 28-nt sequence insertion, and a 40-nt sequence insertion, between-56 and-55. Of these isolates, 56% possessed a\" G\" at position-66 in place of the\" T\" that is present in all previously reported sequences.

Waterproof abrasive paper was used as mold which had a micrometer-sized morphology. N, N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) and 1-octanol were used as solvent and non-solvent addition, respectively. The PVDF membrane was fabricated on the mold by using phase inversion method induced by the penetration of water vapor and then water precipitation bath. Contact angle measurement showed that the water contact angle on the bottom surface of the membrane increased and then decreased slightly with the increase of roughness of the abrasive paper used, among which the WCA on the bottom surfaces prepared with type of 1000-grit waterproof abrasive paper reached as high as 135. It was revealed that the microstructure level roughness was replicated from the course substrate. And the course substrate acted in synergy with non-solvent additive, which promoted the solid-liquid demixing and radial growth of the polymer crystallites in all directions. The resulting micro-and nanoscale hierarchical roughness on the bottom surface brought about an enhanced hydrophobicity of the membrane. The characterization of the porous PVDF membrane obtained from coarse substrate and glass substrate was carried out by a nitrogen flux measuring and a mechanical property test. It shows that the highly hydrophobic membrane by using the novel method is more suitable for membrane contactor devices.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

It is always used in malware to evade detection from anti-malware software. In this paper, we propose a method to detect malware obfuscation using maximal patterns. Maximal pattern is a subsequence in malware's runtime system call sequence, which frequently appears in program execution, and can be used to describe the program specific behavior. The maximal pattern sequence is extracted from the malware's runtime system calls, and the similarity between two pattern sequences will be measured by evolutionary similarity.

Due to its adsorption capacity, it can affect geochemical behaviors of heavy metals and microorganism. This study has focused on the adsorption of Cu2+ and Acidothiobacillus ferrooxidans cells on the chemically synthesized schwertmannite. It is observed that the adsorption of Cu2+ and Acidothiobacillus ferrooxidans on schwertmannite is remarkable, and the biosorption process of Cu2+ is well consistent with the Langmuir model. The biosorption process of Acidothiobacillus ferrooxidans, however, is consistent with the Freundlich model instead of with the Langmuir model.

A change in the ratio of the white lines of Co ion, L3/L2, is used to identify the change in the valence state in Co ion, which reveals that Mg substitution gives rise to an increase of the average valence of Co ion. This is a mixed valence state of Co3+ and Co4+ in Mg substitution materials. Relative lowering of the integrated intensity of prepeak in oxygen K edge with the Mg concentration connects with a lower covalency of the Co\u2013O bond, which indicates a significant electron feeding back from Co 3d to O 2p. This makes the oxygen ions closer to the feature of closed shell, which helps electron hopping between Co3+ and Co4\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

{"title": "Neurogranin: a brain-specific protein\n", "abstract": " Neurogranin (Ng) is a newly discovered brain-specific protein composed of 78 amino acid residues, which mainly located postsynaptically in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and olfactory bulb in adult human or animals. As a member of calpacitin family, Ng is a protein kinase C (PKC) substrate and calmodulin (CaM) reservoir. In the physiological conditions, Ng forms a complex with CaM, and its CaM-binding affinity was modulated by phosphorylation, oxidation and glutathiolation under the activation of PKC or oxidant stress, which may be involved in the regulation of CaM and CaM-activated proteins, such as CaM-dependent nitric oxide synthase (NOS), CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and CaM-dependent adenylate cyclase (AC). Since most of CaM-activated proteins were involved in long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), and the timing pattern of Ng gene expression and protein synthesis are coincidence with synaptogenesis and development, it is suggested that Ng may play an important role in learning, memory and neuroplasticity. In addition, it was found that the changes of Ng expression might associate with certain cerebral pathophysiologic disorders, such as hypothyroidism, sleep-deprivation, brain aging and cerebral hypoxic preconditioning.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

Because it is built on trusted nodes, Friendstore is not burdened by the complexity required to cope with potentially malicious participants. Friendstore only needs to detect and repair accidental data loss and to ensure balanced storage exchange. The disadvantage of using only trusted nodes is that Friendstore cannot achieve perfect storage utilization.

Typically this is performed by partial reconstruction or thresholding operation. In this paper we describe an efficient noise reduction method. EEMD is used to decompose a signal into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). The time intervals between two adjacent zero-crossings within the IMF, called instantaneous half period (IHP), are used as a criterion to detect and classify the noise oscillations. The undesirable waveforms with a larger IHP are set to zero. Furthermore, the optimum threshold in this approach can be derived from the signal itself using the consecutive mean square error (CMSE). The method is fully data driven, and it requires no prior knowledge of the target signals. This method can be verified with the simulative program by using Matlab. The denoising results are proper. In comparison with other EEMD based methods, it is concluded that the means adopted in this paper is suitable to preprocess the stress wave signals in the wood nondestructive testing.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

We compare the results of two assumptions: soft-die mode  and hard-die mode. The former assumes that the DfT of dies cannot be changed, while the latter assumes that the DfT of dies can be adjusted. The results show that thermal-aware cooptimization is essential to decide the optimal TAM and test schedule. Blindly adding TAM cannot reduce the total test cost due to temperature constraints. Another conclusion is that soft-die mode is more effective than hard-die mode to reduce the total test cost for 3D IC.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

METHODS: Injury of PC12 cells was induced by incubating with Abeta (25-35) in vitro. Ovariectomized rats were intragastrically administered with GNC decoction twice daily for 5 days and then sera were obtained. PC12 cells were cultured with different concentrations of serum containing GNC decoction and its main monomers including paeoniflorin, berberine, timosaponin and icariin and the monomer mixtures to determine the best concentration of the drugs by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) method. The effective concentration of Abeta (25-35) was determined by culturing PC12 cells with different concentrations of Abeta (25-35). Then, the activity of PC12 cells with Abeta (25-35)-induced injury was observed with MTT method. Cellular morphological change was observed by phase contrast microscopy. Flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy were employed to observe the Abeta (25-35)-induced early apoptosis of PC12 cells. RESULTS: After Abeta (25-35) induction, the PC12 cells were fewer in number, less viable with shrinked cel1 body and nuclei, and many fragments, and the cells were less adhered.

However, for a low-frequency SAS system operated in shallow water environments, there are often strong sea surface and bottom reflected multipath components that interfere with the desired echo signals. Based upon a small vertically displaced hydrophone array, several spatial processing algorithms have been proposed for multipath reduction. Most of these algorithms, however, are only applicable to narrowband signals, whereas wideband signals are usually used in low-to-medium-frequency SAS systems in order to achieve a high range resolution.

The measured relative complex permittivity of the Co/TiO2 nanocomposite-paraffin wax mixture indicates that a high electrical resistivity and a dielectric loss exist in the Co/TiO2 nanocomposites. The dielectric loss mainly results from the polarisation of the metal/insulator interfaces.

The effects of gefitinib in combination with radiation on cell apoptosis and cell cycle distribution were analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Of the 7 gastric cancer cell lines, the expression of EGFR in MKN45 and SGC7901 cells were the highest. The 50% inhibition concentrations (IC (50)) of gefitinib were 0.4 mmol/L for MKN45 cells and 0.8 mmol/L for SGC7901 cells. Cell survival was significantly decreased with the elevation of gefitinib concentration or radiation dose (P< 0.05). When treated with 0.1 x and 0.2 x IC (50) of gefitinib, the radiosensitization enhancement ratios (SER) of MKN45 cells were 1.102 and 1.154, and those of SGC7901 cells were 1.092 and 1.176, respectively. Either gefitinib or radiation induced cell apoptosis, reduced the percentage of cells at S phase and increased the percentage of cells at G (2)/M\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1023"]}
{"title": "Real-time performance analysis of industrial embedded control systems using switched ethernet\n", "abstract": " The appearance of the switched Ethernet opens up the use of Ethernet as a reliable deterministic communication technology. Comparing with traditional Ethernet, the real-time characteristic of the switched Ethernet is more advanced because it provides a private collision domain to each port of a switch to avoid collisions. Based on the two embedded ARM controllers connected over the switched Ethernet, the real-time performance of four different protocols on ARM-Linux 2.4 and 2.6 platforms are assessed and discussed in this paper. The testing results show that the controllers connected over the switched Ethernet, with which using ARM-Linux and UDP or RTP protocol, to some extent has potential to be used in many real-time control applications, though some drawbacks still need to be improved.

{"title": "Quantitative evaluation of film thickness uniformity: Application to off-axis magnetron source onto a rotating substrate\n", "abstract": " To predict the thin film thickness distribution in a quantitative way, a theoretical calculation was conducted according to the cosine law approach for off-axis sputtering. The numerical calculation was focused on the optimal geometry instead of the thickness distribution itself, which took into account several variables including the target-to-substrate distance, the off-axis displacement, the emission characteristic, the width of the erosion groove, and the film thickness requirement. The effects of these variables on the optimal geometry were analyzed individually and the subsequent combined equations for optimal geometry were summarized. Thus, the combined equations were multivariable functions. These equations were simple and general and could be applied directly. For many situations, these equations eliminate the need to perform the complex, detailed calculation otherwise needed for each deposition\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1023"]}
{"title": "Finite element analysis of impact loads on the femur.\n", "abstract": " To investigate the stress distribution and fracture mechanism of proximal femur under impact loads. The image data of one male's femur were collected by the Lightspeed multi-lay spiral computed tomography. A 3D finite element model of the femur was established by employing the finite element software ANSYS, which mainly concentrated on the effects of the directions of the impact loads arising from intense movements and the parenchyma on the hip joint as well as those of the femur material properties on the distribution of the Mises equivalent stress in the femur after impact. The numerical results about the effects of the angle sigma of the impact loads to the anterior direction and the angle gamma of the impact loads to the femur shaft on the bone fracture were given. The angle sigma had larger effect on the stress distribution than the angle gamma, which mainly represented the fracture of the upper femur including the femoral neck fracture when the posterolateral femur was impacted. This result was consistent with the clinical one. The parenchyma on the hip joint has relatively large relaxation effect on the impact loads. A 3D finite element analysis model of the femoral hip joint under dynamic loads is successfully established by using the impact dynamic theory.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

The CaMV35S promoter-bar construct and DCA promoter-bar construct into D. salina by a Backon 2000 electroporation system were introduced. After the repeated selections with the phosphinothricin (PPT) of 3mg/L, 3 PPT-resistant phenotype transformants were isolated from the CaMV-bar and DCA-bar pools of transformants of D. salina, respectively. The results of PCR and sequencing showed that bar genes were stably integrated into the genome of D. salina, and Southern bolts showed the number of transgene copy had no significant difference between both promoters. Semi-quantitive RT-PCR indicated that the mRNA levels of bar gene were higher in DCA-bar transformants than the CaMV-bar transformants, and could be increased under the induction of high salt in DCA-bar transformants but not in the CaMV-bar transformants. Analysis of growth rate of transformants showed DCA-bar transformants achieved the log stage faster than the CaMV-bar transformants.

The silicon 45 \u00b0  microreflectors are fabricated on an orientation-defined (100) silicon substrate by using anisotropic chemical wet etching. On using a photolithography process, we observe two vertically bending paths at the input and output ports of polymer waveguide on a silicon substrate with 45 \u00b0  microreflectors. The transmission efficiency of -3.77 dB is measured for a 0.5-cm polymer waveguide combined with the 45 \u00b0  microreflectors. The optical loss occurring at the 45 \u00b0 -mirror is -0.27 dB. The channel-to-channel crosstalk for the 250-\u03bcm pitch is less than -40 dB.

How to efficiently implement join operation using MapReduce is an attractive point to which researchers have been paying attention. Multiway equi-joins and two-way theta-joins using MapReduce have been solved recently. In this paper, we introduce a communication cost model to evaluate multiway theta-joins for the first time and propose a randomized algorithm Strict-Even-Join to solve it.

{"title": "Evaluation on peer education program among injecting drug users\n", "abstract": " OBJECTIVE: To reduce risk behaviors which promotes human immuno deficiency virus (HIV) transmission among drug users. METHODS: A peer education program was implemented among drug users in drug detoxification centers in Kunming from May 1998 to June 2000. Before and after intervention, through random sampling, subjects were recruited to assess the impact of the program. Focus group discussion and a small sample of follow-up in communities were used for evaluation. RESULTS: Three hundred and six and 418 subjects were interviewed before and after the intervention program. Rates regarding\" sharing needles\" had a reduction from 68.3% to 62.0%(chi 2= 2.61, P< 0.01, while\" never cleaning a needle\" increased from 3.3% to 15.8%(chi 2= 19.41, P< 0.01), and\" used needles disposal to garbage bin\" increased from 58.4% to 81.8%(chi 2= 40.23, P< 0.01). Thirty-four drug users were followed in their communities and 67.6% were no longer sharing needles but none reported using a condom when having casual sex. CONCLUSION: Peer education program among drug users in detoxification centers had limited impact.

In this work, the non-covalent functionalization of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with P4VP in CO2-expanded liquids (CXLs) is reported. It is found that P4VP stabilized SWCNTs show good dispersion in both organic solvent and aqueous solution (pH= 2). The ability to manipulate the dispersion state of CNTs in water with P4VP will likely benefit many biological applications, such as drug delivery and optical sensors. Furthermore, the structure and morphology of P4VP/SWCNTs composite are examined, with the focus on molecular weight of P4VP (MW-P4VP), the pressure of CXLs and the concentration of P4VP. It is amazing that the P4VP15470 wrapping patterns undergo a notable morphological evolution from dotlike crystals to bottle brush-like, then to compact kebab-like, and then to widely-spaced dotted kebab patterns by facile pressure tuning in the higher polymer concentration series. In other words, the CXLs method enables superior control of the P4VP crystallization patterns on SWCNTs. Meanwhile, the CXL-assisted P4VP crystal growth mechanism on SWCNT is investigated, and the dominating growth mechanism is attributed to \u2018size dependent soft epitaxy\u2019in P4VP15470/SWCNTs composites.

The membrane fouling rate in HMBR is lower than that in CMBR. During the 50-day operation, the trans-membrane pressure (TMP) of HMBR maintains at the same level while TMP of CMBR increases from 4.59 kPa to 26.18 kPa. The analysis of extracellular polymeric substances shows that the concentrations of SMP and LB in HMBR are significantly lower than those in CMBR, which reduces membrane fouling rate. CFP can effectively alleviate membrane fouling in MBR.

The injection-current-dependent electroluminescence characteristics of Mg-doped QW exhibit smaller injection-current-induced blueshift and energy separation, which indicate that modification of quantized levels has occurred in Mg-doped QW due to the reduction of polarization field. The cathodoluminescence intensity of the strained ultrathin InN/GaN QWs is enhanced with increasing barrier thickness due to the suppression of interwell coupling, while the emission wavelength redshifts significantly as the well width increases due to reduction of strain in the QW.

The water use efficiency culminated in the early morning, water use efficiency was significantly higher in the morning than that in the afternoon. The energy use efficiency showed low-concave curve. According to Farquhar and Sharkey's view, resulting in net photosynthetic rate reasons for the decline in both constraints and non-stomatal pores constraints, the decline of net photosynthetic rate in the morning was mainly caused by the constraints of the pore, the reduce of net photosynthetic rate at noon and afternoon was mainly attributed to the leaf cells to reduce the carboxylation efficiency.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

The performance parameters such as orientation, surface morphology, grain size and the thickness of LiTaO3 thin film were studied by XRD, SEM and AFM. The influence of different solvents on the stability of LiTaO3 sols and the influence of different annealing condition on the prepa-ration of LiTaO3 thin film were analyzed either. The relative dielectric coefficient and dielectric loss of the prepared LiTaO3 thin film were measured by using Al/LiTaO3/ITO structure electrode. The experimental results show that the quality of LiTaO3 thin film with every layer crystallized annealing is better than that with pyrolyzed and crystallized annealing alternately. The relative dielectric coefficient is about 53 and dielectric loss is about O. 4 when the measured frequency is 1 kHz. The reason of increaing the dielectric loss of LiTaO3 thin film has been discussed.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

Preferred crystal thicknesses corresponded to simple fractions of E, which result in a relatively higher proportion of chain folds in the surface. Growth rates peaked at 75\u00a0\u00b0C and were unusually scattered at temperatures corresponding to a change in preferred chain conformation.

The SiC whisker seems to be the best reinforcement for aluminium based composites. However, the high cost of SiC whisker has been the critical factor limiting the commercial application of the composites. The development of inexpensive aluminium borate and potassium titanate whiskers shows promise for future applications of the composites. The cost of aluminium borate whisker ranges from one-tenth to one-twentieth of that of silicon carbide whisker. The AllsB4033 whisker (A1BOw) reinforced 6061A1 composite fabricated by squeeze casting exhibits strength and modulus comparable to those of SiC whisker reinforced 6061A1 composite [3].

Firstly, a new kind of fuzzy mapping, termed semistrictly convex fuzzy mapping, is defined through this linear ordering. Note that semistrict convexity does not imply convexity. And the interrelationships among convex, strictly convex and semistrictly convex mappings are established under certain conditions. Furthermore, this paper obtains several characterizations for the above three classes of fuzzy mappings under the conditions of upper or lower semicontinuity. Finally, some further characteristic properties for semistrictly convex fuzzy mappings are derived.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

Compared with the dosage, the bombardment voltage has more obvious effect in change the coercive force of a magnet. When the voltage of ion is 1\u00a0kV, the coercive force increases by 15% compared to untreated one. However, at a higher voltage of 50\u00a0kV, ion bombardment induces a decrease of the coercive force by 18%. It is suggested that the irradiated defects play crucial roles in increasing the magnetic coercive force, and the defects were created by weakened lattice discrete breathers (DB) in the domain wall or grain boundary during ion bombardment.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1023"]}
{"title": "Investigation of an electrochemically switched heterocyclization reaction on gold surface\n", "abstract": " We report an investigation of an electrochemically switched heterocyclization reaction on hydroquinone-terminated self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). This reaction involves an electrochemically modulated hydroquinone/benzoquinone transformation step in the SAMs and a subsequent heterocyclization step taking place between the electrochemically generated benzoquinone moieties in SAMs and l-cysteine in solution. The reaction process was monitored by XPS and electrochemical surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (EC-SERS). The surface reaction proceeds as a two-step reaction to give a benzothiazine product, which is in contrast to the much more complicated multiple step reactions in solution. This result suggests that the tight molecular packing in the SAMs does not hinder the intramolecular heterocylization reaction, but prevents the intermolecular coupling reaction from happening.

Rhoptry protein 13 (ROP13) plays some roles in the invasion process of T. gondii. In this study, sequence variation in ROP13 gene among 14 T. gondii isolates from different geographical locations and hosts was examined. The ROP13 gene was amplified from individual isolates and sequenced. Results show that the length of the ROP13 sequences was 1203 bp. In total, there were 44 variable nucleotide positions in the ROP13 sequences, and sequence variations were 0.1 to 2.0% among the 14 examined T. gondii isolates, representing higher rate in transversion than in transition. Intra-specific nucleotide variations were mainly at the second codon positions. Phylogenetic analysis of the 14 examined T. gondii isolates indicate that the ROP13 sequence was not a suitable genetic marker to differentiate T. gondii isolates of different genotypes from different hosts and geographical regions.

Researches show that bundled feature becomes much more discriminative than single feature, while the intrinsic geometric constraint of a bundled feature is still defective. In this paper, we add a geometric constraint by SIFTs distance matrix to improve the discriminative power.

Boreholes, which were drilled in the fields and used to determine the existence of perfamost at the drilling points, were the data basis. Based on the 189 boreholes and DEM, effects of longitude, latitude, elevation, solar radiation, aspect, slope and curvature on the distribution of permafrost were evaluated quantitatively through the correlation analysis. The results indicated that the macro-scale factors of longitude, latitude, elevation and solar radiation were the major affecting factors. As the spatial scale decreased, slope was another important factor affecting the distribution of permafrost. Therefore, a logistic model, taking longitude, elevation and slope as independent variables, and the occurrence probability of permafrost as a dependant variable, was developed to simulate the distribution probability of permafrost in the buffer areas. The modeling results showed that the possible permafrost with probability values ranging from 0.75 to 1 was the major type, accounting for 65% of the buffer area. The second largest distribution area was the seasonally frozen ground with probability values smaller than 0.5, accounting for 29% of the buffer area. The third was the possible permafrost type with probability values of 0.5-0.75, accounting for only 6% of the buffer area.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

{"title": "Experimental research on steel specially shaped columns with T-section under cyclic loading\n", "abstract": " Pseudo-static tests on 8 steel columns with T-section models of 1\u2236 2 geometrical scale and equal stress under cyclic loading were reported. The deformation properties, failure mode were discussed, and the hysteretic loops, skeleton curves, bearing capacity, ductility and energy-dissipation were investigated. As a result, the effect of flange width-thickness ratio, web depth-thickness ratio and axial compression ratio were reviewed. Testing results indicate that the steel specially shaped column with T-section has excellent bearing capacity, good ductility and energy dissipation if certain flange width-thickness ratio, web depth-thickness ratio and axial compression ratio conditions are appropriate. Finite-element analysis were conducted based on initial geometric imperfection and geometric nonlinearity, and the results were close to those from the tests. The typical failure mode was local buckling instability with sufficient plastic deformation. Study evidence shows that steel specially shaped columns with T-section can be used in buildings in seismic regions.

Both rabbits and guinea pigs sensitized by Salvia miltiorrhiza could produce specified antibodies. Large molecular antigenic impurities were extracted from the Danshen injection and Xiangdan injection using the centrifugal filtering method. The test results of active systemic anaphylaxis (ASA) and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) in guinea pigs confirmed that the extracted antigenic impurities could induce the anaphylaxis reaction in the animals which were sensitized by the Salvia miltiorrhiza antigen. Using the specified antibody produced from rabbits which were sensitiyed by Salvia miltiorrhiza, ELISA test method was developed to test the residual Salvia miltiorrhiza antigenic materials contained in the parenteral Chinese traditional medicines. Calculated as residual protein, the linear range was 0.08-5.12 microg x mL (-1)(r2= 0.9906), the detection limit and quantization limit are 0.08 microg x mL (-1) and 0.4 microg x mL (-1), respectively. 308 batches of parenteral Chinese traditional medicines containing water-soluable components of Salvia miltiorrhiza were tested, and the Salvia miltiorrhiza antigenic impurities were spotted in 35 (11.4%) batches of samples.

Since the development, deployment and maintenance of distributed systems rely largely on middleware services, the failure of middleware services puts a significant impact on the reliability and availability of the whole system. Though recovery-based fault tolerance is an effective way to improve the reliability of middleware services, it is far away from practice mainly because of the high complexity and cost of the recovery of correlated failures between interdependent services. In this paper, a framework for detecting and recovering the correlated failures of middleware services in an automated way is presented. First, the problem is investigated from two perspectives, ie, analyzing the role and impact of middleware services and illustrating a set of correlated failures in J2EE standard services as motivating examples. Then, a general coordinated recovery model is constructed with the elements necessary and sufficient for detecting and recovering correlated failures in middleware services. The supporting framework is demonstrated on three J2EE application servers, ie, PKUAS, JBoss and JOnAS, one by one without fundamental modifications. Finally, based on the three enhanced application servers, many cases on J2EE common services, including the transaction service, database service, naming and directory service, security service and messaging service, are studied.

The average annual abundance of planktonic algae increased from hundreds to ten thousands of cells per ml of water. There was a highest biomass in summer and a marked biomass increase of Cyanophyta. The dominance of biomass was Cyanophyta from 1980 to 2006; the change of biomass of Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta was not large. The species of Chlorophyta and Cyanophyta was dominant from 1980 to 2006, then Bacillariophyta. The species of phytoplankton tended to be miniaturized. Based on ecological changes of phytoplankton association as the main parameter, a biological assessment of eutrophication process in Hongfeng Lake at its present stage can be regarded as medium eutrophication\u2014eutrophication\u2014severe eutrophication, The process of pollution was light pollution to \u03b2-middle pollution\u2014medium pollution\u2014heavy pollution from 1980 to 2006.

METHODS: One hundred and five nude mice orthotopically transplanted with MKN-45 human gastric cancer cells were randomly divided into seven groups: untreated group, normal saline-treated group, dissolvant-treated group, cyclophosphamide (CTX)-treated group and high-, medium-, and low-dose Rhizoma kaempferiae volatile oil-treated groups. Corresponding interventions were implemented in each group except the untreated group. The antitumor effects in vivo were evaluated. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis of MKN-45 human gastric cancer cells were determined by using flow cytometry (FCM). The ultrastructure of MKN-45 gastric cancer cells was observed by a transmission electron microscope. RESULTS: In the high-, medium-, and low-dose Rhizoma kaempferiae volatile oil-treated groups, the growth inhibition rates of gastric cancer were 57.2%, 28.0% and 5.0% respectively, and the gastric cancer cells were arrested at G (0)/G (1) phase. This antitumor effect was dose-dependent. The apoptotic cells occurred more frequently in the high-dose Rhizoma kaempferiae volatile oil-treated group and the CTX-treated group than those in the medium-and low-dose Rhizoma kaempferiae volatile oil-treated groups.

The cells were cloned at 18th passage, and then the culture medium was changed into DMEM containing 10% FBS at 21th passage. Cells were cultured in vitro for half and one year and the cell line was named HIOEC-B (a) P. The morphological changes of the cells were observed with differential interference contrast microscope and HE staining. The soft agar colony forming ability and tumorigenicity of the cells in nude mice were identified to confirm the malignant characteristics of HIOEC-B (a) P cells. RESULTS:(1) After HIOEC cells were treated with B (a) P for 6 months, HIOEC-B (a) P cells could grow well in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS and physical concentration of calcium.(2) When HIOEC cells were treated with chemical carcinogens, the morphology of the cells was changed.

Biological control is recommended to be a potential approach. Chlorella ellipsoidea was screened out for analysis of its inhibiting effect on Microcystis growth. Mixed culture of C. ellipsoidea, a strain isolated from waste water, and Microcystis PCC 7806 was carried out to observe competitive growth of two species. Chlorophyll-a/chlorophyll-b ratio was used as an indicator to estimate percentage of C. ellipsoidea in the mixed culture. Results show that C. ellipsoidea grew faster than Microcystis at either 20 or 30\u2103 in BG-11 medium. In water from a Microcystis blooming lake, C. ellipsoidea displayed stronger competitiveness over Microcystis. The same phenomenon was observed under low light intensity. No evidence was found that C. ellipsoidea produced any toxic substance that inhibits Microcystis. To compare two organisms in ability to use nutrients, absorptions of nitrogen and phosphorus were measured. Results show that C. ellipsoidea absorbed more phosphorus obviously than Microcystis in BG-11, although they were the same in nitrogen absorption. When N concentration in BG-11 was reduced to onetenth, a low nitrogen condition, C. ellipsoidea still absorbed more nitrogen and phosphorus than Microcystis, demonstrating that C. ellipsoidea is more capable of absorbing nutrients, thus resulting in the growth inhibition of Microcystis in mixed culture. It is, therefore, feasible to make use of the superiority of C. ellipsoidea in interspecies competition for growth to control Microcystis bloom.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

Later the precipitation of I-phase from Zr-based metallic glass was reported. 7, 8) Recently, it has been found that noble metals promote the formation of I-phase and the nano icosahedral quasicrystal phase can be reproducibly formed as primary phase during the crystallization of the Zr\u2013Al\u2013Cu\u2013Ni\u2013NM (NM= Ag, Pd, Au, Pt) 9, 10) and Zr\u2013Al\u2013Ni\u2013M (M= Pd, Au, Pt) 11) multicomponent glassy alloys.The formation of I-phase during the crystallization of an amorphous alloy provides an experimentally accessible temperature and time window to clarify the nucleation and growth of the I-phase. It has been suggested that there exist icosahedral short-range orders, 12, 13) which influence the precipitation of I-phase. Because of structure heredity, the short-range orders in a glassy alloy inherit from the liquid alloy and the structure of liquid alloy has heredity to the mother ingot. So, the microstructure of the mother ingot will determine the structure and size of the short-range orders and influence the crystallization of the glassy alloys. This work investigates the influence of microstructure of the mother ingot on the precipitation and decomposition of the I-phase during the crystallization of Zr65Al7: 5Ni10Cu12: 5Ag5 glass.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

{"title": "A new method for the simulation of electron diffraction patterns: the algorithm and its application to previous studies\n", "abstract": " The transmission electron microscope (TEM) is an important tool for studies in materials science, capable of providing high resolution images useful for morphological characterization of complex materials. Combined with an energy dispersive x-ray analyzer (EDXA), the TEM can provide information about the microchemical composition of small phases and even show segregation of impurities to an internal boundary. Crystallographic characterization is possible by performing electron diffraction on the small phases observed while operating in the imaging mode. The use of electron diffraction, however, incurs interpretational difficulties when the phases have complex structures or when more than one particle gives rise to overlapping patterns. Three specific difficulties are: indexing of spots when the crystal structure is not simple, determining the orientation of twinned crystals, and determining the orientation relationship between a second phase precipitate and the matrix phase. The paper describes a method for computing the geometry of complex electron diffraction patterns. The program is written in the Turbo Pascal language and can be run on an IBM-PC microcomputer. The utility of the program is illustrated by examining two recently published TEM studies. It is shown that experiments can be misinterpreted unless analysis is accompanied by computer simulation.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy were used to investigate phase transformations in the steel after different treatments. It was revealed that the phase transformations upon quenching were greatly affected by the austenization temperature and time. When the steel was annealed at 950\u00a0\u00b0C, carbides of Cr, Mn and Fe were dissolved dramatically, while carbides of Nb and Ti are relatively stable at this temperature. When the temperature increases to 1100\u00a0\u00b0C, the carbides of Nb were dissolved rapidly, while the carbides of Ti still show somewhat stable (partial dissolution). Annealing time influences both the amount and the shapes of carbides in the steel, which leads to different\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

To enhance the performance of the channel estimation of OFDM systems, the transmission of the OFDM signals is experimentally investigated via different pilot tone arrangements for effective channel estimation. Three types of pilot patterns (comb-type, block-type and incline-type) are used to evaluate the output OFDM signal in terms of error vector magnitude (EVM), based on the most commonly adopted low complexity Least Square (LS) channel estimation algorithm. It has been shown that, the pilot insertion will definitely improve the quality of the transmitted OFDM signals up to 6 dB in EVM. The best channel estimation is obtained by the block-type pilot pattern, which gives nearly 1dB gain in EVM compared with the other two patterns, implying the measured channel\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

The 26S rDNA D1/D2 domain of each strain was amplified by PCR and subjected to SSCP or sequence analysis. RESULTS: SSCP analysis showed that the Candida strains with slight sequence differences in the D1/D2 domain could be effectively detected. The common pathogenic Candida species, including C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata and C. krusei, were clearly distinguished from each other by their SSCP patterns of PCR amplified D1/D2 domain products. Twenty species belonging to 10 genera were identified from the approximately 260 clinical yeast strains based on SSCP pattern comparison for the common species and D1/D2 sequence analysis for the uncommon species. The dominant species and their frequencies were: C. albicans (57.7%), C. parapsilosis (10.0%), C. tropicalis (9.2%), C. glabrata (6.7%) and C. krusei (5.8%). CONCLUSION: The results indicated that PCR-SSCP analysis of D1/D2 is a powerful approach for rapid species identification of clinical yeast strains. The most common clinical yeast species was C. albicans in Beijing but the increasing trend of non-albicans Candida species was observed.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

{"title": "Synchronous variations of precipitation and temperature at Lake Qinghai, NE Tibetan Plateau during the past 800 years and their relations to solar activity: evidence from Li/Ca\u00a0\u2026\n", "abstract": " Variations of precipitation and temperature at Lake Qinghai, NE Tibetan Plateau on decadal scales during the past 800 years were reconstructed based on the oxygen isotope values and Li/Ca ratios from ostracod shells of the single species Eucypris inflata. Higher temperature relates to lower Li/Ca ratios; higher precipitation relates to lower \u03b418O values, and vice versa. The good correlation between Li/Ca ratios and \u03b418O values of ostracod shells indicates that temperature variations corresponded well with precipitation variations on decadal scales during the past 800 years. Variations of precipitation and temperature are synchronous with variations of solar activity reconstructed from the atmospheric 14C concentration in tree rings and the 10Be concentration in ice cores. These findings suggest that, on decadal scales solar activity may be responsible for the synchronous variations of precipitation and temperature at Lake Qinghai, NE Tibetan Plateau during the past 800 years.

Methods Total 73 uterine lesions of 58 patients were proved as 50 malignant and 23 benign. DWI and other sequences were acquired at 1.5 T MR scanner. B value was 0 and 1000. The signal intensity ratio (SIR) and contrast to noise ratio (CNR) of the DWI and T2 images were calculated to evaluate the image quality in demonstrating lesions. The signal intensities were compared between DWI images and T2 images. Signal intensity and ADC values of DWI were compared between malignant and benign groups. Results Of benign tumors, SIR and CNR of DWI were lower than that of T2WI, with statistically significant differences. Of malignant tumors, however, both 2 parameters were higher in DWI than T2WI. All parameters of DWI in malignant group were significantly higher than that of benign. ADC value of malignant tumors was significantly lower than benign ones, but the distribution of ADC value between endometrial adenocarcinomas and cervical squamous cancers had no difference. Conclusion The relatively high signal intensity of the uterine cancers in DWI make the lesions readily and easy to be found. Compared with T2 images, DWI has a stronger ability in highlighting malignant tumors, which is an advantage of DWI in demonstrating lesions.

The aim of this study is to detect the expression of ezrin and E-cadherin and their significance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with tissue microarray technique. METHODS: Ezrin and E-cadherin proteins were detected in 25 cases of benign pulmonary tissues, 287 cases of NSCLC tissues and 120 cases of metastatic lymph nodes by LSAB method of immunohistochemical staining. All patients were followed up. RESULTS: The overexpression rate of ezrin in primary NSCLC tissues and metastatic lymph nodes was 57.8% and 83.3% respectively (P= 0.000). The abnormal expression rate of E-cadherin in primary NSCLC tissues and metastatic lymph nodes was 82.6% and 98.3% respectively (P= 0.000). The overexpression rate of ezrin was significantly related to grading (P= 0.005) and metastasis (P= 0.032). The abnormal expression rate of E-cadherin was closely related to grading (P= 0.024), metastasis (P= 0.015) and TNM stages (P= 0.037).

The phylogenetic relationships of these species belonging to the family Cruciferae were investigated through comparison of the genes. Homologous sequences of SAMDC comparison indicated that the similarities among the genes at nucleotide and amino acid levels were over 87% and 90%, respectively. The differences in genes at nucleotide and amino acid levels between species ranged from 0.2% to 10.1% and 0.3% to 6.6%, respectively, while those between genera except Raphanus were 4.9% to 13.6% and 3.1% to 10.3%, respectively. The differences of sequences of nucleotides and amino acids among genera were higher than those among species, and the differences of nucleotides sequences were higher than those of amino acids. The phylogenetic tree was thus constructed based on the alignment nucleotides sequences from Nei's genetic distances.

{"title": "The Strain Dependence of Post-Deformation Softening during the Hot Deformation of 304H Stainless Steel\n", "abstract": " Experiments were carried out in which the dependence of the fractional softening on temperature, time and strain rate was determined in a 304H stainless steel. Three prestrain ranges were identified pertaining to three different post-deformation softening behaviors: 1) prestraining to below the DRX critical strain: strongly strain dependent softening by SRX alone with softening kinetics controlled by growth rate of the nuclei; 2) prestraining to above the DRX critical strain: SRX + MDRX softening with weaker strain dependence of the kinetics but still controlled by grain growth; 3) at a prestrain of e* and beyond: nucleation-controlled MDRX softening with the full inhibition of SRX. The transition prestrain e* can exceed the peak strain if the DRX grain refinement\u00a0\u00a0ratio g= D0/DDRX > 4. The transition to MDRX-dominated softening can be attributed to a constant value of the normalized strain hardening rate independent of the preloading temperature and strain rate. The softening data from the compression tests show that at e*, the time for half softening t50 exhibits a minimum. These data differ somewhat from observations obtained in the torsion testing of solid bars, in which no strain dependence of t50 was detected at e* and beyond. Whether or not the strain dependence of t50 vanishes in the MDRX range is sensitive to the test method employed to study the post-deformation softening.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

{"title": "Basement membrane and extracellular matrix molecules in the skin\n", "abstract": " Publisher SummaryThe dermal-epidermal basement membrane zone (BMZ) lies at the interface between the epithelium and underlying mesenchymal tissue. It is a highly organized structure with both similarities and differences compared to BMZs present in other tissues. In the skin, the BMZ serves many functions. Its architectural role includes providing stable dermal-epidermal cohesion and mechanical integrity of the skin. It also regulates and serves as a source of ligands/signaling molecules that bind to cellular receptors such as integrins, to influence cellular proliferation, migration, and differentiation. The BMZ of the skin is composed mainly of collagen and laminin networks, connected by proteoglycans/glycosaminoglycans, all of which can undergo degradation/activation by metalloproteinases.

{"title": "Oxygen and angiogenesis\n", "abstract": " Oxygen (O 2), the final electron acceptor in the respiratory chain of oxidative phosphorylation, is absolutely required for most living organisms, including all invertebrates and vertebrates. The delivery of atmospheric O 2 via diffusion to individual cells within a tissue is limited if the organ dimension is more than 3 mm 3 (Dachs and Tozer, 2000). Thus, in insects such as Drosophila, a tracheal (respiratory) system develops to meet the O 2 demand for internal tissues. Although the O 2 delivery system in mammals is far more complicated, consisting of respiratory, cardiac, vascular, and hematopoietic cells, the basic function is similar to that of the insect trachea, to transport O 2. Since these systems were developed to supply O 2, it is logical to state that the availability and concentration of O 2 regulates development of these O 2 delivery systems.

METHODS: The growth inhibition of NB4 cells was measured by MTT test. Apoptosis was determined morphologically by Giemsa stain and by DNA ladder formation in electrophoresis. Quantitation of apoptosis was determined by percentage of PI stained cells containing subdiploid amount of DNA measured by flow cytometry. Generation of reactive oxidative species (ROS) in NB4 cells was determined by lucigenin dependent chemoluminescent (CL) test. Spectrophotometer was used to measure the level of reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase in the cell. RESULTS: Sodium selenite was shown to inhibit the growth of NB4 cells. Sodium selenite induced apoptosis with dose and time dependency: the ratio of subdiploid cells in control group was 1.3%+/-0.7%. The 5 mumol. L-1 group was 10.4%+/-1.4%, 10 mumol. L-1 group was 16%+/-1%, and the 20 mumol. L-1 group was 27.3%+/-0.8%. Sodium selenite (> or= 5 mumol.

{"title": "Endovascular embolization of intracranial aneurysms with self-made tungsten coils in a dog model.\n", "abstract": " OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the embolization effects and the long-term histologic changes, including the ultrastructure of the neoendothelium, in experimental canine aneurysms obliterated with self-made tungsten microcoil. METHODS: Twenty-eight experimental aneurysms were microsurgically created in 14 mongrel dogs by using end-to-side jungular carotid anastomosis. The aneurysms were obliterated with either self-made tungsten microcoil alone or the microcoil plus micro direct current electrocoagulation, with preservation of the parent vessel. The animals were kept in observation. 48 hours, 4 weeks, and 4 months after the embolization of the aneurysms, repeated carotid arteriography was performed to assess the potential recanalization of the aneurysms. The animals were then respectively killed and submitted for autopsy. The carotid artery and the embolized aneurysms were resected and studied with light and electron microscopy. RESULTS: A total of 14 obliterated aneurysms were completely excluded from the parent circulation by an endothelialized layer of connective tissue. The fundus of the aneurysm was completely obliterated by heavy reactive fibrous tissue surrounding the microcoils with very minimal inflammatory reaction. CONCLUSIONS: Tungsten microcoils are a relatively ideal embolic material at present for endovascular treatment of aneurysms. Microcoils plus micro direct current electrocoagulation yield more reliable, accurate, and safer embolic effects than microcoils alone for the obliteration of aneurysms.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

{"title": "The SAX-3 receptor stimulates axon outgrowth and the signal sequence and transmembrane domain are critical for SAX-3 membrane localization in the PDE neuron of C. elegans\n", "abstract": " SAX-3, a receptor for Slit in C. elegans, is well characterized for its function in axonal development. However, the mechanism that regulates the membrane localization of SAX-3 and the role of SAX-3 in axon outgrowth are still elusive. Here we show that SAX-3::GFP caused ectopic axon outgrowth, which could be suppressed by the loss-of-function mutation in unc-73 (a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for small GTPases) and unc-115 (an actin binding protein), suggesting that they might act downstream of SAX-3 in axon outgrowth. We also examined genes related to axon development for their possible involvement in the subcellular localization of SAX-3. We found the unc-51 mutants appeared to accumulate SAX-3::GFP in the neuronal cell body of the posterior deirid (PDE) neuron, indicating that UNC-51 might play a role in SAX-3 membrane localization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the N-terminal signal sequence and the transmembrane domain are essential for the subcellular localization of SAX-3 in the PDE neurons.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

{"title": "Determination of ilaprazole in beagle plasma and its pharmaeokineties by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry\n", "abstract": " A sensitive, simple and specific high performance liquid chromatography-electro spray ionization mass spectrometry method was developed for the determination of ilaprazole in the plasma of beagles administered via iv bolus doses of ilaprazole. The procedure employed buspirone as the internal standard and a simple protein precipitation step. The separation was achieved using a C18 column (100 mm x 2.1 mm, 5 microm) with a mobile phase consisting of water-methanol-acetonitrile (69: 8: 23, v/v/v) containing 0.1%(v/v) formic acid at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. The detection was accomplished by a mass spectrometer using selected ion monitoring (SIM) in positive mode. The linearity was from 5 microg/L to 10,000 microg/L with a sensitivity of 5 microg/L as the lower limit of quantification. The inter-and intra-day precisions were within 9.00%. The mean recoveries at three spiked levels were about 106% and the matrix effects were less than 142.0%. The method described above was successfully applied to analyze the beagle plasma samples of ilaprazole in a pharmacokinetic study. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC (0-infinity) of ilaprazole after iv doses of 0.2, 0.8 and 3.2 mg/kg were (2.4 x 10 (4)+/-3 x 10 (3)),(8.8 x 10 (4)+/-1.6 x 10 (4)) and (5.4 x 10 (5)+/-8 x 10 (4)) microg/L x min, respectively.

It is revealed that no phase transformation occurs in the as-cast/rolled specimen except for localized shear bands, indicating that the material has a good structural stability against plastic deformation. When the glass is pre-annealed in the supercooled liquid region for a short time, however, the stability deteriorates significantly. In this case, rolling deformation results in nanocrystallization in the specimen. The pre-annealed glass has less free volume than the as-cast glass, but it does not exhibit a quicker increase in free volume content during the rolling, suggesting that free volume is prone to annihilate at the crystal/glass interfaces.

From March 2000 to March 2010, 19 patients (23 hips, of them, 4 patients with bilateral hips) with Crowe type IV DDH underwent THA. There were 5 males and 14 females, with average age of 61.3 years (ranged, 41 to 72 years). All hips were treated with small acetabular components combined with medial protrusion technique in acetabular reconstruction, as well as subtrochanteric shortening osteotomy in femur. Joint function of hips were evaluated according to Harris scoring. All patients were followed up with an average of 4.2 years (ranged, 1 to 8 years). Postoperative X-ray films showed all acetabular prosthesis were in true acetabulum. No loosening and nonunion were found in all patients. Harris scoring improved from preoperative 34.0+/-6.9 to postoperative 85.0+/-7.5. Complications occurred in 11 cases in the patients, including femoral split fracture in 3 cases, nerve injury in 3 cases, delayed union in 2 cases, dislocation in 3 cases.

RESULTS Among 319 strains of non-fermentive gram negative bacilli, PAE, ABA and PMA accounted for 49.8%, 30.1% and 10.3%, respectively. The other non-fermenting accounted for 9.7%. The detection rates of pan-drug resistant PAE and ABA were 13.2% and 13.5%, respectively. The susceptibility testing showed that the higher antibiotics resistance to commonly used antibiotics occurred in three non-fermentive strains. The drug resistant rate of ABA was generally higher than that of PAE. CONCLUSION The multi-drug resistance of non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli has been very serious. The effective measures should be adopted to prevent the outbreak and prevalence of nosocomial infections caused by multi-drug resistant strain.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

However, the statistical analysis indicated water content in surface soil was not the only factor influencing the Haloxylon ammodendron seedling mortality. The Haloxylon ammodendron seedling mortality increased dramatically when the water content in surface soil decreased as low as 0.82%, regardless of the degree of air water deficit in air; The Haloxylon ammodendron seedlings could tolerate water deficit in air when the water content in surface soil was higher than 1.25% and the water content in surface soil determined the seedling mortality. There was a significant correlation between Haloxylon ammodendron seedling mortality and water content in air when water content in surface soil was at 0.82%~ 1.25%. It was concluded that water content in air determined the Haloxylon ammodendron seedling mortality when the water content in surface soil was less than 1.25% and water content in surface soil determined the Haloxylon ammodendron seedling mortality when the water content in surface soil was higher than 1.25%.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

METHODS: From January 2000 to June 2008, 165 patients with Crohn disease receiving perioperative nutritional support were included in this retrospective analysis. The patients were divided into three groups according to the ways of nutritional support: total enteral nutrition group, total parenteral nutrition group and combined nutrition group; there were 55 patients in each group. Each group had the same treatment except for nutritional support. The efficacy of different approaches of nutritional support was analyzed and compared among the groups. RESULTS: Compared with total enteral and total parenteral nutrition, combined nutrition supplied more sufficient energy, the nutritional status improved more significant in short time; pre-albumin, transferrin, lymphocytes and platelet count increased significantly. The disease remission rate in combined nutrition group was 80.0%, better than 76.4% in total enteral nutrition group and 74.5% in total parenteral nutrition group. The morbidity rate was 10.9% in combined nutrition group, and it was lower than that in total enteral nutrition group and total parenteral nutrition group (25.4% and 18.2%, respectively). The length of hospital stay was shorter and the treatment was more cost-effective in combined nutrition group.

{"title": "Dynamic Bayesian networks: modeling and analysis of neural signals\n", "abstract": " Description Studying interactions between different brain regions or neural components is crucial in understanding neurological disorders. Dynamic Bayesian networks, a type of statistical graphical model, have been suggested as a promising tool to model neural communication systems. This thesis investigates the employment of dynamic Bayesian networks for analyzing neural connectivity, especially with focus on three topics: structural feature extraction, group analysis, and error control in learning network structures. Extracting interpretable features from experimental data is important for clinical diagnosis and improving experiment design. A framework is designed for discovering structural differences, such as the pattern of sub-networks, between two groups of Bayesian networks. The framework consists of three components: Bayesian network modeling, statistical structure-comparison, and structure-based classification. In a study on stroke using surface electromyography, this method detected several coordination patterns among muscles that could effectively differentiate patients from healthy people. Group analyses are widely conducted in neurological research. However for dynamic Bayesian networks, the performances of different group-analysis methods had not been systematically investigated. To provide guidance on selecting group-analysis methods, three popular methods, ie the virtual-typical-subject, the common-structure and the individual-structure methods, were compared in a study on Parkinson's disease, from the aspects of their statistical goodness-of-fit to the data, and more importantly, their sensitivity in detecting the effect\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

In contrast to typical single ridge in WPSH, double ridges are found during July in 1998 and associated with the second Meiyu activity in the Yangtze River valley. The second ridge of WPSH is built up in the south of the first one and contributes to the stagnancy of WPSH in the south in middle of July. It is different from the previous view that the stagnancy of WPSH in the south resulted from the sudden southward withdrawal of the original ridge.The characteristics of double ridges including the structure, evolution and possible mechanisms are investigated with the case of 1998. The results show that there are a lot of differences in the large-scale circulation, temperature and humidity between the single ridge and double ridges of the WPSH. The north branch of the double ridges has coherent characteristics with the traditional single ridge, while the south branch is characterized by the tropical systems. There are evidences to support that the formation of the double ridges is associated with the northward movement of equatorial buffer zone and the persistence is related to the evolution of tropical convections. The rainfall pattern in eastern China associated with the double ridges of WPSH is examined using the instrumental records of precipitation in China.

{"title": "Adsorption of heavy metal Cd (\u2161) by aerobic granular sludge [J]\n", "abstract": " As a new type of biosorbent, aerobic granule sludge was studied on its adsorption efficiency on Cd2+ in water. The effects of initial Cd2+ concentration, initial sludge concentration, pH value on adsorption were analyzed. The results showed that, Langmuir isotherm equation and Freundlich isotherm equation could both describe the adsorption data very well. When the solution temperature maintained 25\u2103, pH value was 6-7, a good adsorption effect could be obtained. Under the above conditions, when the mass concentration of Cd2+ was 5-150 mg/L, the adsorption time was 4 h, the maximum adsorption capability was 69.7 mg/g, and the maximum removal efficiency reached 95.9%. It can draw a conclusion that, granular sludge is an effective and economic biosorbent for Cd2+-containing wastewater treatment.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

METHODS: Adenoviral constructs incorporating hHCN4 and green fluorescent protein (GFP) were subepicardially injected into the rats' left ventricular wall in situ (n= 10). Control group was injected with adenoviral constructs of GFP alone (n= 10). ECGs were recorded every day within the initial three days after operation. Up to seven days after injection, all rats were anesthetized and subjected to cervical vagal trunks stimulation to permit the emergence of escape rhythm. Then pace-mapping was performed by the hand-hold electrode. Finally, hearts were removed for histology and immunofluorescence study. RESULTS: Ventricular arrhythmic events were not found during the first three days. During vagal stimulation, the rate of spontaneous rhythm in the hHCN4-injected group was significantly more rapid than that in the control group (69 bpm+/-6 bpm vs 41 bpm+/-10 bpm, P< 0.001). Pace-mapping confirmed the escape rhythm in the hHCN4-injected group was originated near the injection site. Immunofluorescence study showed the overexpression of hHCN4 on the site of injection. However, the duration of hHCN overexpression was no more than one month after injection.

Based on the in-deep research on inductive learning theory, a rule learning algorithm is applied in building the intrusion detection model. For the case of detection precision's decline when lacking audit training data, an efficient approach to intrusion detection is proposed based on boosting rule learning (EAIDBRL). In EAIDBRL, firstly, weights of sample data in the traditional Boosting algorithm are adjusted separately within each class without changing overall class weights to eliminate deterioration in generation performance on some intrusion detection datasets; secondly, the evaluating criteria for rule growing and rule pruning of the traditional rule-learning algorithm are modified; and lastly this improved boosting algorithm is adopted to enhance generalization performance of weak rule learner on the network audit dataset. The results of experiments on the standard intrusion detection dataset indicate that EAIDBRL indeed can improve detection performance of the intrusion detection model built with the traditional rule learning algorithm.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

{"title": "Extracellular matrix and wound healing\n", "abstract": " The extracellular matrix (ECM) components play important roles in every step of wound healing processes by providing both scaffold support and signaling roles. They promote cell adhesion and migration during wound repair. They mediate the interactions between cells, cells and matrices, as well as matrix proteins. They also serve as reservoir and modulator for growth factors. For example, shortly after tissue injury, in\ufb02ammatory cells need to interact with and migrate through the basement membrane ECM of the blood vessels to come to the site of the injury. During the reepithelialization, the ECM provides tracks and signals for epithelial keratinocytes to migrate on the wound surface matrix and reestablish the skin cover. ECM proteins play critical roles in the granulation tissue formation, including angiogenesis and matrix formation, which contribute to the reestablishment of dermis. Most remarkably, the formation of functional basement membrane in dermal\u2013epidermal junction, by ECM protein interactions, is essential for connecting epidermis to dermis and is crucial to restore the integrity and function of the skin.For past decade, there has been enormous progress that has shed light on the structural and biological functions of these ECM components.

In this study for facilitating the identification of the gene responsible for SFMS, the additional markers were analyzed to narrow down the candidate region, and four candidate genes (GPC3, MST4, GPCR2 and GLUD2) were chosen and screened for disease-causing mutation. METHODS: PCR and denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were used to genotype 13 new polymorphic markers distributed within the candidate region. Mutation detection was accomplished by sequencing the exons and intron-exon junctions of the candidate genes. RESULTS: By analyzing 13 additional polymorphic markers, SFMS candidate region can be reduced to an interval of 10.18 Mb bounded by XSTR3 and XSTR4, and no disease-causing mutation was identified in the coding regions of four candidate genes. CONCLUSION: GPCR2 GPC3, MST4 and GLUD2 were excluded as pathogenic genes for SFMS. The refined SFMS locus will assist in the identification and characterization of other candidate genes for SFMS.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1023"]}
{"title": "An efficient method of group rekeying for multicast communication\n", "abstract": " Key management for large dynamic groups is all the way a difficult problem because of scalability and security. This paper presents a new method for key management for group communication, which inherits the model of the logical key tree algorithm but implements group rekeying through one-way function together with random number and the old keys. Compared with the previous schemes, such as logical key hierarchy (LKH) and one-way function tree (OFT), the proposed method is more efficient while secure against arbitrary collusion attacks.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

{"title": "A design for testability technique for low power delay fault testing\n", "abstract": " This paper presents a Quiet-Noisy scan technique for low power delay fault testing. The novel scan cell design provides both the quiet and noisy scan modes. The toggling of scan cell outputs is suppressed in the quiet scan mode so the power is saved. Two-pattern tests are applied in the noisy scan mode so the delay fault testing is possible. The experimental data shows that the Quiet-Noisy scan technique effectively reduces the test power to 56% of that of the regular scan. The transition fault coverage is improved by 19.7% compared to an existing toggle suppression low power technique. The presented technique requires very minimal changes in the existing MUX-scan Design For Testability (DFT) methodology and needs virtually no computation. The penalties are area overhead, speed degradation, and one extra control in test mode.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

The number of young-aged individuals was larger, and that of middle-aged and old individuals was smaller. The life tables for different age classes showed that the mortality at age classes I and II was the highest, and the mortality rate was decreased with increasing age. However, at age classes VII and VIII, the mortality rose again for their decrepitude. The expected life span of age classes III, IV and V was higher, and decreased gradually with increasing age. The survival curves were the type of Deevey III, and the distribution pattern of population was aggregative as a whole. As the age increased, the intensity of aggregation decreased, and tended to a random distribution at higher elevations. A wise management should accelerate the recovery of Q. variabilis population and the enhancement of its productivity. The altitude 800-1,100 m was the favorable habitat for Q. variabilis population. As for the Q. variabilis at lower altitude, its protection should be reinforced, and the disturbance from human beings should be reduced. Forest thinning and other fostering management at middle altitude should be given in time. The target trees at higher altitude should be fostered.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

{"title": "A novel clustering-based method to network intrusion detection.\n", "abstract": " Researchers have developed two general categories of intrusion detection, i.e. misuse detection and anomaly detection, which differ at model construction. The signature-based misuse detection can detect the well-known attacks but do nothing when new attack comes. Even the traditional anomaly detection can catch some new attacks, and the learning process overly relying on the training data sets, which contain either purely clean normal data or correctly labeled data, makes it useless in most cases. To solve such a problem, a novel clustering-based method, capable of processing training data sets without type label and/or of containing unknown intrusion data, is presented.

A custom-made distractor was used to lengthen the mandible at a rate of 1 mm/day for 10 days (total 10 mm elongation). Four goats were sampled respectively at 2, 4 and 8 weeks after completion of distraction. The lengthening mandibles were examined by roentgenography and histology. RESULTS: Newly formed callus was observed in the distraction gap after mandibular lengthening. The new bone exhibited intramembranous ossification generally, but cartilage islands could be found in the specimen that distractor loosed. CONCLUSION: The above findings indicate that the mode of new bone formation in mandibular lengthening following distraction osteogenesis appears to be intramembranous ossification and that endochondral ossification takes place in case distractor has loosened.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

METHODS: After intrasplenic immunization of Balb/c mouse with TFPI, hybridoma technique was used to raise monoclonal antibody against rhTFPI. The McAb was well-characterized and labelled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) by using assay of TFPI in ELISA. Furthermore, the McAb was added to normal and factor IX deficient plasma for observation of dilute PT and APTT. RESULTS: Two hybridomas (4F4, 4F8) secreting McAb against TFPI were established. The Ig class and subclass of the McAb purified from 4F8 was IgG1. Immunoblotting results indicated that the McAb4F8 only recognized a single band of TFPI with molecular weight of 34.8 KD. The results of Sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) by using the HRP labelled McAb4F8 showed that the mean of TFPI in normal human plasma is 103.2+/-11.5 micrograms/L.

The thin films with the different amount of the cubic phase, from about 0.7% to 1.5%, were selected for studying the influence of the cubic phase on the mobility. The results show that the change of the mobility with the amount of the cubic phase is non-linear, but dome-shaped. This interesting result demonstrates that the influence of the cubic phase on the property of the hexagonal GaN thin film is complicated.

{"title": "Observations of grain boundary structure in [alpha]-Ti\n", "abstract": " Interfacial structure can make very important contributions to the mechanical and physical properties of polycrystalline metals. This has been recognized for many years, and the structure of grain boundaries has been studied extensively in cubic metals over the past several years by means of high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) as well as atomic computer simulations. Although hexagonal close-packed (hcp) metals also hold a very important role in metal materials, unfortunately, there have been relatively few experimental investigations of the grain boundaries in hcp metals at the atomic scale. Thus in this particular field, electron diffraction contrast images and computer simulations have always been the dominant methods (4, 5, 6). The geometrical analysis seems to be more complicated for hexagonal materials than for cubic materials because the formation of three dimensional CSLs (Coincidence Site Lattices) is generally forbidden where the square of the axial ratio is an irrational fraction. The authors address this issue in the present work by presenting results of HRTEM investigations of grain boundaries in [alpha]-Ti, which will provide experimental evidence for theoretical calculations and computer simulations of the grain boundary structure in [alpha]-Ti.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

{"title": "An image quality metric based on biologically inspired feature model\n", "abstract": " Objective image quality assessment (IQA) metrics have been widely applied to imaging systems to preserve and enhance the perceptual quality of images being processed and transmitted. In this paper, we present a novel IQA metric based on biologically inspired feature model (BIFM) and structural similarity index (SSIM). The SSIM index map is first generated through the well-known IQA metric SSIM between the reference image and the distorted image. Then, saliency map of the distorted image is extracted via BIF to define the most salient image locations. Finally, according to the saliency map, a feature weighting model is employed to define the different weights for the different samples in the SSIM index map. Experimental results confirm that the proposed IQA metric improves the performance over PSNR and SSIM under various distortion types in terms of different evaluation criteria.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

In this paper, experimental results of dummy poly silicon gate removal using TetraMethyl Ammonium Hydroxide (TMAH) chemical etching are presented. The preliminary results show that the poly silicon removal rate was highly sensitive to the wet etch conditions. By optimizing the wet etch conditions, high selectivity of poly silicon with respect to SiO2, Si3N4 and hafnium silicon oxynitride (HfSiON) was obtained. A gate trench of critical dimension (CD) of about 70 nm without poly silicon residue was fabricated using optimized conditions.

{"title": "Improving the reliability of transit service: Stochastic modeling of holding strategies\n", "abstract": " Improving the reliability of transit services is becoming a major concern for most operators. Holding vehicles at holding points, as a common operational strategy, can improve headway regularity and schedule punctuality, resulting in shorter waiting time at stops. But it will also add additional idle for passengers on board. Therefore, an optimal compromise has to be found by minimizing generalized costs, combining both waiting time and on-board time. Previous works on this topic only take mean waiting time into account. Important waiting time components like potential waiting time (also called buffer waiting time) are missing in the objective function. Furthermore, the proposed models are constrained to short headway routes. Waiting for services with long headways is not adequately modeled. The aim of this paper is to overcome these two noticeable limitations by modeling the holding problem with probability distribution functions for the actual times of vehicle arrivals and departures. The availability of automatic vehicle location (AVL) data at a growing number of transit agencies makes this stochastic approach practically feasible. The optimization problem is formulated for and solved by a heuristic algorithm. A hypothetical numerical example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed stochastic modeling approach and the heuristic algorithm.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

Effects of initial pH value and temperature on Cr (VI) adsorption were studied, adsorption capacity was tested with the help of kinetic models and adsorption isotherms, instruments of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were used to check characteristics and adsorption mechanism of Cr (VI). The results indicated that optimal removing rate was achieved at initial pH value 5, and pH values of aqueous solution changed little be fore and after adsorption process. The adsorbent of rice husk ash could remove Cr (VI) effectively, and the maximum removing rate could be 95% with Cr (VI) concentration 20 mg x L (-1) and achieve 1-2 level of state standard (GB8978-1996). The adsorption process fits pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm better, the maximum adsorption capacity of Cr (VI) was 3.2776 mg xg (-1). Results of FTIR showed that amide II band, Si--O--Si, O--Si--O were important for Cr (VI) removal.

The influence of different edge distances and spacings on the failure form, shearing strength and ultimate displacement is taken into account by the whole variety test of failure load and the results of finite element. The results indicate that the edge distance has impact on the failure form and displacement of chemical anchor bolt anchorage group under load. Brittle fracture may occur under the condition of small edge distance while ductile fracture may occur under the condition of large edge distance. In addition, the spacing has impact on the interaction of chemical anchor bolts. The test indicates that the stress generated by the interaction of anchors with small spacing will result in the propagation of crack along the depth of anchor. When the stress generated with the row of anchor bolts is independent of each other under the condition of large spacing, cracks form two separate concrete wedges. Comparison of the test data with finite element analysis result shows that the equation provided by the related code is reliable in shearing strength.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

{"title": "Stochastic Simulation of Hydraulic Conductivity Fields using non-Gaussian Dependence\n", "abstract": " The flow and transport behavior in the subsurface is considerably influenced by the heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity fields. The uncertainties in the field characterization of hydraulic conductivities propagate through the flow and transport equations to the output variables. Therefore the stochastic simulations of hydraulic conductivity fields which resemble the real spatial variations play an important role in flow and transport estimations. However, spatial simulations are often carried out for log-conductivity values assuming a multivariate normal distribution, which implies the minimal spatial correlation of extreme values. This assumption is in contradiction with many geological settings, eg channels or flow barriers, which are crucial to flow and transport behaviour. Recently, a few advances have been made in simulation approaches of generating multivariate non-Gaussian realizations, such as the sequential\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

The transfected MSCs were seeded on bovine cancellous bone scaffolds (BCB) to construct gene modified tissue engineering bone (GMB). The bilateral rabbits radial defects (2.5 cm long) were created as animal model. The rabbits were divided into five groups to reconstruct the defects with CMB combined with vascularized periosteum (group A); or GMB combined with vascular bundle implantation (group B); or GMB combined with free periosteum (group C); or GMB only (group D); or BCB scaffolds only (group E). Angiogenesis and osteogenesis were observed by X-ray, histological examination, biomechanical analysis and capillary ink infusion. RESULTS: In group A, the grafted GMB was revascularized rapidly. The defect was completely reconstructed at 8 weeks. The mechanism included both intramemerbrane and endochondral ossification. In group B, the vascular bundle generated new blood vessels into the grafted GMB, but the osteogenesis process was slow in the central zone, which healed completely at 12 weeks. In group C, the free graft of periosteum took at 4 weeks with angiogenesis. The thin extremal callus was formed at 8 weeks and the repairing process almost finished at 12 weeks.

METHODS: Serum citrulline concentration was determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in SBS patients (n= 22) and healthy controls (n= 33). In SBS patients, the remnant small bowel lengths and diameters were measured by radiography, and their 5-hour urine D-xylose excretion and intestinal protein absorption were also determined. The correlationship of serum citrulline level with remnant small bowel length, surface area, protein and D-xylose absorption was analyzed. The 6 patients receiving intestinal rehabilitative therapy, serum citrulline level, protein and D-xylose absorption after therapy were also measured. RESULTS: Serum citrulline level of SBS patients was significantly lower than that of healthy controls [(5.94+/-2.65) vs [(16.87+/-5.97) micromol/L, P< 0.01]. In SBS patients, serum citrulline was positively correlated with remnant small bowel length and surface area (r= 0.82 and r= 0.86 respectively). There was also a significant correlationship of serum citrulline level with 5-hour D-xylose excretion (r= 0.56) and intestinal protein absorption (r= 0.48).

The anti-tumor effects of the mfVII-SEA chimeric protein were evaluated. METHODS: Fusion of SEA and mfVII cDNA was constructed using adenovirus vector and produced in 293 packaging cell lines. The 293 cells containing the adenovirus were administered subcutaneously to mice. Fluorescence studies at the injection site and the liver were performed 3 days later. Mouse prostatic tumor RM-1 cells and mouse sarcoma MCA 205 H12 cell lines were then used in mice to create lung metastasis and subcutaneous tumor to carry out efficacy evaluation, respectively. RESULTS: Adenovirus released from the injected 293 cells only infected the subcutaneous tissue at the injection site. The in vivo experiments in mice revealed that formation of lung metastasis was strongly inhibited by the mfVII-SEA (23+/-8) compared to the vacant vector control group (193+/-38) and PBS control group (211+/-42)(P< 0.01). The mfVII-SEA also strongly suppressed tumor growth at the subcutaneous injection site (342.6+/-107.1) mm (3) compared to that of vacant vector control (2244.3+/-350) mm (3) and SEA (1208.3+/-210) mm (3) by the 23rd day.

METHODS: The mossy fiber sprouting and synapse formation were observed in rats after the acute status epileticus and chronic spontaneous temporal lobe epilepsy induced by pilocarpine using in situ hybridization of GAP-43 mRNA (a marker of MFS), an immunohistochemical staining of synaptophysin (P38, a marker of synaptogenes), and Neo-Timm staining. RESULTS: In hippocampus granule cell, there was a significant increase in the GAP-43mRNA levels measured 6-12 h after the end of status epileticus induced by pilocarpine. In contrast, synaptophysin immunoreactivity progressively increased in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus from 7 d, which was in line with the Neo-Timm stain results that revealed a time-dependent growth of aberrant MFS into the dentate inner molecular layer. The GAP-43 mRNA levels in pilocarpine treated animals were significantly decreased after status epileticus.

METHODS: Forty children with severe PH (increased total pulmonary circulation resistance) due to VSD were divided into two groups based on age at operation (Group I aged less than 2 years and group II more than 2 years). The hemodynamic parameter follow-up was measured by cardiac catheterization at presurgery, one week after surgery and 5-7 years postoperatively. RESULTS: The ratio of pulmonary arterial pressure and systemic arterial pressure (pp/ps), pulmonary resistance and systemic resistance (R (p)/R (s)), and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and small pulmonary arterial resistance (PAR) were significantly different in two groups (P< 0.01). During follow-up in the group less than 2 years, all the hemodynamic parameters were at normal level, while in the group more than 2 years, only p (p)/p (s) and R (p)/R (s) were close to normal level. The pulmonary arterial resistance was still abnormal. CONCLUSION: An early operation may be the only way to gain optimal long term result of surgery and decrease the incidence of pulmonary vascular disease in children with PH due to VSD.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

Experimental results for transmission through a circular aperture.\n", "abstract": " To perform an analysis of the hazards associated with scanned laser radiation to determine compliance with either federal or user standards, it is usually necessary to determine the amount of energy entering a specified aperture. A mathematical model has recently been developed that may simplify the hazard analysis. Experimental data and the mathematical model were compared for stationary and scanning Gaussian laser beams transmitted through a stationary 7-mm-diameter circular aperture, representing the dilated pupil of the human eye. Data were obtained for three values of laser beam diameter. The data and the mathematical model were found to agree within the estimated experimental error when the laser beam was concentric with the aperture, the situation typically encountered in compliance measurements. For two of the three laser beam diameters studied, as the eccentricity of the laser beam with respect to the center of the aperture was increased, the difference between the data and the mathematical model was found to increase. At the higher degrees of eccentricity, the percentage errors were shown to be highly sensitive to the errors in the determination of relative position.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

It was more difficult to wash out the inhibitory effect of Ber-HCl on Isi. In the initial stage of the experiment, Ber-HCl 72 mumol/L and 365 mumol/L greatly improved the influx of extracellular Ca2+ and increased the amplitude of Isi. As the drug perfusion was prolonged, however, Ber-HCl dramatically blocked Ca2+ channels and decreased the influx of extracellular Ca2+ consequently, Isi was reduced in amplitude and later disappeared.

Testing of several climate variables-monthly average temperature, monthly average maximum and minimum temperature, as well as monthly precipitation-indicated that the population size of the Oriental white stork in the PLNNR was 1,340\u00b1178 ind., with significant linear increase and drastic annual fluctuation. Every single year, the population size only significantly correlated with the average minimum temperature of Nov. In theory, the low temperature of Nov. could drive individuals to choose other wetlands in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, instead of the Poyang Lake as wintering habitats. Meanwhile, temperatures in wintering areas also showed a carry-over effect on subsequent population size. Temperatures in primary stage and later stage of wintering period were significantly correlated with population size 2-9 years later, while the temperature of Oct. was highly significantly correlated with population size 2-5 years after. Temperatures of Feb. and Mar. in the later stage of wintering period were highly significantly correlated with population size of 8 and 3 years after, respectively. Moreover, the stepwise linear regression result showed that the average maximum temperature of Oct. and average maximum temperature of Mar. 2 years ago, as well as the average maximum temperature of Oct. and the average temperature of Mar. 4 years ago were significant predictor factors of the population size\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

Transport properties of the FETs are investigated using noise spectroscopy before and after low-dose gamma irradiation treatment (10 6  rad). A strong generation-recombination (GR) noise component observed before the treatment is used to identify several charge traps of two dielectric layers by their activation energy. In spite of reduced flicker noise level after gamma irradiation, the GR noise component almost disappears in the spectra after treatment. This indicates the reduction in the number of charge traps. We study the influence of the Schottky barriers at the metal-nanotube interface on the properties of FETs by analyzing the flicker noise component and identified the regime where the contact contribution is\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

{"title": "Evolutionary ruin and stochastic recreate: A case study on the exam timetabling problem\n", "abstract": " This paper presents a new class of intelligent systems, called Evolutionary Ruin and Stochastic Recreate, that can learn and adapt to the changing enviroment. It improves the original Ruin and Recreate principle\u2019s performance by incorporating an Evolutionary Ruin step which implements evolution within a single solution. In the proposed approach, a cycle of Solution Decomposition, Evolutionary Ruin and Stochastic Recreate continues until stopping conditions are reached. The Solution Decomposition step first uses some domain knowledge to break a solution down into its components and assign a score to each. The Evolutionary Ruin step then applies two operators (namely Selection and Mutation) to destroy a certain fraction of the entire solution. After the above steps, an input solution becomes partial and thus the resulting partial solution needs to be repaired. The repair is carried out by using the Stochastic Recreate step to reintroduce the removed items in a specific way (somewhat stochastic in order to have a better chance to jump out of the local optima), and then ask the underlying improvement heuristic whether this move will be accepted. These three steps are executed in sequence until a specific stopping condition is reached. Therefore, optimisation is achieved by solution disruption, iterative improvement and a stochastic constructive repair process performed within. Encouraging experimental results on exam timetabling problems are reported.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

The highly conserved N-terminal domain contains an ATP binding cleft and thus is responsible for the catalytic activity of Hsp90. In order to further study the function and structure of Hsp90, the N-terminal of the human Hsp90 was cocrystallized with AMPPNP and ATP\u03b3S. The cocrystallization experiments were carried out at 277K using the hanging drop vapor-diffusion method, X-ray diffraction data were collected on beamline 17U at the SSRF and the structures were solved by molecular replacement. The densities of the two nucleotides were captured and the interactions between Hsp90N and nucleotides were clearly described. We confirmed that the \u03b3-phosphate of ATP\u03b3S was not hydrolyzed by Hsp90N. The position of S1 and ATP lid in human Hsp90N-AMPPNP differs significantly from that of the structure of yeast Hsp90-AMPPNP. By analyzing the structure of human Hsp90N-AMPPNP, we found that the interactions of E18-K100 and N40-D127 block the moving of S1 and ATP lid, and then prevent the dimerization of Hsp90N.

The cross-junction-loaded hole at the  input side acts as a reflector with the capability of providing a suitable reflection for the 3rd harmonic and improving the output power; it also maintains a good pass-band performance at the fundamental frequency f 0. The slotline-based DGS functions as a frequency selector  and diminishes unwanted harmonic components at f 0, 2f 0, 4f 0, and 5f 0 while only passing the desirable multiplied frequency component (3f 0). With proper DC bias conditions, results from measurements indicate  that the developed tripler achieves an approximate conversion gain of 0.9 dB at 3f 0 under an optimal input power of 2 dBm.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

Little is known about the impact of glucocorticoid on antizyme expression in the regenerating liver. In this paper, the effect of corticosterone on the gene expression of antizyme 1 in early regenerating rat liver induced by partial hepatectomy (PH) was investigated.Materials and methods: Bilateral adrenalectomies (ADX) were performed 3 days before PH. Corticosterone in sesame oil or sesame oil was injected sub-cutaneously to ADX rats. Antizyme 1 mRNA and protein levels as well as polyamine contents in the regenerating liver were determined by RT-PCR, Western blotting and HPLC, respectively.Results: Antizyme 1 protein content in the oil-treated ADX group decreased significantly at 5, 7 and 9 h after PH compared to control. Following corticosterone administration the content rose dose-dependently during the whole experiment. At 5 h post-PH, the protein levels in 10 and 40 mg/kg corticosterone-treated ADX rats increased by 66% and 148%, respectively, when compared with the control group. However, no significant changes in antizyme 1 mRNA levels were observed in oil-treated ADX rats or corticosterone-treated groups compared to control. Polyamine contents in oil-treated ADX rats were the highest among all groups at 5 and 9 h. Corticosterone treatment resulted in a dramatic decrease of polyamine contents at most of the time points investigated when compared with those in control rats.Conclusions: Corticosterone treatment induces antizyme 1 pro-tein synthesis in early regenerating rat liver.

METHODS: A total of 153 AS cases fulfilling the 1984 modified New York diagnostic criteria were reviewed. All patients received radiological evolution at baseline and during a follow-up period. Radiological progression, clinical remission and life quality were recorded and analyzed for their relations. RESULTS: The radiological assessments of mSASSS (modified Stoke ankylosing spondylitis spine score) were recorded at baseline, 3, 6 & 12 months after treatment. Life quality assessments were recorded with SF (short-form)-36 simultaneously. No significant radiological improvement was observed at the end points. However, most patients reported a significant improvement of life quality after a combination therapy of etanercept/MTX. BASDAI (Bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index), C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate demonstrated similar trends. With no relevance with mSASSS, life quality was significantly correlated with disease activity and pain control.

{"title": "Two-level evolutionary approach to the survivable mesh-based transport network topological design\n", "abstract": " The complete topology design problem of survivable mesh-based transport networks is to address simultaneously design of network topology, working path routing, and spare capacity allocation based on span-restoration. Each constituent problem in the complete design problem could be formulated as an Integer Programming (IP) and is proved to be   -hard. Due to a large amount of decision variables and constraints involved in the IP formulation, to solve the problem directly by exact algorithms (e.g. branch-and-bound) would be impractical if not impossible. In this paper, we present a two-level evolutionary approach to address the complete topology design problem. In the low-level, two parameterized greedy heuristics are developed to jointly construct feasible solutions (i.e., closed graph topologies satisfying all the mesh-based network survivable constraints) of the complete problem.

Because the changes of the coefficients in detail scale layers keep energy conservation in the ridge domain, the secret message can be inserted through blocks energy quantization. The steganography algorithm is blind to extraction and robust to common attacks, especially to JPEG.

{"title": "Anatomic study on the mechanism of tear trough deformity and palpbromalar groove deformity\n", "abstract": " OBJECTIVE: To study the anatomic mechanism of tear trough deformity and palabromalar groove deformity. METHODS: Six cadavers (12 sides, 3 male, 3 female, an average age of 67.2 years) with tear trough deformity and palpbromalar groove deformity underwent lower eyelid and periorbital area dissection. RESULTS: Tear trough deformity and palabromalar groove deformity locate at the junction of thin eyelid skin and thick cheek skin. Skin is closely attached to the orbicularis oculi muscle. The superior horder of the malar fat pad covers the junction of the palpebral and orbital portions of the orbicularis muscle, and does not descend with malar fat pad, which is also corresponded to the location of tear trough and palphromalar groove. The gap between the orbicularis oculi muscle and the levator labii superioris alaeque nasi muscle is not correspond to tear trough. The orbicularis retaining ligament arises from the orbital rim and ends at the junction of the palpebral and orbital portions of the orbicularis muscle, and the ligament connects with the deep part of the orbicularis muscle which directly attaches to the infraorbital rim. Suborbicular oculi fat pads locate at the inferolateral of the orbital region, thin and flabby. Orbital septal arises from the infraorbital rim, and the orbital fat extrudes anteriorly and inferiorly. CONCLUSIONS: Tear trough deformity and palabromalar groove deformity are resulted from combination of age-related relaxation, atrophy and ptosis of layers of tissues. The orbital septal and the orbicularis retaining ligament prevent tissues from descending, which makes tear trough deformity and palabromalar groove deformity more visible.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

{"title": "Dependence patterns associated with the fundamental diagram: a copula function approach\n", "abstract": " Randomness plays a major role in the interpretation of many interesting traffic flow phenomena, such as hysteresis, capacity drop and spontaneous breakdown. The analysis of the uncertainty and reliability of traffic systems is directly associated with their random characteristics. Therefore, it is beneficial to understand the distributional properties of traffic variables. This paper focuses on the dependence relation between traffic flow density and traffic speed, which constitute the fundamental diagram (FD). The traditional model of the FD is obtained essentially through curve fitting. We use the copula function as the basic toolkit and provide a novel approach for identifying the distributional patterns associated with the FD. In particular, we construct a rule-of-thumb nonparametric copula function, which in general avoids the mis-specification risk of parametric approaches and is more efficient in practice.

The adsorption isotherm for Witconol NP-100 on thiram and carbofuran was of the Langmuir type. Adsorption of Witconol NP-100 on pesticide particles decreased with increasing concentrations of the anionic surfactant, Morwet D-425, and increased at higher temperatures. Addition of bentonite increased the total adsorption but also increased the quantity of surfactant required. A storage experiment at temperature of 54\u2103 indicated that addition of 10g/l nonionic surfactant so as to obtain saturation absorbance can significantly improved FSC stability. The delamination ratio was 5% only. We infer that a stabile FSC can be obtained only when the surfactant forms an intact layer on the pesticide particles.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

P-\u0394 effect will cause second order forces and displacements in bridge piers, which is well solved in the elastic range, but under seismic action this problem is still not maturely studied. Based on the evaluation of current approaches to consider P-\u0394 effect in seismic analysis and design, a set of nonlinear time history analysis of bridge pier systems considering P-\u0394 effects is conducted in this paper, and the formulas of displacement amplification factor and strength increase coefficient due to P-\u0394 effect is proposed by a regression approach. The results show that, the influences of P-\u0394 effect in inelastic range differ largely from those in elastic range. This reveals the inappropriateness of simply extending elastic design approaches to inelastic range. The displacement amplification factor and strength increase coefficient predicted by all the current theories are less than statistics mean within allowed engineering stability index. Formulas proposed in this paper coincide well with statistical curves, making them suitable to be used within the frame of performance-based seismic design.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

The aspect of the newly created face is taken into account and the position of the newly created vertex is obtained by solving an over-determined system of linear equations with respect to the aspect ratios of the newly created faces; thereupon the simplified mesh quality is improved.

In this paper, we propose a limited feedback scheme to improve the bit error rate (BER) performance of the randomized STBC scheme. Simulation results reveal that the proposed feedback scheme can achieve almost the same BER performance as the centralized STBC scheme in some channel conditions.

The phases and dry sliding wear behavior were studied. The results show that Fe3Al bulk materials are mainly characterized by the low ordered B2 structure. The wear resistance increased with increasing Al content, with the lowest volume loss of Fe-32Al and irregular value of Fe-30Al. There were obvious differences in wear mechanisms of sintered Fe3Al under different testing conditions. Under lower loads plastic deformation occurred on the wear surface and the wear performance is mainly particle abrasion, the characteristics of which are micro cutting and furrows. With higher loads, the stress concentration led to rapid crack propagation and eventually the fatigue fracture, which was characterized by brittle split of material.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

First, two levels of statistical adaptive oriented projection methods based on the high brightness property of the pedestrian pixels are used to locate the Regions of Interest (ROI) and eliminate the\" shadow\" phenomenon caused by one level oriented projection method. Then the method combines the pedestrian's shape-dependent and shape-independent features (including shape's morphological feature, inertia-based feature and histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) feature) to describe the ROI in the round.

For different combining ways of the portable 3D laser scanner and the robot, a new calibration approach for determining the pose of the scanner and the robot is proposed. By using a criterion sphere with known diameters as calibration tool, the rotation matrix and translation vector of the 3D laser scanner relative to the robot can be determined by fitting the circle produced by the cross of laser line and sphere and fitting the whole scanning data of sphere, respectively. Therefore, the 3D laser scanner can cooperate with the robot to acquire the 3D information of object\u2019s surface. Meanwhile, the scanning data obtained by using this robot-3D scanner system can be used for industrial machining, which can realize the integration of on-line measurement and machining procedures.

RESULTS: The standard deviations of systematic errors (Sigma) were 1.13 mm, 1.47 mm, and 1.31 mm in X (medio-lateral), Y (antero-posterior) and Z (cranio-caudal) axes, respectively; the standard deviations of random errors were 0.81 mm, 0.45 mm, and 0.80 mm in X, Y, and Z axes, respectively. Without consideration of organ motion, the sizes of M (PTV) were 3.40 mm, 3.98 mm, and 3.83 mm in X, Y, and Z axes, respectively; with consideration of organ motion, the sizes of M (PTV) were 3.75 mm, 4.35 mm, and 4.16 mm in X, Y, and Z axes, respectively. CONCLUSION: Using the\" occlusal splint method\", each institution can precisely calculate setup error data, and stipulate the size of M (PTV) adequate to one's own situation.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1023"]}
{"title": "The Prevalence and Clinical Features of Inpatients with Diabetes [J]\n", "abstract": " Objective The aim of present survey was to investigate the prevalence and clinical features of diabetes, and to evaluate the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in diabetes screening in inpatients. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among the inpatients registered in Guangdong Provincial People's Hospitals during Nov. 7-12, 2004. FPG levels of first screening when they were hospitalized were recorded. OGTT and HbA1c were measured on the subjects not having been previously diagnosed as diabetes (pDM), but with FPG from 5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L. Diabetes and IGR were classified according to the suggestion of ADA in 2004. Results Totally 1 641 inpatients were screened, the diabetes prevalence was 10.66%, and newly diagnosed diabetes (nDM) was 40.57% in all diabetes. There were 71.43% diabetes and IGR in all OGTT inpatients. 41.34% pDM inpatients were registered in the Dept. of Cardiology and Neurology, while only 11.54% in the Dept. of General Surgery, and 23.08% with CHD, 68.75% with hypertension, 77.17% with dyslipidemia. Inversely, there were 61.98% nDM patients registered in General Internal Medicine (excluding the Dept. of Cardiology, Neurology and Endocrinology) and General Surgery. If screening criteria were FPG\u2265 6.1 mmol/L, 37.69% diabetes and IGR would miss diagnosis. The waist, waist/height ratio and blood pressure significantly increased in nDM, but not BMI, compared with normal OGTT inpatients. Conclusions The prevalence of diabetes was more than 10% among the inpatients investigated. Inpatients with diabetes mostly complicated with vascular diseases.

The dynamics of different operational and evaluating indices during the treatment process are discussed, such as water content, temperature, pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and germination index (GI) and so on. It is concluded that the water content of materials, temperature, DOC and GI can be interpreted as the evaluating indices of the maturation of MSS. Under optimized condition, when the water content of initial materials was adjusted to 60%+/-2% with appropriate sawdust and recycled materials, the results indicated that the temperature of composting materials could reach> 55 degrees C rapidly and last 4 days, thus 100% of the pathogens would be killed out. In the end of composting process, the water content of outputs was reduced exactly to about 35%, DOC could be decomposed by about 50%.

Since then, geological investigations in nearly 50 years have shown that neither fossil plants of such kind nor the Late Devonian strata have yet been found throughout the Mount Bogada including the above-mentioned Satai Town of Jimsar County. Thus, questions arise about the true locality yielding the specimens described by Sze and also about whether there are the Late Devonian strata near Satai Town indeed. These unsettled questions have long been practically and theoretically affecting the task of geologic mapping, palaeofloristic provincialism and interpretation of geological structure of the eastern Tianshan Mountains. Such problems have not yet been cleared up to now. Based on the on-the-spot investigations and examinations for many years and combined with the results of research data, the authors confirm that the original locality of L. rhomblicum is actually the site near Satai by the side of the Sayram Lake at the northern foot of western Tianshan Mountains, and not the Satai Town of Jimsar County at the northern foot of eastern Tianshan Mountains, where the Late Devonian strata containing the above-mentioned plant fossils do not occurr.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

{"title": "Mainlobe and peak sidelobe control in adaptive arrays\n", "abstract": " In radar applications, adaptive beampatterns with low sidelobes and stable mainlobe shapes are desired to suppress pulsed deceptive jammers or sidelobe targets and to accurately measure the direction-of-arrival (DOA) of a target using monopulse techniques. In practice, all kinds of errors exist, such as signal pointing errors, array calibration errors and array covariance matrix estimation errors. In the presence of these errors, adaptive beamformers can suffer from severe performance degradations, including poor interference rejection, distorted mainlobes, and high sidelobes. In this paper, we investigate how a quadratic constraint based adaptive beamformer with peak sidelobe control, referred to as the PPSC (precise peak sidelobe control) method, can be combined with a signal removal scheme to achieve desired adaptive beampatterns and interference rejection performance for a uniform linear array\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

Based on calculation results, two generic classes of interaction can be distinguished according to eta. If eta > 1, the shock wave bends toward the down stream near the density-stratified interface, the transmitted shock wave is reflected from the wall, and the pressure exerted on the wall is higher than that when eta=1. The transition from regular reflection to Mach reflection is found with increasing eta.

During the follow-up period from 2 months to 5 years, 3 cases with intraosseous EW remain alive and free of tumor. The remaining patients are dead or having their tumors metastasized. CONCLUSION: EW is more primitive in cell differentiation, while PNET has more neural differentiation. The presence of HW rosettes is an important morphologic feature of PNET. To differentiate EW from PNET is of clinical significance O13 is a useful marker for the diagnosis of EW/PNET.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1023"]}
{"title": "Bei and the passive in Cantonese\n", "abstract": " Description This paper studies the nature of the BEI-construction in Cantonese, with Mandarin as the standard language of comparison. Although the BEI-construction has been much studied in Mandarin, the same in not true for Cantonese. Although this construction has traditionally been termed a\" passive\", I will show that it can have a different range of semantic interpretations in Cantonese. I argue that BEI is not confined to passive, but is used under certain circumstances to form a causative construction as well. The differences in behaviour between passive-BEI and causative-BEI can be seen in tests with anaphoric binding. I conclude that while the passive structure is mono-clausal, the causative structure must be bi-clausal. The Cantonese BEI-constructions have an obligatory agent-phrase which cannot be dropped. This differs from Mandarin and the challenge is to find an account for this phenomenon, especially if we are to claim that this construction is a passive. The optionality of the agent phrase is characteristic of passives and yet Cantonese deviates from this norm. I argue that passive in Cantonese is a syntactic process and predict that only transitive verbs may participate in this construction. I utilize the universal v-VP structure on transitive verbs, proposed by Chomsky (1995), to guarantee that the external theta role must be retained. I also examine the much debated status of BEI which is used in the BEI-construction. Although this construction can be used to derive both a passives and a causatives, it does not necessarily mean that two separate BEIs must be posited. I conclude that BEI can be treated as a category-neutral element\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

{"title": "Effects of PGE1 on platelet deformability.\n", "abstract": " Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) is frequently used as a stabilizing agent while isolating platelets. The platelet-stabilizing effect of PGE1 is mediate through the PGE1 receptor and the consequent increase of intracellular cAMP. The discoid shape of platelet is thus maintained. Recently, we have studied the effect of PGE1 on platelet deformability with micropipette aspiration technics, using pipettes with radii (Rp) of 0.26-0.36 micron. Platelets, obtained from platelet-rich plasma, and suspended in Hank's buffer containing BSA, glucose, adenosine and theophylline, were subjected for micropipette aspiration test within 2 hr after sampling. In general, PGE1 treated platelets (greater than 75%) remained as non-activated form as revealed under video microscopy and maintained their discoid shape for as long as 6 hr. The time course of the extension length (Dp, in micron) of the platelets in response to aspiration with a negative pressure of 5 cm H2O (tension= 0.15 dynes/cm) was analyzed by using a digital image analyzer system (IRIS 3120 with IP-512, with a resolution of 0.076 microns). A computer program based on the algorithm of real-time reading of image intensity was developed to facilitate real-time data acquisition. The data of Dp/Rp vs time (sec) were fitted by using a second-order equation. The deformability of PGE1 (0.1 microM) treated platelet was decreased significantly as compared with control. These results indicate that the platelet stabilization by PGE1 is accompanied by a decrease in platelet deformability.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

{"title": "Efficient filtration for similarity search with spaced k-mer neighbors\n", "abstract": " In DNA and protein sequence similarity search, seeding (or filtration) has been widely used to trade search sensitivity with search speed. In this paper, a new seeding method, called spaced k-mer neighbors, is introduced to provide a more efficient tradeoff between the speed and sensitivity in protein similarity search. The new method pre-selects a set of spaced k-mers as neighbors, and uses the neighbors to detect hits between the query and database sequences. An efficient heuristic algorithm is proposed for the neighbor selection. We demonstrate that the method can improve the tradeoff efficiency over existing seeding methods.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

Under the conditions of influent COD of 6 000 mg/L and ALK of 1 900 mg/L, before addition of trace elements, the COD removal rate was 51%, the hydrogen production capacity was 0.46 m3/(m3\u00b7 d), and the methane production capacity was 0.68 m3/(m3\u00b7 d), with low dehydrogenase activity of anaerobic sludge. While under the same conditions, after addition of trace elements, the COD removal rate increased to above 62%, the hydrogen production capacity decreased to 0.37 m3/(m3\u00b7 d), and the methane production capacity increased to 1.66 m3/(m3\u00b7 d). As a result, the addition of trace elements could effectively stimulate the activity of anaerobic sludge in fermentative co-production of hydrogen and methane in the ABR.

Employing the concept of second-order cone complementarity, the contact condition with orthotropic friction law is formulated as a linear second-order cone complementarity condition through the analogy with the elastic-perfectly plastic constitutive model. Then, the governing equations of the contact problem can be reformulated as a linear second-order cone complementarity problem (SOCCP) via the parametric variational principle and the finite element method. The SOCCP formulation avoids the polyhedral approximation to the elliptical Coulomb friction cone so that the problem under consideration has much smaller size and the solution has better accuracy. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the SOCCP formulation.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

Several techniques have been employed to prepare suitable thin films for such electronic devices. One of the widely used techniques is the radio frequency (rf) glow discharge decomposition of silane. In this technique it was found that several deposition parameters, such as gas flow rate, excitation power, pressure, substrate temperature and dilution of the source gas (silane) with other gases (argon, hydrogen, or helium) will influence the structure and properties of the growth of a-Si: H thin film [1, 2]. The effect of argon (Ar) dilution on the structure and optical properties of hydrogenated amorphous and microcrystalline films deposited by rf glow discharge decomposition of silane has been demonstrated [1]. The effect of hydrogen dilution on the optical properties of amorphous-microcystalline line mixed-phase Si: H films prepared by glow-discharge decomposition of mixed SiH4-H2 gas was also studied [2, 3].

The primary interpretation of natural lection is individual selection, ie individual is the unit of selection. But if individual is the unit of selection, the popular existence of altruism is hard to understand, because of the altruism increasing the fitness of the altruist others, not the fitness of himself. This is the so-called\" Darwin's Altruism Puzzle\". In the late year of Darwin's life, he try to resolving this puzzle by introducing group selection as a new selection force. Many important new Darwinian biologists in the late 1960s, however, suspected the role of group selection. They proposed kin selection, gene selection and reciprocal altruism as new theory for solving the puzzle. But each of them has difficulties for interpreting of it. From 1990s, more and more biologists have re-introduced and re-interpreted group selection, and have tried to hold a pluralist strategy in order to solve Darwin's Altruism Puzzle", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

In order to reflect the individual behavior, the thinking mode of pedestrians, and the interaction between pedestrians and the environment, we adopt the idea of agents and road network classification. Firstly, we classify the road network of pedestrian agents, use the paths\u2019 track to describe the network of vehicles and use the non-track road network to describe the pedestrians\u2019 network. Secondly, we give some complex rules of pedestrians, analyze the interactive model between pedestrians and the enviroments such as other pedestrians, vehicles, road network, signal lights, and so on, manifest the autonomity, the reactivity and the sociality of the pedestrian agents. Finally, we describe the whole process about the complex microscopic model of pedestrians\u2019 way finding.

{"title": "Design and Chip Implementation of the Segment Weighted Random BIST for Low Power Testing\n", "abstract": " This paper presents a segment weighted random built-in self test (SWR-BIST) technique for low power testing. This technique divides the scan chain into segments of different weights. Heavily weighted segments have more biased probability than lightly weighted segments. Heavily weighted segments are placed closer to the end of scan chain than the lightly weighted segments so the scan-in transitions are minimized. In addition, scan cells in segments of the same weight are reordered to further reduce the scan-out transitions. Experiments on ISCAS circuits show that, compared with the pseudo random BIST, SWR-BIST effectively reduces the test power by 74%. The SWR-BIST circuitry is very small and it grows slowly with the CUT size. The penalty of this technique is area and routing overhead for scan chain reordering.

LMP2 is an ideal target for immunotherapy because LMP2 mRNA is detected in 100% nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells and LMP2 protein shows stronger immunogenity than the rest 2 viral proteins. This study was to analyze the sequence of CTL epitopes in the transmembrane region of LMP2 to optimize LMP2-targeted immunotherapy. METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from 20 biopsies of NPC and 3 biopsies of normal nasopharynx from Cantonese. The transmembrane region of LMP2 gene was amplified with hemi-nest polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and then sequenced directly. RESULTS: As compared with prototype B95. 8 cells, the transmembrane region of LMP2 gene, derived from Cantonese NPC and normal nasopharynx tissues, had 14 base pair substitutions, resulting in 6 amino acid substitutions. Among these substitutions, 3 changed amino acids were located in 4 HLA-restricted CTL epitopes (SSC, TYG, CLG, and VMS). Among these polymorphisms, the VMS variation was first identified. The sequence changes of the LMP2 derived from NPC was the same as those of the LMP2 from normal nasopharynx, indicating that those variations were due to geographic-associated polymorphisms rather than NPC-associated mutations. CONCLUSION: Polymorphisms of LMP2 exist in EBV derived from Cantonese, resulting in 4 CTL epitope variations, which implicates that the effect of LMP2 polymorphisms should be considered when\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

Methods A total of 50 non-duplicate MRSA clinical isolates were collected in 4 hospitals of Guangdong Province. Special primer associated with hyper variable region (HVR) and REIC-2 were used for amplification of MRSA BY PCR and the genotypes were differentiated based on the fragments of amplified products. The difference of two genotypes was observed according to the change of the fragments of amplified products when the annealing temperature was changed. Results 50 strains of MRSA were defferentiated into the genotpyes of A, B, C, D and E based on HVR genotypes and into 10 genotypes on ERIC-2 polymorphism; Moreover, there were still genotypes by ERIC-2 primer when annealing temperature of PCR was changed to 64\u2103. Conclusion Either Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis (RAPD) ERIC-2 or genotype of HVR (HVR-PCR) is an rapid, reliable and effective method for epidemiological study on MRSA at molecular level. But the genotying results will alter along with the changes of annealing temperature. Therefore, the annealing temperature should be controlled strictly when RAPD is used, otherwise, the results of genotype may be not reliable.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

METHODS: The gene expression profile was investigated using cDNA microarray technique; the plasma total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels were analyzed by COD-PAP and GPO-PAP method. And morphological observations of the aorta were made. RESULTS: Among the 4000 target genes, 92 genes were up-regulated and 105 genes were down-regulated in the treble genes mutants, compared with wild type control. Among the differentially expressed lipid metabolism related genes, cholesterol synthesis gene coding for farnesyl diphosphate farnesyl transferase was down-regulated, while triglyceride metabolism gene eg pancreatic lipase related protein 1 gene (Pnliprp1) was up-regulated. Expression profile of carbohydrate, cell skeleton and immune related genes were also altered. On the other hand, in the plasma from the treble genes mutant mice at 5 weeks of age, hyperlipidemia was found to be combined with atheroslerotic lesion. All these biochemical and pathological changes were aggravated following aging.

Compared with the adaptive notch (AN) filter, it is not necessary to know the frequency of reverberation. A normalization method based on fluctuant frequency feature which was combined with frequency variance and kurtosis in frequency domain was presented to fulfill constant false alarm ratio detection. Before the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) method, making use of the echo time dispersion in shallow water, mean processing between two snap_shots was used to detect continuous wave (CW) in a multipath. The results show that frequency response of stopband filter about adaptive reverberation notch using autoregressive model (ARNAR) is better than that of AN, and the bandwidth of stopband about ARNAR is not controlled by the adaptive coefficient. The simulation experiments on detection of low Doppler signals in strong reverberation noises show that the proposed system is effective.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

{"title": "Relation between the mother ingot microstructure and the glass forming ability of a bulk glass forming alloy\n", "abstract": " Amorphous alloys are formed when the liquid atoms are frozen into a non-crystalline arrangement. In general, rapid quenching from the melt at cooling rates about 106 K/s is required to obtain glass formation in conventional metallic alloys. However, recent development have shown that glasses can be produced at cooling rates as low as about 102 K/s in some multicomponent systems [1\u20136], the so-called bulk glassy alloys. The low critical cooling rates for the bulk glassy alloys indicate that they have a very high glass forming ability (GFA). The reason for the high GFA of bulk glassy alloys has been discussed, and has resulted in the three empirical rules [7]:(1) multicomponent systems consisting of no less than three elements,(2) significant difference in atomic size ratios above about 12% among the main three constituent elements, and (3) large negative heats of mixing among the main three constituent elements.

METHODS: Between 1983 and 2000, 6 patients with infection after TKAs were treated, including 2 men and 4 women, aged on average 63 years (44-75 years). Initial knee arthroplasty was performed for osteoarthritis in 4 patients and for rheumatoid arthritis in 2 knees. The timing of diagnosis of infection after knee arthroplasty averaged 50 months (range, 1 month-11 years). Simple debridement and antibiotic treatment were prescribed for 3 patients, debridement and one-stage reimplantation for 1, debridement and two-stage reimplantation for 1, and athrodesis for 1. RESULTS: Of the 3 patients with simple debridement, one was cured, one failed but underwent athrodesis later, and one lost to follow up. Two patients with reimplantation were cured and had good function recovery. All of the 6 patients were followed up on average for 4 years. No infection recurred except one who lost to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Management of infection after total knee arthroplasty includes antibiotic suppression and debridement with prosthesis retention, insertion of another prosthesis as a one-stage or two-stage exchange technique, knee arthrodesis and amputation. These treatments have specific indications. To treat infection after total knee arthroplasty, suitable method should be taken according to patient's condition.

Other high expression rates of OC, BSP, OPN in or among different groups had no significant difference. In unmineralized neoplastic bone matrix OC, BSP, OPN were weakly expressed. In mineralized neoplastic bone matrix the high positive rates of BSP, OPN (81.4%, 76.7%) were significantly higher than that of OC (4.6%). But OC was expressed strongly in mature bone. CONCLUSION: In tumor cells of the osteosarcoma expression of OC, BSP, OPN were accompanied by the cell differentiation. It seemed that during the formation and mineralization of neoplatic bone, BSP, OPN, OC had a relatively close relations with mineralization and they showed some extent sequensed expression.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

{"title": "Selection of new Epitopes from monovalent displayed phage octapeptide library.\n", "abstract": " A library of 2 x 10 (7) random octapeptides was constructed by use of phagemid-based monovalent phage display system. The randomly synthesized degenerated oligodeoxyribonucleotides (oligos) were fused to the truncated g III (p230-p403). Sequence analysis of 11 randomly chosen clones suggested that the degenerated inserts and its deduced amino acid (aa) sequences are randomly distributed. The library was used to select binding peptides to the monoclonal antibody (mAb) 9E10, which recognizes a continuous decapeptide epitope of denatured human c-myc protein. After four to five rounds of panning, most of the eluted clones could bind to 9E10. Sequence analysis of the selected positive clones indicated that the binding sequences could fall into two classes, one class (clone 1) shares a consensus motif, ISE xx L, with c-myc decapeptide; and the sequences of the other class are entirely different. The binding of both classes to 9E10 could be specifically inhibited by free c-myc decapeptide. The immunogenicity of the phage peptide was further investigated by construction of multivalent displayed phage peptides and immunization of animals with or without adjuvant. ELISA and competitive ELISA showed that anti-serum from both mice and rabbit immunized with either clone could bind to the original antigen, c-myc decapeptide. These results denote that in spite of the dissimilarity of the selected peptides with c-myc decapeptide, they are capable of inducing similar immune respones in vivo, thus actually mimicking the antigen epitope.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

{"title": "Stroke volume estimation incorporating a nonlinear arterial system compliance model\n", "abstract": " A frequently used model of the arterial system is the three-element modified Windkessel. The elements of the model are generally assumed to be constant, although it is known that the arterial compliance varies with pressure. A computer simulation of the modified Windkessel model using a pressure-dependent compliance was used to predict stroke volume. The results show a linear correlation between the predicted stroke volume and the measured stroke volume.< >", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

Absorption bands are at 11,300, 13,150, 18,650, 23,000 and 28,700 cm-1. The electronic energy levels were calculated by means of ligand field theory. Its EPR spectrum was measured directly at 77 K without dilution with diamagnetic medium. Zero-field splitting and half-field transition were observed g=2.169\u00b10.020, g= 2.164 \u00b1 0.020 and |D|=0.095\u00b10.003cm-1. This paper discusses synthetically and theoretically the experimental results of electronic structure and crystal structure of this complex crystal.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1023"]}

{"title": "Agroclimatic analysis of the high yield wheat crops in Qinghai-Xizang Plateau\n", "abstract": " The highest yield record per unit area of chimonophilous wheat wheat Subject Category: Commodities and Productssee more details crops in China and the highest average wheat yield occur in the Xizang (Tibetan) plateau despite the low levels of production and agrotechnology. The favorable temperatures, intense solar radiation, and adequate cooperation of photophase combine to make the plateau an area of high wheat yield. Low temperatures prolong the growing period and the heading to maturity periods favoring ear differentiation, filling grains, and organic matter accumulation. The intense solar radiation provides ample energy for the formation of organic matter. The cooperation of photophase and temperature prevents\" napping\" during photosynthesis and forced ripening during the grain filling period. As the daily mean sunshine hours and maximum temperature range during the period between heading and maturity are not high, it is not these factors which cause the high yield of wheat crops, but the lower temperatures which favor growth.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1023"]}
