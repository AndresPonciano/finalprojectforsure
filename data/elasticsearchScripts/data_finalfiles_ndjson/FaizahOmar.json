{"title": "Designing test coverage for grey box analysis\n", "abstract": " Test coverage is an important deliverable of white box testing process. Many articles have publish works detailing out on how to get coverage information by either code based testing (white box) or requirement based testing (black box). This article provides an overview of test coverage and testing analysis that mediates for both testing types. Finding detailed coverage can be time consuming. A future work is proposed in order to find test coverage by integrating the two testing types known as a grey box using software traceability approaches.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["2267"]}
