{"title": "Trust requirements in e-health system: a conceptual framework\n", "abstract": " Resulting from the development of new technology, conventional scientific practices have migrated into computer-based infrastructures, called e-science. Specifically, escience applied in health discipline is called e-health. It is an organized system that deals to diagnose and treat patients. Considering trust is an important role and fundamental for the provision of effective healthcare service, this paper discusses trust requirement in e-health. To highlight the importance of trust in e-health system, a conceptual framework of trust requirements in e-health system is developed. Drawn from literature search framed by STARLITE, a conceptual framework that addresses trust resulting from relationships of various actors based on two perspectives: sociotechnical and technical perspectives are presented. This framework suggests that e-health system must build a trust relationship between actors and understand trust based on sociotechnical and technical perspectives. Further, security and privacy that protect the confidentiality of patient\u2019s data, especially m-health (mobile health) also need trust in resource sharing. It can be concluded that trust requirements in e-health depend on how the media transmits a social experience, patient-system relationship, and collaboration of software engineering and healthcare professionals. The implementation of trust requirements has the potential to produce well-engineered software in a healthcare organization, resulting in the use of software for effective diagnosis and treatment of patients.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1914"]}
{"title": "A New Consistency Validation Approach to Enhance the Quality of Functional Security Requirements for Secure Software\n", "abstract": " Quality security requirements contribute to the success of secure software development. However, the process of eliciting security requirements is tedious and complex. It also requires requirements engineers to have security experience in the process of eliciting consistent security requirements from the clients-stakeholders. Most of the requirements engineers faced problems in eliciting consistent security compliance requirements from the clients-stakeholders as they misunderstood the real needs and the security term used. Thus, this resulted to inconsistent security requirements being elicited. The inconsistency leads to incorrect and insecure software systems being developed as well as to disruptions of schedule and increase of a project's expenditure. Motivated by these problems, this study is aimed to propose a new approach for consistency validation of functional security requirements. Here, security requirements specifications will be collected from software vendors to analyse the flow of functional security requirements process. Next, visual differencing will be integrated to cross-validate the consistency of the elicited functional security requirements with the best-practise template. Here, security requirements best-practice template pattern library will be designed and a new mathematical formulation that defines the consistency validation rules of security requirements will also be constructed. The formulation will be based on the security-related semi-formalised model, called SecEssential Use Case (SecEUC). This approach will then be realised with a proof of concept prototype tool and will be compared with the existing approaches\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1914"]}
{"title": "Requirements defects techniques in requirements analysis: A Review\n", "abstract": " Defects existing in the systems due to poorly identified requirements defects are viewed as the major factors leading to system failure, especially if the requirements defects are not identified or addressed until at the later stage of software development life cycle. In response to this, several attempts have been made to identify defects during the requirements analysis process. This paper presents a review of the various techniques to handle requirements defects in the requirements analysis activity. These techniques are categorised into four categories, namely reading, inspection, analysis and automated tool. It was found that these techniques have different focus and lack of emphasis on the needs of the industry. This study provides the basis for future research aiming at developing an approach to automate the process of requirements defects handling.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1914"]}
{"title": "Determination of trust requirements attributes for developing acceptable autonomous car\n", "abstract": " Automation technology has gained a special interest in the revolution of Industry 4.0, where it helps to minimize human intervention to perform a complex task such as driving a vehicle. This has resulted to the needs of trust concern among users especially when it related to driving an autonomous car. Hence, this leads to low acceptability and marketability among users on this car. Therefore, considering trust requirements from the early development of car is crucial. To do this, determination of trust requirements attributes needs to be done in order to define correct trust requirements is produced. In this paper, we discussed our findings of preliminary study conducted to analyse the attributes of trust requirements for developing acceptable autonomous car based on the perspectives of the users in Malaysia. This preliminary study was carried out with 50 potential buyers of autonomous car. The results indicated that the most effective trust attributes in trust requirements are privacy, experience and integrity the may lead to better acceptability of autonomous car.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1914"]}

{"title": "Eliciting Functional Requirements in Clinical Domain: A Review\n", "abstract": " Requirements elicitation is the most crucial and complex tasks in requirement engineering as it determines the quality of requirements in software development. Further, considering that clinical requirements are more complex in comparison to other requirements, requirements engineers have to give more attention when eliciting requirements for clinical software as any errors may lead to disastrous effects in healthcare. In this case, requirement engineers need to be cognizant of the accuracy and completeness of requirements to ensure the development of a full-function software. Although various methods, approaches and tools have been developed to assist requirements engineers to elicit accurate requirements, there have been very limited work involved in the clinical domain. This paper aims to present a comparison analysis of the existing methods, approaches and tools that help requirements to elicit requirements. The analysis of tools can be used a guidance to identify the existing work related to requirements elicitation.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1914"]}
{"title": "A STUDY OF GENERATING ABSTRACT TEST FOR REQUIREMENTS VALIDATION AMONG REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERS.\n", "abstract": " Requirements testing or requirements-based testing (RBT) is one of the software testing techniques that is found effective to test requirements' completeness and accuracy. This technique involves systematic way of test case generation from the model of the requirements specification. This technique has been applied in the requirements analysis phase to detect and eliminate requirements defects before the next stage of software development project. Although this technique is useful, it is tedious and time consuming to manually generate abstract test from the requirements model. However, we argue that the tedious process can be minimised if the requirements engineer have the good ability (skill) to generate abstract test from requirements models for requirements validation.

{"title": "Ensemble Selection and Optimization Based on Soft Set Theory for Customer Churn Classification\n", "abstract": " Ensemble methods or multiple classifiers which combine decisions from many base classifiers have been confirmed to outperform the classification performance of any single classifiers. Despite having the ability of producing the highest classification accuracy, ensemble methods have suffered significantly from their large volume of base classifiers. Thus, in the previous work, we have proposed a novel soft set based method to prune the base classifiers from heterogeneous ensemble committee and have demonstrated the ability of our proposed soft set pruning algorithm in reducing a substantial number of classifiers while at the same time producing the highest prediction accuracy. However, the pruning method only suggests a subset of relevant classifiers, and the search for the optimized and best classifiers is not yet considered. The selection of the best or optimized classifiers is carried out by checking all combinations of pruned classifiers. In this paper, we extended our research by proposing a new soft ensemble selection and optimization method to find the best subset of the pruned classifiers. The results of this work have proven that our proposed method is able to search for the minimum number of classifiers in the ensemble repository while at the same time maintaining or improving the classification performance. The proposed method is systematically evaluated using Customer Churn dataset taken from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository data set.

The common practice for capturing requirements is found to be subjected to errors, inconsistencies, redundancy, incompleteness, and omissions. Although frequent face-to-face communication between the requirements engineer and various stakeholders can minimize these problems, it is found to consume too much time. Hence, this research suggests that a healthcare domain library comprising compilation of structural expressions and glossary of functional requirements derived from various stakeholders can assist requirements engineer to capture accurate requirements as well as reduce the time taken. This research involves three stages: analysis, design development as well as testing and evaluation.
