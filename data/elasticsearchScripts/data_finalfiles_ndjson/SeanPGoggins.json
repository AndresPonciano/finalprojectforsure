{"title": "Participation-based student final performance prediction model through interpretable Genetic Programming: Integrating learning analytics, educational data mining and theory\n", "abstract": " Building a student performance prediction model that is both practical and understandable for users is a challenging task fraught with confounding factors to collect and measure. Most current prediction models are difficult for teachers to interpret. This poses significant problems for model use (e.g. personalizing education and intervention) as well as model evaluation. In this paper, we synthesize learning analytics approaches, educational data mining (EDM) and HCI theory to explore the development of more usable prediction models and prediction model representations using data from a collaborative geometry problem solving environment: Virtual Math Teams with Geogebra (VMTwG).

Political discourse has been historically constrained by geographic proximity of participants. The introduction of the Internet and specifically social media has altered these geographic constraints and political discourse is now one of the most prevalent activities in social media. As more individuals begin to use technology for political activity, understanding how the technology is used becomes increasingly important. Previous research exploring political discourse on social media has focused on one discrete event or a narrow time period. This narrow focus limits the understanding of the complex election environment.

We conducted a discourse analysis examining the practices of active roleplayers, who interact with thousands of other fans and fellow players to continue their experience of the story, and engage in what we term Twitter play. Our findings illustrate how roleplayers are able to use Twitter to expand their experience of media and story. By examining roleplayers' use of Twitter affordances, we find that these performers not only exhibit deep knowledge of their characters and the narrative, but also of Twitter, demonstrated by expanding the uses of the service's affordances to playfully connect the story with popular culture\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["909"]}

I present a few examples from domains I have developed statistical and visual analytics for as exemplars of how a research program might accomplish the fluid transfer of analytics research across domains in a way that impacts teaching and learning. I begin by characterizing some of the limitations I see in learning analytics generally, and which I argue remain salient issues in the development of teaching analytics. In both cases, the goal is to advance learning. Prior research measuring \u201conline learning\u201d performance has a number of limitations and inconsistencies. First, prior studies of online learning groups do not relate the temporality of group development as a central aspect of analysis, yet group performance, structure and identity are widely understood to change over time (Gersick, 1988; Knowles & Knowles, 1955; Tuckman, 1965). Second, learning performance is not consistently measured or is not measured at all. Student grades are frequently used as a method of convenience, but their limited utility as a measure for learning performance is well documented. Third, there is wide variation in the meaning of words like \u201conline\u201d and \u201ccomputer supported collaborative learning\u201d.

We focus on one growing channel of control; social media use for official communication between government agencies and the public. This paper introduces a framework for analyzing social media use and interaction between government agencies and the public, focusing on a comparative analysis of two consumer protections agencies; one, the Konsumentverket in Sweden, the second, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in the US. Contrasting the efficacy and practices associated with social media as a communication tool for citizens and their governments in different societies may lead to important insights regarding local and global applications of new media. The proposed framework is grounded in the concept of active co-construction of reality via Giddens structuration theory, as expanded on by Orlikowski. While this provides a useful lens for understanding the construction of government and public interaction, it does not provide a methodology for examining the discourse in action. To do this we embed critical discourse analysis in structuration theory and use algorithms and methods from social media research (group informatics and TwitterZombie) to collect data and identify social networks.

{"title": "The rising tide: Open source\u2019s steady transformation\n", "abstract": " Open source projects are transforming. Today, work within open source projects has come to be influenced by a growing set of companies and individuals who receive financial remuneration for their engagement. As such, there is a central focus on commoditization and commercialization of open source products, which drives a trend towards a concealment of the various inner workings that produce these products. Within this shift, the product becomes a central aim of open source project engagement, and the means of production becomes incidental. In this paper, we explore the HCI research and design implications of the transformation of open source projects as part of commercial work and how we can come to better understand and protect the rising tide of open source projects.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["909"]}
{"title": "Big data factories: Collaborative approaches\n", "abstract": " The book proposes a systematic approach to big data collection, documentation and development of analytic procedures that foster collaboration on a large scale. This approach, designated as \u201cdata factoring\u201d emphasizes the need to think of each individual dataset developed by an individual project as part of a broader data ecosystem, easily accessible and exploitable by parties not directly involved with data collection and documentation. Furthermore, data factoring uses and encourages pre-analytic operations that add value to big data sets, especially recombining and repurposing. The book proposes a research-development agenda that can undergird an ideal data factory approach. Several programmatic chapters discuss specialized issues involved in data factoring (documentation, meta-data specification, building flexible, yet comprehensive data ontologies, usability issues involved in collaborative tools, etc.). The book also presents case studies for data factoring and processing that can lead to building better scientific collaboration and data sharing strategies and tools. Finally, the book presents the teaching utility of data factoring and the ethical and privacy concerns related to it.

A dominant mode of investigation involves fitting a mathematical model to an observed distribution, and then inferring the behaviors that generate the modeled distribution. Yet, distributions of activity are not always stable, and the process of fitting a mathematical model to empirical distributions can be highly uncertain, especially for smaller and highly variable datasets.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["909"]}

{"title": "Assessing the structural fluidity of virtual organizations and its effects\n", "abstract": " A major advantage of Virtual Organizations (VOs) is flexible membership and participation. VO members are able to join and leave VOs at will, and can change whom they collaborate with at any point in time. Such flexibility may make VOs more efficient in the completion of collaborative work than traditional organizations. However, efficiency is only one of several measures of organizational performance; and flexibility in a virtual organization includes both how VO structures may be more fluid and adaptive, and how VO leadership emerges and evolves throughout the VO lifecycle. The aim of this chapter is to: (1) define and quantitatively assess the actual flexibility of participation in VOs, through a social network index that we call structural fluidity; and (2) measure the relationship between fluidity and performance in the work carried out within the VO.

{"title": "Collaboration in isolation: bridging social and geographical boundaries in two rural technology firms\n", "abstract": " Little attention has been given to understanding how technology is used to bridge social and geographical boundaries between metropolitan and rural firms in developed nations like the United States.  In this paper we draw on theory from social worlds to contrast the introduction and integration of collaboration technologies in two small (23-53 employees) rural technology firms in the Midwestern US.  We report on a three-year ethnographic study of the work practices and technologies used to forge relationships between distant offices and customers at each firm.  Data include participant observation, field notes, memos and interviews with 71 informants.   Based on our data, we identified organizational facets of geography, socio-technical configuration and collaboration practices as instrumental in the formation of working spheres [31] for members of each firm.  As the facets of each firm change over time, our data show social, organizational and technical practices lead to different types of virtual organization at each firm.  One firm\u2019s working spheres coalesce, while the other firm\u2019s working spheres split.  We show that small firms operating in rural areas experience unique social and geographic boundaries in their development as virtual organizations.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["909"]}

{"title": "HIB & HCI: Common interests in different communities\n", "abstract": " New connections between research and practice are necessary to address human information behavior in an increasingly technologically mediated world.  Socio-technical systems for encountering, finding and sharing information have become sophisticated enough to blur the boundary between human and computer, and transform important design and research questions in human computer interaction (HCI) to questions for which human information behavior research (HIB) offers a deep tradition.  We sought to understand present connections between these two progressively more interrelated research areas by performing a citation analysis of prominent HIB research with the most prominent publications in the HCI field.  While the conceptual affinity between the two research fields is increasingly strong, the production of ideas and the exchange of research agendas between them is weak in the citations we analyzed.  We propose a number of explanations for this gap, and suggest a more activist research agenda by HIB in the realm of HCI as one potential means for bridging this gap.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["909"]}

{"title": "Student assessment in small groups: A spectral clustering model\n", "abstract": " Enabling the formative assessment of students while limiting demands on teachers\u2019 time is a significant concern for technology mediated learning in small groups. Previous approaches have either required extensive time commitments on the part of teachers or relied on the development of special computational models of behavior. Oftentimes, these models overlook the way in which traces of student interaction in a learning system also constitute traces of human behavior, and, act only as \u201cblunt instruments\u201d relying only on the automated accounting of student activities. We employ activity theory to categorize traces of student behavior captured from a Virtual Math Teams (VMT) geometry class in an online, synchronous environment. From this, six semantically-grounded measures are generated for each student. Using these, a recently-developed clustering algorithm \u2013 spectral clustering \u2013 is coded to identify students who have similar behavior patterns. Structured in such a fashion, the theoretical and computational approach taken allows for an automated and meaningfully-grounded assessment of student performance, enabling teachers to offer concrete and personalized help in a timely format.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["909"]}

{"title": "Knowledge construction, social identity and social network structure in completely online groups\n", "abstract": " Working, learning and informal information-seeking behavior is rapidly moving online. It will increasingly involve collaboration within small groups meeting online. While this process is being driven by technological innovation, the important socio-technical issues of human computer, human-human and human-information interaction under the new conditions are less well understood. Completely online groups (COGS) are phenomena that have emerged in computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environments. This mixed methods study examines the development of eight completely online groups in a CSCL course held at the University of Missouri during the summer of 2008. The principal contribution of this work is a new and deeper understanding of completely online groups and the diverse development trajectories they follow. This work also contributes a methodologically rich research design that leads to the comprehensive description of the context and experiences of completely online groups. The results presented include patterns of completely online small-group development, and the relation of those patterns to differences in social ability, group efficacy and information horizons among the groups and their members. Completely online small-group development is characterized through detailed analysis of social-network structure, patterns of group-knowledge construction and trajectories of group-identity formation.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["909"]}
