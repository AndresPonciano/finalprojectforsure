I contend that the open source software phenomenon has metamorphosed into a more mainstream and commercially viable form, which I label as OSS 2.0. I illustrate this transformation using a framework of process and product factors, and discuss how the bazaar metaphor, which up to now has been associated with the open source development process, has actually shifted to become a metaphor better suited to the OSS 2.0 product delivery and support process. Overall the OSS 2.0 phenomenon is significantly different from its free software antecedent.

However, there is not much known about the tailoring and engineering of agile methods, or about how these methods can be used to complement each other. This study investigated tailoring of the agile methods, eXtreme programming (XP) and Scrum, at Intel Shannon, and involved experienced software engineers who continuously monitored and reflected on these methods over a 3-year period. The study shows that agile methods may individually be incomplete in supporting the overall development process, but XP and Scrum complement each other well, with XP providing support for technical aspects and Scrum providing support for project planning and tracking. The principles of XP and Scrum were carefully selected (only six of the 12 XP key practices were implemented, for example) and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "527\n", "authors": ["880"]}

Thus, they seek to accomplish only those development tasks that deliver business value quickly, while accommodating changing user requirements. Practice is ahead of research in this area, and the use of agile approaches appears to be growing rapidly, but the fundamental underpinnings of agile methods need to be better conceptualized and theorized. However, agile methods are not the only result of the quest for flexible software processes. A similar aim can be found in the process tailoring and method engineering literature [3, 4, 7, 8]. Here, the focus is on adapting development processes to changing circumstances, albeit usually in the context of rigorous plan-based methods. Ironically, the suggestion by agile method advocates that agile methods must be applied in their entirety, as the benefits only arise through the synergistic combination of individual practices, is somewhat at odds with the spirit of flexibility, and not borne out in recent research that suggests agile methods should be flexibly tailored to the particular development context to achieve maximum effect [6]. Against this background, the software development environment is changing. The general trend toward globalization has particular implications for software development [2].

The second argument is that the profile of the development environment now faced in organizations is very different from that which prevailed in the period 1967 to 1977. This is illustrated through original empirical research which supports this argument, and by contrasting these findings with those of previous studies in the literature.

It also discusses some of the problems encountered, such as the change in mind-set required when deploying OSS solutions, and resistance from staff who feared being deskilled by moving away from popular proprietary systems. The study reveals a radical shift in open source deployment from invisible horizontal infrastructure systems to highly visible vertical applications. The first phase of OSS implementation is estimated to lead to cost savings of i13 million over five years. These details are useful in that few studies have quantified the savings from OSS deployment. Given that Beaumont was already receiving academic pricing discounts for many of their original proprietary closed source applications, the savings for a typical commercial organization could be even higher. Also, in many cases, the extra functionality available in the OSS systems deployed allowed for a richer feature set overall. Buoyed by the success of this first phase, Beaumont is planning a second phase of OSS implementation for an overall hospital information system, a financial systems suite, and is even considering developing their payroll system in an open source fashion.

This paper presents a novel quantitative method to evaluate urban sustainability enhancing policies to further enable evidence based policy making. Quantitative data on more than 300 economic, social and environmental attributes of 79 small to medium sized urban Irish settlements were assembled into a database. This provided a baseline against which projected impacts of fresh policy implementation may be evaluated.

These are briefly described in this paper. However, more recently, researchers have begun to provide more critical, dystopian predictions for this technology, and these accounts are also summarised in the paper. Interestingly, researchers have tended to consider the utopian and dystopian outcomes as mutually exclusive, ie, there is a tendencey to present extreme accounts which are entirely utopian or dystopian. It is suggested that both the utopian and dystopian visions are fundamentally flawed, in so far as they are founded on a predominantly technologically-determistic view. The paper draws on a comprehensive field study of the phenomenon in practice to illustrate that the Internet has the propensity to result in both utopian and dystopian outcomes. Thus, a central argument presented is that both utopian and dystopian outcomes can occur simultaneously, albeit in relation to different factors. The paper proposes a framework which illustrates the factors which influence the manner in which utopian and dystopian outcomes result.", "num_citations": "33\n", "authors": ["880"]}

Moreover, as yet, there are no effective solutions to the general issue of orphan works.

This paper reports on industrial experience from use of MDD and shows that the approach needs improvements regarding the architecture since there are no suggested ways to formalize design rules which are an important part of the architecture. Instead, one has to rely on time consuming and error prone manual interpretations, reviews and reworkings to keep the system consistent with the architecture. To reap the full benefits of MDD it is therefore important to find ways of formalizing design rules to make it possible to allow automatic enforcement of the architecture on the system model.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["880"]}

The case study describes the implementation of these systems, the difficulties encountered, and also the benefits in terms of astonishing cost savings of\u20ac 13m over 5 years. These details are useful in that few studies have thus far quantified the savings from the deployment of open source software (OSS). Given that Beaumont were already receiving academic pricing discounts for many of their original proprietary closed source applications, the savings for a typical commercial organization could be even higher. Also, in many cases, the extra functionality available in the OSS systems deployed allowed for a richer feature set overall. The study also identifies the primary drivers in the move to OSS, namely principle, pragmatism and practicality. This is useful, since while several studies have considered the motivation of OSS developers, the motivation of actual users of OSS has received far less attention.

In this paper we focus on the technology acceptance of Groupware in virtual learning teams in part-time adult education. We apply Davis\u2019 Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) in a qualitative fashion to analyze and interpret the chronological sequence of events leading to the acceptance of the Groupware technology. The data were gathered through an in-depth qualitative Action Research study of four virtual learning teams within two different Masters education programs. By extracting empirical date from one of these virtual teams we show that the TAM model can be used in a qualitative fashion to investigate Groupware technology acceptance. We find that the causal relationship between ease of use and perceived usefulness, postulated by the TAM model, is not present in the case of Groupware technology in a virtual learning team setting. Finally we also find that social awareness plays an important role in the acceptance of such technology to support collaboration.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["880"]}
{"title": "An innovative training model for an organization embracing technology\n", "abstract": " The significance of information technology (IT) for modern business and, indeed, research in general cannot be questioned, as its sheer pervasiveness adequately attests. However, simplistic views of technological utopianism are now being offset by accounts of technological dystopianism. Clearly organizational management have wholeheartedly subscribed to an IT future as a staggering 41 percent of total capital expenditure in US organizations currently goes on IT. However, organizations face enormous difficulty in trying to achieve successful training programmes in the instruction and use of IT. This research study involved the construction and implementation of an IT training programme to inform midcareer employees, in a large multinational organization, of the benefits of IT. Davis (1989) identified two constructs as relevant to user acceptance of technology, namely ease of use (EOU) and perceived usefulness (PU). These constructs were operationalised into a set of principles to underpin the training programme which was delivered in two phases, each specifically addressing one of Davis\u2019 constructs. While the research is at an early stage, some preliminary lessons have been learned. For example, Davis\u2019 chain of causality operates in a fairly simple linear fashion, in that ease of use (EOU) is identified as a necessary pre-condition before perceived usefulness (PU) can be achieved. However, our research would suggest that this relationship is more interrelated and complex. Early signs suggest that the relationship between ease of use and perceived usefulness is not a simple linear sequential one whereby EOU must first be established as\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["880"]}

{"title": "Realigning Research and Practice in Information Systems Development: The Social and Organizational Perspective\n", "abstract": " Given the pervasive nature of information technology and information systems in the modern world, the design and development of IS and IT are critical issues of concern. New research topics continuously emerge in tandem with the latest developments in technology-E-Business, Knowledge Management, Business Process Reengineering, for example. However, when the initial flurry of research abates and the\" gloss\" of these areas has diminished somewhat, as it inevitably does, the enduring core issue remains as to how to develop systems to fully exploit these new areas. Both information systems and information technology are interpreted fairly broadly in this book. Of particular interest to the editors were research studies that facilitate an understanding of the role and impact of information technology on society, organizations, and individuals, and which strive to improve the design and use of information systems in that context. The contributions to the book are categorized into four broad themes. First is the core issue of developing information systems in the current environment. In this section several fundamental challenges to current assumptions and conventional wisdom in information systems development are posed. The second section considers the management of information systems. Again, the conventional wisdom is challenged. The penultimate section focuses on researching information systems. Here, various issues to do with research methods are surfaced, and the use of leading-edge research methods in information systems development is pioneered and discussed. Finally, a section is devoted to understanding information\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["880"]}
{"title": "Agile Drivers, Capabilities, and Value: An Over-Arching\n", "abstract": " The formation of the Agile Alliance in 2001 and the publication of the Agile Manifesto (Fowler and Highsmith, 2001) formally introduced agility to the field of Information Systems Development (ISD). Those involved sought to \u201crestore credibility to the word method\u201d(Fowler and Highsmith, 2001). The Agile Manifesto presented an industry-led vision for a profound shift in the ISD paradigm, through 12 principles. The Manifesto and its principles represent quite a popular initiative that actually complements the critique of formalized ISD methods over the past decade or so (Baskerville, Travis, and Truex, 1992; Fitzgerald, 1994, 1996), and have been well received by practitioners and academics.However, there are a number of critical issues in the field, all of which revolve around a lack of rigour and cohesion. First, many definitions of an agile method exist. Researchers often use the same term to refer to different concepts and different terms to refer to the same concept. However, this is not surprising given that Information Systems (IS) researchers cannot even reach consensus on the definitions of the most basic terms such as information system, method, and technique. In fact, Sharafi and Zhang (1999), Towill and Christopher (2002), and Vokurka and Fliedner (1998) have explicitly illustrated this issue in the case of the term agility. Second, many agile methods exist, such as eXtreme Programming (XP)(Beck,", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["880"]}
{"title": "Systems Development Methodologies\n", "abstract": " Most of the currently available systems development methodologies are founded on concepts which emerged in the period from about 1967 to 1977. Thus, overarching concepts such as the systems development lifecycle, prototyping, and user participation can be traced to this period. Fundamental design strategies such as functional decomposition, information hiding, and techniques such as data flow diagramming and entity relationship modelling also stem from this era. Even the origins of object-orientation can be traced to this period. This paper provides some empirical evidence which supports the contention that the profile of development is very different from that faced in the past when these methodologies were first promoted. It is therefore argued that there is a need to advance the clock in relation to deriving new methodological canons more appropriate to the needs of the current development\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["880"]}

{"title": "Developing systems to support organisational learning in product development organisations\n", "abstract": " There are aspects of New Product Development (NPD) business processes that pose particularly difficult challenges to Organizational Learning systems. Short product and process life cycles compress the available time window for recouping the expenses associated with product development. Cross-functional collaboration in product development organizations requires the merging of knowledge from diverse disciplinary and personal skills-based perspectives. Cross-institutional collaboration leads a requirement for knowledge to be combined from participants across multiple collaborating organizations. Transient existence in teams and high turnover results in a reduction in organizational knowledge unless there is a repository for knowledge rather than a dependence on knowledge which is situated in the minds of individuals. High rates of change in turbulent industries, such as electronics, motivates participants in NPD processes to effectively overcome these Organizational Learning challenges. The potential payoff includes time saved by not repeating mistakes and reuse of knowledge that leads to successful products and processes. IS research has paid little attention to NPD processes despite the fact that some IS appears to have the potential to have an impact in that area. Recent research completed by these researchers in Analog Devices Inc identified Organizational Learning challenges encountered by engineering teams in product development. This paper will report on these challenges and will describe how systems were developed to support organizational learning to support the product development process.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["880"]}

These forces have put the creation and dissemination of knowledge at the centre of many firms\u2019 new product development (NPD) strategies. Organizational models to support NPD have evolved over the years and a significant aspect of this evolution has been the emergence of organizations that are decentralized and distributed across the globe. Improvements in communication infrastructure have facilitated this trend. These new organizational forms have placed stresses and strains on firm\u2019s ability to efficiently transfer knowledge across its organization units and it has been observed that knowledge dissemination can run aground once organization unit boundaries are encountered. A small number of empirical analyses of knowledge management systems (KMS) applications to support new product development have been done. These analyses have pointed to a dual requirement in this area\u2013firstly, an organizational environment that promotes knowledge dissemination and secondly, an IS infrastructure to support collaboration in and across new product development teams. While some of the extant literature on KMS to support knowledge dissemination stresses the importance of \u201cpeople-topeople\u201d KMS applications and the area of knowledge discovery is starting to get attention, there appears to be a dearth of published material on the issues surrounding the actual implementation of such systems in an industrial setting.

The usual picture of that period represents it as a cultured but callous age; and indeed that was so. The native Gaels were despoiled of their lands by successive confiscations; they were held down by harsh penal laws, designed to prevent the lands which had passed into the hands of the English and Scots Protestant settlers from ever returning to their rightful owners. The settler landowner was a conqueror imposed from outside. He spoke a different language, professed a different religion from that of his tenants. He had little sympathy with their misfortunes, and less interest in their traditions. And he accepted as a matter of course the powerpolitical, economic, and social\u2013which superior strength and energy had bestowed upon him. Undoubtedly the Anglo-Irish dominated the Irish scene from the beginning of the seventeenth century onwards. They held the bulk of the land and as many posts and offices as were not given to Englishmen. But if they were the most rich and powerful, they were also the most progressive element in the country. They introduced into Ireland new methods in industry and agriculture. They fought to get rid of the old outmoded practices of the feudal aristocracy and medieval Church. They were ruthless colonizing capitalists, certainly; but the new order which they introduced into Ireland did represent a real advance on previous forms of Irish society.

We believe that any measure of impact should pass the same fundamental tests that we apply to our own research: validity and reliability. In this paper, we examine the impact of journals in the AIS Senior Scholars\u2019 basket of eight journals, three close contenders (i.e., journals that researchers frequently suggest for inclusion in the basket), and six randomly selected IS journals (from the Web of Science list) using a variety of traditional measures (e.g., journal impact factor) and newer measures (e.g., PageRank). Based on the results, we make three rather unpleasant and likely contentious conclusions. First, journal impact factor and other traditional mean-based measures do not represent valid measures so we conclude that one should not use them to measure journal quality. Second, the journal basket does not reliably measure quality, so we conclude that it one should not use it to measure journal quality. Third, the journal in which a paper appears does not reliably measure the paper\u2019s quality, so we conclude that one should not use the number of papers an author has published in certain journals as a criterion for promotion and tenure assessments. We believe that the best way forward involves focusing on paper-level and not journal-level measures. We offer some suggestions, but we fundamentally conclude that we do not know enough to make good recommendations, so we need more research on paper-level measures.

This paper categorises the ISD environment into four exemplar categories, informed by different development paradigms, namely, the Capability Maturity Model (CMM), Formalised Systems Development Methodology (FSDM), Rapid Application Development (RAD) and Accelerated Business Component Development (ABCD). One of the innovative aspects of the categorisation is that it is based directly on research into the actual practice of ISD, rather than drawing from any a priori theoretical perspectives.

At present, free software provides that opportunity. What is more, free software allows citizens to better participate in and improve upon the process of democracy. In this paper we examine this new justification for the use of free software in the public sector or government, which we label \"free software as democratic principle.\" There is growing interest in and rhetoric about the ability of free software to bring more transparency to core software infrastructure within a governmental system. Our argument is that free software should be deployed in core democratic infrastructure because it will provide the level of transparency and openness that is required for the effective functioning of democratic processes. Some free software development could be seen as an intellectual infrastructure and should then be fostered for maximum public benefit. For example, core software infrastructure for voting process or electronic court processes should be transparent, i.e. available to be monitored and understood by any member of a democratic community. It would be a sad day for the functioning of a democratic system if inherent and/or coded bias in a software program skewed the result of an election or the determination of innocence or guilt of a person in court The purpose of this article is to outline an argument of the notion of \"free software as democratic principle\"; meaning free software should be deployed in core democratic infrastructure to sponsor accountability and transparency\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["880"]}

In the 1960s, 70s and the early 80s surfing spots were relatively uncrowded. Surfers devised and abided by the unwritten rules of surfing, based on common sense and courtesy. Since the late 80s the sport has seen a spectacular increase in the number of surfers. As a result surfing has become more aggressive, particularly in the more popular surf spots like Burleigh Heads, Kirra, Byron Bay, Hawaii and the United States. This has been further exacerbated by the popularisation of a huge range of different surf crafts, such as the short and long surfboards, kneeboards, bodyboards, surfskis, sailboards, and jet skis for \u201ctow in\u201d surfing. It is fair to suggest that in today\u2019s overcrowded surf, 99% of surfers still abide by the etiquette of surfing. However, there are a small number of surfing individuals, whose surfing behaviour violates the rules of surfing and provokes verbal abuse and/or physical violence by one surfer towards another surfer. This antagonistic behaviour is commonly referred to as \u201csurf rage\u201d. The objective of the Law of the Surf Forum was to promote the universally accepted lore of surfing recognised by the surfing community so that surfing remains free of government regulative intervention and preserves the Free Spirit of Surfing.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["880"]}

There is no accepted mechanism to aid decision-makers in policy selection to determine where to promote population growth or how to select settlement specific policies to improve sustainability of urban areas.

Based on the photo in Figure 1, take a moment to make a conjecture for the graph of the light intensity as a function of your depth. Before continuing to read this article, select one of the graphs in Figure 2 which matches your conjecture. For most students, the fact that the light intensity decreases as the depth increases is intuitive. All of their conjectures illustrate this fact (Figure 2). However, students frequently disagree on the shape of the curve. These differences are a result of two informal yet incorrect observations. One belief is that if you go deep enough in the ocean, then there is no light and so the graph must reach zero. A second belief is that near the surface of the water, there is little change in the light intensity and so the curve must have an initial gradual change. This simple question of how the light intensity changes as a function of depth provides an excellent catalyst and center for the following light activity. Fig. 1 An underwater snapshot is used to launch the activity. 3In this activity, students develop exponential models, difference equations and procedures for analyzing exponential data. Students explore concepts and methods which have become fundamental in mathematics, chemistry, physics and biology. The rich context and hands-on experiments provide a strong foundation from which students can make sense of the principles and procedures involved.

{"title": "Towards general theories of software engineering.\n", "abstract": " In 2013, as a part of the SEMAT (Software Engineering Method and Theory) initiative, we organized a workshop devoted to the theme of general theories of software engineering (GTSE). The workshop, in total involving around a hundred authors, participants and program committee members, was held in conjunction with the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2013). The interest in the workshop, both during ICSE 2013 and afterward, prompted us to follow up on the theme. The current special issue of Science of Computer Programming is the result. The GTSE concept may be parsed into two parts, namely general theory and software engineering. Regarding the complicated concept general theory, it seems easier and more enlightening to provide an extensional definition, ie definition by examples, than an intensional one. Well-known general theories in other disciplines include Maxwell\u2019s equations [1], the Standard Model of particle physics [2], the Big Bang theory [3], the theory of the cell [4], probability theory [5], general equilibrium theory in economics [6], John Maynard Keynes\u2019 general theory of employment, interest and money [7], Sigmund Freud\u2019s theory of the psyche [8], and Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity [9]. Additionally, there are many general theories that are well established within their respective disciplines, but have not reached the general public, including Henry Mintzberg\u2019s general theory of organizational structure [10], Richard Easterlin\u2019s unified theory of income and happiness [11], Michael Gottfredson and Travis Hirschi\u2019s general theory of crime [12], Nobel Prize winner Gary Becker\u2019s theory of marriage\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["880"]}

{"title": "A novel method for feasibility testing urban sustainable development policies\n", "abstract": " Policy making to promote more sustainable development is a complex task due in part to the large number of both stakeholders and potential policies. Policy feasibility testing provides a guide to the viability and practicality of policy implementation and forms an important part of an evidence based policy making process. An extensive literature review has identified no standardized approach to feasibility testing. This paper addresses this knowledge gap by describing a novel method using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) for feasibility testing of policies aimed at increasing the sustainability of towns and villages in Ireland. Feasibility results are provided for 40 frequently cited policy interventions tested for 18 settlements in Ireland. Policies were selected in the arenas of transport, food, housing and urban form, energy, waste and water. Policies are feasibility tested through analysis of operational evidence from both quantitative and qualitative data sources. Following testing, policies are ranked in terms of feasibility. This research examines the effectiveness of local and national level policies and the importance of both local community involvement and central government regulation in policy success. The inter-settlement variation in feasibility testing scores prioritises policy selection and aims to reduce cherry-picking of policies to support the viewpoints of the decision maker. Although developed for an Irish urban context the methods described here may have applicability elsewhere.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["880"]}

However this suggests that instead of being a dichotomy, these research genres are actually operating as a minihierarchy in that the North American model is presented as a superior genre1.

On the basis of an empirical study, we suggest that virtual communities can be usefully leveraged for corrective, adaptive, and perfective software maintenance. Specifically, the virtual community allowed for quick discovery of bugs and a rich interaction between developers and customers in the categories of corrective and adaptive software maintenance. However, although contributing also to the perfective category of software maintenance, this was the category in which several customer suggestions for modification were actually ignored by the developers. This implies that community use is indeed beneficial for maintenance related to coding and design errors as well as for maintenance of an adaptive character.

Patent applications will be made available for peer review for a period of 6 months and there will follow a 6 month period of joint qualitative and quantitative assessment of the pilot project by IP Australia and QUT. The objective of Peer-to-Patent Australia is to improve the patent examination process and the quality of issued patents by utilising the knowledge and skills of experts in the broader community. It is a way of linking the scientific and technical expertise of anyone with an Internet connection with the expertise of a patent examiner. That community participation consists of members of the public reviewing patent applications and contributing relevant prior art references and comments within a web-based forum. The aim is to bring to light prior art, particularly non-patent prior art, that might otherwise not be identified by patent examiners. The better the prior art resources a patent examiner has at his or her disposal, the more likely a patent application will be assessed properly in terms of novelty and inventive step. The role of Peer-to-Patent Australia in this regard is to act as both a facilitator of discussion and a collector of prior art submissions. Peer-to-Patent Australia collects relevant prior art references on behalf of the reviewing community and forwards that prior art to IP Australia. Section 27 of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) allows for the Commissioner of Patents to receive submissions of prior art by third\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["880"]}
{"title": "Creative commons\n", "abstract": " This paper written by one of the Creative Commons project leaders for Australia outlines the background and operation of Creative Commons (CC) licensing which has emerged as a new form of copyright management for the Web 2.0 era. It documents examples of how CC licensing is being used including the recent adoption of it by government departments. The paper highlights that CC licensing is a voluntary mechanism and ultimately its use is a matter of choice for the copyright owner. The paper also considers key criticisms of the licence and concludes by cautioning against rejecting this new approach without further investigation.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["880"]}

{"title": "Issues for Academic Authors, Institutional Repositories, Open Access Journals and End-Users\n", "abstract": " The OAK Law Project undertook a survey of issues facing academic authors within Australia in relation to repositories, open access journals and traditional subscription based academic publishing. It looked at their awareness and understanding of repositories and open access journals, their perceptions and experiences when negotiating and entering into publishing agreements and what made them choose between traditional subscription based publishers and repositories and open access journals as vehicles for publishing their work.   This presentation outlines the results of that survey and makes suggestions as to what practical steps can be undertaken to facilitate the growth of institutional and disciplinary repositories and open access journals, including the development of publishing agreements, guides to publishing and legal frameworks that balance and satisfy authors concerns about open access\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["880"]}
{"title": "Civil jurisdiction, intellectual property and the internet\n", "abstract": " At the core of the civil litigation system is the notion of jurisdiction. In a narrow sense it refers to whether a court has the authority to hear a case in relation to specific people and activities (subject matter) but in a broader sense it also encompasses what law should be applied (choice of law), whether the court is a suitable court to hear the case (choice of court) and the enforcement of judgments. The notion of jurisdiction provides a tool for efficiently managing litigation and traditionally has been based upon notions of connection to a particular territory. In the global transnational world of the Internet the concept of jurisdiction has struggled to find a sensible meaning. Does jurisdiction lie everywhere that the Internet runs or is it more narrowly defined? In this chapter we examine recent cases concerning jurisdiction and the Internet before the courts of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in matters relating to intellectual property. We also consider decisions in Australia and the United States of America (US) and international developments in the area.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["880"]}
{"title": "Cricket or Baseball\n", "abstract": " In a recent EJIS opinion piece\u2013\u201cWhy the old world cannot publish\u201d\u2013four respected IS academics opined why it is that \u201cthe European publication record is disappointing\u201d(Lyytinen, et al., 2007). They \u201cpropose several constructive reasons\u201d for this state of affairs. These include: a \u201clack of appreciation\u201d of journal articles,\u201cweak publishing cultures\u201d, and \u201cinadequate PhD preparation\u201d, amongst others. The authors were deliberately controversial in raising these issues, and so is this panel, which will take the form of a debate. The aim is to build on the ECIS panel of last year, from which the EJIS opinion piece emerged, with a view to adding new insights into what Galliers & Meadows (2003) called a \u201cdiscipline divided\u201d. The intention is not to privilege one tradition above another, but to point out their distinctive characteristics, and to argue for diversity in IS research.

{"title": "Critical Tensions in the Evolution of Open Source Software\n", "abstract": " Routine development of software within organizations all over the world remains highly problematic. The term \u201csoftware crisis\u201d was long ago coined to refer to the tripartite software development problems: Namely, that a vast number of software projects exceed their budget, fail to conform to their development schedule, and do not work as expected when eventually delivered. In recent times, the open source software (OSS) 1 phenomenon has attracted considerable attention as a seemingly agile practice-led initiative that appears to address each of the three aspects of the software crisis: cost, time scale, and quality. Open source products are freely available for public download. Thus, the cost issue is immediately addressed. From the point of view of development speed, the collaborative, parallel efforts of globally distributed codevelopers has allowed many open source products to be developed much more quickly than conventional soft-ware. In terms of quality, many open source products are recognized for their high standards of reliability, efficiency, and robustness, and the open source phenomenon has produced several \u201ccategory killers\u201d(ie, products that remove any incentive to develop any competing products) in their respective areas\u2014Gnu/Linux, Apache, and Bind all spring to mind. The open source model also appears to harness the most scarce resource of all-talented software developers. The resulting peer review model, comprising extremely talented individuals, serves to ensure the quality of the software produced. This is the essence of the argument from OSS advocates. However, the OSS concept itself is founded on the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["880"]}
{"title": "Mid-career employees embracing technology (MEET): a case study\n", "abstract": " The importance of information technology (IT) for modern business and, indeed, research in general cannot be questioned, as its sheer pervasiveness adequately attests. However, simplistic views of technological utopianism are now being offset by accounts of technological dystopianism. Clearly organizational management have wholeheartedly subscribed to an IT future as a staggering 41 percent of total capital expenditure in US organizations currently goes on IT. However, organizations face enormous difficulty in trying to achieve successful training programmes in the use of IT. This research study involved the construction and implementation of an IT training programme for mid-career employees in a large multinational organization. Davis (1989) identified two constructs as relevant to user acceptance of technology, namely ease of use (EOU) and perceived usefulness (PU). These constructs were operationalised into a set of principles to underpin the training programme which was delivered in two phases, each specifically addressing one of Davis\u2019 constructs.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["880"]}
{"title": "New light through old windows: the interpretive foundations of the CSF concept and method\n", "abstract": " CSF are those few things that must go well for an individual or an organisation to ensure success in a business undertaking: consequently, they represent those organisational, managerial, or individual activities that must be afforded particular and continuous attention so as to achieve the level of performance necessary to achieve desired goals. Since John Rockart first introduced the concept in 1979, this simple concept has been applied in a variety of forms, by both practitioners and researchers, within the IS field. In recent years, however, the concept has fallen into disuse among the IS research community; indeed, a vox pop of IS academics revealed that the concept was considered \u2018old hat\u2019 as a research approach. There are many possible reasons for this. One explanation may be that it is, in essence, an interpretive rather than a functionalist/rationalist approach for research and praxis, as such, it would\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["880"]}
{"title": "A review and application of the critical success factors concept for research on the information systems development process\n", "abstract": " The Critical Success Factors (CSF) concept has been widely applied by both practitioners and researchers in several areas within the field of information systems (IS). Rockart's (1979) CSF method was the first to be used in IS research; it is interpretive in character and it has been employed in several studies since. Rockart\u2019s CSF approach captures the teleological nature of social action; therefore, following Visala (1991), it can be used in conjunction with the hermeneutic method to conduct interpretive research on the systems development process and its related environments. A review of the relevant literature revealed that the systems development process has not been the subject of CSF research using Rockart's (1979, 1982) original interpretive method. The primary objective of this study was to determine the systems developmentrelated CSFs of social actors involved in the systems development process, ie IS\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["880"]}
