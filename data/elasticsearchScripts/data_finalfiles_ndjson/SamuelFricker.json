In this tertiary study, 13 secondary studies were included for detailed analysis. Given the heterogeneity of the data, we were unable to perform a rigorous synthesis. Instead, we mapped the identified Agile and Lean practices, and their impacts on the project constraints described in PMBOK. From 13 secondary studies, we identified 13 Agile and Lean practices.

Model-based evaluation frameworks usually suggest universally applicable evaluation aspects but do not consider case-specific aspects. On the other hand, evaluation frameworks that are case specific, by eliciting user requirements, limit their output to the evaluation aspects suggested by the users in the early phases of system development. In addition, these case-specific approaches extract different sets of evaluation aspects from each case, making it challenging to collectively compare, unify, or aggregate the evaluation of a set of heterogeneous health information systems.Objectives: The aim of this paper is to find a method capable of suggesting evaluation aspects for a set of one or more health information systems\u2014whether similar or heterogeneous\u2014by organizing, unifying, and aggregating the quality attributes extracted from those systems and from an external evaluation framework.Methods: On the basis of the available literature in semantic networks and ontologies, a method (called Unified eValuation using Ontology; UVON) was developed that can organize, unify, and aggregate the quality attributes of several health information systems into a tree-style ontology structure.

These companies are large in number and often do not have the controls in place to prevent successful attacks, respectively are not prepared to systematically manage their cybersecurity capabilities. One of the reasons for why many SME do not adopt cybersecurity is that developers of cybersecurity solutions understand little the SME context and the requirements for successful use of these solutions. We elicit requirements by studying how cybersecurity experts provide advice to SME. The experts recommendations offer insights into what important capabilities of the solution are and how these capabilities ought to be used for mitigating cybersecurity threats. The adoption of a recommendation hints at a correct match of the solution, hence successful consideration of requirements. Abandoned recommendations point to a misalignment that can be used as a source to inquire missed requirements. Re-occurrence of adoption or abandonment decisions corroborate the presence of requirements.

Alas, for an innovator the search for the right partners and visions can be lengthy and difficult. Even though the analysis of context and problem, the identification of stakeholders, the analysis of stakeholder goals and techno-logical capabilities, and the definition of requirements belong to the cornerstones of requirements engineering, this requirements engineering problem has hardly been explored so far. In an attempt to avoid re-invention of well-tried solutions, we discovered journalism as a discipline that, as a rich body of methodical knowledge, may act as a source for the guidance of how a requirements engineer may support the launch of innovation projects.

{"title": "Towards understanding how to build strategic flexibility of an IT organization\n", "abstract": " IT organizations need to react to changes in the business, the domain (eg, regulatory issues), and the technological development. While some of these changes can be handled by adopting agile practices, others might have large, irreversible effects on the organization as a whole. While flexibility and agility have found their way into software project methodologies, IT organizations struggle with their adaptation at organizational level. This paper presents preliminary results of a grounded-theory study aimed at understanding how experienced managers handle flexibility. The results are a rich empirical source for improving flexibility of an IT organization at the strategic level and also a good starting point for further research towards generalizing agile ideas beyond software projects.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1537"]}

The 22 full papers included in this volume were carefully reviewed and selected from 31 submissions. Also included are reviewed papers summarizing the results of workshops and tutorials that were held at the Summer School as well as papers contributed by several of the invited speakers. The papers combine interdisciplinary approaches to bring together a host of perspectives, which are reflected in the topical sections: language and privacy; law, ethics and AI; biometrics and privacy; tools supporting data protection compliance; privacy classification and security assessment; privacy enhancing technologies in specific contexts.

{"title": "Framework for Analysis of Multi-Party Collaboration\n", "abstract": " In recent years, platforms have become important for allowing ecosystems to emerge that allow users to collaborate and create unprecedented forms of innovation. For the platform provider, the ecosystem represents a massive business opportunity if the platform succeeds to make the collaborations among the users value-creating and to facilitate trust. While the requirements flow for evolving existing ecosystems is understood, it is unclear how to analyse an ecosystem that is to be. In this paper, we draw on recent work on collaboration modelling in requirements engineering and propose an integrated framework for the analysis of multi-party collaboration that is to be supported by a platform. Drawing on a real-world case, we describe how the framework is applied and the results that have been obtained with it. The results indicate that the framework was useful to understand the ecosystem context for a planned\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1537"]}
{"title": "Management of Software as a Business\n", "abstract": " Product management has become an established discipline in many industries since Procter and Gamble introduced it in 1931. During the last decades, most software product companies\u2014such as Microsoft, IBM, and Google\u2014have implemented Software Product Management (SPM). So did a few corporate information technology organizations in essentially all industries, as well as some companies that produce software embedded in software-intensive products and services. The role of software product manager has emerged during this time as being of strategic value since it is crucial to the economic success of a product.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1537"]}
{"title": "Systematic mapping of technology-enabled product innovations\n", "abstract": " Many new products, or services offered as a product, are expected to solve customer problems in new ways or exploit available technology in new or better ways. To innovate, a company needs to have a reliable understanding of the state-of-the-art. That need concerns both, an understanding of the problems that may be addressed and the solutions that have been explored and tried so far. This paper proposes systematic mappings as a method for reviewing the state-of-the-art in a technological or application domain. The method complements bespoke and experience-based approaches by guiding the identification of repositories with information about innovation projects and the analysis and interpretation of the data provided by these repositories. The paper describes the method, demonstrates its application with an example initiated by real-world innovation need, and discusses the potential benefits and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1537"]}
{"title": "1st international requirements engineering efficiency workshop: REEW 2011\n", "abstract": " Requirements engineering research has for a long time focused on specification quality, leading to recommendations of how to engineer \"perfect\" requirements specifications. Practitioners, however, do not have the time, resources, and interests for overdoing requirements engineering. Rather, many situations call for shortcuts that allow investing effort in those concerns that are critical for success, while reducing effort in other areas where risk is comparably smaller. The social context, smart collaboration processes, and novel ways of looking at the interface between stakeholders and the supplier can be a basis to increase the yield of requirements engineering, while reducing required effort. The International Requirements Engineering Efficiency Workshop (REEW 2011) aimed at initiating, facilitating, and nurturing the discussion on efficient approaches to engineer just goodenough requirements.
