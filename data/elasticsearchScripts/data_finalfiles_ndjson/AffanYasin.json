These diverse information sources once aggregated can provide a valuablefuture reference for personal online digital identity and credits check. The primary objective of this paper is to propose a systematic framework for aggregating online identity and reputation information, to provide a holistic approach to personal online behavioral ratings. Major contributions include: An identity aggregation mechanism based on social dependency network is proposed, a smart contract management framework referring to personal online ratings based on the aggregated digital identity, an experiment implementation based on blockchain technology, with illustrative examples and theoretical evaluations to the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "77\n", "authors": ["1558"]}
{"title": "Improving software security awareness using a serious game\n", "abstract": " Protecting people from cyber threats imposes great challenges, not only technically, but also socially. To achieve the intended level of awareness, software security principles need to be shown with concrete examples during security education. This study aims to design a serious game integrating software security knowledge and concepts into the processes to make it more engaging to learn while playing. In this paper, we have: (i) designed a serious game to compensate the deficiencies in the literature; (ii) performed empirical evaluations including survey, brainstorming and observation to the proposed game. Results: Our study shows that: (i) Cyber Security-Requirements Awareness Game (CSRAG) has a positive effect on players security learning outcomes, level of engagement and participation; (ii) Game-based learning can be an effective way of teaching security related scenarios.", "num_citations": "26\n", "authors": ["1558"]}
{"title": "On the quality of grey literature and its use in information synthesis during systematic literature reviews\n", "abstract": " Context: The internet has become a vital channel for disseminating and accessing scientific literature for both the academic and industrial research needs. Nowadays, everyone has wide access to scientific literature repositories, which comprise of both \u201cwhite\u201d and \u201cgrey\u201d literature. The \u201cgrey\u201d literature, as opposed to \u201cwhite\u201d literature, is non-peer reviewed scientific information that is not available using commercial information sources such as IEEE or ACM. A large number of software engineering researchers are undertaking systematic literature reviews (SLRs) to investigate empirical evidence in software engineering. The key reason to include grey literature during information synthesis is to minimize the risk of any bias in the publication. Using the state of the art non-commercial databases that index information, the researchers can make the rigorous process of searching empirical studies in SLRs easier. This study explains the evidence of grey literature while performing synthesis in Systematic Literature Reviews.Objectives: The goals of this thesis work are,", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["1558"]}
{"title": "Contemplating social engineering studies and attack scenarios: A review study\n", "abstract": " The previous year has seen an enormous increase in the studies related to social engineering. This increase is partly due to increasing number of social engineering attacks and partly due to people's inability to identify the attack. Thus, it is of great importance to find solutions which are helpful for human to understand the social engineering attacks and scenarios. To address this, we have performed a literature review of studies (on social engineering) in top\u2010notch journals and conferences. In this paper, we have enlisted the types of attacks, and the persuasion techniques used by social engineers as listed in the literature. We also combined different theories which researchers tried to use to explain various activities of social engineers. Furthermore, we have mentioned that a better understanding of the social engineering attack scenarios can be done using thematic and game\u2010based analysis techniques\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["1558"]}

Given the prevalent popularity of simulation system, it is important to understand and adopt simulation system to develop future educational plans. This paper addresses how simulation system enhances student collaborative learning and learner performance using Technology Acceptance Model. Results were analyzed using Structure Equation Modeling technique; this study established that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived enjoyment all have a significant positive relationship with simulation system. The results indicate that simulation system serves as a dynamic tool to accelerate the progress of learning environments by encouraging collaboration and communication among students which strengthen their learning abilities and increase performance because students practically\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["1558"]}

The main objective of requirements engineering for big data is to capture big data service users\u2019 needs and provider\u2019s capabilities, and to identify value added service use cases for big data technology in a given organizational context. Major objectives may include: collect real-time data about the world, search for useful information in large data sets, gain insights about given problems by data analytics, predict possible trend of interesting subjects, and make decisions for the next immediate actions. In this paper, we propose a big data service requirements analysis framework, which aims to provide useful guidelines for eliciting service requirements, selecting the right services architectures and evaluate the available technological services implementations.

In GSE projects, a steady flow of communication and coordination between the team members is required throughout the project. Communication and coordination make top in the list of challenges currently faced by GSE projects. Geographically dispersed teams members often face lack of coordination problems because of minimal communication. In GSE, teams coordinate on different level from requirement engineering (RE) phase to project deployment phase. Our main focus in this research was achieving coordination between dispersed GSE teams of requirements engineers, software designers and software developer.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1558"]}
