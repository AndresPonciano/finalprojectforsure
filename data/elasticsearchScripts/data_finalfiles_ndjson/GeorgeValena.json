{"title": "A theory of power in emerging software ecosystems formed by small-to-medium enterprises\n", "abstract": " In a software ecosystem, partner companies rely on each other to succeed and survive. This scenario of mutual dependence entails a flow of power among companies. Power is an intrinsic property of their relationship and an asset to be exercised with a degree of intentionality. This paper presents a substantive theory to explain how power and dependence manifest in partnerships among small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) building a software ecosystem. We performed exploratory case studies of two emerging software ecosystems formed by SMEs. We interpreted the results in light of a theoretical framework underpinned by French and Raven's power taxonomy. Finally, we performed a cross-case analysis to evaluate our findings and build the theory. The proposed theory highlights the interactions among different forms of power and corresponding sources of power employed by companies.

BPM governance emphasizes not only the accountability and control of BPM initiatives, but also provides the mechanisms to ensure that BPM delivers desirable results. Despite growing research identifying the importance of BPM governance, there has been limited number of empirical studies investigating this issue. In this paper, we adopt existing BPM governance elements presented in the literature to investigate how these elements are embraced by public organizations. We conducted case studies with four public organizations in Brazil. All organizations are involved in BPM initiatives with varying levels of maturity. The results suggest that strong sponsorship, suitable BPM training and availability of internal staff with BPM expertise are key success factors for these initiatives.

This paper investigates how BPM practices are adopted by Brazilian public organizations. We conducted case studies with two Brazilian public organizations to investigate how the interaction of barriers and facilitators influence the evolution of their BPM initiatives. A System Dynamics approach is proposed as a diagnosis tool to analyze the current performance of BPM initiatives. Systemic archetypes were created to represent specific combinations of virtuous reinforcement and balancing cycles among barriers and facilitators. We identified that support from top management and lack of team skills and competencies in BPM are key factors influencing the evolution of BPM initiatives\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["756"]}

Five professionals group with experience (specialists) in BPM initiatives in the public sector attended the first focus. The second was performed in a public organization that is conducting a three-year old BPM initiative. It was evidenced that many strategies suggested by specialists are being applied by the public organization investigated in the second focus group. In addition, other strategies were cited to manage the FCS.

These time-bounded, intensive, collaborative and solution-oriented events enable companies to generate several ideas, some of which can be used to evolve their products and services. Hackathons are means to gather feedback from outside to innovate. Companies also follow such open innovation trend by raising software ecosystems via a platformisation process. They create platforms so that third parties can develop new software solutions and in doing so extend the current product portfolio. In this scenario, a hackathon can be seen as a strategy to support ecosystem evolution. Therefore, we decided to conduct a systematic mapping study to investigate the benefits that hackathons can provide to software ecosystems.
