{"title": "Severity of depression and response to antidepressants and placebo: an analysis of the Food and Drug Administration database\n", "abstract": " Some studies suggest that more severely ill patients with depression respond well to antidepressants and poorly to placebo, whereas those who are mildly ill respond equally well to antidepressants and placebo. This notion has implications for the design of clinical trials. To further assess and substantiate these putative predictors of antidepressant and placebo response, we assessed the Food and Drug Administration database of 45 phase II and III antidepressant clinical trials. The frequency of statistically significant differences between antidepressants and placebo was higher in the trials that included patients with more severe depression. In the antidepressant-treated groups, the magnitude of symptom reduction was signif-icantly related to mean initial Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) score; the higher the mean initial HAM-D score, the larger the change.

Engine nodes in the engine tier can process SIP messages and can read/write state information from/to the state tier. State tier can maintain state information in a set of partitions of one or more replicas which contain duplicate information. The engine nodes can be adapted to detect and report replica failures and the replicas can in turn be adapted to detect and report engine node failures. Replicas can detect faults with an engine node if the engine node fails to poll the replica for a specified period of time and can then report the failure. The engine node can detect failures of a replica when reading or writing state information and can report the failure to another replica, which can be responsible for updating the partition view to exclude dead replicas.", "num_citations": "226\n", "authors": ["333"]}

{"title": "A comprehensive review on wheat flour dough rheology\n", "abstract": " The applications of rheology to the main processes encountered during bread making (mixing, fermentation and baking) are reviewed. Factors affecting dough rheology and influences of various additives on the rheological properties of flour doughs are illustrated and the component interactions are emphasized. The most commonly used rheological test methods and their relationships to product functionality are reviewed. Rheological testing has become a powerful and preferred approach for examining the structure and the fundamental properties of wheat flour doughs because of its characteristic and sensitive response to the structure variation of wheat flour doughs. It is shown that the most commonly used method for rheological testing of doughs, shear oscillation dynamic rheology, is generally used under deformation conditions inappropriate for bread making and shows little relationship with end-use performance. The frequency range used in conventional shear oscillation tests is limited to the plateau region, which is insensitive to changes in the HMW glutenin polymers thought to be responsible for variations in baking quality. Molecular size and structure of the gluten polymers that make up the major structural components of wheat are related to their rheological properties via modern polymer rheology concepts. Interactions between polymer chain entanglements and branching are seen to be the key mechanisms determining the rheology of HMW polymers.Introduction\u2013what is rheology?", "num_citations": "49\n", "authors": ["333"]}

{"title": "Cities and development\n", "abstract": " For the first time in human history more people now live and towns and cities than in rural areas. In the wealthier countries of the world, the transition from predominantly rural to urban habitation is more or less complete. But in many parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America, urban populations are expanding rapidly. Current UN projections indicate that virtually all population growth in the world over the next 30 years will be absorbed by towns and cities in developing countries. These simple demographic facts have profound implications for those concerned with understanding and addressing the pressing global development challenges of reducing poverty, promoting economic growth, improving human security and confronting environmental change. This revised and expanded second edition of Cities and Development explores the dynamic relationship between urbanism and development from a global perspective. The book surveys a wide range of topics, including: the historical origins of world urbanization; the role cities play in the process of economic development; the nature of urban poverty and the challenge of promoting sustainable livelihoods; the complexities of managing urban land, housing, infrastructure and urban services; and the spectres of endemic crime, conflict and violence in urban areas. This updated volume also contains two entirely new chapters: one that examines the links between urbanisation and environmental change, and a second that focuses on urban governance and politics. Adopting a multidisciplinary perspective, the book critically engages with debates in urban studies, geography and international development\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "46\n", "authors": ["333"]}

The advent of smart appliances and intelligent sensors have increased the realization of home energy management systems. Acquiring balance between energy consumption and user comfort is in the spotlight when the performance of the smart home is evaluated. Appliances of heating, ventilation and air conditioning constitute up to 64% of energy consumption in residential buildings. A number of research works have shown that fuzzy logic system integrated with other techniques is used with the main objective of energy consumption minimization. However, user comfort is often sacrificed in these techniques. In this paper, we have proposed a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) that uses humidity as an additional input parameter in order to maintain the thermostat set-points according to user comfort. Additionally, we have used indoor room temperature variation as a feedback to proposed FIS in order to get the better energy consumption. As the number of rules increase, the task of defining them in FIS becomes time consuming and eventually increases the chance of manual errors. We have also proposed the automatic rule base generation using the combinatorial method. The proposed techniques are evaluated using Mamdani FIS and Sugeno FIS. The proposed method provides a flexible and energy efficient decision-making system that maintains the user thermal comfort with the help of intelligent sensors. The proposed FIS system requires less memory and low processing power along with the use of sensors, making it possible to be used in the IoT operating system eg, RIOT\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "45\n", "authors": ["333"]}

However, when considering Ti6Al4V alloy, these objectives turn out to be difficult to achieve as titanium alloys pose serious machinability challenges, especially at elevated temperatures. In this research, we investigate the optimal machining parameters required for turning of Ti6Al4V alloy. Turning experiments were performed to optimize four response parameters, i.e., specific cutting energy (SCE), wear rate (R), surface roughness (Ra), and material removal rate (MRR) with uncoated H13 carbide inserts in the dry cutting environment. Grey relational analysis (GRA) combined with the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was performed to develop a multi-objective function.

{"title": "Biodegradation of malathion by Bacillus licheniformis strain ML-1\n", "abstract": " Malathion, a well-known organophosphate pesticide, has been used in agriculture over the last two decades for controlling pests of economically important crops. In the present study, a single bacterium, ML-1, was isolated by soil-enrichment technique and identified as Bacillus licheniformis on the basis of the 16S rRNA technique. The bacterium was grown in carbon-free minimal salt medium (MSM) and was found to be very efficient in utilizing malathion as the sole source of carbon. Biodegradation experiments were performed in MSM without carbon source to determine the malathion degradation by the selected strain, and the residues of malathion were determined quantitatively using HPLC techniques. Bacillus licheniformis showed very promising results and efficiently consumed malathion as the sole carbon source via malathion carboxylesterase (MCE), and about 78% malathion was degraded within 5 days. The carboxylesterase activity was determined by using crude extract while using malathion as substrate, and the residues were determined by HPLC. It has been found that the MCE hydrolyzed 87% malathion within 96 h of incubation. Characterization of crude MCE revealed that the enzyme is robust in nature in terms of organic solvents, as it was found to be stable in various concentrations of ethanol and acetonitrile. Similarly, and it can work in a wide pH and temperature range. The results of this study highlighted the potential of Bacillus licheniformis strain ML-1 as a biodegrader that can be used for the bioremediation of malathion-contaminated soil.", "num_citations": "31\n", "authors": ["333"]}

Diabetes mellitus is associated with increased lipid peroxidation. Increased levels of lipid peroxides have been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications. To control and reduce the deleterious effects of lipid peroxides exist several antioxidant protective mechanisms. They comprise of enzymatic defenses and naturally occurring vitamins. The study was designed to determine and compare the antioxidant vitamin levels in Type II diabetic individuals and control healthy subjects. Methods: Blood glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-c, LDL-c, VLDL-c and antioxidant vitamins (\u03b2-Carotene, A, E, and C) levels were determined in 36 Type II diabetic patients and 30 healthy subjects. Results: Values of blood glucose and lipid parameters were observed to be significantly increased (P< 0.001) with the exception of HDL-c, which was significantly decreased (p< 0.001) in Type II diabetes mellitus patients. The levels of antioxidant vitamins (\u03b2-Carotene, E, and C) were found to be significantly low in Type II diabetes mellitus group whereas the concentration of vitamin A showed a non-significant change when both Type II and control healthy groups were compared. Conclusions: Low levels of antioxidant vitamins observed in the study suggest, that Type II diabetes mellitus patients have significant defects of antioxidant protection.", "num_citations": "30\n", "authors": ["333"]}

{"title": "Durability challenges in software engineering\n", "abstract": " Practices shows that the software quality is not that high as it could be. Development organizations spend a relatively large amount of money and effort on fixing quality issues during late stage development of software. One of the qualities of software that has received significant attention in recent years is durable serviceability. Software with poor durability is likely to fail in a highly competitive market; therefore, software developing organizations are paying more attention towards ensuring the durability of their software. To be able to develop durable software cost-effectively, there is a need to investigate the connection between durability characteristics and software. In software engineering, durability depends on four characteristics mainly; ie trustworthiness, human trust, dependability and usability of software. To address the relationship between these characteristics, software designers analyze the durability requirements which may need to be implemented to fulfill these specific requirements of software serviceability. The main objective of this article is to gain an in-depth understanding of the relationship between software and durability characteristics.", "num_citations": "29\n", "authors": ["333"]}

While this has been repeatedly documented in developed nations, there have been limited studies in the English-speaking Caribbean. This study therefore sought to assess the prevalence of alcohol, tobacco and marijuana use among university students in the English-speaking Caribbean and any associated risk factors. Methods: The study was designed as a descriptive, cross-sectional study to assess substance use in fulltime, undergraduate students of The University of the West Indies (UWI), Trinidad and Tobago, over a six-month period. Questionnaires were distributed and students asked to self-report on their use of alcohol, tobacco and marijuana during the preceding six months. Results: The six-month prevalence rate for alcohol was 70% and 28% of students were identified as regular users. Binge drinking was estimated at 31%. Muslims were least likely to have used alcohol when compared to other religious groupings. The prevalence rate for tobacco and marijuana was 17% and 13%, respectively. Ten per cent used all three substances. The use of all three substances was associated with multiple problems.Conclusion: We conclude that substance use is common among many students of the UWI but generally lower than reports from other regions of the world.

{"title": "Genetic Determinants for Pyomelanin Production and Its Protective Effect against Oxidative Stress in Ralstonia solanacearum\n", "abstract": " Ralstonia solanacearum is a soil-borne plant pathogen that infects more than 200 plant species. Its broad host range and long-term survival under different environmental stress conditions suggest that it uses a variety of mechanisms to protect itself against various types of biotic and abiotic stress. R. solanacearum produces a melanin-like brown pigment in the stationary phase when grown in minimal medium containing tyrosine. To gain deeper insight into the genetic determinants involved in melanin production, transposon-inserted mutants of R. solanacearum strain SL341 were screened for strains with defective melanin-producing capability. In addition to one mutant already known to be involved in pyomelanin production (viz., strain SL341D, with disruption of the hydroxphenylpyruvate dioxygenase gene), we identified three other mutants with disruption in the regulatory genes rpoS, hrpG, and oxyR, respectively. Wild-type SL341 produced pyomelanin in minimal medium containing tyrosine whereas the mutant strains did not. Likewise, homogentisate, a major precursor of pyomelanin, was detected in the culture filtrate of the wild-type strain but not in those of the mutant strains. A gene encoding hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase exhibited a significant high expression in wild type SL341 compared to other mutant strains, suggesting that pyomelanin production is regulated by three different regulatory proteins. However, analysis of the gene encoding homogentisate dioxygenase revealed no significant difference in its relative expression over time in the wild-type SL341 and mutant strains, except for SL341D, at 72 h incubation.

Although the mechanisms underlying overgeneral memory are quite clear, the search strategy operated within the autobiographical knowledge base, at time of recollection, requires further exploration. The current study aimed to examine the hierarchical search sequence used to recall autobiographical memories in depressed and non-depressed participants, with a view to determining whether depressed participants exhibited truncated search strategies. Thirteen depressed and an equal number of non-depressed participants retrieved 15 memories each, in response to 15 commonly used cue words. Participants reported the first memory that entered in their mind. All memory descriptions were recorded and later transcribed verbatim for content analysis. Depressed participants retrieved autobiographical memories faster, produced shorter memory descriptions and were less likely to recall positive memories than non-depressed participants. Non-depressed participants were more likely to commence retrieval by accessing lifetime period knowledge followed by general event and event specific knowledge, whereas depressed participants showed a tendency to terminate retrieval at the general event level. It is concluded that depressed participants do adhere to the same hierarchical search strategy as non-depressed participants when retrieving specific autobiographical memories, but that they\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["333"]}

Platelet concentrates (PC) which were made from these units were stored at either room temperature (22 C) or at 4 C. In order to isolate small numbers of bacteria from a PC (i.e., 1 to 10 organisms per ml), substantial contamination (42 to 125 organisms per ml) of the whole blood was required. If the PC were stored at room temperature, all organisms except Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which was apparently killed, grew out of control within 48 hours. Storage of PC at 4 C resulted in the general maintenance of bacterial numbers. Since gross contamination of PC has only occasionally been reported, we conclude that past reports of modest contamination of platelet concentrates are primarily sampling artifacts.", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["333"]}

Currently, reducing the cost and time invested in maintenance is a major challenge for the practitioners. Moreover, symmetrical and optimal maintenance is the need of the hour and it can be achieved by increasing the durability of software. Many attributes of the quality may affect the durability of the software and identification of durability attributes is a crucial task at the early stage of software development. Thus, it is a problem that contains multi-criteria within it. With the help of quantitative estimation, software durability may be assessed symmetrically and increased. In this row, the authors of this article have attempted to posit an effective technique to assess the durability of software. Based on empirical data through research, the presenters of this article suggest that fuzzy-based symmetrical method of Analytic Network Process (ANP) and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) would be an accurate methodology for assessing the durability of software. For determining the efficacy of this assessment, the researchers took six alternative software of a University.

{"title": "Lifetime maximization via hole alleviation in iot enabling heterogeneous wireless sensor networks\n", "abstract": " In Internet of Things (IoT) enabled Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), there are two major factors which degrade the performance of the network. One is the void hole which occurs in a particular region due to unavailability of forwarder nodes. The other is the presence of energy hole which occurs due to imbalanced data traffic load on intermediate nodes. Therefore, an optimum transmission strategy is required to maximize the network lifespan via hole alleviation. In this regard, we propose a heterogeneous network solution that is capable to balance energy dissipation among network nodes. In addition, the divide and conquer approach is exploited to evenly distribute number of transmissions over various network areas. An efficient forwarder node selection is performed to alleviate coverage and energy holes. Linear optimization is performed to validate the effectiveness of our proposed work in term of energy minimization. Furthermore, simulations are conducted to show that our claims are well grounded. Results show the superiority of our work as compared to the baseline scheme in terms of energy consumption and network lifetime. View Full-Text", "num_citations": "23\n", "authors": ["333"]}

It becomes more critical issue when we transmit important data between nodes. There are a lot of attacks available in wireless sensor network or mobile ad hoc network. In our paper we are going to discuss about a particularly devastating attack, known as the wormhole attack. In wormhole attack, an attacker forms two or more malicious nodes in the network at different locations. These nodes are connected with the help of low latency link. As a result of this way two or more malicious nodes create a higher level virtual tunnel in the network. This virtual tunnel is used for sending the packets between the end points of tunnel. Whenever transmission starts between a source to destination, adversary try to record transmitted packets at one location in the network and tunnels all captured packets to another location. The wormhole attack is possible even if the attacker has not compromised with any hosts and even if all communication provides authenticity and confidentiality. The wormhole attack can form a serious threat in wireless networks, especially against many ad hoc network routing protocols and location-based wireless security systems. In this paper, we analyze the nature of wormhole attack in ad hoc and wireless sensor networks and existing methods of the defending mechanism to detect wormhole attacks without require any specialized hardware.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["333"]}

We aimed to evaluate the distribution of TCS resistance determinants in major pathogenic bacteria (N = 231) and to assess the enrichment of potentially pathogenic genera in TCS contaminated environments. A TCS-resistant gene (TRG) database was constructed and experimentally validated to predict TCS resistance in major pathogenic bacteria. Genome-wide in silico analysis was performed to define the distribution of TCS-resistant determinants in major pathogens. Microbiome analysis of TCS contaminated soil samples was also performed to investigate the abundance of TCS-resistant pathogens. We experimentally confirmed that TCS resistance could be accurately predicted using genome-wide in silico analysis against TRG database. Predicted TCS resistant phenotypes were observed in all of the tested bacterial strains (N = 17), and heterologous expression of selected TCS resistant genes from those strains conferred expected levels of TCS resistance in an alternative host Escherichia coli. Moreover, genome-wide analysis revealed that potential TCS resistance determinants were abundant among the majority of human-associated pathogens (79%) and soil-borne plant pathogenic bacteria (98%).

In addition, due to huge investment in secure software development, durability of security is in much demand. However, selecting the right model for software development is becoming more challenging for developers day by day. Security durability attributes play a vital role while designing security during software development. Each attribute has its own importance while integrating durable security during early stage of software development life cycle. This is based upon user\u2019s demand and sensitivity of information. Hence, developers need to know about the importance of each attribute when they are developing software to fulfill user\u2019s demand. In this paper, authors have proposed an approach for prioritization of these attributes using Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (Fuzzy AHP) method. Literature survey reveals that the key attributes of durable security are trustworthiness, dependability and human trust. This will help developers to improve the security for longer.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["333"]}
{"title": "Prevention mechanism for infrastructure based denial-of-service attack over software defined network\n", "abstract": " In software Defined Networking a Denial-of-Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make a machine or network resources unavailable for its intended users. Hence the need for protection of such network controller against attacks from within or outside a network is very much important. Although network devices in open flow can also be targeted by attackers and so required a prevention mechanism in order to avoid problems in smooth packet forwarding. In this research task we compose an Infrastructure based DoS attacking scenario over the software defined network and address the vulnerabilities in flow table, and afterward we developed a prevention mechanism to avoid such kind of attack in its initial stage before harming our network. The scenarios for the Infrastructure based DoS attack are developed using Mininet 2.2.0 and platform used for the simulation is Linux\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["333"]}

The performance of GNSS receiver is strongly influenced by the acquisition time. Acquisition provides rough estimate of code delay and Doppler frequency values of the received signal which plays very important role to synchronize local code with the received one. GNSS receiver effectiveness is usually the measure of the mean acquisition time. Simulation shows that time domain acquisition using serial search method requires very large acquisition time compared to parallel acquisition in time or frequency domain.

{"title": "Testability estimation framework\n", "abstract": " Testability has always been an elusive concept and its correct measurement or evaluation a difficult exercise. Most of the studies measure testability or more precisely the attributes that have impact on testability but at the source code level. Though, testability measurement at the source code level is a good indicator of effort estimation, it leads to the late arrival of information in the development process. A decision to change the design in order to improve testability after coding has started may be very expensive and error-prone. While estimating testability early in the development process may greatly reduce the overall cost. This paper provides a roadmap to industry personnel and researchers to assess, and preferably, quantify software testability in design phase. A prescriptive framework has been proposed in order to integrate testability within the development life cycle.

{"title": "A fuzzy multi-objective covering-based security quantification model for mitigating risk of web based medical image processing system\n", "abstract": " Medical image processing is one of the most active research areas and has big impact on the health sector. With the arrival of intelligent processes, web based medical image processing has become simple and errorless. Web based application is now used extensively for medical image processing. Large amount of medical data is generated daily with more and more data being shared over public and private networks for the diagnosis of diseases through the web based image processing systems. Medical images like that of the CT (Computed Tomography) scan, MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), X-Ray and Ultrasound images, etc., contain highly personal data of the patients. This data needs to be secured from intruders. Medical images are more sensitive to external interruption and manipulation in data may cause changes in the result. Data breaches in medical cases can lead to wrong diagnosis or even more fatal possibilities with life threatening results. So, security in web based medical image processing is a major issue. However, ensuring security for the medical images while preserving the characteristics of confidentiality, integrity, availability, etc., of medical images poses a major challenge. Working towards a feasible solution, in this study, authors are using a list of criteria for checking security level of the web based image processing system. We propose Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) combined with Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) in the list of criteria that affect the security assessment in medical image processing.

Utilization of partographs allow for early identification of abnormal labour and referral for advanced care to Emergency Obstetric Care (EmOC) facilities. A systematic assessment of the quality of partograph utilization in clinical-decision making will contribute to understanding the use of the tool by health workers.   Methods In 2013, the USAID supported MaMoni HSS project, led in country by Save the Children, trained FWVs on the use of partographs in five UH&FWCs in Habiganj district. As part of the follow-up after training, intrapartum case record forms, accompanying partographs, and referral registers for all obstetric cases managed in these five facilities from July 2013 to June 2014 were reviewed. Partographs were reviewed to identify abnormal labour cases based on pre-defined indications. All referred cases were ascertained from the case records in the referral registers. Five health workers were interviewed to assess their knowledge, attitude and experience in partograph use and to explore the challenges for referral decision making associated with the tool.   Results A total of 1,198 deliveries were managed at the study sites, of which 663 presented with cervical dilatation of 8 cm or less. Partographs were initiated in 98% of these cases.

However, fertilizers are one of the major causes of heavy metal pollution. In our study, we aimed to assess silicate and phosphate solubilization by the bacteria Enterobacter ludwigii GAK2, in the presence and absence of phosphate [Ca3 (PO4) 2] or silicate (Mg2O8Si3), to counteract cadmium stress in rice (Oryza sativa L). Our results showed that the GAK2-treated rice plants, grown in soil amended with phosphate [Ca3 (PO4) 2] or silicate (Mg2O8Si3), had significantly reduced cadmium content, and enhanced plant growth promoting characteristics including fresh shoot and root weight, plant height, and chlorophyll content. These plants showed significant downregulation of the cadmium transporter gene, OsHMA2, and upregulation of the silicon carrier gene, OsLsi1. Moreover, jasmonic acid levels were significantly reduced in the GAK2-inoculated plants, and this was further supported by the downregulation of the jasmonic acid related gene, OsJAZ1. These results indicate that Enterobacter ludwigii GAK2 can be used as a silicon and phosphorus bio-fertilizer, which solubilizes insoluble silicate and phosphate, and mitigates heavy metal toxicity in crops.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["333"]}

These protocols help particular organization to successfully send the traffic from source to destination without loss of many packets. In case of the failure of one system, there is a standby system which automatically activates itself and continues sending the traffic. The HSRP protocol and GLBP protocol are Cisco propriety whereas the VRRP protocol is the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standard. The paper contains the detail information of the protocols, their working and comparison between them. The comparison indicates that which protocol is best in which scenario and which is best among the three protocols. These protocols work on layer 3 devices that are on the Transport layer. The protocols are capable of transferring the traffic if one of the routers of the network goes down due to some technical fault. The FHRP includes different kind of protocols but the paper contains three main protocols that are HSRP, VRRP and GLBP.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["333"]}
{"title": "Estimation of genetic parameters in soybean for yield and morphological characters\n", "abstract": " The present study was carried out to estimate the important genetic parameters such as genotypic coefficient of variance (GCV), phenotypic coefficient of variance (PCV), heritability (h 2), expected genetic advance (GA) and genetic advance as percent of mean (GAM) for nine quantitative traits of soybean (Glycine max L). The study was conducted during Kharif 2013 at Agriculture Research Institute (North) Mingora Swat. The field was laid down in randomized complete block design with three replications. The results indicated that PCV was greater than GCV for all traits except oil contents where PCV and GCV were equal. The PCV and GCV values ranged between 24% and 28% for number of pods plant-1, and 4% and 3% for days to maturity, respectively. Highest heritability was observed for oil contents (99%) and lowest heritability were observed for days to pod formation (31%). Most of the parameters exhibited high heritability including 100 seed weight, grain yield ha-1 and oil contents (? 85%), while days to pod formation, and pod length revealed moderate heritability. Expected genetic advance ranged between 1.78 (oil contents) and 780.80 (seed yield ha-1), while genetic advance as percent of mean ranged from 36.93 (number of pods plant-1) to 4.76 (days to maturity). Economically important characters including pod numbers plant-1, 100 seed weight and seed yield exhibited high variability and heritability with moderate genetic advance as percent of mean. It can be concluded that these characters may be used as selection tool in future breeding programs.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["333"]}
{"title": "Software security testing: a pertinent framework\n", "abstract": " Different surveys point toward that over the past several years\u2019 software security has raised its precedence for many software organizations. Software security testing is upgraded with the help of security attributes, security models, testing tools and most importantly test case used in testing. Software security testing was once considered a technical obligation performed by software developers. At that time, software security was much important during the test phase of software development life cycle. Present time an emergent number of security incidents and a growing awareness among business owners about invalidated software due to security issues have moved security testing into software world of testers. It is often impossible to find all the errors in a program. This basics problem in testing thus arise an open question, as to what would be the policy that we would adopt for testing. Thus now security testing is important in each phase of development life cycle. Here is a proposed framework is finalized for that security testing.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["333"]}

Texture is an innate property of virtually all surfaces, the grain of wood, the weave of fabric, the pattern of crop in fields etc It contains important information about the structural arrangement of surfaces and their relationship to the surrounding environment. Since the textural properties of images appear to carry useful information, for discriminating purpose features have always been calculated for textures.The paper deals with the pattern classification using texture features. The features used in the project are standard deviation and entropy of all parts obtained after 3rd level decomposition using DWT. A mean feature vector is calculated and is used for classification. For classification distance similarity is used. The different distances used are Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, Bray Curtis distance and Canberra distance. The efficiency of classification is calculated for each distance and is compared.

The study was designed to determine and compare the levels of oxidative stress and iron indices in Coronary Heart Disease and healthy individuals. Material and Methods: Blood malondialdehyde, iron, total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation and ferretin levels were determined in 140 Coronary Heart Disease and 100 healthy subjects. Results: Values of blood malondialdehyde, iron, transferrin saturation and ferretin were observed to be significantly increased with exception of total iron-binding capacity, which was significantly decreased (p< 0.005) in Coronary Heart Disease patients when compared with normal healthy controls. Conclusion: Elevated serum malondialdehyde, iron concentration and body iron stores in patients reveal a possible role of iron indices in the development of coronary atherosclerosis. Therefore, it is suggested by this study that levels of malondialdehyde and biochemical markers of body iron stores can be used as an early investigative tool for assessing the oxidative stress in coronary heart disease.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["333"]}

System reliability, by definition, includes all parts of the system, including hardware, software, supporting infrastructure (including critical external interfaces), operators and procedures. Software reliability is a key part in software quality. The study of software reliability can be categorized into three parts: modeling, measurement and improvement. Software reliability modeling has matured to the point that meaningful results can be obtained by applying suitable models to the problem. There are many models exist, but no single model can capture a necessary amount of the software characteristics. Assumptions and abstractions must be made to simplify the problem. There is no single model that is universal to all the situations. Software reliability measurement is naive. In this paper, we propose various machine learning approaches or techniques for the assessment of software reliability such as fuzzy approach, neuro-fuzzy approach, artificial neural network approach, genetic algorithm approach, Bayesian classification approach, support vector machine (SVM) approach, Self-organizing map approach.

Our objective is to present a systematic method of carrying out optimal design of novel types of electrostatic beams that have enhanced travel ranges. In this paper, we implement a shape optimization methodology using simulated annealing to maximize the static pull-in ranges of electrostatically actuated micro-cantilever beams. We use the Rayleigh-Ritz potential energy minimization technique to compute the pull-in displacement and voltage of each micro cantilever beam. A versatile parametric width function is used to characterize non-prismatic micro-cantilever geometries and the pull-in displacement of the cantilever is maximized with respect to the parameters of the proposed width function. Geometric constraints encountered in typical MEMS applications are incorporated into the optimization scheme using a penalty method. The simulated annealing algorithm uses different cooling schedules with the same number of objective function computations. We consider a matrix of several test cases in order to successfully demonstrate the utility of the proposed methodology. Our results indicate that an increase in the pull-in displacement of as much as 20% can be obtained by using our optimization approach. We have also compared our results with those obtained using traditional optimization approaches. We find the results are fairly independent of the cooling schedule used which demonstrates the usefulness and flexibility of this method to carry out optimal design of structural elements under\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["333"]}

Bacterial wilt resistance of tomato is a function of the quantitative trait of tomato plants, however, the mechanism underlying quantitative resistance is unexplored. In this study, we hypothesized that rhizosphere microbiota affects the resistance of tomato plants against soil-borne bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum. This hypothesis was tested using a tomato cultivar grown in a defined soil with various microbiota transplants. The bacterial wilt-resistant Hawaii 7996 tomato cultivar exhibited marked suppression and induction of disease severity after treatment with upland soil-derived and forest soil-derived microbiotas, respectively, whereas the transplants did not affect the disease severity in the susceptible tomato cultivar Moneymaker. The differential resistance of Hawaii 7996 to bacterial wilt was abolished by diluted or heat-killed microbiota transplantation. Microbial community analysis revealed the transplant-specific distinct community structure in the tomato rhizosphere and the significant enrichment of specific microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the rhizosphere of the upland soil microbiota-treated Hawaii 7996. These results suggest that the specific transplanted microbiota alters the bacterial wilt resistance in the resistant cultivar potentially through a priority effect.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["333"]}

A great deal of research has been conducted to determine the ways for identifying and classifying the security issues or goals. In recent years, it has been noticed that high secure software has less usability and has loosed businesses continuity. Without using the services of software, high security becomes worthless. Hence, there is a need to bridge the gap between security and usability of software. Indeed, security mechanisms must be usable to improve the security as well as the usability of software. Although security and usability are not directly related, some of their attributes impact each other indirectly. Attributes play a key role in bridging the gap between security and usability. In this respect, this paper identifies the main factors of security and usability that affect each other directly and indirectly, including confidentiality, integrity and availability and effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. The importance of each attribute in terms of their weight is essential for their impact on the overall security design during the software development process.

Decision support systems with accurate output data could increase the controllers\u2019 performance or reduce their workload. Nowadays radar data based identification of controllers\u2019 intent causes delays of up to 30 seconds. The intents could be predicted better and earlier if their spoken commands would be taken into account. Therefore, the project AcListant\u00ae combines an arrival manager (AMAN) with an automatic speech recognizer (ASR). Spoken commands are automatically recognized and forwarded to the AMAN. The AMAN updates its plan (e.g. sequence and aircraft trajectories). The ATCO also receives a direct feedback of ASR recognition performance via an (optional) visual interface. The ATCO gets better support from the assistance system without additional personal effort. This has an impact on the controller\u2019s work and behavior like adhering closely to the radio telephony procedures and articulating more clearly. Together with the suggestion of most probable commands depending on the air traffic situation, this would lead to higher speech recognition rates and result in better AMAN assistance.

It provides flexible and low cost services to huge data through Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) storage. Unfortunately, absence of any inherent security mechanism in Hadoop increases the possibility of malicious attacks on the data processed or stored through Hadoop. In this scenario, securing the data stored in HDFS becomes a challenging task. Hence, researchers and practitioners have intensified their efforts in working on mechanisms that would protect user\u2019s information collated in HDFS. This has led to the development of numerous encryption-decryption algorithms but their performance decreases as the file size increases. In the present study, the authors have enlisted a methodology to solve the issue of data security in Hadoop storage. The authors have integrated Attribute Based Encryption with the honey encryption on Hadoop, ie, Attribute Based Honey Encryption (ABHE). This approach works on files that are encoded inside the HDFS and decoded inside the Mapper. In addition, the authors have evaluated the proposed ABHE algorithm by performing encryption-decryption on different sizes of files and have compared the same with existing ones including AES and AES with OTP algorithms. The ABHE algorithm shows considerable improvement in performance during the encryption-decryption of files.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["333"]}

The soil temperature and moisture, wind, relative humidity and crop water requirements also affect the crop growth. Local farming practices also alter the natural landscape structure and biodiversity in croplands. This study was conducted with the objective to find out seasonality trend and to determine the land cover classification in Potohar region using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Moreover, random points throughout the study area were selected in order to detect the vegetation index pattern in different land cover types. For land cover classification and acquiring seasonality trend, crop growth patterns were determined by phenological phases of a particular crop. Land cover was classified with standard Level 1 Terrain-corrected (L1T) orthorectified images from Landsat 8 from years 2012 to 2016. Seven land cover classes within the study area were identified namely; agriculture, grasses, forest, shrubs/tall herbs, bare soil, built-up and water bodies. Moreover, the seasonality trend over the study was found related to different land cover classifications using 959 sample plots with 97.81% accuracy. The phase trend analysis determined the change in vegetation cover during the years under study, which was correlated to precipitation patterns in Potohar. The NDVI pattern was highly fluctuating in agricultural land cover due to seasonal crop growth but it remained stable throughout the year in forest covers.

Context information is treated as prior information to reduce the search space for recognition. It is integrated in the ASR pipeline by continually updating the recognition network. This is achieved by automatically adapting the underlying grammar whenever new situational knowledge becomes available. The context-dependent recognition network is then re-created and substituted for recognition based on these context-dependent grammars. As a result, the recognizer's search space is constantly being limited to that subset of hypotheses that are deemed plausible in the current situation.

While productivity is associated to quantity and quality, economy focuses on energy efficient processes achieving an overall high output to input ratio. Machining of hard-to-cut materials has always posed a challenge due to increased tool wear and energy loss. Cryogenics have emerged as an effective means to improve sustainability in the recent past. In the present research the use of cooling conditions has been investigated as an input variable to analyze its effect on tool wear, specific cutting energy and surface roughness in combination with other input machining parameters of feed rate, cutting speed and depth of cut. Experimental design was based on Taguchi design of experiment. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was carried out to ascertain the contribution ratio of each input. Results showed the positive effect of coolant usage, particularly cryogenic, on process responses.

Objectives: The purpose of the study is to measure attitude and practice of local community in Karachi, Pakistan regarding safe disposal of unwanted medicines and assess willingness of participants to take part in a medicationtake-back program. Study Design: A two-phase observational study was conducted using convenience sampling. Period: January to February, 2016. Methodology: In Phase I (n= 200) students enrolled in various health sciences institutions in the study were asked to take part in the survey. In Phase II (n= 300) household consumers were contacted by telephone and social media. Results: Participants (response rate 84.4%) were given a questionnaire to explore their attitudes towards medicine disposal. More than half of the consumers surveyed reported storing unused/expired medications in their homes, and majority threw away unwanted medicine in the garbage. The most common reason was unawareness of expiry date (32.7%). Only 12.32% reported returning medication to a pharmacy for disposal. Majority of the consumers had never received advice about medication disposal by a health care provider but were aware of the possible negative consequences and were willing to participate in national pharmacy take-back programs if implemented by the government. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that effective communication and established protocols will promote appropriate disposal\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["333"]}
{"title": "Identification of a gene involved in the negative regulation of pyomelanin production in Ralstonia solanacearum\n", "abstract": " Ralstonia solanacearum causes bacterial wilt in a wide variety of host plant species and produces a melanin-like blackish-brown pigment in stationary phase when grown in minimal medium supplemented with tyrosine. To study melanin production regulation in R. solanacearum, five mutants exhibiting overproduction of melanin-like pigments were selected from a transposon (Tn) insertion mutant library of R. solanacearum SL341. Most of the mutants, except one (SL341T), were not complemented by the original gene or overproduced melanins. SL341T showed Tn insertion in a gene containing a conserved domain of eukaryotic transcription factor. The gene was annotated as a hypothetical protein, given its weak similarity to any known proteins. Upon complementation with its original gene, the mutant strains reverted to their wild-type phenotype. SL341T produced 3-folds more melanin at 72 h post-incubation compared with wild-type SL341 when grown in minimal medium supplemented with tyrosine. The chemical analysis of SL341T cultural filtrate revealed the accumulation of a higher amount of homogentisate, a major precursor of pyomelanin, and a lower amount of dihydroxyphenylalanine, an intermediate of eumelanin, compared with SL341. The expression study showed a relatively higher expression of hppD (encoding hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase) and lower expression of hmgA (encoding homogentisate dioxygenase) and nagL (encoding maleylacetoacetate isomerase) in SL341T than in SL341.

Thus, the present day need calls for innovation in developing web applications that afford sustainable-security to the users. By improving sustainability along with web application protection, underlying security and sustainability attributes play a vital role in determining the symmetrical effect of the sustainability and security attribute to achieve the best outcome. Sustainability evaluation, therefore, uses security and sustainability qualities to achieve the desired sustainability security solutions.

In In vitro studies, 15%(w/v) dried powder of leaves produced the maximum (23 mm) zone of inhibition (ZI) followed by the same concentration of dried powder of succulent shoots (ie, tender shoots plus leaves). The lowest (15 mm) ZI was produced by 5%(w/v) dose of dried powder of stems. The in-planta dose of 30g kg-1 potted soil (succulent shoot powder) applied 20 days before transplanting (20 DBT) was found to be the best treatment combination. It reduced area under disease progress curve (AUDPC), lowered cfu g-1 dry soil, and enhanced plant growth parameters more than the other treatments. The same treatment combination of 30g kg-1 potted soil but applied 10 DBT was the second best combination in terms of disease control or yield-contributing plant growth parameters. The poorest plant growth characters were observed in the treatment combination of 15g/kg soil applied 0 DBT. The AUDPC, and cfu g-1 dry soil were decreased significantly by the treatment combination of 45g (succulent shoot powder) kg-1 soil applied 20 DBT. The plant growth parameters of this treatment combination, however, were lower than those of 30g kg-1 soil applied 20 DBT. This suggested that this dose was probably phytotoxic to tomato plants. As compared to the dried powders of other plant parts, leaf-powder (30g kg-1 soil) enhanced plant growth characters the most, followed by succulent shoot powder.

Although the fish pathogen Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida exhibits triclosan resistance, the nature of this resistance has not been elucidated. Here, we aimed to characterize the triclosan resistance of A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida causing furunculosis. The fosmid library of triclosan-resistant A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida was constructed to select a fosmid clone showing triclosan resistance. With the fosmid clone showing triclosan resistance, a subsequent secondary library search resulted in the selection of subclone pTSR-1. DNA sequence analysis of pTSR-1 revealed the presence of a chromosomal-borne fabV-encoding ENR homolog. The ENR of A. salmonicida (FabVas) exhibited significant homology with previously known FabV, including the catalytic domain YX (8) K. fabVas introduction into E. coli dramatically increased its resistance to triclosan. Heterologous expression of FabVas might functionally replace the triclosan-sensitive FabI in vivo to confer E. coli with triclosan resistance. A genome-wide search for fabVas homologs revealed the presence of an additional fabV gene (fabVas2) paralog in A. salmonicida strains and the fabVas orthologs from other gram-negative fish pathogens. Both of the potential FabV ENRs expressed similarly with or without triclosan supplement. This is the first report about the presence of two potential FabV ENRs in a single pathogenic bacterium.

DESIGN: This was a post hoc analysis of data from a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial using a randomized withdrawal design, performed in patients with moderate to severe chronic LBP. Patients achieving stable doses of hydromorphone ER during a 2-to 4-week conversion and titration phase were randomized to continue treatment with hydromorphone ER or taper-down to placebo during a 12-week double-blind phase. The primary efficacy outcome was the mean change in 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain intensity score from randomization to the final visit of the double-blind phase. Tolerability was assessed by recording adverse events (AEs). Data were analyzed separately for patients with non-neuropathic and neuropathic LBP. RESULTS: A total of 173 patients with non-neuropathic/nociceptive LBP and 94 with neuropathic LBP were randomized into the double-blind phase. During the conversion and titration phase, mean (SD) NRS scores decreased significantly from 6.5 (1.87) and 6.4 (1.99) at screening to 3.3 (0.98) and 3.2 (1.05), respectively. For both LBP subgroups, patients randomized to hydromorphone ER maintained this improvement over the double-blind treatment period, whereas those randomized to placebo reported significant increase in NRS scores.

Relative to other countries the Australian debt market is characterised by higher proportions of intermediated or private debt with a lower inherent level of information asymmetry in that private lenders have greater access to financial information (Gray, Koh & Tong 2009). Our firm level, cross-sectional evidence suggests that higher corporate governance impacts demand for debt via the mitigation of default risk.

Minor improvement in energy conservation methods can lead to a significant increase in the lifetime of IoT devices and overall network. To achieve efficient utilisation of energy, different solutions are proposed such as duty cycling optimization, design changes at the MAC layer, etc. In this paper, we propose a new approach to overcome this challenge in cloud-based IoT sensing applications, based on integration of an abstraction layer with constrained application mechanism. To achieve energy conservation and efficient data management in IoT sensing applications, we incorporate modules of efficient web framework with cloud services, in order to minimize the number of round trips for data delivery and graph-based data representation. Our study is the first attempt in the literature, to the best of our knowledge, which introduces the potential of this integration for achieving the aforementioned objectives in the target applications. We implemented the proposed interfacing of abstraction layer in constrained applications, to develop a testbed using Z1 IoT motes, Contiki OS and GraphQL web framework with Google cloud services.

Number in phishing email are spread with the aim of making web users believe that they are communicating with a trusted entity or organization. Phishing is deployed by the use of advanced and harmful tactics like malicious or phishing URLs. So, it becomes necessary to detect malicious or phishing URLs in the present scenario. Numerous anti- phishing techniques are in vogue to discriminate fake and the authentic website but are not effective. This research, focuses on the relevant URLs features that discriminate between legitimate and malicious/phishing URLs. The impact of email phishing can be largely reduced by adopting an appropriate combination of all these features with classification techniques. Therefore, an Enhanced Malicious URLs Detection (EMUD) model is developed with machine learning techniques for better classification and accurate results.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["333"]}

Six populations of T. domingensis were grown in waterlogged conditions under four levels of nickel (0, 50, 100 and 1500\u00a0mg/kg of Ni). The Ni tolerance was explored on the basis of different characteristics of shoots. Along with the increasing level of Ni stress, all populations showed an increment of proline and glycinebetaine content, low photosynthetic and transpiration rates and decreased chlorophyll content. Analyzed morphological parameters revealed possible adaptations to deal with Ni stress. The less tolerant Sahianwala population produced more aerenchyma, less accumulation of osmolytes and reduced shoot fresh weight under Ni stress than the tolerant ones. Our results suggested that T. domingensis has the capacity to survive under Ni stress\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["333"]}

At that time, Freud was the incontestable hero of psychology. Though Rogers\u2019 client-centred counselling was then a popular challenger to psychoanalysis, I felt that its theory and practice were rather vague. I felt that its extreme non-judgmental noninterfering approach and its unconditional acceptance of the client caused the therapeutic process to lose its value, particularly with non-Western clients who come to the healer to give a central focus to their lives and not to wait for them to find their own solutions. It is of interest to state that this is now one of the criticisms levelled by modern Western psychotherapists against this form of therapy (See for example the book by Vitz, 1977).In the sphere of Islamisation, I was greatly influenced by the writings of Mohammad Qutb, particularly his book titled Islam: The Misunderstood Religion and by the writings of Mawdudi. However, all their literature was of a general nature without a clear guide to the Islamisation of psychology and as such I was able to benefit from their contributions in writing my undergraduate term papers.

In situations where less than  nulls are required to be steered, the existing algorithms have no criterion to utilize the remaining weights for sidelobe suppression. This work combines sidelobe suppression capability with null steering by independent weight control. For this purpose, the array factor is transformed as the product of two polynomials. One of the polynomials is used for null steering by independent weight control, while the second one is for sidelobe suppression whose coefficients or weights are determined by using convex optimization. Finally, a new structure is proposed to incorporate the product of two polynomials such that sidelobe suppression weights are decoupled from those of null steering weights.

{"title": "Interactive effect of deficit irrigation and mulching on sugar beet productivity in Pakistan\n", "abstract": " In dry regions, irrigated agriculture is facing increasing demand for decreasing water resources. For sustainable and efficient use of the available water resources, field scale water saving strategies must be applied to enhance water productivity and crop yield. Deficit irrigation application along with suitable soil moisture conservation technique is one of the strategies and its successful application depends on crop response to different water stress levels. This research paper presents results of two years (2011\u201312 and 2012\u201313) study carried out at Sugar Crops Research Institute (SCRI) Mardan, to determine the effect of different irrigation deficit levels applied throughout the crop growing season and different types of mulching on productivity of sugar beet. The field experiments included four water stress levels designated as FI (full irrigation), DI20, DI40, DI60 (20, 40 and 60 percent deficit irrigation levels) and three moisture conservation practices; No mulch (NM), black polyethylene film mulch (BFM) and straw mulch (SM), respectively. Results revealed that different water stress levels and mulching combination produced significant effects on yield of sugar beet and its water productivity. The highest mean root yield was produced by FI\u2013BFM combination and the highest mean sugar yield by DI20\u2013BFM treatment. Results further revealed that the relative amounts of irrigation water saved by irrigation regimes and mulching interaction was ranged from 5.83 to 66.53% and the relative reduction in seasonal water used was ranged between 2 and 47%, respectively.

The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of E. coli in recent years (2014-2016) and antibiogram profile of E. coli isolates. Liver samples from different poultry farms were collected and processed for the confirmation of E. coli colonies. Antibiogram profile was also estimated for E. coli isolates by placing antibiotics disc and measuring zone of inhibition. Overall prevalence of E. coli was recorded as 35.1% while year wise prevalence was 29.2, 29.88 and 41.05% for year 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. Antibiogram profile of E. coli isolates showed that Gentamicin was highly sensitive in year 2014 and 2015 while ampicillin was least sensitive in these years while Colistin with 60% sensitivity was recorded highly sensitive in 2016 and Oxytetracyclin was highly resistant. Antibiogram profile of E. coli isolates showed that resistance developed to some antibacterial with passage of time while sensitivity of some antibacterial increased. Development of resistance might be due to the vigorous use of these antibiotics for control of diseases in poultry and also due to use of antibacterials as feed additives.

These parameters are then used as an input for the finite element analysis. Secondly, a specially designed specimen (MSTS) is used to perform the shear stress tests in a tensile testing machine to get the results in terms of forces and extension, crack initiation etc. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is also performed on the shear fracture surface to find material behavior. These experiments are then simulated by finite element method and compared with the experimental results in order to confirm the simulation model. Shear stress state is inspected to find the usability of the proposed shear specimen. Finally, a geometry correction factor can be established for these two materials in this specific loading and geometry with notch using Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM). By these results, strain energy of shear failure and stress intensity factor (SIF) of shear of these two polymers are discussed in the special application of the screw cap opening of the medical or food packages with a temper evidence safety solution.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["333"]}

Rutherford backscattering was employed to determine the extent of intermixing, which increased from 7% in an as-grown sample to nearly 23% when annealed at 400\u00a0\u00b0C. The as-grown sample showed a higher value of magnetization of 530\u00a0emu/cm3, which dropped to 20\u00a0emu/cm3 on annealing at 400\u00a0\u00b0C. The low temperature magnetization behavior of the as-grown Co films showed the presence of both positive and negative exchange bias due to the formation of antiferromagentic domains in parallel with ferromagnetic domains. This behavior is explained using the Malozemoff Random Field Model, which predicted values of exchange bias closely matching the present experimental findings.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["333"]}

{"title": "Early Stage Software Reliability Modeling using Requirements and Object-Oriented Design Metrics: Fuzzy Logic Perspective\n", "abstract": " In the current scenario as the influence of information technology has been rising day by day, the industry is facing the pressure of developing software with higher level of reliability. Generally it is an accepted fact that the roots of unreliability lies in ill defined requirements and design documents. With this spirit, researcher has proposed and implemented a reliability prediction model through fuzzy inference system that utilizes early stage product based measures from requirements and object-oriented design stages. The study starts with the review findings those have been used as foundation for proposing a reliability quantification framework. Subsequently this framework has implemented in the form of reliability prediction model that predicts reliability at the requirements as well as design level through its output variable. The model has been validated as well as quantitatively compared with two existing reliability models. The obtained results are quite encouraging and supports that the proposed framework and reliability prediction model are better. Consideration of requirements phase along with the object-oriented design provides this paper an edge over other similar studies those are based on only design phase. Because ignoring requirements deficiencies and only concentrating on design constructs will not help in developing reliable software.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["333"]}

The experiment was conducted in completely randomized design (CRD) with three replications. The response of fourteen wheat varieties at two seed treatments (primed with 50 mM CaCl2 and un-primed) with four salinity levels (0, 45, 90, 135 mM) was studied in sand as growth media. The results revealed that incremental increase of salinity stresses had decreasing effect on growth parameters compared with control. Highest germination (85.42% and 84.31%) was recorded from wheat varieties (Lalma-2013 and Pirsabak-2005). Minimum germination (64.40% and 73.89%), tillers plant-1 (2.83 and 3.49), leaves plant-1 (11.44 and 12.79), leaf area (21.47 cm2 and 25.20 cm2) and more days to emergence (9.92 and 8.98), was recorded from salinity levels of 135mM and 90mM, respectively compared with maximum germination (94.80%), tillers plant-1 (4.42), leaves plant-1 (17.45), leaf area (32.10 cm2) less number of days to emergence (7.54) from control. All growth parameters were significantly improved by seed priming with CaCl2 except shoot length (cm). It is concluded that salinity stresses has adversely affected growth traits of wheat varieties however, seed priming with CaCl2 has alleviated the adverse effects of salinity in wheat varieties.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["333"]}

The current study was undertaken to develop local allomteric equation and biomass expansion factor for Cedrus deodara. Data was collected from 32 sample trees which were felled and measured for the study in natural dry temperate forests of Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan. Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) and total height of the sample tree were measured before felling. After felling, bole, branches and brushwood were separated and weighed on the spot. Samples were taken from bole, branches and brushwood for drying in the oven at 1050 C till they gained constant weight. The allometric equation was developed through logarithmic transformation of dependent and independent variables. Results showed good relationship between biomass as dependent variable and DBH and height as independent variables. The R2 was found to be 0.98. The F and P values show that the model is significant. Standard Error and sum of square (SS) of the residuals also indicate good fit of the model. The BEF for Cedrus deodara varied between 1.17 and 2.07 with a mean of 1.37\u00b10.039 for trees with DBH> 20 cm. The percentage contribution of bole, branches and brushwood in the total dry biomass of Cedrus deodara was found to be 72.95%, 10.43% and 16.62% respectively.

{"title": "Numerical simulation of meltpool instability in the selective laser melting (slm) process\n", "abstract": " Selective laser melting (SLM) is a nonlinear process which involves melting of powder metal using laser to manufacture intricate metallic parts. During laser melting, the meltpool dynamics are influenced by initial laser processing parameters such as laser power and scan speed. Understanding of the meltpool flow physics and associated heat transfer is important for producing stable meltpool and hence high quality layers and parts. This research work focuses on the steady state numerical simulation of heat flux driven flows in the meltpool of pure metal (24 carat gold powder). Experimental observations indicated a relationship between the sizes of balling and the laser energy density, while no such relationship could be deduced for the change in the spatial gap between the droplets or balling. The splitting of meltpool away from the path of scan and first line balling was also observed. Simulation results predict the formation of different types of balling at different scan speeds and heat flux to be linked with heat transfer from the meltpool. Results indicate that the size of meltpool is largely dependent on the applied heat flux and its rate of transport to the surroundings ie boundary conditions. The steady state velocity patterns in the meltpool, driven by heat flux from the neighbouring surfaces, match well with experimental results.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["333"]}

{"title": "Intron 22 inversions in severe hemophiliacs\n", "abstract": " Hemophilia A (HA) is the most common X-linked recessive bleeding disorder affecting one in 5000-7000 male births. It is caused by the mutations in factor VIII (F8) gene. In severe HA, intron 22 inversion (IVS-22) of the F8 gene is the most prevalent mutation accounting up to 50% of all mutations. The knowledge of the pathogenetic mutation is important for i) the basis of carrier detection and ii) for the risk estimation of inhibitor formation. The goal of the present study was to analyze the presence of IVS-22 and to assess those patients for inhibitor development. We studied 50 unrelated patients suffering from severe HA reporting to Hemophilia Centre, Department of Hematology, BMU Karachi. Performa for each patient was filled which included personal and family history, symptom at the time of first presentation, joints involvement and inhibitor status. Subcycling Polymerase Chain Reaction (SPCR) was performed to detect IVS-22. The number of patients with IVS-22 accounted to 22 (44%). Family history could not be traced in 50% of the patients. Inhibitors were present in only 2 (4%) of the patients and both were IVS-22 negative. Our study suggests that IVS-22 inversion is the major genetic mutation responsible for severe HA patients in Pakistan. There is a high probability of de novo mutation of this genetic change. The non significant risk for the developing inhibitors among IVS-22 positive patients agrees with variety of genetic and non-genetic factors involved in such a complication.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["333"]}

General Surgeons are thus required to fill in the lacunae. In order to assess whether general surgical trainees receive adequate training for treating children in Pakistan, a cross-sectional survey was conducted at recognized teaching hospitals in Karachi among residents and fellows. Responses were received from 90.4% of surveyed candidates. Only 25% of the respondents were aware of the CPSP guidelines for training with paediatric patients. Nearly half planned to include paediatric patients in their practice. Most respondents believed that training by their programmes was adequate in this regard.

An integrated approach has been adopted to get a single class based metrics that may be used for cumulative measure of all aspects of object oriented design (encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism), and hence an indication of quality of class in terms of complexity. These values of WCC (Weighted Class Complexity) when averaged will enable computing the average complexity of software and also the quality. Three principle steps, identification of product attributes, identification of quality factors and a means of linkage, has been followed to develop such a metric. The proposed metric has been theoretically and empirically validated. This single metric may be used in initial stages and ensuring compliance at this stage will increase the reliability of system as a whole, as reliability in general is a by-product of quality.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["333"]}

Surface soil samples were amended with ground plant residues at 3% w/w with or without urea N at 100 mg N kg-1 soil. Microbial activities were measured by trapping the evolved CO2 in alkali during incubation of samples at 30 degree C at 1-3 day's interval for 40-43 days. The rate of CO2 evolution was consistently greater in the residue than in the non-residue treatment in all the three soils resulting in about 6-fold greater cumulative CO2 production in the former than in the later treatment over 40-43 days of incubation. The addition of urea N showed variable effects. It suppressed CO2 evolution in 2 out of 3 soils during the 1st 1 or 2 wk but later the rates became equal or slightly greater in the urea fertilized than in the unfertilized treatment. The rate of CO2 evolution also varied with the type of crop residue and with soil. Initially the rate was 2-3 fold greater in the legumes than in the non-legume residue treatment in all the three. soils but later the rate varied with the type of soil. The rate of CO2 evolution remained greater in the legumes than in the non-legume residue with relatively large difference in Warsak soil and small difference in Swat soil 1 throughout 40-43 days of incubation.

Minimum air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed were significant for both the diseases at two different locations. Multiple regression model consisting of all the environmental variables explained 87 and 81 percent of the citrus canker disease variability at University of Agriculture,(UAF) and Post-graduate Agricultural Experiment Station (PARS), Faisalabad, respectively. R2 values were reduced to 0.81 and 0.70 at UAF and PARS when minimum air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed were employed to predict citrus canker disease severity. The observed and predicted canker disease severity values were in conformity in all the varieties. A full model containing all the environmental variables could explain only 45 percent of the variability in citrus wither tip development at both locations. The prediction with partial model containing relative humidity and wind speed as the significant environmental variables was poor as indicated by 0.38 and 0.24 R2 values at UAF and PARS, respectively.

The treatment of Swiss albino rats with intraperitoneal injections of CCl4 (1 ml/kg body weight) on alternate days for 30 days decreased the antioxidant enzymes, while lipid peroxidation and serum toxicity markers were increased. These changes were reversed in the animals receiving an oral dose of RSME (100 and 200 mg/kg body weight) along with CCl4, thus increasing the level of antioxidant enzymes and decreasing serum toxicity markers and thus ameliorating the toxic effect of CCl4. These results show that seed extract of R. sativus can reciprocate the toxic effects of CCl4 and can be used to make a chemopreventive drug.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["333"]}

An optimum transmission strategy is the need in this case in order to maximize the network lifetime via hole alleviation. To this end, we provide a solution that is able to optimize the network performance through balance transmission strategy by equally dividing the network into number of sectors to balance the energy among the nodes. Two types of nodes are considered, the one with minimum energy level are normal nodes, the other one with maximum energy level are super nodes.

{"title": "Fuzzy Logic Approach to Quantify Water Pollution\n", "abstract": " In designing of water quality index more rational approach is needed as present indices have number of discrepancies and need to be rectified. Water quality parameters considered for obtaining WQI is different for all indices. Some important parameters have not been considered at all and allotment of weight age factor is completely subjective. At the same time some parameters can change the results dramatically without justifying it. Because of these limitations of crisp set theory an advanced computation method is required which is capable of handling imprecise, vague and fuzzy information in decision making on water quality. Hence there is need for more robust approach which can deal with uncertainty and ambiguity involved in assessment of water quality. To reduce uncertainty, ambiguity, vagueness and subjectivity in environmental issues fuzzy set theory has emerged as an excellent tool. In present work of quantifying EIA by using fuzzy set theory, fuzzy logic has been used for quantifying pollutants in water and instead of WQI new nomenclature is done as FWPI (Fuzzy Water Pollution Index).

{"title": "Measuring the vulnerability of an object-oriented design\n", "abstract": " Secure software development is still an underexplored topic for many organisations, who failed to design security in at the early stage of the development process. The issue is complicated by advanced software architectural concepts, such as object oriented design, in which multiple pieces of software inherit characteristics and methods from each other.This article discusses a practical approach to assessing vulnerabilities within object oriented designs, taking into account object-based principles such as inheritance and polymorphism.Traditional approaches to security focus primarily on antivirus, firewalls, intrusion detection, and so on.1 In spite of these protection, the attacks continue, and data breaches and other losses are escalating. This proves that network security alone cannot protect application from attacks. What else is missing?", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["333"]}

Maximum graft take success was noted in genotype Ch-22 (75%) closely followed by Sw-8 (74%) while minimum (40%) in genotype Ch-7. Genotype Ch-20 attained maximum (192.4 cm) plant height, stem diameter (25.9 mm) and number of leaves per plant (43) The least plant height (56.6 cm) was recorded in genotype Sw-46 while less average number of leaves per plant (15) by genotype Sw-14 during one growing season. Excluding a few genotypes, generally graft take success was above 60%. It was however, highly impressive in genotypes Ch-22 and Sw-8. This suggests higher degree of compatibility of these two genotypes with the tested walnut rootstock (Swat local) used in the region.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["333"]}

Management of bacterial canker of tomato caused by Clavibecter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis (Smith and Davis et al.) using different antibiotics\n", "abstract": " In an attempt to control bacterial canker of tomato, a very hard-to-control disease, both in-vitro and in-vivo studies were conducted using antibiotics alone or in combinations with other antibiotics and with copper oxychloride. Using paper disc diffusion assay and 50 ppm-400 ppm concentrations, tetracycline+ streptomycin produced the largest inhibition zone (22.8 mm) followed by tetracycline alone (22.0) at highest concentration after 48 hrs incubation. The result of antibiotic combination streptomycin and gentamicin were statistically at par with those of tetracycline+ streptomycin combination. However, streptomycin alone proved to be ineffective. Antibiotic concentrations of 250 ppm and higher were sufficient to inhibit the in-vitro bacterial growth. In case of screen-house studies, combination of tetracycline and copper oxychloride gave minimum% disease severity (5.40%), as compared to inoculated but untreated control in which case the% disease severity was 56.6%. The same combination (ie tetracycline+ copper oxychloride) also proved to be more effective than other treatments in term of enhancing yield per plant (1147.7 g), plant height (102.0 cm), plant dry weight (130.8 g) and other parameters. The better performance of this combination treatment could be attributed to its interactive effect. This study suggested that combination of antibiotics should be used for proper disease management and further combinations of different antibiotics in different concentrations should be evaluated.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["333"]}

Organic manures applications without processing have low potential to supply nutrients in short time. In this experiment different treatments were applied as source of nitrogen and 120 kg N ha-1 was desired from each single treatment or combination of treatments. The different treatments were comprised of poultry manure composted (PMC) for various durations ie 5, 10, 15 and 20 days. Two composting conditions were used ie one sole composted poultry manure and the other was integrated with half nitrogen from urea. Beneficial microbes (BM) were applied in two levels ie no BM and 50 L ha-1. Sole treatment of poultry manure only, machine compost, urea only, a combination of urea and poultry manure in 50: 50 ratio and a control treatment for mean comparisons were also used. The results of the experiment indicated that different composting duration significantly affected days to anthesis, leaf area tiller-1, leaf area index, days to maturity and plant height. Higher values were recorded with compost duration of 15 days except days to anthesis and plant height which were higher with compost duration of 20 days. Moreover addition of compost along with urea in 50: 50 ratio increased days to anthesis, leaf area, leaf area index, days to maturity and plant height. Application of beneficial microorganisms at the rate of 50 L ha-1 increased crop growth. The fertilized treatment in comparison with control treatment was found superior in terms of growth.

{"title": "Peace in Afghanistan:: Role of Regional Countries and United States\n", "abstract": " The year-2019, marked the 40 years of instability and chaos in Afghanistan, ever since it was invaded by former Soviet Union in December 1979. In the last forty years, the Afghan instability and conflict has been so transmissible that any peace plan, initiated even with sincerity got entombed into viscid domestic ambiguities, undesired regional rivalries and geopolitical interests of great powers. Owing to internal instability and frequent foreign invasions, there could not develop a cohesive national character within Afghanistan. Besides, there has been no institutional build-up and development which could have provided a strong base for the establishment of good governance system. In the absence of domestic peace and a unanimously acceptable leadership, the invaders and regional players have been exploiting Afghan geopolitics and its diverse societal makeup. Above all, the poor economic system, lack of needed resource base and massive unemployment constrained the flexibility, the Kabul regimes could have utilized for the minimum economic management at the domestic level. Furthermore, the post 2014 drawdown of US and NATO forces did not provide conducive environment where Afghans could have taken independent decisions to determine their future course of action for the larger national interest of the state and masses. The paper takes a critical analysis of the above-mentioned factors, which impeded peace process from taking firm roots in Afghanistan.

The single most important prognostic factor in determining the outcome of treatment in these patients is the stage in which it is detected. The early detection of carcinoma breast is associated with excellent prognostic outcome. Triple test consisting of physical examination; mammogram and fine needle aspiration cytology is one of the most sensitive test for early detection of carcinoma breast and is found to have a considerably high sensitivity in detection of carcinoma breast as compared to any single test such as mammography or fine needle aspiration cytology. The modified triple test which substitutes mammography by ultrasound examination is also found to be highly sensitive in early detection of breast carcinoma we conducted this study to assess the accuracy of modified triple test score ie clinical examination, ultrasonography and fine needle aspiration cytology in breast lump by comparing with histopathology.Materials and Methods: 50 women with palpable breast lump attending surgical outpatient and inpatient who underwent surgery for the same were included in the study on the basis of a predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Bioactive glass is a novel material that dissolves and forms a bond with bone when exposed to body fluids. Bioactive glasses are silicate based, having calcium and phosphorous in equal ratio to those of the natural bone and this is the reason for their high biocompatibility. Traditionally bioactive glasses have been used to restore bone defects. The bioactive bone scaffolds have been discussed on the basis of melt derived bioactive silicate glass compositions. In addition ion release effects of bioactive glasses and scaffolds concerning, osteogenic and angiogenic responses are addressed. In this study the current knowledge on the bone tissue engineering scaffold and their clinical implication has been discussed. Inductive couple plasma mass spectroscopy was carried out to determine the release of zinc, strontium, phosphorous and cobalt within bioactive glass and bone scaffolds over period of time. ICP Vista Pro was used to carry out inductive couple plasma mass spectroscopy. The results show significant amount of release of cobalt,, zinc and strontium over period of time which confirmed the bioactive nature of glasses and justified the properties of ions released by glasses and scaffolds..

The objectives of this paper are to know the present uses of Kabul River and future potential of the river for construction of dams. Studies conducted during 1990-2010 revealed that the Kabul River has already been used for hydro power generation and irrigation by both the riparian countries, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Undoubtedly, it has a major role in uplifting the socio-economic condition of the farmer communities. But this heavy extraction of water has also posed some negative impacts on the river\u2019s ecology and surrounding community such as fishermen and people attached with tourism. Therefore, further construction of dams need technical hands with the idea not to bring further distortion in the environment. As per analysis of five years flow data recorded at Nowshera station, the flow rate during July-August rose above 1000 M 3/Sec. Water received during this period of time can be termed as extra and can be allocated for storage. If Afghanistan constructs more dams on Kabul River or on its tributaries, it will have negative impacts on Khyber Pukhtunkhwa province. Three fertile districts, Peshawar, Nowshera and Charsada will be suffered in terms of productivity and crop yields. The diversion of Chitral River is good for Pakistan but not for Afghanistan.

{"title": "Treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension: Current and Clinical Trial Modalities\n", "abstract": " Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a deadly cardiovascular disease that follows a progressive and symptomatic course. This disease presents in approximately 15 cases per million each year and is categorized into five different groups based on established or presumed etiology. The poorly understood role of BMPR II mutation, early onset and severity of symptoms and increased fatality rate associated with IPAH make treatment a challenge for physicians. Current treatment options focus on the three main mechanisms of endothelial dysfunction which is the hallmark of PAH, namely Prostacyclin, Endothelin-1, and Nitric oxide pathways. This review summarizes different mechanisms of action for drugs that are currently available, recently approved or still under investigation. Despite all the progress made in the past decade, a number of obstacles still exist in the way of optimal treatments and outcomes. Currently available drugs (Amlodipine, Ambrisentan, and Sildenafil) may no longer be as effective as the newer generation of drugs, due to better outcomes and favorable modification of disease profile. Some clinical trial drugs have shown significant health improvements in IPAH patients by prolonging vasodilation and inhibiting vasoconstriction. Understanding the mechanism of action for IPAH still remains the key for researchers and physicians to develop novel drugs to treat PAH patients thereby increasing survival rates.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["333"]}

The solubility of Ni increases in the intermetallic NiTi phase by increasing the temperature. The phase diagram for Ni-rich NiTi alloys suggests a two phase region below 600\u25e6 C; NiTi and Ni3Ti. Upon solution annealing followed by water quenching, the two-phase region transforms to a single phase microstructure, intermetallic NiTi. By aging the single phase NiTi, precipitates of type Ni4Ti3 are observed [1].In Ni-rich NiTi, the phase transition in martensitic transformation is different, depending on its composition and thermomechanical treatments. On cooling, the solution treated Ni-rich NiTi alloys transform from B2 austenite phase to B19 monoclinic martensite phase. By aging the Ni-rich NiTi alloys, precipitates of type Ni4Ti3 are made in the B2 matrix, which change the transformation behavior from one step into two steps. In two-step transformation, the transformation takes place from B2 to R-phase and then from R-phase to B19 martensite phase [2]. The change in transition behavior from one-step to two-step in NiTi SMAs can be explained by the fact that both the R-phase and B19 are martensite phases. Further, the presence of coherent precipitates produces enough resistance to larger lattice deformations corresponding to the formation", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["333"]}

{"title": "The Effect of Cobalt Doping in Structural Phase Transition of SmFe1-xCoxAsO Measured by Low-temperature X-ray Diffraction\n", "abstract": " The parent compound SmFeAsO shows structural phase transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic at the temperature T D= 144 K. In the compound SmFe 1-x Co x AsO, with increasing x the structural transition temperature T D and SDW T N decreases and reaches 0 K at the critical concentration x c. The X-ray diffraction technique has been used here to study the structural phase transition temperature. It is observed that the (400) peak of the parent compound SmFeAsO splits into two peaks (400) and (040), when the temperature is lower than the structural transition temperature T D. The structural phase transition of Co doped compounds SmFe 1-x Co x AsO has also been studied for x= 0, 0.01, 0.025 and 0.075. The phase transition temperature T D for SmFe 0.99 Co 0.01 AsO, SmFe 0.975 Co 0.025 AsO and SmFe 0.925 Co 0.075 AsO are 134 K, 118 K and 4 K, respectively. The phase diagram of T D versus lattice spacing reveals that the structural transition temperature decreases with shrinking lattice constant along c-axis similar to the decrease of the structural phase transition temperature with increasing Co concentration. The phase diagrams of SmFe 1-x Co x AsO and Sm (O 1-xF x) FeAs show a similar nature.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["333"]}

The paper provides a true concurrency, also known as Symmetric Multi-Threading (IACKMA), which occur when multiple threads execute instructions during the same clock cycle. It gives high-performance to Java developers, a tremendous opportunity for speeding up programs. The proposed algorithm divides the dataset into several identical unit blocks. Then, it calculates the centroids and related statistics of patterns in each unit block to represent an approximation of the information in the unit blocks. We use this reduced data to reduce the overall time for distance calculations. We find that the clustering efficiency is closely related to determining how many blocks should be partitioned. In fact, since the algorithm uses discrete assignment rather than a set of continuous parameters, the\" minimum\" it reaches cannot even be properly called a local minimum. Despite these limitations, the algorithm is used frequently as a result of its ease of implementation.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["333"]}

{"title": "Localization and fault detection in wireless sensor networks\n", "abstract": " In this thesis three themes related to wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are covered. The first one concerns the power loss in a node signal due to voltage droop in the battery of the node. In the first part of the thesis a method is proposed to compensate for the apparent increase in the calculated distance between the related nodes due to decrease in the energy of the signal sending node battery. A function is proposed whose arguments are the apparently observed RSS and the current voltage of the emitter node battery. The return of the function is the corrected RSS that corresponds to the actual distance amongst the connected nodes. Hence increasing the efficiency of the RSS based localization methods in WSNs. In the second part of the thesis a position estimation method for localization of nodes in a WSN is proposed. In the proposed localization algorithm anchor nodes are used as landmark points. The localization method proposed here does not require any constraint on the placement of the anchors; rather any three randomly chosen nodes can serve as anchors. A heuristic approach is used to find the relative topology with the help of distance matrix. The purpose of the distance matrix is to indicate whether or not a pair of nodes has a connection between them and in case of connectivity it gives the estimated distance between the nodes. By using the information of connectivity between the nodes and their respective distances the topology of the nodes is calculated. This method is heuristic because it uses the point solution from the intersection of two circles instead of conventional triangulation method, where a system of three quadratic\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["333"]}

Pure-liquid velocity and turbulence intensity test-measurements performed with the incorporation of this technique compare very well with existing data in pipe flow. Measurements of bubble velocity and size at two locations along the pipe are presented with emphasis on the near wall region. The experiments have been carried out at a Reynolds number of 12086 and a volumetric flow ratio of 2.7%.

{"title": "TRIPLETS-A Rare Case Report\n", "abstract": " Introduction The term\" Triplets\" is used when three babies are born to a mother at one time. Twin deliveries are quite common but triplets are rare. Amongst multiple pregnancies, estimated incidence of twins is I 0 86, triplets 1 of 86 2 and quadruplets 1 of 86 3 and so on, which is called Helin's law.[I]. Incidence of multiple gestations has increased in recent past due to frequent use of ovarian stimulant drugs such as clomiphene and gonadotropins for treatment of infertility. Clomiphene increases the occurrence of dizygotic pregnancies by 5 to 10%[1, 2]. Perinatal mortality rate for twins and triplets is as high as 4 to 11 times that of singleton [3]. One such case is reported here and related problems discussed.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["333"]}

During Jan. to May 1999 except, non-significant correlation of relative humidity with disease severity on Mandarin at PARS, wind speed and relative humidity were significantly correlated with wither tip recorded on citrus varieties at both locations. Biweekly maximum air temperature was significantly correlated with disease severity recorded on Lime and Sweet orange at both locations. There was no correlation of minimum temperature, rainfall and clouds with disease severity recorded on citrus varieties on either location.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["333"]}
{"title": "Correlation of environmental conditions with bacterial blight disease severity on advanced lines/varieties of cotton\n", "abstract": " Except rain fall, all the environmental variables had significant correlation with bacterial blight disease severity during 1997 and 1998. The correlation of weekly air temperature (max/min), soil temperature and pH was significant with bacterial blight disease severity recorded on majority of cotton lines/varieties. Weekly rain fall and wind speed had poor correlation with bacterial blight disease severity. The correlation of relative humidity with disease severity recorded on AU-59, B-874, MS-95 and S-152-93 was significant, while there was no correlation of this environmental variable with bacterial blight recorded on other varieties. Weekly air and soil temperature and soil pH need to be studied further to characterize environmental conditions conducive for bacterial blight disease development in epidemic form.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["333"]}

Bubble size measurements are obtained with the phase-Doppler method and a video imaging technique which is also non-intrusive.

The experiments have been carried out at a Reynolds number of 12086 and a volumetric flow ratio of 2.7%. Bubble velocity fluctuations properties were found to be almost uniform in the core region. Bubble mean velocity was constant within one average bubble diameter from the wall and axial velocity fluctuations peaked at approximately half that distance. Velocity distributions near the wall were non-Gaussian and skewed towards lower values. The average bubble size was found to be in the range between 1,200 {micro} m and 1,400 {micro} m with more\u00bb", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["333"]}

{"title": "Zinc in human nutrition: Requirement and bioavailability-an overview\n", "abstract": " Zinc is an essential micronutrient for both plants and animals. It is present in every tissue of the body, component of protein and nucleic acids and a cofactor for major metabolic enzymes. Its deficiency has a variety of biochemical and physiological effects in human health. The metabolic need of zinc is 6 mg for an adult per day. The bioavailability of zinc is affected by endogenous and exogenous factors. The endogenous factors are zinc status of the body, presence of metallothionine in the intestine, receptor sites on the basolateral membrane, presence of metal free albumin and age of the animal. The exogenous factors include protein type, certain amino acids, fiber, phytic acid, minerals, pH of the intestine, heat treatment and processing of foods. Phytic acid/zinc and phytic acid x calcium/zinc molar rations affect zinc absorption. Adaptation of the animal to the food increases zinc absorption. These factors should be considered when evaluating the bioavailability of zinc from food stuff.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["333"]}

L (Cabbage, Tomato. Coriander was studied in Quetta city during 2011, because wind storm and sand storm are the common phenomena in arid regions of Balochistan. It has important impact on nutritional values of vegetables and fruits of Quetta. Quetta is considered as fruit garden, so our main emphasis is on the orchards but besides this some vegetables commonly present in the wind erosion seasons were evaluated. Chemical analysis showed that Pb concentration deposited with dust particles on leaves ranged between 1.00-2.00 mg/g, that was the maximum deposition among other orchards and vegetable leaves. Mn concentration ranged between 1.12-1.31 mg/g, Cu concentration ranged 1.11-1-46 mg/g, which followed by Zn concentration that ranged between 1.14-1.72 mg/g, less amount 0.34-1.44 mg/g of Ni deposition was found. Dust deposition was negatively effect on the productivity of fruits and vegetables. Results were negative correlation at P< 0.05 level of significance.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["333"]}
{"title": "Big File Cloud Storage (BFCS): Distributed Storage Service with De-Duplication and Secure Storage\n", "abstract": " Nowadays, cloud-based storage are growing and has become an emerging trend in big data storage field. Many problems arise while designing an efficient and low complicated storage engine for cloud-based systems with some issues like big files processing, metadata, latency, parallel Input/Output, de-duplication, distributed nature, high scalability. Key value stores has a vital role and showed many advantages when solving those problems. This paper presents about Big File Cloud Storage (BFCS) with its modules and architecture to handle most of problems in a big file cloud storage which is based on key value store. Here we are proposing lesscomplicated, fixed metadata design, which allows fast as well as highly-concurrent, distributed file Input/Output, and simple file and data de-duplication method for static data. This method can be used to build a distributed storage system that can accommodate data whose size is upto terabytes.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["333"]}
