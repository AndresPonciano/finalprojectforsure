{"title": "Parametric runtime verification of multiagent systems\n", "abstract": " Parametricity [14] is an important feature of a monitoring system for making runtime verification (RV) more effective, since, typically, correctness of traces depends on the specific data values that are carried by the monitored events of the trace, and that, in general, cannot be predicted statically. Typically, the correctness of an interaction protocol may depend on the values exchanged by agents; protocols may also be parametric in the involved agents, and resources, and this parametricity is naturally reflected on the data carried by values.In this work we propose parametric trace expressions, an extension to trace expressions [7, 2], expressly designed for parametric RV of multiagent systems. Such an extension is achieved by introducing variables in trace expressions that are substituted with data values at runtime, when events are matched during monitoring.", "num_citations": "42\n", "authors": ["1663"]}
{"title": "Comparing trace expressions and linear temporal logic for runtime verification\n", "abstract": " Trace expressions are a compact and expressive formalism, initially devised for runtime verification of agent interactions in multiagent systems, which has been successfully employed to model real protocols, and to generate monitors for mainstream multiagent system platforms, and generalized to support runtime verification of different kinds of properties and systems.                 In this paper we formally compare the expressive power of trace expressions with the Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), a formalism widely adopted in runtime verification. We show that any LTL formula can be translated into a trace expression which is equivalent from the point of view of runtime verification. Since trace expressions are able to express and verify sets of traces that are not context-free, we can derive that in the context of runtime verification trace expressions are more expressive than LTL.", "num_citations": "41\n", "authors": ["1663"]}

{"title": "On enactability of agent interaction protocols: Towards a unified approach\n", "abstract": " Interactions between agents are usually designed from a global viewpoint. However, the implementation of a multi-agent interaction is distributed. It is well known that this difference between the specification and the implementation levels can introduce problems, allowing designers to specify protocols from a global viewpoint that cannot be implemented as a collection of individual agents. This leads naturally to the question of whether a given (global) protocol is enactable, namely, whether it can be implemented in a distributed way. We consider this question in the powerful setting of trace expressions, considering a range of message ordering interpretations (specifying what it means to say that an interaction step occurs before another), and a range of possible constraints on the semantics of message delivery, corresponding to different properties of the underlying communication middleware.

LAIPs are modelled as trace expressions whose high expressive power allows for the design of protocols that could not be specified using finite state automata or equivalent formalisms. This expressive power makes the problem of stating if \u03c4 conforms to \u03c4 undecidable.

While determinism of the trace calculus ensures better performances of the generated monitors, it makes the semantics of its operators less intuitive.
