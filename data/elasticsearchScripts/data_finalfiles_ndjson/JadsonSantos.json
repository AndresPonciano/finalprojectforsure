{"title": "Conditional execution: a pattern for the implementation of fine-grained variabilities in software product lines\n", "abstract": " This paper presents the Conditional Execution design pattern that aims to help the implementation of fine-grained variabilities in the context of software product lines of information systems. The pattern has been used successfully in three product lines of web information systems developed by Informatics Superintendence (SINFO) at Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1348"]}
{"title": "Squid: an extensible infrastructure for analyzing software product line implementations\n", "abstract": " Software product line engineering is about producing a set of related products that share more commonalities than variabilities. This approach promotes benefits such as cost reduction, product quality, productivity and time to market, but it brings new challenges that must be considered during the evolution of the software product line. In this context, recent research has explored and proposed automated approaches based on code analysis and traceability techniques for change impact analysis. This paper presents Squid, an extensible infrastructure for analyzing software product line implementations. The approach uses information from variability modeling, variability mapping to code assets, and dependency relationships between code assets to perform analysis of SPL implementations. A Squid instantiation example is presented to illustrate the usage of the tool in practical scenarios.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1348"]}
{"title": "SIGElei\u00e7\u00e3o\u2013Um Novo Jeito Seguro de Votar\n", "abstract": " The effort and cost of setting up several electronic voting machines or the work for the manual counting of hundreds or thousands of paper ballots led to emerge a demand for implementation of a web system to manage elections. This required that the system had extra safety features not present in the other systems developed by UFRN. This paper describes the SIGElei\u00e7\u00e3o voting system, highlighting the security, accessibility, availability and performance mechanisms that have been implemented to provide elections for the various management positions inside UFRN.Resumo. O esfor\u00e7o e custo de se configurar diversas urnas eletr\u00f4nicas ou o trabalho para contagem manual de centenas ou milhares de votos em papel fez com que surgisse uma demanda para implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de um sistema web para realizar vota\u00e7\u00f5es. Nesse sentido, a UFRN desenvolveu o sistema de vota\u00e7\u00e3o SIGElei\u00e7\u00e3o para que se pudesse realizar pleitos para os diversos \u00f3rg\u00e3os que comp\u00f5em a institui\u00e7\u00e3o. Este artigo descreve o sistema SIGElei\u00e7\u00e3o, destacando os mecanismos de seguran\u00e7a, acessibilidade, disponibilidade e desempenho que foram implementados.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1348"]}
{"title": "Quantifying and Assessing the Merge of Cloned Web-Based System: An Exploratory Study.\n", "abstract": " This paper presents an exploratory study that analyzes the complexity to integrate existing merge conflicts of a cloned large-scale web system. The study is supported by an existing tool that focuses on the identification of merge conflicts that can arise during the integration of cloned systems. The approach addresses the merge conflict analysis through the extraction and comparison of the issues and code history of cloned systems using mining software repository and static analysis techniques. The main aims of our study are:(i) to quantify the kind of conflicts defined by our approach that happen when evolving cloned systems;(ii) to evaluate if they are being correctly detected by our tool; and finally (iii) to analyze the difficult to integrate them from one cloned system to another. The study findings show:(i) a predominance of semantic conflicts between issues of source and target cloned systems; and (ii) the feasibility to use merge analysis approaches to integrate tasks from one clone to another.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1348"]}
