{"title": "Investigation of Project Administration related challenging factors of Requirements Change Management in global software development: A systematic literature review\n", "abstract": " Presently, software firms are adopting global software development (GSD) paradigm increasingly, due to producing quality software's with low cost. But, the adoption of GSD is not straightforward, there are various complications allied with it mainly that related to requirements change management (RCM). The aim of this study is to identify project administration related challenges (CHs) that could negatively impact the RCM activities in GSD firms. We have employed systematic literature review (SLR) method in order to investigate the CHs. Using the SLR method, 10 CHs were identified. The identified CHs were categorized into three broad categories based on the size of organizations as small scale organizations (SSOs), medium scale organizations (MSOs) and large scale organizations (LSOs) in the context of GSD. The classification of the CHs was used to provide a clear picture of RCM process, and their\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "26\n", "authors": ["2255"]}

The use of virtual teams helps software organizations to get various benefits with respect to time, cost and access to skillful resource. However, the virtual team relies on telecommunication technologies, team members faces various challenges in order to complete the activities. Therefore, in this study we have used the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) by applying the customized keywords derived from our research question to investigate the various challenges which create the difficulties in the successful operation of virtual teams.

{"title": "Communication related issues in GSD: An exploratory study\n", "abstract": " Global Software Development (GSD) projects use virtual teams that linked through telecommunication technologies. The work carried out in GSD process involves several issues. One of the key issues named is effective communication among team members. It has a great effect on the success of global software projects. In this paper, the influencing factors for effective communication have been highlighted considering the life cycle of the project development. Furthermore, a framework incorporating the relevant factors such as temporal distances, geographical distance, socio-cultural distance, attitudinal issues and social communication have been proposed and introduced in this paper. According to our study, social communication and attitudinal issues effects the team members also influences the communication in GSD projects.

However, there is a lack of understanding of challenges associated with successful execution of COSD projects. The objective of this study is to identify and prioritize the challenges that influence COSD projects. First, we conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and identified 21 challenges that impact COSD projects. Next, a questionnaire survey was developed based on the SLR findings to collect feedback from industry practitioners. Finally, we applied the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) to rank the identified challenges for COSD projects. We also present a prioritization-based taxonomy of the identified challenges which will help practitioners to focus on the critical areas for\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["2255"]}
{"title": "A systematic literature review to identify human related challenges in globally distributed agile software development: towards a hypothetical model for scaling agile methodologies\n", "abstract": " Currently, software organizations are implementing agile methodologies in global software development (GSD) because of low development cost, schedule and high quality product. However, GSD project is complex undertaken because of it distributed dimensions especially when the agile methodologies are concerned. The objective of this study is to identify the human related factors that can negatively influence agile practices in GSD organizations, and proposed a hypothetical model of the identified challenges related to the scaling agile methodologies. A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method was used to identify the challenges. In the findings, a total of eleven challenges were identified using SLR. This study also reported the Critical Challenges (CChs) for scaling agile methodologies using a criterion of the challenges having a frequency \u2265 50 %.

{"title": "SWOT: Strength, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats for scaling agile methods in global software development\n", "abstract": " Nowadays, software organizations are deploying agile methods in the geographically distributed environment to get several benefits ie significant return on investment it produces, fast project delivery, and managing the dynamic behavior of the project development. The execution of agile practices in Global Software Development (GSD) is more complex than collocated environment (single site development). The objectives of this study is to explore the factors which positively and negatively impact on scaling program of agile development in the GSD context and propose a framework based on the factors for successful scaling of agile programs in GSD context. This study is carried out in two stages. In the first stage, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) protocol was adopted to investigate the factors. In the second stage, the SWOT analytical framework was followed to classify the factors into four categories\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["2255"]}
{"title": "A proposed framework for effective software team performance: A mapping study between the team members' personality and team climate\n", "abstract": " Over the last two decades, numerous studies have been explored the relationship between the personality of individual team members and team outcome. Although every software team possess its own climate in order to exchange the knowledge transfer among the team members, it has been considered as the factor have the impact on team performance. Therefore, in this study we conducted an exploratory study to develop the best possible combinations between the various dimensions of team members' personality and the critical factors of team climate. The Five Factor Model (FFM) has been considered to measures the individual personality while Team Climate Inventory (TCI) was used for measuring team climate. Hence a framework has been proposed that highlights that consciousness is an important personality dimension for the visionary output, task orientation, and innovative output of a team while the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["2255"]}
{"title": "A hybrid evaluation framework for qos based service selection and ranking in cloud environment\n", "abstract": " With the growing demand and the varied availability of a large number of cloud services, it has become difficult to discover a relevant cloud service that can satisfy cloud customer's functional needs. From the customer's point of view, it is hard to decide, which cloud service satisfy their QoS (Quality of Service) requirement and what is the basis for their selection. To assist the cloud customer in the optimal service selection, a framework has been proposed, which allows cloud customer to assess the many cloud service providers by considering the QoS attribute value. In this work, we put forward an improved MCDM (Multi Criteria Decision Making) methodology that improves the existing cloud service selection methods. In particular, we use Best-Worst method for calculating the attribute weights and apply TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method for calculating the final rank of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["2255"]}
