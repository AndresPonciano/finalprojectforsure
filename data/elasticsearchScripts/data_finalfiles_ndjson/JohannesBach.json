{"title": "Model based scenario specification for development and test of automated driving functions\n", "abstract": " Research and evaluation of algorithms and system architectures for automated driving advanced to a stage where transition from prototyping to series development seems practicable in some extent. While particular systems for environmental perception play a key role in advanced driving assistance systems, we still lack feasible methods for specification and validation of complex driving scenarios. This leads to increased effort in testing and inconsistent requirement definition along different development phases. In this paper we propose a methodology for abstract positional and temporal description of driving scenarios. The approach utilizes a movie related and omniscient view composed of sequential acts. Each act combines both states and interactions of distinct participants as well as the rudimental scenery. Selective events trigger changes in conduct leading to transitions between acts.

To assure the feature's valid behavior all realistically possible environmental situations have to be tested. The test scenarios used for simulation can be derived from real-worlddriving-data. However, the significance of derived scenarios is weakened by repetitive similar situations within the driving data, which increase the test efforts without providing new insights regarding the test of the ADAS. In this contribution, an automated selection algorithm for test scenarios based on relevant environmental parameters is presented. Starting with a randomly selected initial testset, the machine-learning concept of autoencoders is utilized to recognize novel scenarios within the data pool, which are\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "25\n", "authors": ["1429"]}

Traffic jam pilot or predictive energy management depict examples of recently introduced features that span across different conventional vehicle domains. The increased interconnectivity and functional complexity impose new requirements on the automotive systems engineering practice. The resulting challenge is to develop integrated approaches that combine the established procedures with innovative techniques. To address this challenge, we present a comprehensive taxonomy for existing automotive features. Based on this characterization, established industrial and new research approaches for logical system architectures are consolidated. We introduce levels of hierarchy in the logical system architecture to facilitate systems engineering of innovative functions and highly distributed features.

To assure the feature under development's valid behavior, the sample of scenarios evaluated for Verification and Validation (V&V) needs to proof substantial coverage of all possible situations. Currently applied V&V activities on system-level are in a large part based on real world tests. These are not scalable to sufficiently cover the variant system environment. Our previously introduced Reactive-Replay enables substantial coverage by reuse of recorded real world data in closed-loop simulation. In this contribution we present an approach to determine the relevance of recorded scenarios and derive efficient sets of test scenarios.

In the process, the significance of automotive software for a satisfactory driving experience is growing. To benefit from these new opportunities, thorough assessment in early development stages is highly important. It enables manufacturers to focus resources on the most promising concepts. For early assessment, a common approach is to set up vehicles with additional prototyping hardware and perform real world testing. While this approach is essential to assess the look-and-feel of newly developed concepts, its drawbacks are reduced reproducibility and high expenses to achieve a sufficient and balanced sample.

{"title": "A driving scenario representation for scalable real-data analytics with neural networks\n", "abstract": " As development of Automated Driving Systems (ADS) advances, new methods for validation and verification (V&V) are needed. A promising approach for V&V is scenario-based testing. Recorded real-world-driving-data constitutes a useful source for the extraction of scenarios as they ensure a high level of realism. Since recorded data is typically unlabeled, the benefits drawn from the large amounts of available data are limited, e.g. the data interpretation with respect to the inherent driving scenarios is challenging. Manual data inspection or rule-based approaches are hardly scalable to neither big datasets nor numerous different scenario types. Hence, there is a need of automated data analysis tools, e.g. for labeling on a semantic level. Many current approaches try to accomplish that based on neural networks. This arises the need for a consistent, valid and machine-readable representation of a driving scenario. In\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1429"]}
{"title": "Semantic Comparison of Driving Sequences by Adaptation of Word Embeddings\n", "abstract": " The development of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) is proceeding rapidy, leading to fastly growing pools of recorded driving data for testing and validation. To make use of this data pool efficiently, a low barrier access for development engineers is of high importance, facilitating reuse of the data for function assessment or simulation. The main contribution of this work is the adoption of ideas from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to enable the semantic interpretation of driving data in their respective contexts, facilitating search and comparison in the data pool. The suggested process consists of a binning to convert the multivariate time series into discrete drive states and a subsequent transformation into a lower-dimensional space, a so-called embedding. The transformation is performed by the adaptation of Word2Vec, a model originally developed for the embedding of words in language\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1429"]}
{"title": "Leveraging regular expressions for flexible scenario detection in recorded driving data\n", "abstract": " For the development of Advanced Driver Assistant Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving Systems (ADS) large amounts of driving data are collected. Storing, processing and analyzing this data requires significant efforts. For these efforts to pay off, data must be made accessible and reusable for different development phases from specification to testing. However, raw measurement data can largely vary in format, configuration and comprehensiveness. Adding meaningful, semantic labels to the data, also called data enrichment, is a promising way to improve searchability and to compute aggregating statistics over large databases. In this work we identify challenges and define requirements for data enrichment of real world measurement data for ADAS and ADS.
