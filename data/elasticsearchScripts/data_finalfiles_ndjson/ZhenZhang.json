{"title": "The global methane budget 2000\u20132012\n", "abstract": " The global methane (CH 4) budget is becoming an increasingly important component for managing realistic pathways to mitigate climate change. This relevance, due to a shorter atmospheric lifetime and a stronger warming potential than carbon dioxide, is challenged by the still unexplained changes of atmospheric CH 4 over the past decade. Emissions and concentrations of CH 4 are continuing to increase, making CH 4 the second most important human-induced greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. Two major difficulties in reducing uncertainties come from the large variety of diffusive CH 4 sources that overlap geographically, and from the destruction of CH 4 by the very short-lived hydroxyl radical (OH). To address these difficulties, we have established a consortium of multi-disciplinary scientists under the umbrella of the Global Carbon Project to synthesize and stimulate research on the methane cycle, and producing regular (\u223c biennial) updates of the global methane budget. This consortium includes atmospheric physicists and chemists, biogeochemists of surface and marine emissions, and socio-economists who study anthropogenic emissions.

A rich source of such targets for the design of novel anti-tumor agents is the ubiqutin-proteasome system (UP-S), a tightly regulated, highly specific pathway responsible for the vast majority of protein turnover within the cell. Because of its critical role in almost all cell processes that ensure normal cellular function, its inhibition at one point in time was deemed non-specific and therefore not worth further investigation as a molecular drug target. However, today the proteasome is one of the most promising anti-cancer drug targets of the century. The discovery that tumor cells are in fact more sensitive to proteasome inhibitors than normal cells indeed paved the way for the design of its inhibitors.

Challenges in modeling human motion include high dimensional prediction as well as extremely complicated dynamics. We present a novel approach to human motion modeling based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). The hierarchical structure of CNN makes it capable of capturing both spatial and temporal correlations effectively. In our proposed approach, a convolutional long-term encoder is used to encode the whole given motion sequence into a long-term hidden variable, which is used with a decoder to predict the remainder of the sequence. The decoder itself also has an encoder-decoder structure, in which the short-term encoder encodes a shorter sequence to a short-term hidden variable, and the spatial decoder maps the long and short-term hidden variable to motion predictions. By using such a model, we are able to capture both invariant and dynamic information of human motion, which results in more accurate predictions. Experiments show that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the Human3. 6M and CMU Motion Capture datasets.

The GCP dataset integrates results from top-down studies (exploiting atmospheric observations within an atmospheric inverse-modelling framework) and bottom-up models (including process-based models for estimating land surface emissions and atmospheric chemistry), inventories of anthropogenic emissions, and data-driven approaches. The annual global methane emissions from top-down studies, which by construction match the observed methane growth rate within their uncertainties, all show an increase in total methane emissions over the period 2000\u20132012, but this increase is not linear over the 13 years. Despite differences between individual studies, the mean emission anomaly of the top-down ensemble shows no significant trend in total methane emissions over the period 2000\u20132006, during the plateau of atmospheric methane mole fractions, and also over the period 2008\u20132012, during the renewed atmospheric methane increase.

{"title": "Joint probabilistic matching using m-best solutions\n", "abstract": " Matching between two sets of objects is typically approached by finding the object pairs that collectively maximize the joint matching score. In this paper, we argue that this single solution does not necessarily lead to the optimal matching accuracy and that general one-to-one assignment problems can be improved by considering multiple hypotheses before computing the final similarity measure. To that end, we propose to utilize the marginal distributions for each entity. Previously, this idea has been neglected mainly because exact marginalization is intractable due to a combinatorial number of all possible matching permutations. Here, we propose a generic approach to efficiently approximate the marginal distributions by exploiting the m-best solutions of the original problem. This approach not only improves the matching solution, but also provides more accurate ranking of the results, because of the extra information included in the marginal distribution. We validate our claim on two distinct objectives:(i) person re-identification and temporal matching modelled as an integer linear program, and (ii) feature point matching using a quadratic cost function. Our experiments confirm that marginalization indeed leads to superior performance compared to the single (nearly) optimal solution, yielding state-of-the-art results in both applications on standard benchmarks.", "num_citations": "29\n", "authors": ["1620"]}

By utilizing an adaptive control technique combined with a sliding mode approach, an adaptive sliding mode control (ASMC) law with friction compensation scheme is proposed in presence of both frictions and external disturbances. Based on the LuGre dynamic friction model, a dual-observer structure is used to estimate the unmeasurable friction state, and an adaptive control law is synthesized to effectively handle the unknown friction model parameters as well as the bound of the disturbances.

Moreover, most of the previous studies on empathy have focused on empathy for pain rather than empathy for positive emotions, such as happiness. In the present study, we addressed this question by investigating the spatiotemporal dynamics of different kinds of empathy by combining electrophysiological recordings with a behavioral priming empathy task involving negative and positive emotions. Electrical brain activity and behavioral data were analyzed from 30 subjects (12 males and 18 females). Half of the subjects performed a behavioral task on empathy for pain (EP task), while the other half performed a behavioral task on empathy for happiness (EH task). In each task, participants viewed prime photographs of either: 1) a stranger; or 2) a close friend (primes) followed by target photographs showing either a hand being hurt (or not; targets in the EP task), or a hand in happy circumstances (or not; targets in the EH task).

Overall, our results suggest that taking the perspective of a close friend (compared to that of a stranger), as a prime stimulus, does have a dual-stage effect on empathy that is characterized by an early modulation for pain and later modulations for both pain and happiness.

It is found that the double-horn slice energy distribution of the electron beam induced by the laser modulation is very effective to increase the density bunching. Since the modulation is performed on a relativistic electron beam, the process does not suffer from strong space charge force or coupling between phase spaces, so that it is straightforward to preserve the beam quality for terahertz (THz) radiation and other applications.

In Experiment 1, the partner\u2019s resources were more attractive than the child\u2019s. In the reciprocal condition, the child was told that s/he would be a recipient when the partner played as a donor. In the nonreciprocal condition, however, the child was told that an anonymous child would be the recipient when the partner donated.

In Experiment 2, the child was always the recipient when the partner donated, but the partner\u2019s resources were more desirable than the child\u2019s in the high-value condition, and less desirable in the low-value condition. We found that children were more generous when the partner\u2019s resources were valued higher.

We describe a method to calculate the volume of a saturated void (VSV), attained in a steady state when each point in a conductor line is in a state of hydrostatic pressure, and the gradient of the pressure along the conductor line balances the electron wind. We show that the VSV will either increase or decrease when the coefficient of thermal expansion of the dielectric increases and will increase when the elastic modulus of the dielectric decreases.

Relationships between WUE and environmental factors have been widely investigated, but the variations in WUE in response to biotic factors remain little understood. Here, we argue that phenology plays an important role in the regulation of WUE by analyzing seasonal WUE responses to variability of photosynthetic phenological factors in terrestrial ecosystems of the Northern Hemisphere using MODIS satellite observations during 2000\u20132014. Our results show that WUE, during spring and autumn is widely and significantly correlated to the start (SOS) and end (EOS) of growing season, respectively, after controlling for environmental factors (including temperature, precipitation, radiation and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration). The main patterns of WUE response to phenology suggest that an increase in spring (or autumn) WUE with an earlier SOS (or later EOS) are mainly because the increase in GPP is relatively large in magnitude compared to that of ET, or due to an increase in GPP accompanied by a decrease in ET, resulting from an advanced SOS (or a delayed EOS).

In temperate zones, shallow lakes show significant differences in thermal stratification compared to deep lakes. Here, the variation in thermal stratification in Lake Taihu, a shallow fresh water lake, is studied systematically. Lake Taihu is a warm polymictic lake whose thermal stratification varies in short cycles of one day to a few days. The thermal stratification in Lake Taihu has shallow depths in the upper region and a large amplitude in the temperature gradient, the maximum of which exceeds 5 C m\u20131. The water temperature in the entire layer changes in a relatively consistent manner. Therefore, compared to a deep lake at similar latitude, the thermal stratification in Lake Taihu exhibits small seasonal differences, but the wide variation in the short term becomes important. Shallow polymictic lakes share the characteristic of diurnal mixing. Prominent differences on the duration and frequency of long-lasting thermal stratification are found in these lakes, which may result from the differences of local climate, lake depth, and fetch. A prominent response of thermal stratification to weather conditions is found, being controlled by the stratifying effect of solar radiation and the mixing effect of wind disturbance. Other than the diurnal stratification and convection, the representative responses of thermal stratification to these two factors with contrary effects are also discussed.

The binding ability of ICA-Cu to calf thymus DNA (CT-DNA) was examined by fluorescence spectrometry and the viscosity method. The results indicated that, upon the addition of increasing amounts of CT-DNA, the excitation and emission intensity of ICA-Cu decreased obviously and the excitation spectra shifted towards a long wavelength. ICA-Cu could displace ethidium bromide (EB) from the EB-DNA system, making the fluorescence intensity of the EB-DNA system decrease sharply; the quenching constant K SV value was 3.99\u00d7 10 4 M\u2212 1. The emission intensity of the ICA-Cu-DNA system was nearly constant, along with the addition of Na+ in a series of concentrations. The fluorescence of the complex could be protected after the complex interacted with DNA. A viscosity measurement further supported the result that the ICA-Cu complex may interact with DNA in an intercalative binding mode. The antioxidant activities of ICA-Cu were evaluated by a 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay, a hydroxyl radical (OH) scavenging assay, and a 2, 2\u2032-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) assay.

{"title": "Time-dependent crack behavior in an integrated structure\n", "abstract": " Devices in modern technologies often have complex architectures, dissimilar materials, and small features. Their long-term reliability relates to inelastic, time-dependent mechanical behavior of such structures. This paper analyzes a three-layer structure consisting of, from top to bottom, an elastic film, a power-law creep underlayer, and a rigid substrate. The layers are bonded. Initially, the film is subject to a uniform biaxial tensile stress. A channel crack is introduced in the elastic film. As the underlayer creeps, the stress field in the film relaxes in the crack wake, but intensifies around the crack tip. We formulate nonlinear diffusion-like equations that evolve the displacement field. When the crack is stationary, the region in which the stress field relaxes increases with time. We identify the length scale of the region as a function of time. The stress intensity factor is proportional to the square-root of the length scale\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["1620"]}

We quantified agricultural land-use change based on available maps derived from 30-m multi-seasonal Landsat imagery and analyzed the socioeconomic and biophysical determinants of the observed agricultural land-use changes using boosted regression trees. We used a scenario-based approach to assess future agricultural land abandonment and recultivation until 2060. The maps of agricultural land use analysis reveal that cropland abandonment was the dominant land use process on 11% of agricultural land from 1986 to 2000, and on 6% of the agricultural land from 2000 to 2010. Recultivation occurred on approximately 2% of agricultural land in both periods. Although most abandoned land was located in the plains, the rate of abandonment was twice as high in the mountainous landscapes. The likelihood of abandonment increased with increased distance from the national capital (Bratislava), decreased with an increase of annual mean temperatures and was higher in proximity to forest edges and on steeper slopes. Recultivation was largely determined by the opposite effects.

The current study directly compared 3- and 5-year-old Chinese children\u2019s happiness when sharing was autonomous (the recipient did not contribute to getting the reward) with when sharing was obligated (the recipient and the actor jointly earned the reward). We found that children shared more items overall when sharing was obligated than autonomous, demonstrating their conformity to social norms of merit-based sharing. In children who eventually shared with others, 5-year-olds gave out more stickers in the obligated sharing condition than in the autonomous sharing condition, but 3-year-olds shared the same amount between the conditions, suggesting that 5-year-olds adhered to the merit-based sharing norm more strictly than 3-year-olds. Moreover, in the autonomous sharing condition, children displayed greater happiness when they shared with the recipient than when they kept stickers for themselves, suggesting that costly prosocial giving benefited children with positive mood; however, children did not gain happiness when they shared with the recipient in the obligated sharing condition.

Due to the stroke by stroke motion of the internal combustion engine, the fuel pressure pulsation is primarily periodic with respect to the engine rotational-angle since fuel injection timing is scheduled on an angular basis. However, the period of the pressure pulsation changes in time domain as the rotational speed varies in general.

Using in situ monitoring of the contact zone during sliding, we show that for large friction coefficients the steady state scratch propagation is driven by the 3D plastic deformation of the thin silver layer at the front of the contact. As a side effect, the top brittle layer spalls away. We also demonstrate that initiation of this damage mechanism results from the brittle failure of the film. This initial failure is shown to predominantly occur at the rear half but well inside the contact zone and then propagate to the front of the contact. This observation demonstrates that a combination of tensile and shear stresses is necessary to drive the initial interface crack.

The high-precision ultra-thin glass molding process (UTGMP) is very important in the fabrication of high-quality 2.5 D/3D ultra-thin glass for smartphones; however, the UTGMP, with its high energy consumption and low pass rate, is not considered to be environment-friendly. Therefore, in this study, the sustainability of the molding process for 3D ultra-thin glass was comprehensively investigated. First, the ultra-thin 3D glass molding process is described, including a discussion of the glass molding apparatus, and the principle of glass thermos-formation is explained.

However, due to the large mismatch of silicon and organic package in the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), the solder bumps undergo large viscoplastic deformation in temperature cycling test and in field operation. The viscoplastic damage accumulates cycle by cycle, which leads to the bump failure by fatigue cracking after hundreds or thousands of thermal cycles. Underfill plays a key role in solder joint fatigue lifetime. In addition to the effects of underfill modulus and CTE, the glass transition temperature, T g , is also critical. Solder deformation is very sensitive to underfill modulus, the viscoplastic work is much larger when the temperature is above T g  than below T g .

Hu et al.(2018) reported unexpectedly large methane enhancements over South Sudan in these observations. Here we assess methane emissions from the wetlands of South Sudan using two years (December 2017\u2013November 2019) of TROPOMI total column methane observations. We estimate annual wetland emissions of 7.2\u00b13.2 Tg yr-1, which agrees with the multiyear GOSAT inversions of Lunt et al.(2019) but is an order of magnitude larger than estimates from wetland process models. This disagreement may be explained 20 by the up to 4 times underestimation of inundation extent by the hydrological schemes used in those models. We investigate the seasonal cycle of the emissions and find the lowest emissions during the June-August season when the process models show the largest emissions. Using satellite altimetry-based river water height measurements, we infer that this seasonal mismatch is likely due to a seasonal mismatch in inundation extent. In models, inundation extent is controlled by regional precipitation, scaled to static wetland extent maps, whereas the actual inundation extent is driven by water inflow from rivers 25 like the White Nile and the Sobat.

Here we present, to our knowledge, the first multi-site synthesis of how predictors of CH4 fluxes (FCH4) in freshwater wetlands vary across wetland types at diel, multiday (synoptic), and seasonal time scales. We used several statistical approaches (correlation analysis, generalized additive modeling, mutual information, and random forests) in a wavelet-based multi-resolution framework to assess the importance of environmental predictors, nonlinearities and lags on FCH4 across 23 eddy covariance sites. Seasonally, soil and air temperature were dominant predictors of FCH4 at sites with smaller seasonal variation in water table depth (WTD). In contrast, WTD was the dominant predictor for wetlands with smaller variations in temperature (eg, seasonal tropical/subtropical wetlands). Changes in seasonal FCH4 lagged fluctuations in WTD by~ 17\u00b111 days, and lagged air and soil temperature by median values of 8\u00b116 and 5\u00b115 days, respectively. Temperature and WTD were also dominant predictors at the multiday scale. Atmospheric pressure (PA) was another important multiday scale predictor for peat-dominated sites, with drops in PA coinciding with synchronous releases of CH4.

So far, their overall role in regulating lake methane flux is a subject of debate because the oxygen produced by their roots can promote methane oxidation in the sediment but they can also enhance methanogenesis through organic substrate production. In this study, we used the eddy covariance method to investigate the temporal dynamics of the CH4 flux in a habitat of submerged macrophytes in Lake Taihu. The results show that the nighttime CH4 flux is on average 33% higher than the daytime flux, although a clear diurnal pattern is evident only in the spring. At the daily to the seasonal time scale, the sediment temperature is the main driver of the CH4 flux variations, implying higher methane production in the sediment at higher temperatures.

However, different LP relaxations often have different objective functions and variables of differing dimensions, which presents a barrier to effective comparison and analysis. In addition, the computational complexity of LP relaxation-based methods grows quickly with the number of constraints. Reducing the number of constraints without sacrificing the quality of the solutions is thus desirable. We propose a unified formulation under which existing MAP LP relaxations may be compared and analysed. Furthermore, we propose a new tool called Marginal Polytope Diagrams. Some properties of Marginal Polytope Diagrams are exploited such as node redundancy and edge equivalence. We show that using Marginal Polytope Diagrams allows the number of constraints to be reduced without loosening the LP relaxations. Then, using Marginal Polytope Diagrams and constraint reduction, we develop three novel message passing algorithms, and demonstrate that two of these show a significant improvement in speed over state-of-art algorithms while delivering a competitive, and sometimes higher, quality of solution.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1620"]}

This research examined the association between social network size and SWB and the mediating role of future time perspective (FTP) among Chinese retirees. We modeled the relationship between social network size, FTP, and SWB by two sub-studies. SWB was indicated by life satisfaction, positive affect, negative affect, and meaning in life. FTP comprised two dimensions: focusing on opportunity in future and focusing on limitation of time. Study 1 used the number of Spring Festival greeters, and Study 2 used the size of networks based on common actions (discussion, mutual helping, and social participation) as indicators of network size to examine the association and mediating effect among 1097 and 335 community-dwelling retirees, respectively. Both studies revealed that social network size was positively associated with SWB; FTP-opportunity but not FTP-limitation mediated above associations, when possible confounding variables were controlled for.

In this paper, we formulate hyper graph matching problems as constrained MAP inference problems in graphical models. Whereas previous discrete approaches introduce several global correspondence vectors, we introduce only one global correspondence vector, but several local correspondence vectors. This allows us to decompose the problem into a (linear) bipartite matching problem and several belief propagation sub-problems. Bipartite matching can be solved by traditional approaches, while the belief propagation sub-problem is further decomposed as two sub-problems with optimal substructure. Then a newly proposed dynamic programming procedure is used to solve the belief propagation sub-problem.

There were three different types of action intentions: kindness, hostility and non-interactiveness. Electro- physiological results revealed the peak amplitudes of N2 over the frontal sites for kindness intentions were significantly larger than those for hostility and non-interactive intentions. On the other hand, there were no significant differences between hostility and non-interactive intention at N2.

{"title": "A review of global wetland carbon stocks and management challenges\n", "abstract": " Wetlands have unique soil, vegetation, and biogeochemistry that arises from their landscape position and wetland hydrology, which creates low oxygen levels in the soil. With reduced oxygen availability, plants develop adaptations to survive, such as aerenchyma, that allow transport of atmospheric oxygen to their roots, and soil microbial communities become dominated by anaerobic respiration processes that are less efficient in oxidizing carbon. Combined, the above\u2010 and belowground carbon stocks of wetlands play a key role in the global carbon cycle at varying time scales. This chapter provides a comprehensive assessment of wetland carbon stocks, research methodologies, and their historical and future trajectories.

Displacement encoded phase-sensitive temporal interferogram is generated when phase stabilized femtosecond laser pulses transmitting through a time-stretch interferometer. To avoid the chirp of temporal interferogram due to high-order dispersion, time-to-frequency mapping is established to transform the temporal interferogram to the spectral interferogram for high-speed detection. The phase delay of spectral interferogram corresponding to specific displacements is retrieved and accumulated for linear fitting. The fitted slope is the time delay between two arms in the interferometer therefore displacement can be calculated. For precision verification, the preset displacements are measured.

{"title": "Memory-Augmented Dynamic Neural Relational Inference\n", "abstract": " Dynamic interacting systems are prevalent in vision tasks. These interactions are usually difficult to observe and measure directly, and yet understanding latent interactions is essential for performing inference tasks on dynamic systems like forecasting. Neural relational inference (NRI) techniques are thus introduced to explicitly estimate interpretable relations between the entities in the system for trajectory prediction. However, NRI assumes static relations; thus, dynamic neural relational inference (DNRI) was proposed to handle dynamic relations using LSTM. Unfortunately, the older information will be washed away when the LSTM updates the latent variable as a whole, which is why DNRI struggles with modeling long-term dependences and forecasting long sequences. This motivates us to propose a memory-augmented dynamic neural relational inference method, which maintains two associative memory pools: one for the interactive relations and the other for the individual entities. The two memory pools help retain useful relation features and node features for the estimation in the future steps. Our model dynamically estimates the relations by learning better embeddings and utilizing the long-range information stored in the memory. With the novel memory modules and customized structures, our memory-augmented DNRI can update and access the memory adaptively as required. The memory pools also serve as global latent variables across time to maintain detailed long-term temporal relations readily available for other components to use.

This study examines comovements across G20 international stock markets while considering the volatility similarity and spillover effects. We provide a new approach using an ICA- (independent component analysis-) based ARMA-APARCH-M model to shed light on whether there are spillover effects among G20 stock markets with similar dynamics. Specifically, we first identify which G20 stock markets have similar volatility features using a fuzzy C-means time series clustering method and then investigate the dominant source of volatility spillovers using the ICA-based ARMA-APARCH-M model. The evidence has shown that the ICA method can more accurately capture market comovements with nonnormal distributions of the financial time series data by transforming the multivariate time series into statistically independent components (ICs). Our findings indicate that the G20 stock markets are clustered into three categories according to volatility similarity. There are spillover effects in stock market comovements of each group and the dominant source can be identified.

{"title": "Solving Constrained Combinatorial Optimisation Problems via MAP Inference without High-Order Penalties\n", "abstract": " Solving constrained combinatorial optimisation problems via MAP inference is often achieved by introducing extra potential functions for each constraint. This can result in very high order potentials, eg a 2nd-order objective with pairwise potentials and a quadratic constraint over all N variables would correspond to an unconstrained objective with an order-N potential. This limits the practicality of such an approach, since inference with high order potentials is tractable only for a few special classes of functions. We propose an approach which is able to solve constrained combinatorial problems using belief propagation without increasing the order. For example, in our scheme the 2nd-order problem above remains order 2 instead of order N. Experiments on applications ranging from foreground detection, image reconstruction, quadratic knapsack, and the M-best solutions problem demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. Moreover, we show several situations in which our approach outperforms commercial solvers like CPLEX and others designed for specific constrained MAP inference problems.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1620"]}

Hydrologic inundation models, such as TOPMODEL, are based on a fundamental parameter known as the compound topographic index (CTI) and provide a computationally 5 cost-efficient approach to simulate wetland dynamics at global scales. However, there remains large discrepancy in the implementations of TOPMODEL in land-surface models (LSMs) and thus their performance against observations.
