{"title": "Applying associative retrieval techniques to alleviate the sparsity problem in collaborative filtering\n", "abstract": " Recommender systems are being widely applied in many application settings to suggest products, services, and information items to potential consumers. Collaborative filtering, the most successful recommendation approach, makes recommendations based on past transactions and feedback from consumers sharing similar interests. A major problem limiting the usefulness of collaborative filtering is the sparsity problem, which refers to a situation in which transactional or feedback data is sparse and insufficient to identify similarities in consumer interests. In this article, we propose to deal with this sparsity problem by applying an associative retrieval framework and related spreading activation algorithms to explore transitive associations among consumers through their past transactions and feedback.

Accordingly, a text analytics framework is proposed for Twitter sentiment analysis. The framework uses an elaborate bootstrapping ensemble to quell class imbalance, sparsity, and representational richness issues. Experiment results reveal that the proposed approach is more accurate and balanced in its predictions across sentiment classes, as compared to various comparison tools and algorithms.

{"title": "Mining opinion summarizations using convolutional neural networks in Chinese microblogging systems\n", "abstract": " Chinese microblogging is an increasingly popular social media platform. Accurately summarizing representative opinions from microblogs can increase understanding of the semantics of opinions. The unique challenges of Chinese opinion summarization in microblogging systems are automatic learning of important features and selection of representative sentences. Deep-learning methods can automatically discover multiple levels of representations from raw data instead of requiring manual engineering. However, there have been very few systematic studies on sentiment analysis of Chinese hot topics using deep-learning methods. Based on the latest deep-learning research, in this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based opinion summarization method for Chinese microblogging systems.

The public availability of transaction histories offers an opportunity to analyze and compare different cryptocurrencies. In this paper, we present a dynamic network analysis of three representative blockchain-based cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Namecoin. By analyzing the accumulated network growth, we find that, unlike most other networks, these cryptocurrency networks do not always densify over time, and they are changing all the time with relatively low node and edge repetition ratios. Therefore, we then construct separate networks on a monthly basis, trace the changes of typical network characteristics (including degree distribution, degree assortativity, clustering coefficient, and the largest connected component) over time, and compare the three. We find that the degree distribution of these monthly transaction networks cannot be well fitted by the famous power-law distribution, at the same time, different currency still has different network properties, e.g., both Bitcoin and Ethereum networks are heavy-tailed with disassortative mixing, however, only the former can be treated as a small world.

However, what the specific mechanisms of emotion entrainment are beyond in-person interactions, and how human emotions evolve under different entrainment patterns in large-scale social communities, are still unknown. In this paper, we aim to examine the massive emotion entrainment patterns and understand the underlying mechanisms in the context of social media. As modeling emotion dynamics on a large scale is often challenging, we elaborate a pragmatic framework to characterize and quantify the entrainment phenomenon. By applying this framework on the datasets from two large-scale social media platforms, we find that the emotions of online users entrain through social networks. We further uncover that online users often form their relations via dual entrainment, while maintain it through single entrainment. Remarkably, the emotions of online users are more convergent in nonreciprocal entrainment. Building on these findings, we develop an entrainment augmented model for emotion prediction. Experimental results suggest that entrainment patterns inform emotion proximity in dyads, and encoding their associations promotes emotion prediction.

A wide range of recommendation approaches have been developed to analyze past consumer-product interactions, consumer attributes, and product attributes to predict customer preferences and future transactions. In this paper we propose a unified recommendation framework based on a relational learning formalism, probabilistic relational models (PRMs). This framework includes most existing recommendation approaches, such as collaborative filtering, content-based, demographic filtering, and hybrid approaches, as special cases. Relational learning attempts to capture the relational data patterns within a database containing multiple interlinked data tables. As a main statistical model for relational learning, PRMs extend from standard models such as Bayesian networks by describing probabilistic dependencies among attributes of the same object as well as attributes of related objects in a relational domain. The inputs for recommendation are typically stored in a relational database and the general recommendation problem can be naturally formulated as a relational learning problem. We extended the original PRMs in order to capture relational data patterns that are important for recommendation modeling. We also customized the algorithm for learning PRMs for both dependency model construction and parameter estimation to exploit the special characteristics of the recommendation problem. Through an experimental study, we demonstrate that the proposed framework not only conceptually unifies existing recommendation approaches but also\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "39\n", "authors": ["1186"]}

A total of 3605 e-liquid related posts from January 1st, 2011 to June 30th, 2015 were collected from Reddit. Then the patterns of VG/PG distribution among different flavors were analyzed. Next, the relationship between throat hit, which was a typical symptom of e-cigarette use, and e-liquid components was studied. Finally, other symptoms were examined based on e-liquid components and user sentiment. We discovered 3 main sets of findings: 1) We identified three groups of flavors in terms of VG/PG ratios. Fruits, cream, and nuts flavors were similar. Sweet, menthol, and seasonings flavors were classified into one group. Tobacco and beverages flavors were the third group. 2) Throat hit was analyzed and we found that menthol and tobacco flavors, as well as high ratios of PG and nicotine level, could produce more throat hit. 3) A total of 9 systems of 25 symptoms were identified and analyzed. Components including VG/PG ratio, flavor, and nicotine could be possible reasons for these symptoms.

A new computational infrastructure and models are needed for a business to gain a competitive edge through effective use of this information base. One of the key issues in competing in the electronic marketplace is product/service differentiation. Currently there are no computational models for multi-issue decision making in electronic commerce.             We develop a model of interorganizational electronic commerce that explores various new choices and opportunities that the electronic marketplace offers.

This paper investigates an approach reducing a multi-class cost-sensitive learning to a standard classification task based on the data space expansion technique developed by Abe et al., which coincides with Elkan's reduction with respect to binary classification tasks. Using this proposed reduction approach, a cost-sensitive learning problem can be solved by considering a standard 0/1 loss classification problem on a new distribution determined by the cost matrix. We also propose a new weighting mechanism to solve the reduced standard classification problem, based on a theorem stating that the empirical loss on independently identically distributed samples from the new distribution is essentially the same as the loss on the expanded weighted training set.

Our empirical analysis of five widely-adopted open-source software packages reveals a set of interesting features of such networks, which cannot be adequately reproduced by existing complex network models. We then set out to develop a new network growth model, explicitly imitating generally-advocated software development principals, such as divide-and-conquer, modularization, high intra-module cohesion, and low inter-module coupling.

Among the most important and distinctive actionable knowledge are actionable behavioral rules that can directly and explicitly suggest specific actions to take to influence (restrain or encourage) the behavior in the users\u2019 best interest. However, in mining such rules, it often occurs that different rules may suggest the same actions with different expected utilities, which we call conflicting rules. To resolve the conflicts, a previous valid method was proposed. However, inconsistency of the measure for rule evaluating may hinder its performance. To overcome this problem, we develop a new method that utilizes rule ranking procedure as the basis for selecting the rule with the highest utility prediction accuracy. More specifically, we propose an integrative measure, which combines the measures of the support and antecedent length, to evaluate the utility prediction accuracies of conflicting rules. We also introduce a tunable weight parameter to allow the flexibility of integration. We conduct several experiments to test our proposed approach and evaluate the sensitivity of the weight parameter.

Methods: Consecutive patients admitted to public hospitals between 1st January and 24th May 2020 in Hong Kong with COVID-19 diagnosed by RT-PCR were included. The primary endpoint was ICU admission.  Results: This study included 1043 patients (median age 35 (IQR: 32-37; 54% male). Nineteen patients were admitted to ICU (median hospital length of stay (LOS): 30 days, median ICU LOS: 16 days). ICU patients were more likely to be prescribed angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, anti-retroviral drugs lopinavir/ritonavir and remdesivir, ribavirin, steroids, interferon-beta and hydroxychloroquine. Significant predictors of ICU admission were older age, male sex, prior coronary artery disease, respiratory diseases, diabetes, hypertension and chronic kidney disease, and activated partial thromboplastin time, red cell count, white cell count, albumin and serum sodium.

When the thickness deviation of defect layer is in the range of 5 nm, the variation of the wavelength is 6 nm. The bandwidth of the defect localized modes is 0.2 nm and its quality factor is of the order of 103.

Studying such spatio-temporal movement sequences to discover spatial sequential patterns holds promises in many real-world settings.

Traditional spatial data mining algorithms suitable for the Euclidean space are not directly applicable in these settings. We propose a new algorithm to cluster movement paths such as shopping trips for pattern discovery. In our work, we represent the spatio-temporal series as sequences of discrete locations following a pre-defined network.

{"title": "Coordination of purchasing and bidding activities across markets\n", "abstract": " In both consumer purchasing and industrial procurement, combinatorial interdependencies among the items to be purchased are commonplace. E-commerce compounds the problem by providing more opportunities for switching suppliers at low costs, but also potentially eases the problem by enabling automated market decision-making systems, commonly referred to as trading agents, to make purchasing decisions in an integrated manner across markets. Most of the existing research related to trading agents assumes that there exists a combinatorial market mechanism in which buyers (or sellers) can bid (or sell) service or merchandise bundles. Today's prevailing e-commerce practice, however, does not support this assumption in general and thus limits the practical applicability of these approaches.

Ordering, demand forecasting and inventory decisions at each link in the chain all depend not only an organizations immediate trading partners, but on every link in the supply chain. In the past, there was little coordination among all the participants in a supply chain\u2014each participant communicated with their suppliers (upstream) and buyers (downstream). Recently, however, organizations have focused more attention on the supply chain as a strategic asset, and communication is no longer between pairs of participants, but instead among all the members of a given supply chain. The rise of electronic commerce has further heightened the importance of supply chain management as companies reengineer processes as they are moved online. Little work has been done however, on how agents that represent members of a supply chain can communicate with one another as their human counterparts do now. We believe that successful supply chain integration demands knowledge-intensive agents. Such agents must have more than transactional knowledge that enables them to agree on prices and quantities. They must possess detailed knowledge of the domain in which they trade. In this paper we describe the knowledge needed, and suggest ways in which XML can be used to represent the needed knowledge.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1186"]}

Machine intelligence has met with limited success in detecting and curbing false news. Human knowledge and intelligence hold great potential to complement machine-based methods. Yet they are largely under-explored in current false news detection research, especially how to efficiently utilize such information. We observe that the crowd contributes to the challenging task of assessing the veracity of news by posting responses or reporting. We propose to combine these two types of scalable crowd judgments with machine intelligence to tackle the false news crisis. Specifically, we design a novel framework called CAND, which first extracts relevant human and machine judgments from data sources including news features and scalable crowd intelligence. The extracted information is then aggregated by an unsupervised Bayesian aggregation model. Evaluation based on Weibo and Twitter datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of crowd intelligence and the superior performance of the proposed framework in comparison with the benchmark methods. The results also generate many valuable insights, such as the complementary value of human and machine intelligence, the possibility of using human intelligence for early detection, and the robustness of our approach to intentional manipulation.

We identified 11 categories of flavors based on commonly used categorizations. Each post\u2019s frequency of being shared served as a proxy measure of information propagation. We evaluated a set of regression models and chose the hurdle negative binomial model to characterize the influence of different flavors and nonflavor control variables on e-cigarette\u2013related information propagation.Results: We found that 5 flavors (sweet, dessert & bakery, fruits, herbs & spices, and tobacco) had significantly negative influences on e-cigarette\u2013related information propagation, indicating the users\u2019 tendency not to share posts related to these flavors. We did not find a positive significance of any flavors, which is contradictory to previous research. In addition, we found that a set of nonflavor\u2013related factors were associated with information propagation.Conclusions: Mentions of flavors in posts did not enhance the popularity of e-cigarette\u2013related information.

Among the most important and distinctive actionable knowledge are actionable behavioral rules that can directly and explicitly suggest specific actions to take to influence (restrain or encourage) the behavior in the users' best interest. The problem of mining such rules is a search problem in a framework of support and expected utility.

A three-step decision structuring framework is used to develop a model, based on Bayesian networks, to support Supply Chain Management scenarios. The result is a Bayesian network that incorporates the knowledge of experts into a decision support model. It is shown that the model is essential as it contains all the vital elements of the problem from a managerial viewpoint. The described model can be used to perform what-if analysis in various ways, thereby supporting the management of risk in different scenarios.

We find that subsidized firms smooth their earnings more aggressively than their unsubsidized peers, consistent with firms that receive subsidies bearing higher political costs and having more incentives to smooth earnings to avoid public attention. Smoothing by subsidized firms is more pronounced when the subsidies are granted through non-tax-related channels than tax-based channels, and for firms with more opaque information environments. In addition, smoothing by subsidized firms reduces the ability of current earnings to predict future cash flows. Using textual content analysis, we find that the MD&As of subsidized firms provide less explanatory content to explain accruals, consistent with smoothing being used to obfuscate earnings.

In this paper, we strive to bridge this gap by proposing a framework for studying pure-strategy Nash equilibria in GSP auctions. We first analyze the equilibrium bidding behaviors by investigating the properties and distribution of all pure-strategy Nash equilibria. Our analysis shows that the set of all pure-strategy Nash equilibria of a GSP auction can be partitioned into separate convex polyhedra based on the order of bids if the valuations of all advertisers are distinct. We further show that only the polyhedron that allocates slots efficiently is weakly stable, thus allowing all inefficient equilibria to be weeded out. We then propose a novel refinement method for identifying a set of equilibria named the stable Nash equilibrium set (STNE) and prove that STNE is either the same as or a proper subset of the set of the well-known symmetrical Nash equilibria. These findings free both auctioneers and advertisers from complicated strategic thinking. The revenue of a GSP auction on STNE is at least the same as that of the classical Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism and can be used as a benchmark for evaluating other mechanisms. At the same time, STNE provides advertisers a simple yet effective and stable bidding strategy.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1186"]}

{"title": "An interpretable neural network model through piecewise linear approximation\n", "abstract": " Most existing interpretable methods explain a black-box model in a post-hoc manner, which uses simpler models or data analysis techniques to interpret the predictions after the model is learned. However, they (a) may derive contradictory explanations on the same predictions given different methods and data samples, and (b) focus on using simpler models to provide higher descriptive accuracy at the sacrifice of prediction accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid interpretable model that combines a piecewise linear component and a nonlinear component. The first component describes the explicit feature contributions by piecewise linear approximation to increase the expressiveness of the model. The other component uses a multi-layer perceptron to capture feature interactions and implicit nonlinearity, and increase the prediction performance. Different from the post-hoc approaches, the interpretability is obtained once the model is learned in the form of feature shapes. We also provide a variant to explore higher-order interactions among features to demonstrate that the proposed model is flexible for adaptation. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve good interpretability by describing feature shapes while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1186"]}

One of the obvious challenges is how to aggregate these possibly noisy labels provided by a set of heterogeneous annotators. Another challenge stems from the difficulty in evaluating the annotator reliability without even knowing the ground truth, which can be used to build incentive mechanisms in crowdsourcing platforms. When each instance is associated with many possible labels simultaneously, the problem becomes even harder because of its combinatorial nature. In this paper, we present new flexible Bayesian models and efficient inference algorithms for multi-label annotation aggregation by taking both annotator reliability and label dependency into account. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets confirm that the proposed methods outperform other competitive alternatives, and the model can recover the type of the annotators with high accuracy.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1186"]}

This paper proposes a novel approach to convert this semantic information into quantitative values from a smoothing point of view, taking advantage of the topic-based method, and then make recommendation in a traditional user-based CF fashion based on the smoothed user-item matrix.

{"title": "Comparison between early outbreak detection models and simulated outbreaks of measles in Beijing\n", "abstract": " OBJECTIVE: Using simulated outbreaks to choose the optimal model and its related parameters on measles so as to provide technical support for developing an Auto Warning System (AWS). METHODS: AEGIS-Cluster Creation Tool was applied to simulate a range of unique outbreak signals. Then these simulations were added to the actual daily counts of measles from the National Disease Surveillance System, between 2005 and 2007. Exponential weighted moving average (EWMA), C1-MILD (C1), C2-MEDIUM (C2), C3-ULTRA (C3) and space-time permutation scan statistic model were comprehensively applied to detect these simulations. Tools for evaluation as Youden's index and detection time were calculated to optimize parameters before an optimal model was finally chosen. RESULTS: EWMA (lamda= 0.6, k= 1.0), CI (k= 0.1, H= 3sigma), C2 (k= 0.1, H= 3sigma), C3 (k= 1.0, H= 4sigma) and space-time permutation scan statistic (maximum temporal cluster size= 7 d, maximum spatial cluster size= 5 km) appeared to be the optimal parameters among these models. Youden's index of EWMA was 90.8% and detection time being 0.121 d. Youden's index of C1 was 88.7% and detection time being 0.142 d. Youden's index of C2 was 92.9% and detection time being 0.121 d. Youden's index of C3 was 87.9% and detection time being 0.058 d. Youden's index of space-time permutation scan statistic was 94.3% and detection time being 0.176 d.

As such, advertisers have to consider their competitors' responses when making advertising decisions, which concern both bid determination in individual keyword auction instances, and budget allocation over time at the aggregate market level. Although bidding decisions have been extensively treated in competitive auction settings in the literature, competitive budgeting models are yet to be developed. Applying the differential game framework, we propose a dynamic budget allocation model in a duopolistic competitive setting. We first examine the steady-state Nash equilibrium policies for the advertisers, and then investigate the optimal paths of open-loop Nash equilibrium. In addition, we provide an algorithm to compute the optimal path of budget policies. Computational experiments were conducted to derive additional managerial insights. One important finding of this study is that the effects of two advertising factors, quality score and potential market revenue, on the steady-state budget levels are non-monotonic. This finding to some extent challenges the commonly-held view that higher quality scores lead to lower optimal advertising expenditures. Another interesting finding suggests that advertisers should set a budget cap even in a competitive environment to avoid the potential risk of over-spending in sponsored search advertising.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1186"]}

We also find that the effect is more conspicuous among firms with board members with a concentration of rare surnames and those operating in a more developed institutional environment. Moreover, we test the mechanisms through which surname diversity fuels firm value.

In this paper we apply random graph theory to analyze bipartite consumer-product graphs that represent sales transactions to better understand consumer purchase behavior in e-commerce settings. Based on two real-world e-commerce datasets we found that such graphs demonstrate topological features that significantly deviate from theoretical predictions based on standard random graph models. In particular we observed consistently larger-than-expected average path lengths and tendency to cluster. Such deviations suggest that the consumers' choices of products are not random and provide justification for a large family of collaborative filtering-based recommendation algorithms that make product recommendations based only on previously observed sales transactions. By analyzing the artificial consumer-product graphs generated by graph generation models that embed two representative recommendation algorithms, we found that these recommendation-algorithm-induced graphs generally provided a better match with the real-world consumer-product graphs than purely random graph models. However, consistent deviations in topological features remained. These findings have motivated the development of a new recommendation algorithm based on graph partitioning aiming to achieve high clustering coefficients as observed in the real-world graphs.

It aims to identify the logical relationship between two sentences. Most of the existing approaches make such inference based on semantic knowledge obtained through training corpus. The adoption of background knowledge is rarely seen or limited to a few specific types. In this paper, we propose a novel Knowledge Graph-enhanced NLI (KGNLI) model to leverage the usage of background knowledge stored in knowledge graphs in the field of NLI. KGNLI model consists of three components: a semantic-relation representation module, a knowledge-relation representation module, and a label prediction module. Different from previous methods, various kinds of background knowledge can be flexibly combined in the proposed KGNLI model. Experiments on four benchmarks, SNLI, MultiNLI, SciTail, and BNLI, validate the effectiveness of our model.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1186"]}

{"title": "SRGCN: Graph-based multi-hop reasoning on knowledge graphs\n", "abstract": " Learning to infer missing links is one of the fundamental tasks in the knowledge graph. Instead of reasoning based on separate paths in the existing methods, in this paper, we propose a new model, Sequential Relational Graph Convolutional Network (SRGCN), which treats the multiple paths between an entity pair as a sequence of subgraphs. Specifically, to reason the relationship between two entities, we first construct a graph for the entities based on the knowledge graph and serialize the graph to a sequence. For each hop in the sequence, Relational Graph Convolutional Network (R-GCN) is then applied to update the embeddings of the entities. The updated embedding of the tail entity contains information of the entire graph, hence the relationship between two entities can be inferred from it. Compared to the existing approaches that deal with paths separately, SRGCN treats the graph as a whole, which can\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1186"]}

However, in the real world, high-quality data is usually difficult to acquire due to privacy or cost. Especially when it comes to credit card fraud, the fraud samples are quite rare. Detecting card fraud with few samples is a meaningful task. Graph neural network (GNN) is a good way to deal with few samples because an advantage of GNN is that information can be disseminated through connections between nodes. However, the data structure of credit cards cannot be applied by the GNN-based method directly. In this paper, we proposed a GNN-based few-shot learning method which can detect credit card fraud with few samples effectively.

This approach combines the advantages of prior knowledge and neural networks.

Many countries have imposed export restrictions on PPE to ensure the sufficient domestic supply. The surging demand and export restrictions cause shortage contagions on the global PPE trade network. Here, we develop an integrated network model, which integrates a metapopulation model and a threshold model, to investigate the shortage contagion patterns. The metapopulation model captures disease contagion across countries. The threshold model captures the shortage contagion on the global PPE trade network. Results show that, the shortage contagion patterns are mainly decided by top exporters. Export restrictions exacerbate the shortages of PPE and cause the shortage contagion to transmit even faster than the disease contagion.

{"title": "How search engine advertising affects sales over time: An empirical investigation\n", "abstract": " As a mainstream marketing channel on the Internet, Search Engine Advertising (SEA) has a huge business impact and attracts a plethora of attention from both academia and industry. One important goal of advertising is to increase sales. Nevertheless, while previous research has studied multiple factors that are potentially related to the outcome of SEA campaigns, effects of these factors on actual sales generated by SEA remain understudied. It is also unclear whether and how such effects change over time in highly dynamic SEA campaigns. As the first empirical investigation of the dynamic advertisement-sales relationship in SEA, this study builds an advertising response model within a time-varying coefficient (TVC) modeling framework, and estimates the model using a unique dataset from a large E-Commerce retailer in the United States. Results reveal the effects of the advertising expenditure, consumer behaviors and advertisement characteristics on realized sales, and demonstrate that such effects on sales do change over time in non-linear ways. More importantly, we find that carryover has a stronger effect in generating sales than direct response does, conversion rate is much more important than click-through rate, and ad position does not have significant effects on sales. These findings have direct implications for advertisers to launch more effective SEA campaigns.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1186"]}

{"title": "The effectiveness of non-persistent social status as an incentive mechanism\n", "abstract": " Content sharing platforms such as product review websites largely depend on users' voluntary contributions. In order to motivate users to contribute more, many platforms established reputation-based incentive mechanisms. Though the academic community has devoted much effort to study the effectiveness of these mechanisms, most of the existing research has focused on everlasting reputations such as badges and points. It's still largely underexplored how non-persistent social status actually influences user's behavior ranging from contribution level, the opinion they express, to how they express. In this paper, we answer this question by examining data from Yelp Elite Squad where reviewers with good reviewing history are awarded into the elite group and most importantly re-evaluated each year. By applying propensity score matching and difference-in-difference methods, we find that in short term, reviewers significantly increase their contribution levels after acquiring the non-persistent social status, become more conservative with lower percentage of extreme ratings, and also increase the readability of their reviews. In long term, they continue to improve the quality of reviews while their numerical rating behaviors stabilize.

{"title": "Exploring opinion dynamics in security-related microblog data\n", "abstract": " Web social media has become one of the major channels for people to express their opinions, share their feelings and communicate with others. Public opinions often ebb and flow with time due to the occurrence of social events and mutual influence of people on certain topics. The dynamic change of public opinions reflects the evolvement and trend of public attitudes and can facilitate many security-related applications. In this paper, we explore the modeling and detection of opinion dynamics on a specific topic based on textual social media data. We first define three measures to provide a thorough description of opinion dynamics, and identify the key factors that influence opinion changes, namely sentiment, social influence and dynamic factors. We then develop the computational method to capture opinion dynamics in security-related data. A preliminary empirical study is conducted based on the data from\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1186"]}

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted among 45 patients who were admitted to our department between October 2010 and August 2011 for abdominal pain. All the patients underwent ultrasound, abdominal X-ray and DSCT examinations and subsequent surgical interventions, which confirmed the diagnosis of colon tumor obstruction. RESULTS: DSCT diagnosis was obviously more efficient than ultrasound and X-ray in detecting colon obstruction by neoplasms, and could better predict the position of the obstruction. Complete information of the vessels in the surgical field could be obtained by DSCT imaging three-dimensional reconstruction. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with ultrasound and X-ray, DSCT is more effective in the diagnosis of colon tumor obstruction by acquiring more thorough information by imaging reconstruction and should be considered for a rapid and accurate diagnosis.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1186"]}
{"title": "A new pruning method for resolving conflicts in actionable behavioral rules\n", "abstract": " Among the most important and distinctive actionable knowledge are actionable behavioral rules that can directly and explicitly suggest specific actions to take to influence the behavior in the users' best interest. However, in mining such rules, it often occurs that different rules may suggest the same actions with different expected utilities, which we call conflicting rules. To resolve the conflicts, a previous pruning method was proposed. However, inconsistency of the measure for rule pruning may hinder its performance. To overcome this problem, we develop a new pruning method to achieve rule pruning in actionable rule discovery. We conduct several experiments to test our proposed approach and evaluate the sensitivity of the weight parameter. Empirical results based on a benchmark terrorism dataset indicate that our approach outperforms those from previous research.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1186"]}

{"title": "Dynamic budget adjustment in search auctions\n", "abstract": " With serious advertising budget constraints, advertisers have to adjust their daily budget according to the performance of advertisements in real time. Thus we can leave precious budgets to better opportunities in the future, and avoid the surge of ineffective clicks for unnecessary costs. However, advertisers usually have no sufficient knowledge and time for real-time advertising operations in search auctions. We formulate the budget adjustment problem as a state-action decision process in the reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Considering dynamics of marketing environments and some distinctive features of search auctions, we extend continuous reinforcement learning to fit the budget decision scenarios. The market utility is defined as discounted total clicks to get during the remaining period of an advertising schedule. We conduct experiments to validate and evaluate our strategy of budget adjustment with real world data from search advertising campaigns. Experimental results showed that our strategy outperforms the two other baseline strategies.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1186"]}
{"title": "Markov switching models for outbreak detection\n", "abstract": " Infectious disease outbreak detection is one of the main objectives of syndromic surveillance systems. Accurate and timely detection can provide valuable information for public health officials to react to major public health threats. However, disease outbreaks are often not directly observable. Moreover, additional noise caused by routine behavioral patterns and special events further complicates the task of identifying abnormal patterns caused by infectious disease outbreaks. We consider the problem of identifying outbreak patterns in a syndrome count time series using the Markov switching models. The outbreak states are treated as hidden (unobservable) state variables. Gibbs sampler then is used to estimate both the parameters and hidden state variables. We cover both the theoretical foundation of the estimation methods and the technical details of estimating the Markov switching models.

{"title": "Maximizing Influence Through Information-Overloaded Online Social Networks\n", "abstract": " Online social communities have become an important communication channel for people to share and discover information. Pieces of information spread within the community via the underlying social network, from one individual to another. However, with the unprecedented ease and low cost of communication provided by online systems, information overload emerges as a negative factor that potentially threatens the effectiveness of communication. As such, traditional single-message based diffusion models, such as Independent Cascade Model (ICM), are inadequate for describing the role of information overload. We then proposed an extended version of ICM (EICM) that explicitly takes the message multiplicity into account, after examining the message exchange patterns observed from a real online social community. We extensively evaluated this new diffusion model and compared with standard ICM in addressing one fundamental algorithmic problem related to viral marketing: How to select a set of network nodes/individuals to facilitate information diffusion and maximize influence? The evaluation results obtained from using both real and simulated data sets show that our approach results in node-selection heuristics outperforming well-studied notions of various centrality measures based on the ICM. The study and findings presented in this research have important managerial implications. In particular, from a viral marketing perspective, information overload effect should be recognized in order for campaign managers to build advantages in their influence maximization decisions.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1186"]}

This solution concept, however, has major limitations. It allows for over-bidding and has uncompelling upper bounds. In this paper, we propose a risk-free refinement of symmetric Nash equilibrium (RfSNE), to tackle these limitations. RfSNE can be determined by a bottom-up recursive algorithm. At an RfSNE, no advertiser is exposed to the risk of payoff loss caused by over-bidding. Managerially, RfSNE can be employed by search engines to help advertisers plan bidding strategy and the revenues realized on the set of RfSNEs can be used as a benchmark to evaluate alternative auction mechanisms.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1186"]}

METHODS: Considering the seasonality and the number of vaccination on pandemic influenza A (H1N1), data regarding pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in Beijing were collected and analyzed. Based on the dynamics of infectious disease transmission, a quantitative model for evaluation of prevention and control measures was developed. RESULTS: Both latency and infectious periods of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) were estimated to be 1.82 days and 2.08 days, respectively. The effective reproduction numbers of the three periods were 1.13, 1.65 and 0.96, respectively. Thanks to the implementation of a series of measures to prevent and control pandemic influenza A (H1N1), the cumulative number of laboratory-confirmed cases of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) was reduced, making it much smaller than what would have been under the natural situation. Specifically, the program on pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vaccination reduced the cumulative number of laboratory-confirmed cases by 24.08% and postponed the peak time. CONCLUSION: Measures that had been taken during this period, had greatly contributed to the successful prevention and control of pandemic influenza A (H1N1). The 2009 Pandemic (H1N1) vaccination was confirmed to have contributed to the decrease of cumulative number of laboratory-confirmed cases and postponed the peak arrival time.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1186"]}

{"title": "Randomized distributed access to mutually exclusive resources\n", "abstract": " Many systems consist of a set of agents which must acquire exclusive access to resources from a shared pool. Coordination of agents in such systems is often implemented in the form of a centralized mechanism. The intervention of this type of mechanism, however, typically introduces significant computational overhead and reduces the amount of concurrent activity. Alternatives to centralized mechanisms exist, but they generally suffer from the need for extensive interagent communication. In this paper, we develop a randomized approach to make multiagent resource-allocation decisions with the objective of maximizing expected concurrency measured by the number of the active agents. This approach does not assume a centralized mechanism and has no need for interagent communication. Compared to existing autonomous-decentralized-decision-making (ADDM)-based approaches for resource-allocation, our work emphasizes achieving the highest degree of agent autonomy and is able to handle more general resource requirements.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1186"]}
