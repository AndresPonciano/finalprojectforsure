The analysis highlights the advantages of cascode amplifiers and the disadvantages of amplifiers employing global feedback. Feedback gives rise to two significant errors, one arising from an increase in the input-noise current, the other from the modification of the amplifier input impedance. With care, the errors arising from thermal-noise sources associated with the preamplifiers can be kept below 1 mK. However the largest error associated with the preamplifiers, typically 10 mK to 30 mK and previously unnoticed, arises from the interaction of the input capacitance and the transmission line inductance. This effect negates the common practice of matching the RC time constants in noise thermometers.", "num_citations": "44\n", "authors": ["1715"]}

To mitigate distortion effects in the correlator, the RT products of the two sensors must be the same, and to mitigate frequency-response errors in nominally identical input circuits, the two sensing resistances should be the same. A noise thermometer using synthetic noise for the primary reference signal overcomes this conflict because the output voltage and output resistance are independent. This paper presents the rationale and design constraints for a noise thermometer using a synthetic-noise source based on Josephson junctions.

{"title": "Compilation by stochastic Hamiltonian sparsification\n", "abstract": " Simulation of quantum chemistry is expected to be a principal application of quantum computing. In quantum simulation, a complicated Hamiltonian describing the dynamics of a quantum system is decomposed into its constituent terms, where the effect of each term during time-evolution is individually computed. For many physical systems, the Hamiltonian has a large number of terms, constraining the scalability of established simulation methods. To address this limitation we introduce a new scheme that approximates the actual Hamiltonian with a sparser Hamiltonian containing fewer terms. By stochastically sparsifying weaker Hamiltonian terms, we benefit from a quadratic suppression of errors relative to deterministic approaches. Relying on optimality conditions from convex optimisation theory, we derive an appropriate probability distribution for the weaker Hamiltonian terms, and compare its error bounds with other probability ansatzes for some electronic structure Hamiltonians. Tuning the sparsity of our approximate Hamiltonians allows our scheme to interpolate between two recent random compilers: qDRIFT and randomized first order Trotter. Our scheme is thus an algorithm that combines the strengths of randomised Trotterisation with the efficiency of qDRIFT, and for intermediate gate budgets, outperforms both of these prior methods.", "num_citations": "27\n", "authors": ["1715"]}

The dopant levels used were 1.0, 0.1 and 0.0130 and 400 degrees C, with spectra being taken both prior to heat treatments, and after heating to 500 degrees C for one hour and cooling at different rates. For the RL, each sample gave a UV/blue emission band near 300 nm which decreased with increasing Nd concentration. During thermoluminescence the Nd is the main recombination centre and shows characteristic line emission. However the spectra vary with concentration and thermal treatments.

This dominance is increasing with the advent of ubiquitous computing whereby lightweight, low-resource systems are being deployed on a vast scale.  These systems present new engineering challenges: high-volume production places a stronger emphasis on absolute cost, resources available to executing software are highly constrained, and physical manufacturing capabilities approach hard limits.  Add to this the sensitive nature of many of these systems, such as smartcards used for financial transactions, and the development of these systems becomes a formidable engineering challenge.   For the software engineer, the incentive to produce efficient and resource-aware software for these platforms is great, yet existing tools do not support them well in this task.  It is difficult to assess the impact  of decisions made at the source code level in terms of how they change a system's resource consumption.  Existing toolchains, together with the very complex interactions of software and their host processors, can produce unforeseen implications at run-time of even small changes.   We could describe such a situation as an instance of programming the unprogrammable, and Genetic Programming is one solution method used for such problems.

Our results indicate thresholds across all three families of hypergraph product code, and provide evidence of exponential suppression in the low error regime.

The conceptual underpinnings of the project are: truly extensible algorithm templates that support reuse without modification, white box problem descriptions that provide generic support for the injection of domain specific knowledge, and remotely accessible frameworks, components and problems that will enhance reproducibility and accelerate the field\u2019s progress. We argue that, via such principled choice of infrastructure support, the field can pursue a\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1715"]}

SUMMARY ANSWER           ES was safe but did not improve pregnancy outcomes when performed in the mid-luteal phase prior to the first IVF cycle, with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).                             WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY           ES is an \u2018add-on\u2019 treatment that is available to women undergoing a first cycle of IVF, with or without ICSI, despite a lack of evidence to support its use.                             STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION           This pragmatic, superiority, open-label, multi-centre, parallel-group randomised controlled trial involving 1048 women assessed the clinical effectiveness and safety of the ES procedure prior to first time IVF, with or without ICSI, between July\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1715"]}
{"title": "Optimising Trotter-Suzuki decompositions for quantum simulation using evolutionary strategies\n", "abstract": " One of the most promising applications of near-term quantum computing is the simulation of quantum systems, a classically intractable task. Quantum simulation requires computationally expensive matrix exponentiation; Trotter-Suzuki decomposition of this exponentiation enables efficient simulation to a desired accuracy on a quantum computer. We apply the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm to optimise the Trotter-Suzuki decompositions of a canonical quantum system, the Heisenberg Chain; we reduce simulation error by around 60%. We introduce this problem to the computational search community, show that an evolutionary optimisation approach is robust across runs and problem instances, and find that optimisation results generalise to the simulation of larger systems.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1715"]}
{"title": "Luminescence detection of nanoparticle inclusions from their phase transitions\n", "abstract": " Nanoparticle inclusions in insulators from contaminants dramatically alter host luminescence properties of intensity and spectra. Their presence is readily revealed if, during heating or cooling, the nanoparticles undergo phase transitions, as their structural changes modify the host signals. Examples cited include both bulk contaminants retained from growth, and impurities and changes from surface reactions and in-diffusion. Phase changes from impurities such as water ice, oxygen, nitrogen, argon, or carbon dioxide can alter the host emission intensity by factors of ten to a hundred times, and also distort the spectra. Such nanoparticle inclusions are detectable in many insulators. Unfortunately, not only does this imply that published data of luminescence performance efficiency may often have been compromised, but the examples of pressure transitions controlling long range interactions within the host lattice mean\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1715"]}

{"title": "Fine-grained timing using genetic programming\n", "abstract": " In previous work, we have demonstrated that it is possible to use Genetic Programming to minimise the resource consumption of software, such as its power consumption or execution time. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which Genetic Programming can be used to gain fine-grained control over software timing. We introduce the ideas behind our work, and carry out experimentation to find that Genetic Programming is indeed able to produce software with unusual and desirable timing properties, where it is not obvious how a manual approach could replicate such results. In general, we discover that Genetic Programming is most effective in controlling statistical properties of software rather than precise control over its timing for individual inputs. This control may find useful application in cryptography and embedded systems.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1715"]}
{"title": "A new approach to Johnson noise thermometry using a quantum voltage noise source for calibration\n", "abstract": " We describe a new approach to Johnson noise thermometry (JNT) that takes advantage of the recent advances in Josephson voltage standards and digital signal processing techniques. Previous attempts at high-precision thermometry using Johnson noise have been limited by the non-ideal performance of the electronic systems. By using the perfect quantization of voltages from the Josephson effect, any arbitrary broadband waveform can be synthesized and used as a calculable noise source for calibrating the cross-correlation electronics. With better calibration, we should be able to achieve relative accuracies of parts in 10/sup 5/ for an arbitrary temperature in the range between 84 K and 430 K. We present the latest measurements of our recently constructed JNT system.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1715"]}

Growing evidence links weight loss with negative prognostic outcomes. We aimed to explore the practice of dietitians in the UK with regard to the nutritional management of ALS.   Methods A national online survey was disseminated via professional groups, social media and newsletters to UK healthcare professionals between September and November 2018. The survey examined the nutritional management of ALS. Dietitian responses are reported in the present study.   Results In total, 130 dietitians responded to the survey. Two\u2010thirds reported that ALS comprised less than 20% of their total patient caseload. Forty\u2010two percent reported that nutritional screening took place in their organisation.

{"title": "Modelling Genetic Programming as a Simple Sampling Algorithm\n", "abstract": " Previous attempts to characterise Genetic Programming (GP) have focused on complex schemata, that is \u2018templates\u2019 of full GP trees or subtrees composed of fixed positions that specify the presence of a given function from the function set, and other unspecified \u2018wildcard\u2019positions that indicate any single function, or an arbitrary subtree; a schema represents a set of expression trees that share some syntactic characteristics. Unfortunately, the complicated definitions of such schemata has made resulting theories difficult to test empirically, and GP schema theory has been criticised for its inability to make significant predictions or inform the development of improved algorithms. We present a dramatically simplified approach to GP schema theory, which considers only the distribution of functions at a single node in the tree, ignoring second-order effects that describe the context within which the node resides: for example, we do not consider parent-child node relationships. Our schemata are thus", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1715"]}
{"title": "Extending the \u201cOpen-Closed Principle\u201d to Automated Algorithm Configuration\n", "abstract": " Metaheuristics are an effective and diverse class of optimization algorithms: a means of obtaining solutions of acceptable quality for otherwise intractable problems. The selection, construction, and configuration of a metaheuristic for a given problem has historically been a manually intensive process based on experience, experimentation, and reasoning by metaphor. More recently, there has been interest in automating the process of algorithm configuration. In this article, we identify shared state as an inhibitor of progress for such automation. To solve this problem, we introduce the Automated Open-Closed Principle (AOCP), which stipulates design requirements for unintrusive reuse of algorithm frameworks and automated assembly of algorithms from an extensible palette of components. We demonstrate how the AOCP enables a greater degree of automation than previously possible via an example implementation.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1715"]}
{"title": "An improved electronic measurement of the Boltzmann constant by Johnson noise thermometry\n", "abstract": " Recent measurements using acoustic gas thermometry have determined the value of the Boltzmann constant, k, with a relative uncertainty less than 1\uf0b4 10-6. These results have been supported by a measurement with a relative uncertainty of 1.9\uf0b4 10-6 made with dielectric constant gas thermometry. Together, the measurements meet the requirements of the International Committee for Weights and Measures and enable them to proceed with the redefinition of the kelvin in 2018. In further support, we provide a new determination of k using a purely electronic approach, Johnson noise thermometry, in which the thermal noise power generated by a sensing resistor immersed in a triple-point-of-water cell is compared to the noise power of a quantum-accurate pseudo-random noise waveform of nominally equal noise power. The experimental setup differs from that of the 2015 determinations in several respects: a 100 \u03a9\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1715"]}
{"title": "Automated heap sizing in the poly/ML runtime\n", "abstract": " Typical theorem-proving workloads on the Poly/ML runtime may execute for several hours, occupying multi-gigabyte heaps. The runtime heap size may be fixed at execution startup time, or it may be allowed to vary dynamically. To date, runtime heap size growth has been implemented using simple hard-coded heuristics. In this position paper, we argue that a mathematically rigorous approach to heap sizing, based on control theory, is more appropriate.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1715"]}
