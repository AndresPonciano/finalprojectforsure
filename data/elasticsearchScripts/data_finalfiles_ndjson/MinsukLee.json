{"title": "Strategies to improve the corrosion resistance of microarc oxidation (MAO) coated magnesium alloys for degradable implants: Prospects and challenges\n", "abstract": " The development of biodegradable implants is indeed fascinating and among the various types of materials used in this regard, magnesium and its alloys assume significance. However, the rapid corrosion, generation of a large volume of hydrogen gas, accumulation of the hydrogen bubbles in gas pockets adjacent to the implant, increase in local pH of the body fluid, are the major impediments in using them as an implant material. Hence, development of Mg/Mg alloy based degradable implants requires that (i) they should maintain sufficient mechanical strength and integrity until the affected part of body is healed; (ii) they should exhibit good resistance to corrosion in the body fluid during the initial periods of implantation and subsequently corrode in a controlled and uniform fashion; and (iii) the corrosion products should not exceed the acceptable absorption level of the human body.

The goal of this study was to poll a panel of expert anesthesiologists to determine which clinical anesthesia outcomes associated with routine outpatient surgery were judged to occur frequently and to be important to avoid. Outcomes scoring highly in both scales could then be prioritized for measurement and improvement in ambulatory clinical practice. A mailed survey instrument instructed panel members to rate 33 clinical anesthesia outcomes in two scales: how frequently they believe the outcomes occur and which outcomes they expect patients find important to avoid. A feedback process (Delphi process) was used to gain consensus rankings of the outcomes for each scale.

The proposed technique consists of two steps. The first step performs a per-task analysis to estimate cache-related preemption cost for each execution point in a given task. The second step computes the worst case response time of each task that includes the cache-related preemption delay using a response time equation and a linear programming technique. This step takes as its input the preemption cost information of tasks obtained in the first step. This paper also compares the proposed approach with previous approaches. The results show that the proposed approach gives a prediction of the worst case cache-related preemption delay that is up to 60 percent tighter than those obtained from the previous approaches.", "num_citations": "404\n", "authors": ["881"]}

The optimal adhesion of mammalian cells is critical in determining the cell viability and proliferation on substrate surfaces. Because of the inherent high hydrophobicity of a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) surface, cell culture on these surfaces is unfavorable, causing cells to eventually dislodge from the surface. Although physically adsorbed matrix proteins can promote initial cell adhesion, this effect is usually short-lived.

However, L929 cells that express human TNF-R1 lacking most of the intracellular domain fail to respond to anti-human-TNF-R1 Ab. This demonstrates that the intracellular domain of TNF-R1 is necessary to generate antiviral activity. TNF-R1 but not TNF-R2 also signals killing of virus-infected cells by TNF-alpha.

The biocompatibility of carbon nanomaterials such as graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), that is, single-walled and multiwalled CNTs, against pheochromocytoma-derived PC-12 neural cells was also evaluated by quantifying metabolic activity (with WST-8 assay), intracellular oxidative stress (with ROS assay), and membrane integrity (with LDH assay). Graphene films were grown by using chemical vapor deposition and were then coated onto glass coverslips by using the scooping method. Graphene sheets were patterned on SiO2/Si substrates by using photolithography and were then covered with serum for a neural cell culture. Both types of CNTs induced significant dose-dependent decreases in the viability of PC-12 cells, whereas graphene exerted adverse effects on the neural cells just at over 62.5\u2009ppm. This result implies that graphene and CNTs, even though they were the same carbon-based nanomaterials, show differential influences on neural cells. Furthermore, graphene-coated or graphene-patterned substrates were shown to substantially enhance the adhesion and neurite outgrowth of PC-12 cells. These results suggest that graphene-based substrates as biomimetic cues have good biocompatibility as well as a unique surface property that can enhance the neural cells, which would open up enormous opportunities in neural regeneration and nanomedicine.", "num_citations": "70\n", "authors": ["881"]}

All groups finished nutrition counseling every three weeks for 12 weeks. Anthropometric, dietary assessments (24 hr-recall) and blood samples were measured at 0 and 12 weeks nutrition counseling. After 12 weeks of intervention, anthropometric data (weight, BMl, body fat (%), and waist/hip ratio) were significantly decreased (p< 0.05) in all groups. Daily consumption of calorie was decreased significantly (p< 0.05) in the group of low risk and high risk. Blood level of fasting plasma glucose was significantly decreased (p< 0.001) in all groups after 12 weeks of intervention. Significantly, the fasting plasma glucose level was returned to normal range in the high risk group. The number of people who have three or more risk factors of MS (high risk group) was decreased from 25 to 12. Sum of MS Criteria decreased from 85 to 52 in the group of MS and decreased from 143 to 99 in all groups. These results indicate that nutrition counseling for male workers at the worksite proved to be helpful by reducing the risk factors of MS and thereby reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease.

The SKN was analyzed in combination with membrane-permeabilizing agents Tris and Triton X-100, ATPase inhibitors sodium azide and N,N\u2032-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, and S. aureus-derived peptidoglycan; the effects on MRSA viability were evaluated by the broth microdilution method, time-kill test, and transmission electron microscopy. Addition of membrane-permeabilizing agents or ATPase inhibitors together with a low dose of SKN potentiated SKN anti-MRSA activity, as evidenced by the reduction of MRSA cell density by 75% compared to that observed when SKN was used alone; in contrast, addition of peptidoglycan blocked the antibacterial activity of SKN. The results indicate that the anti-MRSA effect of SKN is associated with its affinity to peptidoglycan, the permeability of the cytoplasmic membrane, and the activity of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters.

A very good correlation exists between the F/O ratio of the coatings prepared under varying experimental conditions and their icorr, |Z| and phase angle maximum; the higher the F/O ratio, the better the corrosion protective ability of the coatings in Hank's balanced salt solution.

In this study, the preventive effects of EGCG against serial passage-induced senescence were investigated in primary cells including rat vascular smooth muscle cells (RVSMCs), human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs), and human articular chondrocytes (HACs). The involvement of Sirt1 and acetylated p53 was examined as an underlying mechanism for the senescence preventive activity of EGCG in HDFs. All cells were employed with the initial passage number (PN) between 3 and 7. For inducing senescence, the cells were serially passaged at the predetermined times and intervals in the absence or presence of EGCG (50 or 100\u2009\u03bcM). Serial passage-induced senescence in RVSMCs and HACs was able to be significantly prevented at 50\u2009\u03bcM EGCG, while in HDFs, 100\u2009\u03bcM EGCG could significantly prevent senescence and recover their cell cycle progression close to the normal level. Furthermore, EGCG was found to prevent serial passage- and H2O2-induced senescence in HDFs by suppressing p53 acetylation, but the Sirt1 activity was unaffected. In addition, proliferating HDFs showed similar cellular uptake of FITC-conjugated EGCG into the cytoplasm with their senescent counterparts but different nuclear translocation of it from them, which would partly account for the differential responses to EGCG in proliferating versus senescent cells.

Half of each core group was 0.5 mm-in thickness and the other half was 1.0 mm-in thickness. Thus, there were four groups with 20 cores/group. Each group was divided into two subgroups with two different veneering methods (conventional powder/liquid layering technique and the heat-pressing technique). Tensile strength was measured using the biaxial flexural strength test based on the ISO standard 6872: 2008 and Weibull analysis was conducted. Factors influencing fracture strength were analyzed through three-way ANOVA (\u03b1\u2264. 05) and the influence of core thickness and veneering method in each core materials was assessed using two-way ANOVA (\u03b1\u2264. 05).RESULTSThe biaxial flexural strength test showed that the fabrication method of veneering porcelain has the largest impact on the fracture strength followed by the core thickness and the core material. In the metal groups, both the core thickness and the fabrication method of the veneering porcelain significantly influenced on the fracture strength, while only the fabrication method affected the fracture strength in the zirconia groups.CONCLUSIONThe fabrication method is more influential to the strength of a prosthesis compared to the core character determined by material and thickness of the core.", "num_citations": "29\n", "authors": ["881"]}

In an animal model, obese mice were artificially induced by a high fat diet for 10 weeks. Experimental groups were treated with LC (100 mg/kg/day) by gavage for the next 10 weeks. At the end of experiment, the body weight of the LC group mice was reduced by 14.2% compared to the high fat diet (HFD) group. The treatment also decreased liver (31.0%), epididymal (18.0%) and retroperitoneal (19.3%) adipose tissue, and kidney (6.7%) weights, respectively, compared with those of the HFD group. LC prevented diet-induced increases in the serum level of TC (22.6%), TG (11.6%), and glucose (35.0%), respectively, compared with the HFD group.

{"title": "Layered multicast recovery\n", "abstract": " We study the problem of localizing repair packets when packets are lost during multicasts. When repair packets are multicast, a highly lossy receiver may swamp the entire multicast \"group\" with duplicate repair packets thereby wasting bandwidth; thus, the protocols need repair locality. We present a multicast layering scheme where the sender proactively distributes FEC repair packets among multiple multicast groups. Each receiver can selectively tune in to a subset of these multicast groups to obtain packets close in number to what it needs. We develop an efficient algorithm that dynamically determines the optimal distribution of FEC repair packets to a given (small constant) number of multicast groups. The running time of this algorithm is independent of the number of receivers in the multicast session, and is hence highly scalable. However, the optimal algorithm requires the knowledge of the FEC repair\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "28\n", "authors": ["881"]}

We hypothesized that HMGB1 may promote fibroblast activity to cause abnormal cutaneous scarring. In vitro wound healing assay with normal and keloid fibroblasts demonstrated that HMGB1 administration promoted the migration of both fibroblasts with increased speed and a greater traveling distance. Treatment of the HMGB1 inhibitor glycyrrhizic acid (GA) showed an opposing effect on both activities. To analyze the downstream mechanism, the protein levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, protein kinase B (AKT), and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB) were measured by western blot analysis. HMGB1 increased the expression levels of ERK1/2, AKT, and NF-\u03baB compared to the control, which was suppressed by GA. HMGB1 promoted both normal and keloid fibroblasts migration to a degree equivalent to that achieved with TGF-\u03b2. We concluded that HMGB1 activates fibroblasts via the receptor for advanced glycation end product (RAGE)\u2014mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and NF-\u03baB interaction signaling pathways.

{"title": "An accurate instruction cache analysis technique for real-time systems\n", "abstract": " An accurate and reliable estimation of a task's worst case execution time (WCET) is crucial for scheduling of real-time tasks. However, instruction caches, which are extensively used in computer systems today, impose a serious problem in analyzing the WCETs of tasks. The problem stems from the fact that the cache hit or miss of an instruction reference can be known only after the worst case execution path has been found and the worst case execution path, on the other hand, can be located only after the cache hit or miss of every instruction reference is known. This cyclic dependency, in many cases, leads to a pessimistic estimation of WCETs. This paper proposes an analysis technique that is immune from the above cyclic dependency and accurately predicts the WCETs of tasks in the presence of instruction caches. The key to the proposed technique is an extension of the timing schema 16] so that the timing variation due to instruction caches can be accurately accounted for.

Hydroxyapatite-tricalcium phosphates (HA-TCPs) are essential components of hard tissue and generally used as a biocompatible material in tissue engineering of bone. Demineralized dentin matrix (DDM) has been reported to increase efficiency of bone induction. We compared the efficiencies of osteogenic differentiation and in vivo bone formation of HA-TCP and DDM on human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs). DDM contains inorganic components as with HA-TCP, and organic components such as collagen type-1. Due to these components, osteoinduction potential of DDM on hDPSCs was remarkably higher than that of HA-TCP. However, the efficiencies of in vivo bone formation are similar in HA-TCP and DDM. Although osteogenic gene expression and bone formation in immunocompromised nude mice were similar levels in both cases, dentinogenic gene expression level was slightly higher in DDM transplantation than in HA-TCP. All these results suggested that in vivo osteogenic potentials in hDPSCs are induced with both HA-TCP and DDM by osteoconduction and osteoinduction, respectively.

A column (16\u00d7 100 mm) was packed with purified MWCNT, and various proteins were eluted with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with and without gradient systems. It was found that albumin in bovine serum was eluted immediately from the column without any adsorption to MWCNT. Conversely, the non-albumin proteins, including a protein of 85 kDa molecular mass and a group of proteins with molecular masses higher than 115 kDa, exhibited considerably high affinity towards MWCNT. A sample of pure bovine serum albumin was also eluted immediately from the column, while lysozyme did not elute as a peak with PBS, but eluted with 0.6 M NaCl. Fundamentally, carbon nanotubes are devoid of any electrical charge. Therefore, other forces including the hydrogen bonds, hydrophilic interactions, and van der Waals forces were most probably responsible for the differential elution behaviors.

This, study analyzed the shear bond strength (SBS) between various surface treated Y-TZP and orthodontic metal brackets. The Y-TZP specimens were conditioned by 110 \u03bcm Al 2 O 3 sandblasting, or sandblasting followed by coating with one of the primers (silane, MDP, or an MDP-containing silane primer). After surface treatment, the orthodontic metal bracket was bonded to the specimen using a resin cement, and then 24 h storage in water and thermal cycling (5000 cycles, 5\u201355 C), SBS was measured. Surface roughness was analyzed for surface morphology, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed for characterization of the chemical bond between the Y-TZP and the MDP-based primers (MDP, MDP containing silane primer). It was found that after surface treatment, the surface roughness of all groups increased. The groups treated with 110 \u03bcm Al 2 O 3 sandblasting and MDP, or MDP-containing silane primer showed the highest SBS values, at 11.92\u00b11.51 MPa and 13.36\u00b12.31 MPa, respectively. The SBS values significantly decreased in all the groups after thermal cycling. Results from XPS analysis demonstrated the presence of chemical bonds between Y-TZP and MDP. Thus, the application of MDP-based primers after Al 2 O 3 sandblasting enhances the resin bond strength between Y-TZP and the orthodontic metal bracket. However, bonding durability of all the surface-treated groups decreased after thermal cycling\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["881"]}

After RAW 264.7 macrophage cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the addition of fluorescein to the LPS-treated media reproductively reduced its absorption and emission spectra (it was a dose-dependent reduction). The advantages of this LPS-detection method were compared with the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) test by using purified bacterial LPS (Salmonella minnessota, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Additionally, the absorption and fluorescence intensity of fluorescein, following treatment of RAW 264.7 cells with a high concentration of Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive, lysed bacteria), could not generally be detected by the LAL test, but they were found to be reduced, in a dose-response relationship, with this new system.

A recent report showed that Asb-9 is specifically expressed in the kidney and testes; however, detailed expression patterns in developing germ cells have not been shown. Northern blot analysis in various tissues demonstrated that mAsb-9 was strongly expressed in the testes. Expression analysis by RT-PCR and Northern blot in developing mouse testes indicates that mAsb-9 is expressed from the fourth week after birth to adulthood, with the highest expression in round spermatids. Expression sites were further localized by in situ hybridization in the testes.

{"title": "Cache-conscious limited preemptive scheduling\n", "abstract": " In multi-tasking real-time systems, inter-task cache interference due to preemptions degrades schedulability as well as performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel scheduling scheme, called limited preemptive scheduling (LPS), that limits preemptions to execution points with small cache-related preemption costs. Limiting preemptions decreases the cache-related preemption costs of tasks but increases blocking delay of higher priority tasks. The proposed scheme makes an optimal trade-off between these two factors to maximize the schedulability of a given task set while minimizing cache-related preemption delay of tasks. Experimental results show that the LPS scheme improves the maximum schedulable utilization by up to 40\\% compared with the traditional fully preemptive scheduling (FPS) scheme.

However, identifying individuals at high risk of recurrence among these patients is a crucial issue. We tested the hypothesis that [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans can help predict prognosis in patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.  Methods Between April 2004 and December 2008, 305 patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer who underwent FGD-PET were enrolled. Patients with luminal B subtype were identified by positivity for human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) or high Ki67 (\u226514%) according to criteria recently recommended by the St. Gallen panelists. The cut-off value of SUVmax was defined using the time-dependent receiver operator characteristic curve for recurrence-free survival (RFS).  Results At a median follow up of 6.23 years, continuous SUVmax was a significant prognostic factor with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.21 (p = 0.021). The cut-off value of SUVmax was defined as 4. Patients with luminal B subtype (n = 82) or high SUVmax (n = 107) showed a reduced RFS (p = 0.031 and 0.002, respectively). In multivariate analysis for RFS, SUVmax carried independent prognostic significance (p = 0.012) whereas classification with immunohistochemical markers did not (p = 0.274).

{"title": "Depression, suicide, and Korean society\n", "abstract": " The number of Korean people who are currently suffering from depressive disorders that require medical treatment is assumed to be more than 2 million. However, only around 15% of those with depressive disorder are actively receiving medical treatment, and this leads to an increasing suicide rate. Hence, the National Evidence-based Healthcare Collaborating Agency held a round-table conference to provide information on depression and suicide and suggested a reasonable policy through comprehensive discussion with experts. The prevalence of depression, which is closely related to suicide rates, is lower in Korea than in the US, but the rate of suicide is the highest among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. It is thought that the underestimated prevalence of depression is owing to the inconsistency between the diagnostic criteria of depression and characteristics of depression in Korea. Therefore, it is necessary to develop Korean diagnostic criteria for depression reflecting cultural characteristics and conduct a regular and organized nationwide survey. Moreover, a term related to suicide officially used by Statistics Korea is' intentional self-injury'. However, in a Korea-based community study, it was found that 60% to 72% of those attempting suicide had mental disorders; thus suicide is not merely an intentional self-injury but a medical condition that should be treated.

The findings indicate that each solid phase has a different dependency on the H2 concentration.

However, the drugs also adversely affect vascular endothelial cells (VECs), leading to the induction of late thrombosis. We have investigated the effect of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on the proliferation and migration of VECs and VSMCs. Both cells showed dose-dependent decrease of viability in response to EGCG while they have different IC 50 values of EGCG (VECs, 150 mM and VSMCs, 1050 mM). Incubating both cells with EGCG resulted in significant reduction in cell proliferation irrespective of cell type. The proliferation of VECs were greater affected than that of VSMCs at the same concentrations of EGCG. EGCG exerted differential migration-inhibitory activity in VECs vs. VSMCs. The migration of VECs was not attenuated by 200 mM EGCG, but that of VSMCs was significantly inhibited at the same concentration of EGCG. It is suggested that that EGCG can be effectively used as an efficient drug for vascular diseases or stents due to its selective activity, completely suppressing the proliferation and migration of VSMCs, but not adversely affecting VECs migration in blood vessels.

However northern blot analysis showed that GAG2 was expressed in seedlings. As the ginseng plant grew, the expression of GAG2 was confined to flowers. In situ hybridization experiments showed that GAG2 transcripts accumulated in the three inner whorls of flowers and in the cells surrounding the developing embryo sac. Temporal and spatial differences between GAG2 expression and AG imply that GAG2 alone is not sufficient to determine the identities of sexual\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["881"]}

Using hexamethyl propyleneamine oxime (HM-PAO) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) brain scanning, regional cerebral perfusion (rCP) was demonstrated. In contrast to three patients with lesions near the thalamus who showed symmetrical cortical radioactivity, the other three patients with thalamic lesions revealed decreased rCP in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex on HM-PAO brain SPECT. We thought that the loss of afferent activating stimuli from the thalamus led to decreased cortical neuronal activity and the following hypoperfusion. In patients with thalamic syndrome resulting from thalamic lesions, the role of the remote effect of the thalamic damage and consequent cortical deregulation in the development of thalamic pain and/or neuropsychological symptoms cannot be excluded completely.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["881"]}

Patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) have higher-order sensory dysfunctions including prolonged temporal discrimination threshold (TDT). However, the impact of prolonged TDT on parkinsonian motor deficits is uncertain.   Methods This study includes 33 PD patients and 24 healthy controls. TDT values were measured in the index finger. Using coin rotation task (CRT), dexterous finger movement was assessed. Using an inertial sensor, the speed, amplitude, and frequency of finger tapping were measured. The impact of prolonged index finger TDT on two different finger movements was analyzed using the general estimating equation.   Results Compared to healthy controls, TDT was prolonged in the PD patients. There was no impact of TDT on mean values or decrement for amplitude and speed, as well as mean values, decrement and variability of tapping frequency. However, prolonged TDT had a significant impact on the variability in amplitude (B = 436.905 \u00d7 10\u22124, Wald \u03c72 = 9.140, p = 0.014) and speed (B = 425.655 \u00d7 10\u22124, Wald \u03c72 = 9.876, p = 0.014) of finger tapping. There was a marginal correlation between TDT and CRT. In addition, CRT correlated with variability in amplitude and speed of finger tapping.   Conclusion In PD, cutaneous temporal discriminative sensory dysfunction appears to be related to increased variabilities in the speed and amplitude of fast repetitive finger movements and disturbed finger dexterity.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["881"]}

Thus, it appears that an appropriate amount of  nanoparticles in the PAN backbone leads to an improvement of the performance of the  gas sensor, most likely due to the change of functional groups in the membrane.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["881"]}

Lithium disilicate-reinforced Amber Mill-Q glass ceramic blocks were bonded to 3 mol% yttria stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystal (3Y-TZP) blocks by heat-bonding with a liner or cementation with a dual-cure self-adhesive resin cement for a microtensile bond strength test. CAD/CAM implant-supported glass ceramic crowns were produced using Amber Mill-Q blocks and bonded to a milled 3Y-TZP zirconia abutments by heat-bonding or cementation for a fracture test. A statistical analysis was conducted to investigate the significant differences between the experimental results. The mode of failure was analyzed using high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscopy. Chemical bonding was identified at the interface between the zirconia ceramic and liner. The mean tensile bond strength of the liner-bonded group was significantly higher than that of the cement-bonded group. The initial chipping strength of the liner-bonded group was significantly higher than that of the cement-bonded group, although no statistically significant difference was found for the fracture strength. The mode of failure was mixed with cohesive fracture through the liner, whereas the cement-bonded group demonstrated adhesive failure at the interface of bonding.

These methods that rely on surface property changes are effective when cell detachment prior to application is necessary, but of limited use when used for cell sheet transfer to target regions. The study reports a new reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced strategy based on hematoporphyrin-incorporated polyketone film (Hp-PK film) to transfer cell sheets directly to target areas without an intermediate harvesting process. After green LED (510\u202fnm) irradiation, production of exogenous ROS from the Hp-PK films induces cell sheet detachment and transfer. The study suggests that ROS-induced cell detachment property of the Hp-PK film is closely related to conformational changes of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.

Knockdown of MCRS1 resulted in a dispersion of centriolar satellites whose establishment depends on cytoplasmic dynein. By contrast, NDE1 was not necessary for the proper distribution of centriolar satellites, indicating a functional distinction between MCRS1 and NDE1.

The effect of annealing temperatures on the domain shape of PPLN was investigated in the range of 300 to 800\u00a0\u00b0C. At 300\u00a0\u00b0C, residual stress was not relieved completely. As the annealing temperature increases above 800\u00a0\u00b0C, the domain shape changes. However, no domain damage was observed for annealing temperatures from 400 to 700\u00a0\u00b0C. The best annealing temperature for the suppression of domain damage and the improvement in the crystalline quality was found to be 400\u00a0\u00b0C.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["881"]}

The vehicle weight can be reduced effectively by using lightweight materials such as aluminum and magnesium. However, if such materials are used in vehicles, there are often instances when different materials such as aluminum and steel need to be joined to each other. The conventional joining method, namely resistance spot welding, cannot be used in joining different materials. Self-piercing rivet (SPR) and adhesive bonding, however, are good alternatives to resistance spot welding. This paper is concerned with the crushing test of double hat-shaped member made by resistance spot welding, SPR and adhesive bonding. Various parameters of crashworthiness are analyzed and evaluated. Based on these results, the applicability of SPR and adhesive bonding are proposed as an alternative to resistance spot welding.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["881"]}

Although LAET reduced the populations of the three microorganisms, V. parahaemolyticus was more injured by LAET than S. aureus and E. coli when treated at the same processing conditions.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["881"]}
{"title": "Influence of electrolyte temperature on pure titanium modified by electrochemical treatment for implant\n", "abstract": " This study examined the effect of electrolyte temperature on the surface characteristics of anodized pure titanium in DL\u2010\u03b1\u2010glycerophosphate (DL\u2010\u03b1\u2010GP) and calcium acetate (CA). The anodic oxide films contained a large proportion of anatase with some rutile. The relative intensity of the anatase peaks and the surface roughness increased with increasing electrolyte temperature. As the electrolyte temperature was increased, the pore size increased to 1\u20134 \u00b5m, and the apatite crystals became coarser and denser. The amount of calcium and phosphate adsorbed increased with increasing electrolyte temperature. The anodizing voltage reached the onset of constant voltage mode faster with decreasing electrolyte temperature. A higher voltage is essential for the electrolyte at lower temperature to reach the constant voltage mode during this initial period.

Methods: Subjects were allocated randomly into two groups: a T-shape cane group (n= 14) and an I-shape cane group (n= 14). Before the test, subjects were trained by a physical therapist to walk with a cane for 6 weeks. The Main Outcome Measures were measured as maximal sway velocity, sway path, sway area, and partial weight bearing using a Balance Performance Monitor (BPM) and ambulation velocity using a'Timed up and go test'. We also measured the maximal ambulation velocity. Results: The distribution of weight bearing on the affected side without the cane was 35% in the I-shape cane group and 36% in the T-shape cane group. After training, weight bearing on the affected side increased by 45% in the I-shape cane group and 40% in the T-shape cane group. With the cane held in the hand, weight bearing on the affected side in the T-shape cane group decreased by 3%. Conclusion: The I-shaped cane increased static standing balance, including hemiplegic side weight bearing. Therefore, I-shape canes can improve the balance of hemiplegic patients.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["881"]}

Epidemiologic studies have also suggested that green tea consumption might be effective in the prevention of certain human cancers. In this study, the differential antiproliferative responses of green tea polyphenols (GTP) were investigated in fibroblast cell line (L-929 cells, from mouse connective tissue) and normal fibroblasts (from neonatal human dermis). GTP treatment (100 \u03bcM for 24 h) resulted in significant (p < 0.05) inhibition of cell proliferation and morphological alterations with decreased local attachment, but not in normal fibroblasts. Cell cycle analysis revealed that the GTP treatment resulted in an appreciable G0/G1-phase arrest of the cell cycle in L-929 cells at 100 \u03bcM concentration, while under similar experimental conditions, no evidence of G0/G1-phase cell cycle arrest was found in normal fibroblasts at the same dose. These results suggest that antiproliferative activity of GTP may be attributed to the differential regulation of cell cycle in fibroblast cell line and normal fibroblasts, which GTP may be exploited to craft strategies for the chemoprevention and/or therapy against cancer by GTP.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["881"]}

Methods: Using a visual rating scale (from G0 to G3), 2 examiners independently rated putaminal hypointensities of 37 MSA patients and 21 control subjects. To investigate the correlation with the scales, R2* values and the volume of the entire putamen were measured. Results: MSA patients with parkinsonian variant had significantly higher scores than those with cerebellar variant. Visual rating scores in MSA were correlated with R2* values (General estimating equation [GEE], Wald chi-square = 25.89, corrected p < 0.001) and volume (Wald chi-square = 75.44, corrected p < 0.001). They correlated with UPDRS motor scores. Binary logistic regression analyses revealed that the visual rating scale was a significant predictor for discriminating MSA patients from controls (multivariate model adjusted for age and sex, odds ratio 52.722 [corrected p = 0.009]). Pairwise comparison between areas under the curve (AUCs) revealed that the visual rating scale demonstrated higher accuracy than R2* values (difference between AUCs; univariate model = 0.247 [corrected p<0.001]; multivariate model = 0.186 [corrected p=0.003]).

Although various tools such as logging records for digital products have become prevalent in everyday life, there is a lack of both understanding of and design tools for the practical use of interaction history. To provide systematic approaches for using interaction histories as resources for designing interactive artifacts, we analyzed previous design cases that applied interaction history in their systems. Based on the analysis, we discovered impacts of interaction history from utilitarian, emotional, and social perspectives. Then, we obtained design properties of interaction history that should be considered in practice for constructing the impacts: logging moment, logging content, target, retrieving moment, and expressed form. Finally, we explored potential research and design issues with the consideration of impacts and design properties of interaction history.

A sharp interface between the coating layer and the substrate was observed for single  coating ( nanorods/FTO glass), which may be detrimental to the bonding strength. In multicoating sample ( nanorod/ nanoparticle/ nanoparticle/FTO glass), the tape test was not performed due to severe peeling-off prior to the test. On the other hand, the dual coating sample ( nanorod/ nanoparticle/FTO glass) showed minimum variation of transmittance (4%) after the test, suggesting that the topcoat adheres well with the FTO substrate due to the presence of the  nanoparticle buffer layer.

This study was conducted to investigate the effect of the attitude of parent and school on smoking status and to help to reduce the smoke rate in high school students.METHODSData was collected by self-administered questionnaire between September and October 2002. The study subjects were 977 students of 7 high schools in the Nonsan area. The data was analysed by using the SPSS program which included t-test, X2-test and logistic regression test.RESULTSThe smoking rates were 18.1% of general school students and 20.8% of vocational school in males, while 2.6% of general school students and 7.9% of vocational school in females. The mean starting age for the first cigarette was 15.3+/-1.9 in males and 15.6+/-1.3 in females. The mean age for regular smoking was 16.0+/-1.3 in males and 16.2+/-1.3 in females. Multiple logistic regression analyses indicated that the smoking rate increased in males (OR= 2.75), early age for the first cigarette (OR= 7.04), small family (OR= 8.60), high family income (OR= 1.95), colleagae smoking (OR= 5.68), strict attitude by school (OR= 0.28) and loss of one's parents (OR= 2.58). Among smokers, 71.4% of male smokers and 75% of female smokers wanted to quit.CONCLUSIONThis study suggests that the strict attitude of parents on their children's smoking decreased the smoking rate, while the stern attitude of school on their students increased it. Therefore, in order to decrease smoking rate, the strict attitude of parents on smoking should be continued and the attitude of school will have to consider aspects of students'\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["881"]}

However, data on the expression of EBV in lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) and cutaneous CD30+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) in Korea is limited. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of EBV in LyP and cutaneous CD30+ ALCL in Korea. Method: In situ hybridization for EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER) and immunohistochemistry, including viral latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1), were performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded skin specimens of 26 cases of LyP and 16 cases of CD30+ ALCL involving skin which were collected from 6 university hospital medical centers in Korea. Results: In situ hybridization studies revealed positivity of the neoplastic cells for EBER in 2 of 16 specimens of CD30+ ALCL and in none of the LyP specimens. One EBER-positive case was cutaneous CD30+ ALCL with concurrent involvement of lymph nodes. The other case was CD30+ ALCL involving skin and other organs such as lymph nodes, bone, lung, and the spleen. Immunostaining for LMP-1 was also positive only for the 2 cases of EBER-positive CD30+ ALCL. Conclusion: In Korea, LyP and primary cutaneous CD30+ ALCL are unlikely to be associated with EBV, however, systemic CD30+ ALCL may be associated with EBV.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["881"]}

As regards the SIR response, in simulations, the M-DCPC algorithm produced a faster convergence and lower overshoot in transient time than the other power control algorithms when the desired SIR value was varying. For the outage probability, M-DCPC converged to a fixed outage rate faster than CSOPC while also maintaining the system capacity to make as high a connection as CSOPC.

Since malnutrition was observed at all clinical stages, but more frequently seen at advanced stages, early and detailed nutritional assessment in all patients with liver cirrhosis is important. The aims of this study are to define the nutritional status and the difference of nutritional index according to etiology and Child classification in patients with liver cirrhosis in Korea.METHODSA total 138 cirrhotic patients (41 alcoholic cirrhosis, 97 virus-related cirrhosis) were studied. The diagnosis of cirrhosis was based on clinical, laboratory and ultrasonographic criteria and liver biopsy. The patients were divided into three groups according to the severity of their liver disease as assessed by the Child-Pugh classification. Nutritional parameter of protein (serum albumin, serum transferrin, total lymphocyte count) were measured.RESULTSThe patients with protein malnutrition are as follows: albumin 55, transferrin 68, total lymphocyte count 8. The frequency of moderate to severe protein malnutrition was high in alcoholic cirrhosis.: albumin (< 2.9 g/dL)(26.8% vs 17.5%), transferrin (< 180 mg/dL)(48.5% vs 24.8%), total lymphocyte count (< 1200 number/L)(2.4% vs 2.0%).

These potentials are due to the activity of the vestibular rather than cochlear afferents, which produce very short latency inhibition of ipsilateral motor unit activity and is best detected by averaging the unrectified surface electromyogram (EMG) from the muscle. We investigated the click evoked vestibulocollic reflexes in neck muscles to find out the significance and relationship of latency and amplitude of myogenic potentials between two different methods of muscle activation.METHODSEMGs were recorded from surface electrode evoked by sound stimuli (95dB, 5/sec repetitive rate, 512 times) over SCM muscles on each side. Myogenic potential have two biphasic responses, which are termed P1, N1, P2 and N2 based on the polarity of their components. The subjects were 24 normal volunteers. Surface EMG activities from 12 subjects (Group I) were recorded by neck flexion to activate bilateral SCM muscles through the averaging runs (bilateral SCM muscle activation method). EMGs from another 12 subjects (Group II) were recorded by rotating head to the opposite side to activate SCM muscle throughout the procedure (unilateral SCM muscle activation method). The latencies and amplitudes of myogenic potential in the SCM muscle after stimulation were analysed and compared between each method.RESULTSThe latencies (msec) of P1 and N1 were 11.2+ 2.4, 21.7+ 1.1 in Group 1, respectively and 13.3+ 2.4, 23.0+/-1.1 in Group 11, respectively.

{"title": "An explicitly declared delayed-branch mechanism for a superscalar architecture\n", "abstract": " One of the main obstacles to exploiting the fine-grained parallelism that is available in general-purpose code is the frequency of branches that cause unpredictable changes in the control flow of a program at run-time. Whenever a branch is taken, a performance penalty may be incurred as the processor waits for instructions to be fetched from the branch target stream. RISC processors introduce a delayed-branch mechanism which defines branch delay slots into which code can be scheduled. This strategy allows the processor to be kept busy executing useful instructions while the change of control flow takes place. While the concept of delayed branches can be readily extended to VLIW architectures, it is less clear how it should be incorporated in a superscalar architecture.

{"title": "Lateral handling improvement with dynamic curvature control for an independent rear wheel drive EV\n", "abstract": " The integrated longitudinal and lateral dynamic motion control is important for four wheel independent drive (4WID) electric vehicles. Under critical driving conditions, direct yaw moment control (DYC) has been proved as effective for vehicle handling stability and maneuverability by implementing optimized torque distribution of each wheel, especially with independent wheel drive electric vehicles. The intended vehicle path upon driver steering input is heavily depending on the instantaneous vehicle speed, body side slip and yaw rate of a vehicle, which can directly affect the steering effort of driver. In this paper, we propose a dynamic curvature controller (DCC) by applying a newly-defined parameter, the dynamic curvature of the path, derived from vehicle dynamic state variables; yaw rate, side slip angle, and speed of a vehicle. The proposed controller, combined with DYC and wheel longitudinal slip control, is to utilize the dynamic curvature as a target control parameter for a feedback, avoiding estimating the vehicle side-slip angle. The effectiveness of the proposed controller, in view of stability and improved handling, has been validated with numerical simulations and a series of experiments during cornering engaging a disturbance torque driven by two rear independent in-wheel motors of a 4WD micro electric vehicle.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["881"]}

However, the rapid corrosion, generation of a large volume of hydrogen gas, accumulation of hydrogen bubbles in gas pockets adjacent to the implant, and increase in the local pH of the body fluid are the major impediments in using Mg and its alloys as implant materials. Among the various surface modification processes explored to increase the corrosion resistance of Mg and its alloys, microarc oxidation (MAO) has received considerable attention. However, the higher pore density of MAO coatings increased the effective surface area and the tendency of the corrosive medium to adsorb and concentrate in these pores, thus causing a deleterious influence on the corrosion protective ability. Hence, it is not only essential but also mandatory to increase the corrosion resistance of MAO coatings. This chapter addresses the various\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["881"]}

Under endoscopic and fluoroscopic control, the balloon was then inflated with diluted contrast over a period of 1 to 2 minutes.RESULTSA total of 10 patients (7 male and 3 female) were enrolled in this study. Eight had common bile duct stones, 1 bile duct cancer, and 1 pancreatic cancer. The common bile duct was dilated by a balloon. The calculi were removed in 6 patients, and a common bile duct stent was implanted in two cases via endoscopy. No complications such as acute pancreatitis or apparent infections of the biliary tracts were encountered in these cases except for mild fever, temporary high serum levels of aminotransferase and amylase after ERCP in 3 cases. No severe bleeding or perforation occurred in patients undergoing balloon dilatation.CONCLUSIONSAn infundibulotomy with balloon dilatation is a valuable alternative to endoscopic sphinterotomy in the treatment of patients\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["881"]}

However, the clinical significance of the discordant values in patients with airflow limitation has not been examined. This study investigated the D L CO and KCO changes after improving the airflow limitation.MethodsThe baseline D L CO and KCO with lung volume were measured in patients with an airflow obstruction. The effective alveolar volume was measured using the single-breath CH 4 dilution method. The patients divided into two groups according to the baseline values:(1) increased KCO in comparison with the D L CO (high discordance)(2) decreased or not increased KCO in comparison with the D L CO (low discordance). The diffusion capacity and lung volume were measured after treatment.ResultsThere was no significant difference in the baseline lung volumes including the FEV 1 and FVC between the two groups. The FEV 1 and FVC were significantly increased in the high discordance group compared with the low discordance group after treating the airflow limitation. The D L CO and alveolar volume were significant higher in the high discordance group compared with the low discordance group while the TLC was not.ConclusionThe discordance between the D L CO and KCO could be translated into an airflow reversibility in patients with an airflow limitation", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["881"]}

When immersed in Hank\u2019s solution, which has ion concentrations similar to that of human blood, an apatite layer, which accelerates the connection with bone, formed easily on the alkali-treated specimens compared to the non-treated specimens. The number of macrophages, which is known to increase as the inflammation reaction proceeds, is much lower for the alkali-treated specimens than for other samples. The average thickness of the fibrous capsule formed around the implant is much thinner for the alkali-treated specimens than for the others.

However, the DST has not been widely used, because it is time-consuming, invasive, and labor-intensive. On the other hand, intraductal secretin test (IDST) with endoscopic retrograde cannulation of the main pancreatic duct has been showed similar diagnostic efficiency compared with DST. We assessed the clinical usefulness of IDST and investigated parameters for assessing impaired pancreatic function of IDST.METHODSPure pancreatic juices were collected from 12 patients with chronic pancreatitis by endoscopic cannulation after a bolus intravenous injection of secretin 100 U, for 15min in three 5-min intervals. Five parameters of IDST were measured, and the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of IDST evaluated compared with ERP.RESULTSWhen we regarded mean-1.5 SD as the lower limits of IDST, the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of five parameters to detect chronic pancreatitis were 91.7-100%, 75-87.5%, and 85-90%, respectively. Among five parameters, pancreatic juice secretory volume, bicarbonate concentration, and amylase output showed the highest diagnostic accuracy, followed by lipase output and bicarbonate output.

The role of inflammatory mediators in pathogenesis of asthma and RS virus disease is not well-understood. We investigated the performance of serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) and eotaxin levels on the airway inflammation in a population of patients with RS virus and non-RS virus bronchiolitis, compared with control subjects.METHODSTwenty-eight patients with RS virus positive bronchiolits, 11 patients with RS virus negative bronchiolitis and seven control subjects were enrolled in the study. Serum ECP, RANTES and eotaxin levels were measured by enzyme immunoassay. We analyzed the correlation among serum ECP, RANTES, eotaxin, immunoglobulin E and blood eosinophil count in the RS virus positive bronchiolitis group and the RS virus negative bronchiolitis group, respectively.RESULTSBoth serum ECP and RANTES in the brochiolitis group were not higher than in the control. Serum eotaxin concentration in bronchiolitis group was significantly higher than in control (P= 0.030), but there was no significant difference between RS virus positive and negative groups. There were significant correlations between the peripheral blood eosinophil count and serum ECP, and between the levels of serum ECP and RANTES in the RS virus positive bronchiolitis group (P= 0.038, 0.012 respectively).CONCLUSIONSerum eotaxin may have a systemic effect in pathophysiology of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["881"]}

Anodizing was performed at current density 30 up to 300 V in electrolyte solutions containing -glycerophosphate disodium salt hydrate (-GP) and calcium acetate (CA). Hydrothermal treatment was done at  for 2 hrs to produce a thin outermost layer of hydroxyapatite (HA). The bioactivity was evaluated from HA formation on the surfaces in a Hanks' solution with pH 7.4 at  for 30 days. The size of micropores and the thickness of oxide film increased and complicated multilayer by increasing the spark forming voltage. Needle-like HA crystals were observed on anodic oxide film after the hydrothermal treatment at  for 2 hrs. When increasing -GP in electrolyte composition, the precipitated HA crystals showed the shape of thick and shorter rod. However, when increasing CA, the more fine needle shape HA crystals were appeared. The bioactivity in Hanks' solution was accelerated when the oxide films composed with strong anatase peak with presence of rutile peak. The increase of amount of Ca and P was observed in groups having bioactivity in Hanks' solution. The Ca/P ratio of the precipitated HA layer was equivalent to that of HA crystal and it was closer to 1.67 as increasing the immersion time in Hanks' solution.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["881"]}

The measure of porto-systemic shunt plays a significant role in the management and prognosis of the patients. So we have evaluated the relationship between the shunt index of thallium-201 liver scan and the histological grade and stage of chronic liver disease.METHODSThe thallium-201 scintigraphy per rectum was evaluated in 159 patients with chronic liver disease, which were proven with percutaneous liver biopsy. We used the heart to liver activity ratio at 20 minute as shunt index, representing portal-systemic shunt. The two pathologists scored independently hepatitis activity (lobular and porto-periportal activity) and stage (fibrosis).RESULTSA significant difference was noted between the shunt index and the scores of fibrosis (p< 0.001) although this correlation was statistically weak (r= 0.26, p= 0.008). In cumulative logistic regression test, the shunt index had a effect on the fibrosis (p< 0.001) but not on the lobular and porto-periportal activity. Fibrosis was predicted as less than 2 if shunt index was less than 0.24, 3 if more than 0.24 but less than 0.46, 4 if more than 0.46.CONCLUSIONThe shunt index of thallium-201 liver scintigraphy correlated only with fibrosis not with lobular and porto-periportal activity. As the fibrosis progresses in chronic liver disease, portal hypertension becomes more severe and the shunt index increases.

The mean duration of corticosteroid therapy was 11 months (1~ 77), and the mean total dose at the time of examination was 16,259 mg (2,250~ 61,292). The incidence of cataract formation was 47.8% and all had posterior subcapsular type. The severity of cataract was grade I in 12, grade II in 8, grade III in 1, and grade IV in 1 according to the Crews' classification. The incidence of intraocular pressure above 18 mmHg was 75%, compared to 18 mmHg (2SD) in normal control. There was no significant relation between the total dose of corticosteroid and the cataract formation, the severity of cataract, and the incidence of increased IOP. Also, there was no relation between the duration of therapy and them. In conclusion, We found that the ocular complications in children do not relate with the dose of corticosteroid and the duration of therapy and may be closely related to the individual susceptibility.

The hydrogel formed by hyaluronic acid (HA) and polygalacturonic acid (PGA) has been used into Mg-based cannulated screws to prevent bone resorption owing to the rapid corrosion of Mg with unfavorable mechanical properties and a high ambient pH. In addition, Ca ions were added to the gel for cross-linking the carboxyl groups to modify the gelation rate and physical properties of the gel. The developed hydrogels were injected into the Mg-based cannulated screws, after which they released HA and Ca. The possibility of the application of this system as a cannulated screw was evaluated based on the corrosion resistance, gel degradation rate, HA\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["881"]}

Methods In total, 150 PD patients were included from the Parkinson\u2019s Progression Markers Initiative database. Specific SNPs that are associated with PD were selected for genotyping. SNPs that were not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium or whose minor allele frequency was less than 0.05 were excluded. Twenty-three SNPs met the inclusion criteria for this study. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare annual percentage changes in DAT availability for three subgroups of SNP.Results None of the 23 SNPs exerted a statistically significant effect (p< 0.0022) on the decline of DAT availability in PD patients. However, we observed trends of association (p< 0.05) between three SNPs of two genes with the annual percentage change in DAT availability: 1) rs199347 on the putamen (p= 0.0138), 2) rs356181 on the caudate nucleus (p= 0.0105), and 3) rs3910105 on the caudate nucleus (p= 0.0374).

The TiO\u00e2 \u201a\u201ananotube layer was formed to increase the specific surface area of the titanium, and then the cyclic calcification treatment was performed to induce precipitation of hydroxiapatite by improvement of the bioactivity. The corrosion resistance test, wettability test and immersion test in simulated body solution were conducted to investigate the effect of these surface treatments. The nanotubes formed by the anodization treatment have a dense structure in which small diameter tubes are formed between relatively large diameter tubes, and their inside was hollow and the outer walls were coupled to each other. The hydroxyapatite precipitates were well combined on the nanotubes by the penetration into the nanotube layer by successive cyclic calcification treatment, and the precipitation of hydroxyapatite tended to increase proportionally after immersion in simulated body solution as the number of cycles increased. In conclusion, it was confirmed that induction of precipitation of hydroxyapatite by cyclic calcification treatment after forming the nanotube TiO\u00e2 \u201a\u201ananotube layer on the surface of the titanium membrane can contribute to improvement of bioactivity.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["881"]}

An electrolyte solution containing manganese and phosphate ions and, a steel anode were used to deposit the manganese phosphate coating on aluminium cathode. The deposition was performed using current density and treatment time as main variables. The resultant coatings were characterized by X-ray diffraction measurement, scanning electron microscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy to ascertain their phase constituents, morphological features and the type of functional groups, respectively. The corrosion resistance of the manganese phosphate coated aluminium, in 3.5% NaCl, was evaluated by potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic studies. The novel electrochemical approach explored in this study provides a new avenue to deposit manganese phosphate coating on aluminium and it offered a good corrosion protection for aluminium in 3.5% NaCl.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["881"]}

{"title": "Influence of rebonding procedures on microleakage of composite resin restorations\n", "abstract": " During a composite resin restoration, an anticipating contraction gap is usually tried to seal with low-viscosity resin after successive polishing, etching, rinsing and drying steps, which as a whole is called rebonding procedure. However, the gap might already have been filled with water or debris before applying the sealing resin. We hypothesized that microleakage would decrease if the rebonding agent was applied before the polishing step, ie, immediately after curing composite resin. On the buccal and lingual surfaces of 35 extracted human molar teeth, class V cavities were prepared withthe occlusal margin in enamel and the gingival margin in dentin. They were restored with a hybrid composite resin Z250 (3M ESPE, USA) using an adhesive AdperTM Single Bond 2 (3M ESPE). As rebonding agents, BisCover LV (Bisco, USA), ScotchBond Multi-Purpose adhesive (3M ESPE) and an experimental adhesive were applied on the restoration margins before polishing step or after successive polishing and etching steps. The infiltration depth of 2% methylene blue into the margin was measured using an optical stereomicroscope. The correlation between viscosity of rebonding agents and mciroleakage was also evaluated. There were no statistically significant differences in the microleakage within the rebonding procedures, within the rebonding agents, and within the margins. However, when the restorations were not rebonded, the microleakage at gingival margin was significantly higher than those groups rebonded with 3 agents (p< 0.05). The difference was not observed at the occlusal margin. No significant correlation was found between viscosity\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["881"]}

Both jaw collimator and multi-leaf collimators (MLCs) for photon beams have been used to achieve such goals. In the Pinnacle3 treatment planning system (TPS), which we are using in our clinics, a set of model parameters like jaw collimator transmission factor (JTF) and MLC transmission factor (MLCTF) are determined from the measured data because it is using a model-based photon dose algorithm. However, model parameters obtained by this auto-modeling process can be different from those by direct measurement, which can have a dosimetric effect on the dose distribution. In this paper we estimated JTF and MLCTF obtained by the auto-modeling process in the Pinnacle3 TPS. At first, we obtained JTF and MLCTF by direct measurement, which were the ratio of the output at the reference depth under the closed jaw collimator (MLCs for MLCTF) to that at the same depth with the field size  in the water phantom. And then JTF and MLCTF were also obtained by auto-modeling process. And we evaluated the dose difference through phantom and patient study in the 3D-CRT plan. For direct measurement, JTF was 0.001966 for 6 MV and 0.002971 for 10 MV, and MLCTF was 0.01657 for 6 MV and 0.01925 for 10 MV. On the other hand, for auto-modeling process, JTF was 0.001983 for 6 MV and 0.010431 for 10 MV, and MLCTF was 0.00188 for 6 MV and 0.00453\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["881"]}

{"title": "Sinterbility and mechanical properties of zirconia nanoparticles prepared by hydrothermal process\n", "abstract": " A hydrothermal method has been used to produce nanoparticles of 3 mol% yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia (3Y-TZP) with high fracture toughness. The effects of reaction temperature and pH on crystallite size and sintered density, and the influence of Nb2O5 addition into 3Y-TZP on toughness have been investigated. The particle size increased with increasing the processing parameters and the influence of temperature was more significant than pH. The density of nanosized 3Y-TZP increased with increasing pH up to 9 and then decreased abruptly with further increase. The density increased slightly with the reaction temperature up to 140 C and then changed little with increasing temperature. The toughness increased in proportional to the Nb2O5 content. After sintering for 1 h at 1270 C, the highest relative density of 98% was obtained from nanoparticles of about 17 nm, prepared at 200 C and pH 9, and the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["881"]}

The polarization can be reoriented by applying the electric field. BTO with perovskite structure is widely used due to their ferroelectric, pyroelectric and piezoelectric properties in various electronic applications such as multi-layer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs), transducers, sensors and actuators, solid oxide fuel cell, and ferroelectric random access memories (FRAMs)[1, 2]. BTO nanofibers were fabricated by drying electrospun BTO/polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) nanofibers for 1 h at 80oC in vacuum and subsequent annealing for 1 h at 750oC in air. During the annealing, PVP was removed and the crystallization was completed. The properties of electrospun BTO nanofibers were evaluated by using a TG/DSC, an XRD, a scanning SEM, a TEM, a Cannon-Fenske viscometer, a pycnometer, a dynamic tensiometer, and a FT-IR.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["881"]}

Mechanical properties of VPSed CoNiCrAlY coatings are investigated via Taguchi method and L18 (2 1\u00d7 3 7) orthogonal arrays to determine the optimal setting and the relationship of experimental variables. Seven parameters were considered as follows:(A) arc current;(B) primary gas flow rate;(C) secondary gas flow rate;(D) stand-off distance;(E) working pressure;(F) carrier gas flow rate (Ar); and (G) powder feeding rate. The effect of carrier gas flow rate on the porosity is determined to be the highest among the parameters investigated. Higher microhardness values are observed for the VPSed coatings as compared to the coatings prepared by conventional high velocity oxygen fuel probably due to low amount of the porosity.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["881"]}

{"title": "Evaluation of cell toxicity and surface properties of surface modified Ti and Ti alloys\n", "abstract": " Ti and Ti alloys present high specific strength and excellent heat and corrosion resistance. These can be widely applied to the field of machinery, electronics, aircraft, and military equipment. In particular, these can be used as an implant material in the field of orthopedics and dentistry due to the excellent biocompatibility of the surface characteristics of Ti and Ti alloys. The superior corrosion resistance and biocompatibility of Ti and Ti alloys are due to a dense TiO2 passive layer, which is rapidly formed on their surface. The oxide film naturally generated in the air, mainly forms a chemically and thermodynamically stable TiO2 rutile structure which presents no inflammation or toxic reactions because it has low solubility in simulated body fluid (SBF); however, because the TiO2 rutile structure is inactive due to its stability in an organism, approximately 6 months is required for osteointegration to occur. Studies on the bioactivity of surface layers, formed by various surface treatment methods, have been conducted to reduce the medical treatment period and to improve the osteosynthesis. Among these surface treatment methods a plasma coating method applies plasma using bioactive hydroxyapatite (HA) powder, however because a large part of the crystal phase will be transformed into an amorphous shape or unstable structure during the melting injection with an ultra high temperature exceeding 10,000 C; there are some reports on problems occurring after implanting, such as dissolution of the surface layer, cracks in the interface of base metal and surface layers and separations of the deposited material. 1, 2) Studies on the surface treatment methods\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["881"]}

The fracture resistance of these core connector areas is relatively low. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to standardize the appropriate volumetric figure and location of the connectors in the alumina core fabricated in alumina tape to be used in fixed partial dentures by way of topology optimization. Material and method: A maxillary anterior three-unit bridge alumina core with teeth form and surrounding periodontal apparatus model was used to ultimately design the most structurally rigid form of the connector. Loadings from a ,  and  to the axis of each tooth were applied and analyzed with the 3-D finite element analysis method. Using the results from these experiments, the topology optimization was applied and the optimal reinforcement layout of connector was obtained and the detail shape in the fixed partial denture core was designed. Results: The modified prosthesis with the form of a bulk in the lower lingual surface of the connector in the event, reduced the stress concentration up to 20% in the 3-D FEA. Conclusion: The formation of a bulk in the lower lingual connector area of an alumina core for a fixed partial denture decreases the stress to a clinically favorable measure but does not harm the esthetic point of view. This result illustrates the possibility of clinical application of the modified form designed by the topology optimization method.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["881"]}
{"title": "The Significances of Chest X-ray Findings and Serum IFN-\u03b3, IL-5, ECP as Predictors of Prognosis of Bronchiolitis and Bronchopneumonia in Infants\n", "abstract": " Purpose: Lower respiratory tract infections in infant and young children are often due to a virus, especially the Respiratory syncytial (RS) virus. Chest X-ray findings in bronchiolitis and bronchopneumonia are different. The radiographic hallmark of bronchiolitis is pulmonary hyperinflation and similar to that of bronchial asthma. Bronchiolitis is predisposed to later development of bronchial asthma. To evaluate the difference of immuno-pathophysiology between bronchiolitis and bronchopneumonia, we measured (Th1 cytokine), IL-5 (Th2 cytokine) and ECP. We also investigated whether X-ray findings in infants with viral infected respiratory disease are useful in predicting the development of asthma. Methods: We measured IL-5, ECP,  levels in serum from 21 infants with bronchiolitis and 21 infants with bronchopneumonia and 16 infants without pulmonary viral diseases. Results: IL-5 levels of bronchiolitis and bronchopneumonia were significantly higher than those of the control (P= 0.02, P= 0.042). IL-5 levels of bronchiolitis were higher than those of bronchopneumonia but there was no significant difference.  levels of bronchopneumonia were higher than those of bronchiolitis but there was no significant difference. ECP levels of bronchiolitis and bronchopneumonia were higher than those of the control but only those of bronchiolitis were significantly higher than those of the control (P= 0.045). IL-5 and ECP levels did not show any significant correlation in bronchiolitis, bronchopneumonia and control groups.

We review unconstrained control algorithms, the distributed power control (DPC), unconstrained second order power control (USOPC) and DPC with stationary relaxation factor (DPCSRF). Under the unconstrained condition, the convergence analysis shows theoretically that the convergence rate of DPC is the fastest one. However, under the constrained control algorithms, DCPC is not the fastest one any more because of transmission power constraint. To improve the convergence speed, the DCPC with non-stationary relaxation factor (FDCPC) are proposed. Under the constrained condition, the convergence rate of FDCPC outperforms that of DCPC and CSOPC.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["881"]}

The infiltration distance was parabolic with respect to time as described by the Washburn equation and the penetration rate constant, K, decreased due to the reduction in pore size as the amount of zirconia rose. Although the optimum strength (308 MPa) of the Spinel/zirconia-glass composites was observed when the zirconia was added up to 20 wt%, K and transmittance decreased as the zirconia content rose. In conclusion, it suggested that the positive effect of strength as a result of the addition of zirconia was not effective.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["881"]}

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundreds patientswith HS were studied using a 1.5 T MRI system with a 3D time-of-flight (TOF) MRA sequence. To reconstructshort-range MRA, 6-10 source images near the 7-8th cranial nerve complex were processed using a maximum-intensityprojection technique. In addition, an MPR technique was used to investigate neurovascular compression. We observedthe relationship between the root-exit zone (REZ) of the 7th cranial nerve and compressive vessel, and identifiedthe compressive vessels on symptomatic sides. To investigate neurovascular contact, asymptomatic contralateralsides were also evaluated. RESULTS: MRI showed that in 197 of 200 patients there was vascular compression orcontact with the facial nerve REZ on symptomatic sides. One of the three remaining patients was suffering fromacoustic neurinoma on the symptomatic side, while in two patients there were no definite abnormal findings.

{"title": "Production of carotid artery aneurysm in pigs\n", "abstract": " PURPOSE: To establish the method of constructing an experimental aneurysm model in porcine carotid artery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen aneurysms were created in the carotid arteries of eight pigs. After paramedian incision under intravenous anesthesia, the common carotid artery and external jugular vein were separated. A portion of the latter was cut to make an aneurysmal sac and this was sutured to the side wall of the common carotid arterial wall (end to side). Within one week, an arteriogram was obtained in all pigs and color Doppler study was performed in four. Digital subtraction arteriograms were serially obtained three images/sec, and these were analyzed to determine the size of the sac and the neck, flow pattern in the aneurysm, and stenosis in the common carotid artery. RESULTS: Arteriographic findings were obtained in ten of 14 aneurysms. Six aneurysms were saccular in shape, and the mean size of the sac and neck was 16x10 mm and 5.3 mm, respectively. Four aneurysms were lobulated, and in these cases, the mean size of the sac and neck was 9x3 mm and 3.7 mm, respectively. The mean size of the proximal common carotid artery was 4.5 mm, and at the operation site, mean stenosis was 40%. CONCLUSION: In 10/14 cases (71%), we successfully established an aneurysm model in the porcine carotid artery, and believe that it is suitable for use in interventional neuroradiology experiments.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["881"]}

There are several possible reasons for such wide range of frequency of urinary problems in Parkinson's disease or parkinsonism;(1) They used different questionnaires on the urinary problems;(2) they did not try to differentiate the patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and those with multiple system atrophy (MSA), in which condition severe urinary problems occur frequently early in the clinical course or even before the onset of parkinsonian symptoms. However, exact nature of urinary problems in MSA and IPD has never been compared. Using Boyarsky score, we compared the frequency and severity of urinary symptoms between 32 patients with IPD and 28 patients with probable MSA. All except one with MSA (96.5%) had urinary symptoms. Although 24 of the 32 with IPD (75%) also had urinary problems, the severity was milder than those with MSA. In 8 with MSA, urinary symptoms preceeded the onset of parkinsonian symptoms. No one with IPD developed urinary symptoms before the onset of parkinsonian symptoms. Seven out of the 28 patients with MSA voided more than 8 times during the day, 10 woke up more than 2 times to void during sleep, 20 wet their clothes more than 2 times per a day. However no one with IPD had such severe urinary problems. Careful history taking about the urinary had such severe urinary problems.

{"title": "The Value of External Anal Sphincter Motor Unit Potential Analysis in Differentiating Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease and Multiple System Atrophy\n", "abstract": " Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is an idiopathic neuro-degenerative disorder involving many neuronal structures including substantia nigra, putamen, cerebellum, pontine nuclei, olives, intermediolateral cell column of the spinal cord. Anterior horn cells innervating external urethral and external anal sphincter muscles in the sacral cord, so called Onuf's nucleus, are also affected. Neuronal loss of the Onuf's nucleus may cause denervation and reinnervation in the external urethral and the external anal sphincter muscles. As a result, in the patients with MSA electromyographic study of the external urethral and the external anal sphincter muscles may show prolonged duration of motor unit potentials (MUPs). Such abnormal MUPs of the external urethral sphincter muscles has been known to be a useful indicator distinguishing patients with MSA from those with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) in which minimal or no abnormal MUPs can be found. However, the results of external anal sphincter MUPs analysis has not been reported yet. In the patients with IPD and probable MSA, we measured the duration, the number of phases and the proportion of pathological MUPs from the external anal sphincter muscles. Cut off value of more than 60% of abnormal MUPs could differentiate patients with MSA and IPD with sensitivity of 70.3% and specificity of 90.9%.
