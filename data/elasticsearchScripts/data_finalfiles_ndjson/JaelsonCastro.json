Therefore, an appropriate requirements model must provide a comprehensive structure for what must be elicited, evaluated, specified, consolidated, and modified, instead of just providing facilities for software specifications. Since there is a well-known gap between requirements specifications and final software products, we propose the integration of Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering (GORE) and Model-Driven Development (MDD) to solve this gap. The core of our proposal is comprised by a set of guidelines to automate the process of going from an initial i* model to a final software product by means of a precise model transformation process.

Analysis were developed using EPA methods: SW 846: 3050B/6010B for arsenic and lead (FLAAS); and EPA SW 846: 7471A for total mercury (CVAAS). Compared to a recommended concentration in soil of 20 mg/kg for arsenic and mercury and 100 mg/kg for lead (PROFEPA Interim Criteria of 2001), the concentration of heavy metals was found to be up to 8 times higher for the metals analyzed. With this information a dispersion model was run in order to get iso-concentration curves and to establish risk zones.

We propose an approach that combines variability analysis and non-functional requirements to drive the configuration of a business process.

This approach allows us to assure that the functionality of the information system will be equivalent to the tasks that are executed in the business. However, only a few research studies offer a systematic approach for carrying out the equivalence between models. In this paper, a methodological approach for deriving conceptual schemas from TROPOS business models is presented. The resultant conceptual schema will be the input of the OO-Method Case Tool, which implements the automatic software production process.

In this complex context of software specification, generating high quality documentation is very difficult. Usually, clients are not sure about their needs and sometimes software requirements do not represent clients and organizational environment needs. Inconsistent and incomplete requirements are very frequent. One of the challenges to solve this problem is to integrate organizational and functional requirements of the system to be developed.

The initial concept of the magnetic actuator proposed here is simple, but enables either the external excitation without contact or the vibration control when associated with a controller system.

We allow the expression of conditions in which certain failures may be ignored \u2013 i.e., conditions on which a failure will not be compensated. Such policies may lead to reduced costs and performance improvement. The FAST framework consists of the definition of a tolerance policy, the mechanisms to evaluate this policy and a tool to aid the creation of policies.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["649"]}

{"title": "On the behavior of context-sensitive systems.\n", "abstract": " Software systems are being used in ever more diverse and dynamic environments where they have to routinely and efficiently adapt to changing environmental conditions. Therefore, they must detect variations in their operating context and adapt their behavior in response to such variations. However, specifying monitoring and adaptation can be difficult due to their dependence on the contextual elements, which need to be made explicit. The variable nature of these systems calls for new approaches to create systems that can adapt to context changes. This paper proposes the GOals to Statecharts (GO2S) process to systematically derive the behavior of context-sensitive systems from requirements models. This is an iterative process centered on the incremental refinement of a goal model, obtaining different views of the system (design, contextual, behavioral). We illustrate our proposal with the meeting scheduler exemplar and we conducted a controlled experiment in order to evaluate our process. The experiment results show that the structural complexity of the group that used our GO2S approach was lower and the mean of behavioral similarity and the time spent was higher than control group. Besides, the subjects agreed that the GO2S process is easy to use indicating that it is possible to reproduce the process and it is understandable.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["649"]}

{"title": "GO2S: a systematic process to derive the behavior of contextsensitive systems from requirements models\n", "abstract": " Context: Context-sensitive systems use context in order to adapt to the user\u2019s current needs or requirements failure. Therefore, they need to dynamically adapt their behavior. It is of paramount importance to specify and analyze the intended behavior of these systems before they are fully implemented. The behavioral specification can be used for requirements validation in order to verify if these systems will be able to achieve their goals. Moreover, the reasoning about properties of these systems, such as deadlocks, reachability, completeness and correctness of the system, can be supported. Therefore, the dynamic behavior of the context-sensitive systems requires an approach to specify it from their requirements. Objective: In this work, we propose the GOals to Statecharts (GO2S) process to systematically derive the behavior of context-sensitive systems, expressed as statecharts, from requirements models, described as goal models. The process takes into consideration the impact of non-functional requirements of these systems through their operationalization and prioritization of alternatives to be used at runtime (variants). Method: The research presented in this dissertation followed the engineering approach to define the GO2S (GOals to Statecharts) process and its suitability was empirically evaluated. Results: The GO2S process addresses the specification of the tasks required for monitoring of the requirements satisfaction as well as the system adaptation according to the context, the operationalization of non-functional requirements and prioritization of variants. This is an iterative process centered on the incremental refinement of a goal\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["649"]}

In these research works, the business models are proposed as the source of the software requirements specification process. However, the majority of these works focus only on the definition of notations that permit the representation of the semantics of the organizational context, and only a few works define processes that use these notations in a methodological way. This lack of a methodological process for generating organizational models makes practical application in software development enterprises difficult. The objective of this paper is to present a goalbased method to generate organizational models represented in the Tropos framework.

Nonetheless, the implementation of requirements related to adaptation, just as of any other kind of requirement, comes at a cost.

In particular, the following questions are tackled: is the use of requirements-based adaptation frameworks somehow affected by requirements' priorities? Does the use of said frameworks affect requirements' priorities? Through an analysis of selected frameworks, we have found evidences that suggest positive answers for both questions.

Existem duas perspectivas a atender: a dos usu\u00e1rios, que trata da descoberta de conhecimento para o estabelecimento de estrat\u00e9gias de neg\u00f3cio; e a de tecnologia de informa\u00e7\u00e3o que abrange os sistemas e processos de tratamento destas informa\u00e7\u00f5es. Para tal \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio desenvolver estruturas para armazenar, processar e recuperar dados. Este ambiente, intitulado \u201cEstrutura de Dissemina\u00e7\u00e3o de Informa\u00e7\u00f5es\u201d, constitui o alicerce da distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de informa\u00e7\u00f5es na empresa. Nesta estrutura destaca-se a exist\u00eancia dos DataWareHouse\u2019s que armazenam ordenadamente e temporalmente os dados, e os SIGs que permitem estabelecer padr\u00f5es de comportamento a partir da utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o da informa\u00e7\u00e3o espacial.

{"title": "Organizational Model to Derive Multi-Agent Architecture from Requirements.\n", "abstract": " Understanding and supporting the interaction between software requirements and architectures remains one of the challenging problems in software engineering research. To narrow these problems, we are proposing a framework for deriving architectural model in concert with Multi-Agent System requirement specifications. Our framework advocates that a multi-agent system corresponds to the organisational structure, in which actors are members of a group in order to perform specific roles.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["649"]}
