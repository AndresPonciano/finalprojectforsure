{"title": "Using Data Mining Techniques to Predict Students' Performance. A Review\n", "abstract": " Predicting students' performance is an essential activity towards the success of the world's education sector. However, the action continues to present itself as a challenging task due to the existing large data amounts in educational databases. On the other hand, some Institutions lack systems that are capable of analyzing and monitoring students' performance. This problem could be partially due to a lack of awareness about the importance of predicting students' performance. In addition to that, the existing studies on performance prediction methods are still inadequate in identifying and convincing educators with the most suitable method for predicting students' performance. This review explores the commonly used data mining techniques to predict students' performance in previous studies to find out the most suitable technology that can be trusted with predicting students' performance.

The speed and clarity of information is a demand for the development of tourism villages today in addition to the innovation and uniqueness of tourist attractions. Efforts to build a model that is in line with these demands have begun to involve relevant stakeholders, ie, village tourism managers, local governments, and tourists. Nevertheless, more in-depth studies are needed regarding the local wisdom of rural communities who are key actors in the development of tourism villages. This paper aims to explain the initial research in formulating a development model of smart tourism village based on information and communication technology. The case taken is tourism villages in Sleman district.

{"title": "IOT Design Monitoring Water Tank Study Case : Instituto Profissional De Canossa (IPDC)\n", "abstract": " Water supply at an institute is essential. How much water is needed depends on the institute's water use needs. So far, the Instituto Profissional de Canossa (IPDC) has placed a tank or reservoir for water supply on the roof of the construction to collect water taken from its source, from wells on the ground that have been installed with water pumps. In order not to run out of water or wastewater on the tank, an operator is required to check it directly every day, thus wasting time and energy trying to check the water reservoir. With the problems faced, the authors encouraged to build a prototype of IoT-based system: Design Monitoring Water Tank, which is used to monitor changes in the volume of water in the container using device devices such as smartphones, computers, or laptops, and tablets. The prototype design is connecting the ultrasonic sensor with Arduino UNO then the location inside the tank is the function of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1241"]}
{"title": "MRI Image Processing Method on Brain Tumors: A Review\n", "abstract": " Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a technological development in the medical field that produces images with high resolution to detect and then can classify diseases that are found in the organs of the patient's body. One condition that can be identified from reading an MRI image is a brain tumor. MRI technology is beneficial for medical for early detection of brain tumor disease. However, the weakness of detecting brain tumor disease with MRI images performed by doctors is still manual. It certainly requires a long process due to the complexity of the structure of the human brain. Of course, the slow process of detecting and classifying brain tumor disease in patients can cause delayed medical treatment for the patient's recovery. For this reason, based on the need for medical information needed by doctors to treat patients quickly and accurately, an image processing technique or method for reading MRI images\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1241"]}
{"title": "Designing Mobile Application Gamification for Tourism Village in Indonesia\n", "abstract": " Tourism in Indonesia is one of the contributing factors for income for the country, especially in the non-oil and gas sectors. Also, Indonesian tourism is expected to help the economy of the community, especially villages. Because of this reason, a tourist village was created. However, in its development, tourist villages are still experiencing some challenges. Among them is a stagnation in the development of attractiveness, weak tourist competitiveness, limited human resources, and lack of promotion. All of these challenges can be solved by using the gamification method. The purpose of this study is to propose a prototype of a mobile application for a tourist village using gamification. Gamification uses motivation in its application, and this method can have a beneficial effect on the tourism sector. These effects include raising brand awareness, loyalty/repeat visits, and enhancing tourism experiences. Therefore, in this\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1241"]}

This paper explores the application of Greedy Knapsack algorithm in Direct Selling in which the goal is to optimize the member\u2019s points by optimal purchase of the products. The algorithm requires the definition of the weight, profit, density and knapsack capacity to reach optimal value. In this case, the weight is the price of the product, the profit is the points of the product, the density is ratio of points per product and the knapsack capacity is the budget to be spent by member. The algorithm will give recommendations in the form of list of products that should be bought in order to optimize the member\u2019s points. The case study of the recommedation system is performed at Oriflame Direct Selling company. It can be concluded based on the survey to the members that the recommendation system based on this algorithm is useful.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1241"]}
{"title": "Modularity Index to Quantify Modularity of Open Source Software Projects\n", "abstract": " In this paper a new Software Metrics called Modularity Index is proposed and analyzed for the first time. This metrics could be used as a single measure to the modularity level of Open Source Projects. Modularity has been identified by many studies as one of the key factors of the success of Open Source Projects, but how modularity should be achieved and measured systematically is not yet known. In this first attempt to identify and analyze this metrics, the correlations of this Software Metrics with other parameters currently attributed to modularity such as size, number of modules, complexity, cohesion, and coupling (fan in and fan out) are identified and analyzed. The result of the analysis is the general formula for Modularity Index in a form of matrix relation. It can be shown from the analysis that the possibility of uniting many of these attributes into this single measure called Modularity Index is highly feasible.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1241"]}
