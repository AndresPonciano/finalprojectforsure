{"title": "Ensemble application of convolutional and recurrent neural networks for multi-label text categorization\n", "abstract": " Text categorization, or text classification, is one of key tasks for representing the semantic information of documents. Multi-label text categorization is finer-grained approach to text categorization which consists of assigning multiple target labels to documents. It is more challenging compared to the task of multi-class text categorization due to the exponential growth of label combinations. Existing approaches to multi-label text categorization fall short to extract local semantic information and to model label correlations. In this paper, we propose an ensemble application of convolutional and recurrent neural networks to capture both the global and the local textual semantics and to model high-order label correlations while having a tractable computational complexity. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance when the CNN-RNN model is trained using a large-sized dataset.", "num_citations": "177\n", "authors": ["244"]}
{"title": "Software-specific named entity recognition in software engineering social content\n", "abstract": " Software engineering social content, such as Q&A discussions on Stack Overflow, has become a wealth of information on software engineering. This textual content is centered around software-specific entities, and their usage patterns, issues-solutions, and alternatives. However, existing approaches to analyzing software engineering texts treat software-specific entities in the same way as other content, and thus cannot support the recent advance of entity-centric applications, such as direct answers and knowledge graph. The first step towards enabling these entity-centric applications for software engineering is to recognize and classify software-specific entities, which is referred to as Named Entity Recognition (NER) in the literature. Existing NER methods are designed for recognizing person, location and organization in formal and social texts, which are not applicable to NER in software engineering.

{"title": "Mastering complex control in moba games with deep reinforcement learning\n", "abstract": " We study the reinforcement learning problem of complex action control in the Multi-player Online Battle Arena (MOBA) 1v1 games. This problem involves far more complicated state and action spaces than those of traditional 1v1 games, such as Go and Atari series, which makes it very difficult to search any policies with human-level performance. In this paper, we present a deep reinforcement learning framework to tackle this problem from the perspectives of both system and algorithm. Our system is of low coupling and high scalability, which enables efficient explorations at large scale. Our algorithm includes several novel strategies, including control dependency decoupling, action mask, target attention, and dual-clip PPO, with which our proposed actor-critic network can be effectively trained in our system. Tested on the MOBA game Honor of Kings, the trained AI agents can defeat top professional human players in full 1v1 games.", "num_citations": "52\n", "authors": ["244"]}

Due to the cross-reference of questions and answers (note that users also reference URLs external to the Q&A site.

In Stack Overflow, why do developers share URLs? How is the community feedback to the knowledge being shared? What are the unique topological and semantic properties of the resulting knowledge network in Stack Overflow? Has this knowledge network become stable? If so, how does it reach to stability? Answering these questions can help the software engineering community better understand the knowledge diffusion process in programming-specific Q&A sites like Stack\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "42\n", "authors": ["244"]}

Extracting API mentions in natural language texts is a prerequisite for effective indexing and searching for API-related information in software engineering social content. However, the informal nature of social discussions creates two fundamental challenges for API extraction: common-word polysemy and sentence-format variations. Common-word polysemy refers to the ambiguity between the API sense of a common word and the normal sense of the word (e.g., append, apply and merge). Sentence-format variations refer to the lack of consistent sentence writing format for inferring API mentions. Existing API extraction techniques fall short to address these two challenges, because they assume distinct API naming conventions (e.g., camel case, underscore) or structured\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "40\n", "authors": ["244"]}
{"title": "Towards playing full moba games with deep reinforcement learning\n", "abstract": " MOBA games, e.g., Honor of Kings, League of Legends, and Dota 2, pose grand challenges to AI systems such as multi-agent, enormous state-action space, complex action control, etc. Developing AI for playing MOBA games has raised much attention accordingly. However, existing work falls short in handling the raw game complexity caused by the explosion of agent combinations, i.e., lineups, when expanding the hero pool in case that OpenAI's Dota AI limits the play to a pool of only 17 heroes. As a result, full MOBA games without restrictions are far from being mastered by any existing AI system. In this paper, we propose a MOBA AI learning paradigm that methodologically enables playing full MOBA games with deep reinforcement learning. Specifically, we develop a combination of novel and existing learning techniques, including curriculum self-play learning, policy distillation, off-policy adaption, multi-head value estimation, and Monte-Carlo tree-search, in training and playing a large pool of heroes, meanwhile addressing the scalability issue skillfully. Tested on Honor of Kings, a popular MOBA game, we show how to build superhuman AI agents that can defeat top esports players.

{"title": "Adversarial Transfer for Named Entity Boundary Detection with Pointer Networks.\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we focus on named entity boundary detection, which aims to detect the start and end boundaries of an entity mention in text, without predicting its type. A more accurate and robust detection approach is desired to alleviate error propagation in downstream applications, such as entity linking and fine-grained typing systems. Here, we first develop a novel entity boundary labeling approach with pointer networks, where the output dictionary size depends on the input, which is variable. Furthermore, we propose AT-BDRY, which incorporates adversarial transfer learning into an end-toend sequence labeling model to encourage domaininvariant representations. More importantly, ATBDRY can reduce domain difference in data distributions between the source and target domains, via an unsupervised transfer learning approach (ie, no annotated target-domain data is necessary). We conduct Formal Text\u2192 Formal Text, Formal Text\u2192 Informal Text and ablation evaluations on five benchmark datasets.

We develop a high-level synthesis methodology suitable for rapid prototyping of bitwidth-annotated RTL code generation using gcc's GIMPLE backend. For range analysis, we perform parallel evaluation of sub-intervals to provide tighter bounds compared to ordinary interval arithmetic. For bitwidth allocation, we enumerate the different bitwidth combinations in parallel by assigning each combination to a GPU thread.

While traditional solutions use automated heuristics like simulated annealing or integer linear programming, they still rely on the manual formulation of resource models, which can be tedious, and potentially inaccurate due to the unpredictable interactions between different stages of the FPGA CAD flow.

One of the key issues is how to represent the non-stationary price series of assets in a portfolio, which is important for portfolio decisions.

In this paper, under a deep reinforcement learning paradigm for portfolio selection, we propose a novel Relation-aware Transformer (RAT) to handle these aspects. Specifically, being equipped with our newly developed attention modules, RAT is structurally innovated to capture both sequential patterns and asset correlations for portfolio selection. Based on the extracted sequential features, RAT is able to make profitable portfolio decisions regarding each asset via a newly devised leverage operation.

State-of-the-art drafting methods fail to consider: 1) drafting efficiency when the hero pool is expanded; 2) the multi-round nature of a MOBA 5v5 match series, i.e., two teams play best-of-N and the same hero is only allowed to be drafted once throughout the series. In this paper, we formulate the drafting process as a multi-round combinatorial game and propose a novel drafting algorithm based on neural networks and Monte-Carlo tree search, named JueWuDraft.

While most research focuses on the state-action function part through reducing the bootstrapping error in value function approximation induced by the distribution shift of training data, the effects of error propagation in generative modeling have been neglected. In this paper, we analyze the error in generative modeling. We propose AQL (action-conditioned Q-learning), a residual generative model to reduce policy approximation error for offline RL. We show that our method can learn more accurate policy approximations in different benchmark datasets.
