High rotational J levels are shown to have an enhanced propensity to preserve anisotropic distributions of m J states.

In this study we demonstrate that saturated polarisation spectroscopy on photo-induced C2 can be exploited for soot detection. Signal maps featuring high signal-to-noise ratios were readily recorded in ethyne-rich flames and any spurious background, for example, caused by Rayleigh scattering, was successfully suppressed by means of spatial filtering. Additionally, investigations were carried out addressing how the attained signals correlate with local soot volumne fractions.
