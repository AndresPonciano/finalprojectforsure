In this paper, we present a falsification technique that uses a local search technique called Tabu search to search for optimal inputs. The key idea is to discretize the space of input signals and use the Tabu list to avoid revisiting previously encountered input signals.

Depending on the cell line, the specific molecular mechanisms leading to cell death may significantly differ. Precise characterization of these differences is crucial for understanding and exploiting extrinsic apoptosis. Cells show distinct behaviors on several aspects of apoptosis, including (i) the relative order of caspases activation, (ii) the necessity of mitochondria outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) for effector caspase activation, and (iii) the survival of cell lines overexpressing Bcl2. These differences are attributed to the activation of one of two pathways, leading to classification of cell lines into two groups: type I and type II. In this work we challenge this type I/type II cell line classification. We encode the three aforementioned distinguishing behaviors in a formal language, called signal temporal logic (STL), and use it to extensively test the validity of a previously-proposed model of TRAIL-induced apoptosis with respect to experimental observations made on different cell lines. After having solved a few inconsistencies using STL-guided parameter search, we show that these three criteria do not define consistent cell line classifications in type I or type II, and suggest mutants that are predicted to exhibit ambivalent behaviors. In particular, this finding sheds light on the role of a feedback loop between caspases, and reconciliates two apparently-conflicting views regarding the importance of either upstream or downstream processes for cell-type determination.

Unlike the traditional design flow for SDF which involves splitting of a big problem into smaller heuristic sub-problems, we deal with this problem as a whole and try to compute exact Pareto-optimal solutions for it. We introduce symmetry breaking constraints in order to reduce the run-times of the solver. We have tested our work on a number of SDF graphs and demonstrated the practicality of our method. We validate our models by running an image decoding application on the Tilera multicore platform.", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["1870"]}
{"title": "Efficient parametric identification for STL\n", "abstract": " We describe a new algorithm for the parametric identification problem for signal temporal logic (STL), stated as follows. Given a dense-time real-valued signal w and a parameterized temporal logic formula \u03c6, compute the subset of the parameter space that renders the formula satisfied by the signal. Unlike previous solutions, which were based on search in the parameter space or quantifier elimination, our procedure works recursively on \u03c6 and computes the evolution over time of the set of valid parameter assignments. This procedure is similar to that of monitoring or computing the robustness of \u03c6 relative to w. Our implementation and experiments demonstrate that this approach can work well in practice.", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["1870"]}

In robotics, however, computer science makes contact with real-world geometric and physical phenomena such as compliance of elastic bodies, the frictional phenomena that occur when two bodies come in contact, errors in modeling which are inevitable in the real world, the sudden changes of state which occur when two bodies collide unexpectedly, and so forth. It is to be expected that much interesting new computer science will emerge from contact with these rich conceptual domains and, in particular, that computer science will become more traditionally mathematical and\\continuous\". The theory of hybrid systems (HS), can be considered as an important step toward the realization of this vision. By a hybrid system I mean a system which is a product of the interaction between a discrete state-transition system (an automaton, a program) and a continuous di erential dynamical system. In this informal talk I will try to explain what this theory is about and in what aspects it di ers from other computational theories. In order to do so I will first (section 2) point out explicitly the underlying assumptions of traditional computability theory concerning the phenomena it is supposed to model. In section 3 I will show how these assumptions are not valid in what I call\\real-life\" computations, where the computer is embedded in the physical world. In section 4 I will show how reactive and real-time systems can be considered as preliminary\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["1870"]}

Our result is based on the observation that in probabilistic transition systems, \u201crandomness\u201d and \u201cmemory\u201d can be separated so as to allow the non-random part to be treated using common deterministic automata-theoretic techniques.

Differential and difference equations are common formalisms to characterize such systems. Hybrid dynamical systems come in handy when the modeled system combines continuous and discrete evolutions or different evolution modes such as where slow evolution phases are interrupted by fast ones. Biological data with kinetic content are often scarce, thus it can be appropriate to reason in terms of sets of (parametrized) models and sets of trajectories. In doing so, uncertainties and lack of knowledge are explicitly taken into account and more reliable predictions can be made. A crucial problem in Systems Biology is thus to identify regions of parameter space for which model behavior is consistent with experimental observations\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1870"]}

In most cases, the number of Pareto solutions can be huge and we would like to provide a good representative approximation of the Pareto front. Moreover, the search space can be too large and complex for the problem to be solved by exact methods. Therefore efficient heuristic search algorithms are needed that can handle such problems.

Timed automata were introduced as a formal model for real-time systems hoping that their role in the verification of such systems will be similar to the role of finite automata in the systematic search of errors in the design of untimed systems. In our thesis we are concerned with several theoretical questions related to timed automata and timed languages. In the first part of the thesis we investigate a simple sub-class of timed automata with one clock which is reset at each transition. We show that for this sub-class we can obtain simple analogs of the classical results of automata theory, namely Kleene and Myhill-Nerode theorems and closure under complementation. The second and main part of the thesis is motivated by the timed regular expressions of Asarin, Caspi and Maler where it was shown that, in order to match the expressive power of timed automata, one needs to introduce intersection into the expressions. We investigate an alternative to intersection by using colored parentheses for defining timing restrictions on overlapping parts of a sequence. This idea leads to an alternative representation of languages of timed automata, which is based on a new class of languages called here. We develop the theory of regular expressions over regminoes and prove that their emptiness problem is undecidable in general, and decidable for a large subclass of languages. From these results we develop new data-structures and algorithms for solving emptiness and reachability problems for timed automata\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1870"]}
{"title": "On the Cascaded Decomposition of Automata, its Complexity and its Application to Logic (Draft)\n", "abstract": " The primary decomposition theorem due to Krohn and Rhodes (KR65]), which has been considered as one of the fundamental results in the theory of automata and semigroups, states that every automaton is homomorphic to a cascaded decomposition (wreath-product) of simpler automata of two kinds: reset automata and permutation automata. If the automaton is non-counting (and correspondingly its transformation semigroup is group-free) then it can be decomposed using only reset components.There exist various proofs and partial proofs for the primary decomposition theorem eg, HS66, Ze67a, Ze67b, Gi68, MT69, La71, We76, Ei76]. None of them give explicit bounds on the size of the decomposition. 1 In this paper we give tight exponential bounds on the size of the decomposition as a function of the size of the original automaton. For the upper-bound we give an exponential algorithm by modifying the implicit construction appearing in Ei74]. Our algorithm is constructive enough to allow implementation??]. We apply the algorithm to give an exponential upper-bound on transforming star-free regular (resp.!-regular) sets expressed by counter-free automata (resp.!-automata) into past (resp. future) temporal logic formulae. These upper bounds improve upon previously-known non-elementary translations (MNP71, LPZ85, Zu86).", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1870"]}
{"title": "Learning pareto front from membership queries\n", "abstract": " We present a new method for inferring the Pareto front in multi-criteria optimization problems. The approach is grounded on an algorithm for learning the boundary between valid and invalid configurations of a multi-dimensional space (X). The algorithm selects sampling points for which it submits membership queries x \u2208 X to an oracle. Based on the answers and relying on monotonicity, it constructs an approximation of the boundary. The algorithm generalizes binary search on the continuum from one-dimensional (and linearly-ordered) domains to multi-dimensional (and partially-ordered) ones. The procedure explained in this paper has been applied for the parameter synthesis of extended Signal Temporal Logic (STLe) expressions where the influence of parameters is monotone. Our method has been implemented in a free and publicly available Python library.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1870"]}
{"title": "On universal search strategies for multi-criteria optimization using weighted sums\n", "abstract": " We develop a stochastic local search algorithm for finding Pareto points for multi-criteria optimization problems. The algorithm alternates between different single-criterium optimization problems characterized by weight vectors. The policy for switching between different weights is an adaptation of the universal restart strategy defined by [LSZ93] in the context of Las Vegas algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on multi-criteria quadratic assignment problem benchmarks and prove some of its theoretical properties.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1870"]}

{"title": "Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control: 6th International Workshop, HSCC 2003 Prague, Czech Republic, April 3-5, 2003, Proceedings\n", "abstract": " This volume contains the proceedings of the Sixth Workshop on Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control (HSCC 2003), which was held in Prague, during April 3\u20135, 2003. The Hybrid Systems workshops attract researchers interested in the modeling, analysis, control, and implementation of systems which involve the interaction of both discrete and continuous state dynamics. The newest results and latest developments in hybrid system models, formal methods for analysis and control, computational tools, as well as new applications and examples are presented at these annual meetings. The Sixth Workshop continued the series of workshops held in Grenoble, France (HART\u201997), Berkeley, California, USA (HSCC\u201998), Nijmegen, The Neth-lands (HSCC\u201999), Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA (HSCC 2000), Rome, Italy (HSCC 2001), and Stanford, California, USA (HSCC 2002). Proceedings of these workshops have been published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in C-puter Science (LNCS) series. This year we assembled a technical program committee with a broad expertise in formal methods in computer science, control theory, applied mathematics, and arti? cial intelligence. We received a set of 75 high-quality submitted papers. After detailed review and discussion of these papers by the program committee, 36 papers were accepted for presentation at the workshop, and the? nal versions of these papers appear in this volume.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1870"]}
{"title": "Hybrid systems applications: An oxymoron?\n", "abstract": " Hybrid systems are richly expressive models for a large variety of potential ap- plications. However, being so rich as to include continuous nonlinear dynamical systems, discrete-event systems and other models of computation (unite-state machines and data ow come to mind here), they are not amenable to com- putationally attractive techniques for synthesis and analysis and present hard numerical problems to simulation. Hence, applying the methods typical of this technology requires non trivial amount of approximation and abstraction. And approximation and abstraction are effective only if the domain of application is deeply understood. Thus, significant applications of hybrid systems require a great deal of work both to select the right abstraction level and to derive algo- rithms that exploit the particularities of the domain of application. In addition, one needs to motivate and document convincingly why\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1870"]}
{"title": "A decomposition theorem for probabilistic transition systems\n", "abstract": " In this paper we prove that every finite Markov chain can be decomposed into a cascade product of a Bernoulli process and several simple permutation-reset deterministic automata. The original chain is a statehomomorphic image of the product. By doing so we give a positive answer to an open question stated in [Paz71] concerning the decomposability of probabilistic systems. Our result is based on the surprisingly-original observation that in probabilistic transition systems, \u201crandomness\u201d and \u201cmemory\u201d can be separated in such a way that allows the non-random part to be treated using common deterministic automata-theoretic techniques. The same separation technique can be applied as well to other kinds of non-determinism.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1870"]}
