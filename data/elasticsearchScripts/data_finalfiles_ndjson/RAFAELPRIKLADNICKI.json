The results provide some support for the claims of proximity benefits. The Brazil-North dyads use moderate timeshifting that is perceived as comfortable for both sides.

In parallel, other studies indicate that the emergence of agile methods in the 90s led to the formation of high performance teams with great level of knowledge in technical, business and behavioral domains. For this reason, we have proposed a training method called Software Kaizen, which provides temporary immersion of a team in a high-performance environment, based on agile methodologies.

In crowdsourcing a task is delivered to a crowd of participants who will work on this task. Task allocation is then an important aspect in the context of crowdsourcing.

Factors like a task's requirements, the knowledge required for its resolution, and the size and heterogeneity of the participants in the crowd all impact task allocation, and therefore, the expected quality of the task results. In this case, the execution of actions from a plan, which assist the dynamic tasks' allocation in crowdsourcing systems, become relevant as an alternative solution.

They have to be built taking into account different existing aspects like customers, organization\u2019s business, and its current Information Technology (IT) infrastructure, among others. IT architects are the professionals who take all these aspects into account when designing an information system. Despite their importance, the work of these professionals is barely understood. This research aims to fill this gap by describing a qualitative study we conducted with IT architects. We use semi-structured interviews for data collection and analyzed our data using grounded theory methods. Our results suggest that there are different IT architect roles in every company and that the activities performed by them are highly interconnected and these interconnections are fundamental for the information diffusion and collaboration in projects.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["181"]}

However, due to a large number of possible configurations, it is a challenge to select the ML environment to be used for a specific SE domain issue. Helping software engineers choose the most suitable ML environment according to their needs would be very helpful. For instance, it is possible to automate software tests using ML models, where the model learns software behavior and predicts possible problems in the code. In this paper, we present a mapping study that categorizes the ML techniques and tools reported as useful to solve SE domain issues. We found that the most used algorithm is Na\u0131ve Bayes and that WEKA is the tool most SE researchers use to perform ML experiments related to SE.

It is claimed that women lead differently than men and are more collaboration-oriented, communicative, and less aggressive than their male counterparts. However, when talking with women in technology companies' leadership roles, a list of problems women face grows fast.
