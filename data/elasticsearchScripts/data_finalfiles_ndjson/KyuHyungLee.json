{"title": "{MPI}: Multiple perspective attack investigation with semantic aware execution partitioning\n", "abstract": " Traditional auditing techniques generate large and inaccurate causal graphs. To overcome such limitations, researchers proposed to leverage execution partitioning to improve analysis granularity and hence precision. However, these techniques rely on a low level programming paradigm (ie, event handling loops) to partition execution, which often results in low level graphs with a lot of redundancy. This not only leads to space inefficiency and noises in causal graphs, but also makes it difficult to understand attack provenance. Moreover, these techniques require training to detect low level memory dependencies across partitions. Achieving correctness and completeness in the training is highly challenging. In this paper, we propose a semantics aware program annotation and instrumentation technique to partition execution based on the application specific high level task structures. It avoids training, generates execution partitions with rich semantic information and provides multiple perspectives of an attack. We develop a prototype and integrate it with three different provenance systems: the Linux Audit system, ProTracer and the LPM-HiFi system. The evaluation results show that our technique generates cleaner attack graphs with rich high-level semantics and has much lower space and time overheads, when compared with the event loop based partitioning techniques BEEP and ProTracer.", "num_citations": "74\n", "authors": ["1833"]}

As an example, when graphene oxide (GO) sheets are assembled in the liquid crystalline state, they can turn into ordered macroscopic forms of GO such as fibers via the wet spinning process. Here, we report that by reinforcing intersheet interactions, GO liquid crystals (LCs) turn into mechanically robust hydrogels that can be readily drawn into highly aligned fibrillar structures. GO hydrogel fibers with highly aligned sheets (orientation factor, f = 0.71) exhibit more than twice the ionic conductivity compared to those with partially aligned structures (f = 0.01). The hierarchically interconnected two-dimensional nanochannels within these neatly aligned GOLC hydrogel fibers may facilitate controlled transport of charge carriers and could be potentially explored as cables for interconnecting biosystems and/or human-made\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "52\n", "authors": ["1833"]}
{"title": "Augmenting RAID with an SSD for energy relief\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we describe a design of a novel architecture for RAID that uses an SSD as a large cache to conserve energy. This approach stems from the fact that short term footprints are small enough to be efficiently managed within an SSD. More specifically, in this study, we consider two simple approaches to reduce the energy consumed in RAID. First, when a read happens in RAID, a copy of the read request is copied to the SSD, so that future requests may be serviced by the SSD. Then, for writes, all writes are buffered in SSDs so that the interval between requests may be increased reducing activities at RAID disks. We incorporate these approaches into a real implementation of a RAID 5 system that consists of four hard disks and an SSD in a Linux environment. Our preliminary results in actual performance measurements using the cello99 and SPC traces show that energy consumption is reduced by a\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "44\n", "authors": ["1833"]}

JSgraph\u2019s main goal is to enable a detailed, post-mortem reconstruction of ephemeral JS-based web attacks experienced by real network users. In particular, we aim to enable the reconstruction of social engineering attacks that result in the download of malicious executable files or browser extensions, among other attacks. We implement JSgraph by instrumenting Chromium\u2019s code base at the interface between Blink and V8, the rendering and JavaScript engines. We design JSgraph to be lightweight, highly portable, and to require low storage capacity for its fine-grained audit logs. Using a variety of both in-the-wild and lab-reproduced web attacks, we demonstrate how JSgraph can aid the forensic investigation process. We then show that JSgraph introduces acceptable overhead, with a median overhead on popular website page loads between 3.2% and 3.9%.", "num_citations": "30\n", "authors": ["1833"]}

{"title": "Write-aware buffer cache management scheme for nonvolatile ram\n", "abstract": " Nonvolatile RAM (NVRAM) technology is advancing rapidly with 1-2Mb capacity single-chip prototypes becoming available from major semiconductor companies. We will soon see NVRAM become an everyday component of our commodity computers. This paper explores the use of NVRAM as part of the buffer cache. A nonvolatile buffer cache provides a computer system with a means to maintain complete consistency as well as improved performance. The results of this paper can be summarized as follows. First, we show that the hit ratio that has been a commonly used metric to measure buffer cache performance is no longer adequate for caches with NVRAM. Instead of the hit ratio, we need to count the number of disk accesses to assess user perceived cache performance. Second, we show that because of this change in performance metric, when managing a buffer cache with NVRAM, one can do better than when using the MIN replacement algorithm mainly by distinguishing read and write operations. With this, we show that there is room for improvement in efficiently handling caches with NVRAM. Finally, based on these findings, we propose a simple and practical buffer management technique that improves on using the LRU algorithm.", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["1833"]}
{"title": "Enabling Reconstruction of Attacks on Users via Efficient Browsing Snapshots.\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we present ChromePic, a web browser equipped with a novel forensic engine that aims to greatly enhance the browser\u2019s logging capabilities. ChromePic\u2019s main goal is to enable a fine-grained post-mortem reconstruction and trace-back of web attacks without incurring the high overhead of record-andreplay systems. In particular, we aim to enable the reconstruction of attacks that target users and have a significant visual component, such as social engineering and phishing attacks. To this end, ChromePic records a detailed snapshot of the state of a web page, including a screenshot of how the page is rendered and a \u201cdeep\u201d DOM snapshot, at every significant interaction between the user and the page. If an attack is later suspected, these finegrained logs can be used to reconstruct the attack and trace back the sequence of steps the user followed to reach the attack page.We develop ChromePic by implementing several careful modifications and optimizations to the Chromium code base, to minimize overhead and make always-on logging practical. We then demonstrate that ChromePic can successfully capture and aid the reconstruction of attacks on users. Our evaluation includes the analysis of an in-the-wild social engineering download attack on Android, a phishing attack, and two different clickjacking attacks, as well as a user study aimed at accurately measuring the overhead introduced by our forensic engine. The experimental results show that browsing snapshots can be logged very efficiently, making the logging events practically unnoticeable to users.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["1833"]}
{"title": "Droidforensics: Accurate reconstruction of android attacks via multi-layer forensic logging\n", "abstract": " The goal of cyber attack investigation is to fully reconstruct the details of an attack, so we can trace back to its origin, and recover the system from the damage caused by the attack.

{"title": "When Push Comes to Ads: Measuring the Rise of (Malicious) Push Advertising\n", "abstract": " The rapid growth of online advertising has fueled the growth of ad-blocking software, such as new ad-blocking and privacy-oriented browsers or browser extensions. In response, both ad publishers and ad networks are constantly trying to pursue new strategies to keep up their revenues. To this end, ad networks have started to leverage the Web Push technology enabled by modern web browsers. As web push notifications (WPNs) are relatively new, their role in ad delivery has not yet been studied in depth. Furthermore, it is unclear to what extent WPN ads are being abused for malvertising (ie, to deliver malicious ads). In this paper, we aim to fill this gap. Specifically, we propose a system called PushAdMiner that is dedicated to (1) automatically registering for and collecting a large number of web-based push notifications from publisher websites,(2) finding WPN-based ads among these notifications, and (3\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1833"]}
{"title": "Vortex dynamics in magnesium-diboride superconductor by using {sup 11} B NMR\n", "abstract": " {sup 11}B nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR) measurements were performed to investigate vortex dynamics in the polycrystalline superconductor MgB{sub 2}. {sup 11}B NMR spectrum, shift and transverse relaxation rate 1/T{sub 2} were measured down to 4.3 K at {approx}1.8 T. The spectrum below T{sub c} exhibits a typical local field distribution for a vortex lattice under a magnetic field. The peak point of the spectrum shifts toward low magnetic field, due to imperfect field penetration. This decrease in the shift starts to appear below the detuning temperature of a NMR resonant circuit, which is measured to match the irreversibility temperature T{sub irr} of magnetization. 1/T{sub 2} data, probing the slow motion of vortices, show a single peak with a small change in the rate, in contrast to the results for nickel borocarbides. This strongly suggests that thermal fluctuation of vortices is reduced and the vortex motion is much smaller, compared with nickel borocarbides.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1833"]}

{"title": "A Novel AI-based Methodology for Identifying Cyber Attacks in Honey Pots\n", "abstract": " We present a novel AI-based methodology that identifies phases of a host-level cyber attack simply from system call logs. System calls emanating from cyber attacks on hosts such as honey pots are often recorded in audit logs. Our methodology first involves efficiently loading, caching, processing, and querying system events contained in audit logs in support of computer forensics. Output of queries remains at the system call level and is difficult to process. The next step is to infer a sequence of abstracted actions, which we colloquially call a storyline, from the system calls given as observations to a latent-state probabilistic model. These storylines are then accurately identified with class labels using a learned classifier. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate methods and models for each step of the methodology using 114 different attack phases collected by logging the attacks of a red team on a server, on some likely benign sequences containing regular user activities, and on traces from a recent DARPA project. The resulting end-to-end system, which we call Cyberian, identifies the attack phases with a high level of accuracy illustrating the benefit that this machine learning-based methodology brings to security forensics.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1833"]}

Our emphaSSL could guide app developer's security development decisions via real-time feedback, informative warnings and suggestions.

{"title": "SBBox: A tamper-resistant digital archiving system\n", "abstract": " Reliable forensic data (kernel, socket, audit, other user defined data, etc.) is imperative when investigating cybercrimes. While static and dynamic forensic data collection techniques have already been proposed, none of them pay attention to the process of storing the collected data securely. If the forensic data is tampered with while in storage\u2013after collection\u2013investigators cannot rely on the collected data. In this paper, we propose a hardware/software collaborative novel mechanism for capturing forensic data. The proposed BlackBox Engine ensures data integrity, whereby distorted data can be traced out. The BlackBox Engine runs on a proposed hardware device called Server BlackBox (SBBox). Compared with append-only storage, SBBox offers a more comprehensive solution for forensic data collection and storage, including capturing changes in any file, compressing data, and reconstructing distorted data. Due to close integration between application software, kernel, and proposed hardware, it is virtually impossible for an intruder to interfere with the system by any unfair means. After running standard benchmarks, we observe that the proposed solution incurs minimal overhead of 3.2%, 4.9%, and 1.4% for the CPU, memory, and network, respectively.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1833"]}
{"title": "C 2 SR: Cybercrime Scene Reconstruction for Post-mortem Forensic Analysis\n", "abstract": " Cybercrime scene reconstruction that aims to reconstruct a previous execution of the cyber attack delivery process is an important capability for cyber forensics (eg, post mortem analysis of the cyber attack executions). Unfortunately, existing techniques such as log-based forensics or record-and-replay techniques are not suitable to handle complex and long-running modern applications for cybercrime scene reconstruction and post mortem forensic analysis. Specifically, log-based cyber forensics techniques often suffer from a lack of inspection capability and do not provide details of how the attack unfolded. Record-and-replay techniques impose significant runtime overhead, often require significant modifications on end-user systems, and demand to replay the entire recorded execution from the beginning. In this paper, we propose C2SR, a novel technique that can reconstruct an attack delivery chain (ie, cybercrime scene) for postmortem forensic analysis. It provides a highly desired capability: interactable partial execution reconstruction. In particular, it reproduces a partial execution of interest from a large execution trace of a long-running program. The reconstructed execution is also interactable, allowing forensic analysts to leverage debugging and analysis tools that did not exist on the recorded machine. The key intuition behind C2SR is partitioning an execution trace by resources and reproducing resource accesses that are consistent with the original execution. It tolerates user interactions required for inspections that do not cause inconsistent resource accesses.
