{"title": "Assessing the thinking curriculum: New tools for educational reform\n", "abstract": " In America, educational reform and testing are intimately linked. Test scores signal the need for reform, as evidenced by the attention paid to declining scores on college entrance exams and standardized tests, to Americans\u2019 weak performances on international comparisons, and to the percentages of students failing certain kinds of items on our national assessments. Tests are also widely viewed as instruments for educational improvement. Calls for better performance by American schools are almost always accompanied by increases in the amounts of testing done in the schools. New tests, or more active scrutiny of tests already in place, are frequently prescribed, both as a source of information for a concerned public and as a form of \u201cquality control\u201d and an incentive to better performance by educators and students.

From an historical examination of selected European and American models of literacy, they conclude that reading instruction has been aimed at attaining either a low level of literacy for a large number of people or a high level for an elite. Thus, the contemporary expectation\u2014high levels of literacy for the entire population\u2014represents a relatively recent development. From this stance the Resnicks argue that, contrary to the thrust of the \"back to basics\" movement, pedagogical practices from the past offer little remedy for reading problems as currently defined.", "num_citations": "654\n", "authors": ["1059"]}

THE BELL CURVE by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray, a best selling book published in 1994, set off a hailstorm of controversy about the relationships among IQ, genetics, and various social outcomes, including welfare dependency, crime, and earnings. Much of the public reaction to the book was polemical and did not focus on the details of the science and in particular on the validity of the statistical arguments that underlie the books's conclusions. A detailed understanding of the arguments in THE BELL CURVE requires knowledge about (i) statistical models for genetic heritability,(ii) factor analysis, especially as it has been applied to the analysis of IQ tests,(iii) logistic regression and multiple regression analyses, and (iv) causal modelling and alternative statistical frameworks for making inference from longitudinal data. In this volume a group of statisticians and social scientists have assembled a scientific response to THE BELL CURVE. The sixteen chapters begin by presenting an overview of the scientific and statistical issues and summarize the material in Herrnstein and Murray's book. Then separate chapters by various experts deal with more focused issues, including reanalyses of data relied upon by the authors of THE BELL CURVE.

In no other Western nation does it occupy so large a place in the processes of schooling. Selection, guidance, place-ment, credentialing, and program evaluation, which all tend to be dealt with in other ways in other nations, are closely tied in our society to standardized testing.Our historical analysis indicates that the significant place presently occupied by testing in dealing with these functions is the result of interrelated developments in the past century in the concerns of psychology, the structure of the schools, and the capabilities of educational publishers. Through the interaction of psychologists, school administrators, and pub-lishers, relatively low-cost methods have been developed for dealing with the needs of a rapidly growing system of mass education.

Actionable variables include teacher educational background and salary, instructional time, textbooks, class size, classroom homogeneity, homework, tracking, and courses taken.

{"title": "Technical Choice, Innovation, and Economic Growth: Essays on American and British Experience in the Nineteenth Century: David, Paul A.: New York: Cambridge University Press\u00a0\u2026\n", "abstract": " Just because this book is handsomely produced and beautifully illustrated, the reader should not be deceived: it is a firstrate work about a key problem in military history-perhaps the key problem. General Hughes has set out to determine how effective the weapons of war were between 1630 and 1850. The question arises constantly in military circles, be they in Washington, Moscow, or Hanoi. The author launches a two-pronged attack on the problem. He first investigates the theoretical maximum kill rate that the technology of the time was capable of inflicting. He then explores how much of that maximum was actually achieved on the battlefield. To reach a conclusion about theoretical kill rates, the author investigates tactical formations, musket ranges, fire discipline, and surviving data on what today would be called proving-ground tests. The kill rate actually achieved, on the other hand, is built up from eight battles\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1059"]}
