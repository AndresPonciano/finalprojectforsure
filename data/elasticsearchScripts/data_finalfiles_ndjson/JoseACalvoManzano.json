{"title": "Experiences in the application of software process improvement in SMES\n", "abstract": " During the last few years, many Software Process Improvement methods (SPI) have been presented to increase the quality of products and services provided by a software organization. Current Software Process Improvement (SPI) methods (i.e. ISO 15504, CBA-IPI,...), are difficult to apply to Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMES) due to the costs (financial, time, and resource) associated with their application. Also, these methods are principally focused on the assessment stage. This paper presents a new SPI method, called MESOPYME, which main focus is to reduce effort and time on the SPI implementation. This method focuses on the improvement implementation stage, which is based on a concept called Action Package, whose components are described (in Section 2.1.).

However, despite these efforts, they can still find it difficult to deploy processes throughout the organization because most of them focus more on the technical rather than human aspects. This paper proposes a taxonomy of critical success factors for software process deployment. A method to create this taxonomy was developed and applied based on a systematic review of existing literature and is complemented with industry experiences where software processes have been deployed or implemented.

{"title": "Implementing the Ki Wo Tsukau\u00ae model to strengthen the commitment of small-sized software enterprises in software process improvement initiatives\n", "abstract": " In spite that the lack of commitment and motivation has been directly linked to a high degree of failures in software process improvement initiatives, these two aspects have not received yet enough attention by researchers. In this regard, small enterprises are more susceptible to fail when committing an effort for improving because the people involved do not know what to do or how to act with this change. Moreover, the Ki Wo Tsukau\u00ae model is promoting the use of proper levels of energy, commitment, and motivation in different contexts. Therefore, this paper introduces an alternative approach to strengthen the commitment of a Mexican small-sized software enterprise, by implementing some basic principles of the Ki Wo Tsukau\u00ae model in a software process improvement initiative.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1155"]}

{"title": "MEDEPRO: a method to deploy processes focused on people\n", "abstract": " Nowadays, organizations need to respond to customer demands with quality products and services. Methodologies and process models have been developed to help organizations to achieve these objectives. However, despite the efforts of organizations, they still come up against difficulties in their deployment and the processes are not institutionalized. Difficulty in process institutionalization arises due to the fact that most of these efforts focus on technical issues, and people issues are ignored. This paper presents the critical success factors to take into account in the process deployment, and a process deployment method to be used in software projects. These highlight the importance of having an effective process deployment strategy to adopt, use and institutionalize the process. The results of a case study are included.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1155"]}
{"title": "Project management and IT governance. Integrating PRINCE2 and ISO 38500\n", "abstract": " IT governance is becoming a critical area for the improvement and business continuity in organizations. The value of the services, as a product of IT projects, must be improved. A good definition of IT projects, according to business needs, helps to improve product value. For this purpose, some frameworks and standards have been developed by internationally recognized institutions. Among them project management framework \u201cPRINCE2\u201d and the IT governance standard ISO/IEC 38500 are highlighted. The application of these frameworks and standards has meant figures have improved, but they are far from covering the expectations of organizations. A IT project approach that integrates the needs of business and technology that supports it is a key to achieve the expected success for IT projects in organizations.

Therefore the activities to integrate it are very important because they allow building and strengthening both the personal and professional relationships among the team members. Nowadays there is a great variety of activities to carry out the integration of a team that aims to improve communication coordination and teamwork. These activities are a very important support for improving the teamwork regardless the area where the team carries out its activities. In this context this paper presents a proposal to carry out the identification of teamwork roles for a software development team based on building a Rube Goldberg machine and the activities carried out in TSPi methodology toward the integration of a team.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1155"]}
{"title": "MyPMP: A plug-in for implementing the metamodeling approach for project management in small-sized software enterprises\n", "abstract": " Nowadays, with the recurrent demands of high quality, delivery on time and no    extra costs, the task of managing a software project could be extremely    complex for any software enterprise. Furthermore, small-sized software    enterprises face several problems (e.g., lack of knowledge, human and    financial resources, time, and size of staff) that, undoubtedly, make this    task more difficult. In this context, obtaining a simplified version of the    management activities can be a helpful alternative for these enterprises. In    this way, that an inexperienced project manager can define the management    process that best fits with a particular project is not an easy task. Thus,    this paper introduces the metamodeling approach in order to help project    managers to define a process for managing a software project. Therefore, with    the aim to validate its feasibility an add-in program was developed as a part    of a case study. The achieved results show an important reduction in    project\u2019s effort and time needed to develop a new software product.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1155"]}

The goal of this initiative is to develop high quality software products; however, some difficulties related to the learning process can be found in the dynamics interactions of the professional teams within the organization. A potential cause for these difficulties can be attributed to the use and implementation of teaching methodologies with lower levels of team member motivation. Gamification offers a possible solution for these deficiencies providing more thought-provoking environments for the learning experience. In this paper we propose a teaching instrument based on the principles of gamification to achieve a required level of motivation in teams involved in process improvement. Thus, motivation makes possible a successful implementation of the continuous improvement cycle in software development organizations.\u00a9 2014 AISTI.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1155"]}

However, despite these efforts they still encounter difficulties in their process deployment throughout the organization. This is because the vast majority of these efforts focus more on the technical aspects, bypassing the human aspects. There is a set of factors that influence the successful deployment of new or modified processes.

This paper addresses an organizational proposal that establishes a multi-model workflow in order to implement specific practices of the Solicitation and Supplier Agreement Development (SSAD) process area of CMMI-ACQ model. To achieve this, the Organization of the Acquisition Processes (OAP) procedure is implemented. OAP have helped to determine the implementation sequences of the acquisition processes areas at maturity level 2. Once the sequence is obtained, the explicit dependencies and prioritization of the practices within the SSAD process area are analyzed, in order to establish the workflow and its multi-model environment.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1155"]}
