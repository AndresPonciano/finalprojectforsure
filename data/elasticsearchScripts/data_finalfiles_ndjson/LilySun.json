{"title": "Role of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 in regulation of renal lipid metabolism and glomerulosclerosis in diabetes mellitus\n", "abstract": " Diabetic renal disease is associated with lipid deposits in the kidney. The purpose of our study was to determine whether there is altered regulation of the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) in the diabetic kidney and whether SREBPs mediate the abnormal renal lipid metabolism and diabetic renal disease. In streptozotocin-induced diabetes in the rat, there were marked increases in SREBP-1 and fatty acid synthase (FAS) expression, resulting in increased triglyceride (TG) accumulation. Treatment of diabetic rats with insulin prevented the increased renal expression of SREBP-1 and the accumulation of TG. The role of hyperglycemia in the up-regulation of SREBP-1 was confirmed in renal cells cultured in a high glucose media. High glucose induced increased expression of SREBP-1a and -1c mRNA, SREBP-1 protein, and FAS, resulting in increased TG content.

However, the signaling pathways governing NF\u03baB regulation and function in the brain are poorly understood. We identify complement protein C3 as an astroglial target of NF\u03baB and show that C3 release acts through neuronal C3aR to disrupt dendritic morphology and network function. Exposure to A\u03b2 activates astroglial NF\u03baB and C3 release, consistent with the high levels of C3 expression in brain tissue from AD patients and APP transgenic mice, where C3aR antagonist treatment rescues cognitive impairment. Therefore, dysregulation of neuron-glia interaction through NF\u03baB/C3/C3aR signaling may contribute to synaptic dysfunction in AD, and C3aR antagonists may be therapeutically beneficial.", "num_citations": "318\n", "authors": ["1451"]}

The assumption that the use of IT is necessary in any business is almost taken for granted. It can be witnessed that continual investments in IT have been made to sustain the productivity in industry. However, it has been widely observed that there is often a gap between an operational IT system and current business requirements in an organisation. An IT system, that at one time is highly supportive, after an initial period of time, could impose constraints to business operations, and could be regarded as a legacy system. Such a problem may be caused by a number of factors. One is that IT systems and business processes are not treated as one integral unit and they are designed separately. Calibration and adjustment of IT and business systems can overcome some of the problem, but sometimes more costly exercises such as process re-engineering or re-development of the IT system have to be involved. Many research communities such as computing and management sciences have made great effort in searching for a solution, through investigation of flexible architecture of IT systems, evolutionary information systems and co-evolution of IT systems and business processes.The co-design of business and IT systems is an approach towards this direction. When an IT system is viewed as a part of the business organisation, and both the IT and business systems are designed in the same time, the gap between them will be minimised.

A gradual increase in size-resolved activation ratio (AR) with particle diameter (Dp) suggests that aerosol particles have different hygroscopicities. During pollution events, the activation diameter (Da) measured at low supersaturation (SS) was significantly increased compared to background conditions. An increase was not observed when SS was > 0.4%. The hygroscopicity parameter (\u03ba) was ~ 0.31\u20130.38 for particles in accumulation mode under background conditions. This range in magnitude of \u03ba was ~ 20%, higher than \u03ba derived under polluted conditions. For particles in nucleation or Aitken mode, \u03ba ranged from 0.20\u20130.34 for background and polluted cases. Larger particles were on average more hygroscopic than smaller particles. The situation was more complex for heavy pollution particles because of the diversity in particle composition and mixing state.

Several molecular imaging studies have investigated alterations in 5-HT1A receptors in patients with depression using positron emission tomography and have reported conflicting results. We performed a meta-analysis of studies investigating the relationship between depression and 5-HT1A binding. We conducted a comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, ScienceDirect, Scopus and Springer databases for relevant studies published between January 1999 and October 2015. The meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. Ten studies were included, comprising 218 patients with depression and 261 healthy controls. The results of these studies indicated a reduction in 5-HT1A receptors in mesiotemporal cortex, yielding a summary effect estimate of -0.8 (95\u00a0% CI \u22121.36, \u22120.24). Smaller reductions were reported in 5-HT1A receptor binding in the hippocampus, raphe nuclei, insular, anterior cingulate cortex and occipital cortex of people with depression.

The algorithm is based on a simulated annealing method, and operates on different fluids at the same time to achieve the best average results. A 14-term EOS is developed based on this algorithm that has good accuracy for selected non-polar and polar fluids.

The S/N values were measured in vivo and with homogeneous phantoms and compared to commercial 3 in receive and quadrature head coils. RESULTS: At a depth of 4-5 cm, phantom studies yielded S/N improvements of a factor of 1.26-1.37 with the large array compared to the 3 in coil and 2.33-1.74 compared to the head coil. Similar improvements (1.16 and 2.37) were obtained in inner ear images. No further improvement was achieved at this depth with the small array. At a depth of 8 cm, phantom studies yielded similar S/N for the quadrature head coil and two bilaterally placed large array coils, while a factor of 1.27 was obtained in brainstem images.

Methodology/Principal Findings We identified a tag SNP for the CCL2/MCP-1 gene (rs4586 C/T). In order to understand whether this SNP may serve to evaluate the contribution of the CCL2 gene to the expression of TB disease, we further analysed distribution of its alleles and genotypes in 301 TB cases versus 338 non-infected controls (all BCG vaccinated) representing a high-risk pediatric population of North China. In the male TB subgroup, the C allele was identified in a higher rate (P = 0.045), and, acting dominantly, was found to be a risk factor for clinical TB (P = 0.029). Homozygous TT genotype was significantly associated with lower CSF mononuclear leukocyte (ML) counts in patients with tuberculous meningitis (TBM) (P = 0.001).  Conclusions/Significance The present study found an association of the CCL2 tag SNP rs4586 C allele and pediatric TB disease in males, suggesting that gender may affect the susceptibility to TB even in children. The association of homozygous TT genotype with decreased CSF mononuclear leukocyte (ML) count not only suggests a clinical significance of this SNP, but indicates its potential to assist in the clinical assessment of suspected TBM, where delay is critical and diagnosis is difficult.", "num_citations": "40\n", "authors": ["1451"]}

With a contrast, the unreinforced aluminum at elevated temperature showed progressively cyclic softening behavior without initial hardening.(2) The cyclic stress response characteristics of the composite were different from that of its unreinforced matrix at room temperature. In spite of the initial hardening, the composite showed progressive softening in most of the fatigue life. At elevated temperature the composite also displayed continuous cyclic softening behavior. The reason for the softening behavior probably was that the dislocation tangles in the composite specimen with a likely work-hardened status was not stable and could be changed under a cyclic loading.(3) The SiCp/Al composite and the unreinforced matrix followed the Coffin-Manson law.

They applied MILP method to search integral distinguisher based on division property, and used it to analyze six lightweight block ciphers. Later on, Sun et al. handled the feasibility of MILP-aided bit-based division property for primitives with non-bit-permutation linear layers. Although MILP-aided bit-based division property has gave many perfect results since its appearance, there still are many left problems when we want to develop its further applications. In this paper, we focus on the feasibility of MILP-aided bit-based division property for ARX-based primitive. More specifically, we consider the construction of MILP models for some components of ARX-based structure. Firstly, the Modulo model is proposed by using its iterated expression and introducing some auxiliary variables. Then, to propagate the operations of AND and OR with a constant (or a subkey), we prove that the known-region deduced by the input division property is always included in the known-region derived from the output division property, which allows us to ignore these operations. Furthermore, with its help, we also handle the Modulo operation with a constant (or a subkey). As a result, these new models are exploited to search integral distinguishers for some ARX-based block ciphers. For HIGHT and LEA, the lengths of the distinguishers both are improved by one round.

Significant carbide formation at 573\u00a0K, and therefore less carbon to stabilize RA, overcomes the increase in austenite stability due to the decrease in the temperature-dependent chemical driving force for the martensite\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "29\n", "authors": ["1451"]}

Factors tested included type of activator, persulfate concentration, number of persulfate applications, and reaction time. Probe chemicals were used to study efficiency of the persulfate oxidation mechanism. The best activation method used Fe2+, which achieved 40.8% TPH degradation at 24 h with an initial TPH concentration of 14,432.5 mg/kg. For alkaline (high pH) and hydrogen peroxide activation treatments, TPH degradation efficiencies were 35.2% and 21%, respectively. Thermal activation efficiency was relatively low (15.6%). Kinetic experiments demonstrated that the oxidation reaction was substantially completed within 60 min. A one-time addition of persulfate was superior to multiple applications. The addition of probe compounds produced sulfate radicals, hydroxyl radicals, and reductants.

The characterization of genomic variation between and within non-human primate species could advance the development of genetically defined non-human primate disease models. However, non-human primate specific reagents that would expedite such research, such as exon-capture tools, are lacking. We evaluated the efficiency of using a human exome capture design for the selective enrichment of exonic regions of non-human primates. We compared the exon sequence recovery in nine chimpanzees, two crab-eating macaques and eight Japanese macaques. Over 91% of the target regions were captured in the non-human primate samples, although the specificity of the capture decreased as evolutionary divergence from humans increased. Both intra-specific and inter-specific DNA variants were identified; Sanger-based resequencing validated 85.4% of 41 randomly selected SNPs. Among the short indels identified, a majority (54.6%\u201377.3%) of the variants resulted in a change of 3 base pairs, consistent with expectations for a selection against frame shift mutations. Taken together, these findings indicate that use of a human design exon-capture array can provide efficient enrichment of non-human primate gene regions.

For the specimens from this type, characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) could generally be isolated by demagnetization temperatures larger than 600\u2103; we assigned this ChRM as component A; whilst magnetite is the predominant magnetic mineral of the second type; progressive demagnetization yielded another ChRM (component B) with unblocking temperatures of 550~ 570\u2103.

Compared with red and green light, the growth rate of Skeletonema costatum under blue light is higher within saturated light intensity, and saturated light intensity of LED monochromatic light is lower under blue light and higher under green light.

The individual and combined effects of the sulfonylurea herbicide nicosulfuron and the safener isoxadifen-ethyl on the growth and selected physiological processes of maize were evaluated. Bioassays showed that the EC50 values of nicosulfuron and nicosulfuron plus isoxadifen-ethyl for maize cultivar Zhengdan958 were 18.87 and 249.28 mg kg-1, respectively, and were 24.8 and 275.51 mg kg-1, respectively, for Zhenghuangnuo No. 2 cultivar.

{"title": "Multi target pigs tracking loss correction algorithm based on Faster R-CNN\n", "abstract": " In order to solve the problem that target tracking frames are lost during the visual tracking of pigs, this research proposed an algorithm for multi target pigs tracking loss correction based on Faster R-CNN. The video of live pigs was processed by Faster R-CNN to get the object bounding box. Then, the SURF and background difference method were combined to predict whether the target pig will be occluded in the next frame. According to the occlusion condition, the maximum value of the horizontal and vertical coordinate offset of the bounding box in the adjacent two frames of the frame image in continuous N (N is the value of the video frame rate) were calculated. When bounding boxes in a video frame are merged into one bounding box, this maximum value was used to correct the current tracking frame offset in order to achieve the purpose of solving the tracking target loss problem. The experiment results showed that the success rate range of RP Faster-RCNN in the data set was 80%-97% while in term of Faster-RCNN was 40%-85%. And the average center point error of RP Faster-RCNN was 1.46 lower than Faster-RCNN which was about 2.60. The new algorithm was characterized by good robustness and adaptability, which could solve the problem of missing tracking target and accurately track multiple targets when the targets occlude each other.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["1451"]}

The commercially available high-power LED light bulbs often come with a bulky heatsink to keep the temperature of the light bulb in a reasonable range. Unfortunately, the heatsink designs of most of the commercial products are not optimized in terms of cooling efficiency, dimension, and material cost. Indeed, optimization of the heatsink design is a time-consuming and sophisticated process. It requires a powerful computational fluid dynamics tool to perform computer simulation. With the aid of computer simulation based on a simple heat conduction model together with some measurement results, this work presents a rapid evaluating tool for predicting the peak temperature of a heatsink by using the concept of effective heat conductivity.

{"title": "New leak element using anodic aluminum oxide\n", "abstract": " A leak element has been developed based on anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) by means of the shadow coating technique. The gas flow through the leak element can exhibit the molecular flow in the pressure range from high vacuum to atmospheric pressure for helium and other heavy gases, since the AAO is made of multi tubes with the diameter of about 70\u00a0nm. The shadow coating technique could achieve a specific number of tubes on AAO to satisfy the conductance required for vacuum applications. Some key characteristics of molecular flow are demonstrated according to the conductance measurement using difference method. The flow rate of any other test gases introduced in to the vacuum chamber can be predictable with the known flow rate of helium through the fabricated leaks.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1451"]}

This is thought to be the underlying mechanism for a form of synaptic plasticity that involves changes in the expression of synaptic AMPA type glutamate receptors. Phosphorylation of eEF2 by Ca/calmodulin-dependent eEF2 kinase reduces the activity of eEF2, and this is prevented by a commonly used eEF2 kinase inhibitor, NH125. Here we show that 10\u00a0\u03bcM NH125 increased the expression of synaptic GluA2-containing receptors in mouse cerebellar stellate cells and this was prevented by a protein synthesis inhibitor. However NH125 at 10\u00a0\u03bcM also reduced the level of CPEB3, a protein that is known to bind to GluA2 mRNA and suppress GluA2 (also known as GluR2) synthesis. In contrast, a low concentration of NH125 lowered the peEF2 level, but did not alter CPEB3 expression\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1451"]}
{"title": "Determination of benefits of cochlear implantation in children with auditory neuropathy\n", "abstract": " Background Auditory neuropathy (AN) is a recently recognized hearing disorder characterized by intact outer hair cell function, disrupted auditory nerve synchronization and poor speech perception and recognition. Cochlear implants (CIs) are currently the most promising intervention for improving hearing and speech in individuals with AN. Although previous studies have shown optimistic results, there was large variability concerning benefits of CIs among individuals with AN. The data indicate that different criteria are needed to evaluate the benefit of CIs in these children compared to those with sensorineural hearing loss. We hypothesized that a hierarchic assessment would be more appropriate to evaluate the benefits of cochlear implantation in AN individuals.   Methods Eight prelingual children with AN who received unilateral CIs were included in this study. Hearing sensitivity and speech recognition were evaluated pre- and postoperatively within each subject. The efficacy of cochlear implantation was assessed using a stepwise hierarchic evaluation for achieving: (1) effective audibility, (2) improved speech recognition, (3) effective speech, and (4) effective communication.   Results The postoperative hearing and speech performance varied among the subjects. According to the hierarchic assessment, all eight subjects approached the primary level of effective audibility, with an average implanted hearing threshold of 43.8 \u00b1 10.2 dB HL. Five subjects (62.5%) attained the level of improved speech recognition, one (12.5%) reached the level of effective speech, and none of the subjects (0.0%) achieved effective communication.

Dealing with the adverse impact of perturbation in coal quality, however, is still a challenge to be resolved. In this paper, a 300MW drum-boiler unit model is first established and verified by experimental data, for the purpose of DEB and calorific value flexibility study. Unlike conventional measurement correction methods, the heat value variation is considered here as a part of the internal disturbance, which is estimated and compensated in an improved active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) structure. The proposed control strategy brings a novel design concept for a critical problem of heat variation in any coal-fired power plant.

The results indicated that the occurrences of drought showed distinct seasonal and regional features. In the view of growth stage, drought occurred with high frequency at the seedling stage and the frequency decreased evidently at afterwards growth stages. Slight drought happened in higher frequency than moderate and severe drought. The main cause of drought was the seasonal distribution characteristics of precipitation. In the view of spatial scale, the occurrence frequency of drought for different degrees reduced gradually from west to east. The most frequent areas of drought were northwestern of Liaoning province, western of Jilin province and southwest of Heilongjiang province, respectively. For interdecadal variation characteristics, drought frequency decreased from 1960s to 1980s, increased slightly in the early of 1990s and increased apparently after the middle of 1990s, especially increased dramatically from 2000 to 2004.

The results showed that MBT can be efficiently degraded within four minutes. More importantly, the oxidative activities of different manganese dioxides were influenced by a combination of factors including BET, Eh, AOS, and pHpzc. Manganese dioxides synthesized by the comproportionation method (CM) or liquid-phase oxidation method (OM) exhibited oxidative activities for MBT degradation with the order of \u03b4-MnO2 (CM)> \u03b1-MnO2 (CM)> \u03b1-MnO2 (OM)> \u03b3-MnO2 (OM)> \u03b2-MnO2 (OM).

In this study, global radiations and relative sunshine duration from 22 radiometric stations across the Tibetan Plateau during the past 40 years were used to determine the coefficients of Angstrom-Prescott model. Combined with the data of other 116 meteorological stations across the plateau, global radiations were estimated for the recent 40 years. It is found that there is abundant sunshine over the main plateau with the average sunshine duration up to 3000 hours or more, and with a better utilization prospect. During the past 40 years, the high global radiation zone has appeared in the west of the plateau, and has extended to the northeast and southeast, with a northern branch reaching the Inner Mongolia Plateau. Although decadal change of global radiation over the plateau has been inconsistent with surrounding areas, on the whole, the anomaly values of global radiation during the 1960s and 1970s were positive, indicating that the global radiation increased over the plateau during these period. While during the 1980s and 1990s, the anomaly values were negative, showing a global radiation decreasing period. Volcanic activity was the major cause for these phenomena. Global radiation over the plateau increased with relative sunshine duration and altitude but decreased with latitude.

The flow stress-strain and static recrystallisation behaviours of the X-70 steel were studied by monotonic and interrupted hot plane strain compression (PSC) tests. A fraction softening parameter calculated from \"double-hit\" PSC tests has been found to be capable of quick outlining the partial recrystallisation temperature region without complicated microstructure analysis involved. When hot deformed to medium strains (Evm=O.3~0.5) in austenite non-recrystallisation temperature region by forward-reverse torsion tests, simple strain path changes do not impose significant influence on the microstructural evolution of this X-70 steel through continuous cooling phase transformations. The post-deformation cooling rate is the more influential factor which determines the transformation mechanisms and microstructure, therefore mechanical properties of the final products. However, when subjected to large accumulative strains (Evm2.0), the effects of multiple strain path reversals combined with small amplitude of each forward strain are found to be very profound on microstructural evolutions in austenite studied by hot cyclical torsion using two non-transforming model alloys.

The results showed that the TOC removal efficiencies were all fluctuated between 40% and 60% under the condition of different influent pH values. The microelectrolysis can decompose and transform the toxic refractory organic pollutants and increase the BOD5/COD ratio from 0.32 to 0.60, which increased the biodegradability of ABS resin wastewater significantly. When the pH value of influent was 4.0, the BOD5/COD ratio of effluent reached 0.71.

Firstly, a new concept of intuitionistic fuzzy entropy was presented to measure the intuitionism and fuzziness of intuitionistic fuzzy sets, and relevant properties were also discussed. Secondly, to decrease decision effects of uncertain information, a programming model was constructed to determine attribute weights combined with intuitionistic fuzzy entropy. Meanwhile, in the view of membership, non-membership and hesitancy degree, correlation coefficients between objects of the universe and the ideal object were constructed, and according to decision makers' attitude, the optimal decision was obtained by defining the score function. Finally, the article proposed a multiple attribute decision making method on intuitionistic fuzzy information, and the feasibility and effectiveness of the method are verified through a case study of candidates evaluation.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1451"]}

In this study, we examined the expression and function of the LuxS from a pathogenic E. ictaluri strain, J901. J901 was found to produce autoinducer 2 (AI-2) activity that maximized at mid-logarithmic phase and was enhanced by glucose and repressed by high temperature. Consistently, a luxS gene (luxSEi) was identified in J901, whose expressionwas regulated by cell density, glucose, and temperature in a manner similar to that observed with AI-2 activity. Further analysis showed that LuxSEi is a biologically active AI-2 synthase that was able to complement the luxS-defective phenotype of Escherichia coli DH5\u03b1. To examine the functional importance of LuxSEi, a genetically modified variant of J901, J901Ri, was constructed, in which luxSEi expression was blocked by RNA interference. Compared to the wild type, J901Ri was (i) reduced in AI-2 activity to a level of 59% of that of the wild type;(ii) impaired in both planktonic and biofilm growth;(iii) significantly attenuated in the ability to infect cultured fish cells and to cause mortality in infected fish;(iv) unable to induce the expression of certain virulence-associated genes. Addition of exogenous AI-2 failed to rescue the growth defect of J901Ri as free-living cells but restored biofilm production and the expression of virulence genes to levels comparable to those of the wild type.

METHODS: Adult male SD rats were intragastrically pretreated with AAP at a low (50 mg/kg) or high (100 mg/kg) dose once a day for 20 days before operation. Rats intraperitoneally injected with ginkgo biloba extract (EGb671) were taken as positive control. Focal ischemia was achieved by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) on the right side for 60 min. After 24 hrs of reperfusion, the nerve function defects were recorded by Longa's score and the brain infarct sizes were measured by 2, 3, 5-Triphenyl-tetrazolium-chlor (TTC) staining. Apoptotic neurons were detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining after 48 h of reperfusion. The levels of oxidative stress was determined via the mitochondria-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS). RESULTS: AAP treatment decreased Longa's score, brain infarct size, apoptotic neurons and mitochondria-generated ROS in a dose-dependent manner. AAP at 100 mg/kg gave a better performance compared with EGb671 on all parameters examined. CONCLUSION: AAP treatment protected rat brain from focal ischemia/reperfusion injury by its anti-oxidative effect and worked better than EGb671.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1451"]}

In this study, we present LA-ICP-MS U-Pb zircon dating results which shows that the ages of the Youshan granite and the northwestern part of the Pingtian granite are (213.4\u00b13.0) Ma and (238.8\u00b12.2) Ma, respectively. These results indicate that the Youshan granite was formed by the Indosinian magmatism and the Pingtian granite is probably a composite granite batholith formed in the Indosinian and Yanshanian periods. In addition, it is revealed that both granites contain zircons having inherited cores with ages of Archean and 541 Ma~ 1 642 Ma, implying existence of Archean crust as well as Proterozoic crust containing rocks formed by several periods of magmatism in the source. Some of the zircons from the Youshan granite display dark rims (in CL images) with Yanshanian ages, which suggests that the granite was probably affected by hydrothermal fluids during the Yanshanian period. Narrow dark rims of zircons are also observed in the Pingtian granite, suggesting effect of hydrothermal fluids.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1451"]}

In emerging economies, most scholars have paid attention to how multinational enterprises (MNEs) successfully enter and compete effectively in these countries. However, relatively little is known on how firms in emerging economies develop their strategies to survive and thrive in this new world order (Arnold and Quelch, 1998; Li et al., 2006). There has been a debate on whether latercoming international players from emerging economies have varying catchup strategies different from the traditional strategies of MNEs (Dunning, 2006; Mathews, 2006; Narula, 2006). In the strategic behavior of large MNEs, both internationalization and product diversification play a key role. Building on the seminal work of Vernon (1966) and Rumelt (1974), international management scholars have explored the potential explanations for performance difference among MNEs (Stopford and Dunning, 1983; Hitt et al., 1997), and found that MNEs that employ dominant-constrained or related-constrained diversification strategies gain the highest levels of performance. They also found that the degree of internationalization of a MNE is positively correlated to the performance (Geringer et al., 1989). However, strategy management and international business literatures have often ignored the \u201clatecomers\u201d from periphery countries (Mathews, 2006).

So the major form of inorganic carbon is HCO-3. Algae which can utilize bicarbonate as inorganic carbon source become dominant in eutrophic water. Microcystis aeruginosa and Scenedesmus quadricauda both have the ability to use HCO-3. To understand the effects of alkalinity on growth and competition of M. aeruginosa and S. quadricauda, the experiments were conducted on BG11 medium with different concentrations of bicarbonate. The results showed that the two algae both grew well in the separate experiments because they can directly or indirectly use bicarbonate as inorganic carbon source in photosynthesis. The optimal alkalinity for growth of M. aeruginosa was about 2.4 mmol\u00b7 L-1. And a lag phenomenon occurred during the growth beginning of M. aeruginosa at high alkalinity. The density of S. quadricauda cells increased with increasing of bicarbonate levels. In competition experiments, the density of two algae cells both decreased compared to that in separate experiment.

Kaplan-Meier analysis shows that the patients with high SNHG16 expression have poorer disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) than the patients with low SNHG16 expression. Multivariate Cox regression analysis reveals that SNHG16 expression could be regarded as an independent predictor for DFS and OS in NSCLC patients. In vitro experiments show that SNHG16 knockdown inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and SNHG16 overexpression promotes NSCLC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. We further identify and confirm that miR-146a is the target of SNHG16, and SNHG16 functions by targeting miR-146a. Subsequently, MUC5AC, a major mucin in the human respiratory tract correlated with post-operative metastasis and recurrence of NSCLC, is confirmed to be regulated by SNHG16 and miR-146a, and might be involved in the oncogenic activity of SNHG16-miR-146a axis in NSCLC.

{"title": "On the identification of impedance spectroscopy processes of an SOFC under different hydrogen concentrations\n", "abstract": " This paper reports a series of new electrochemical impedance measurements that were performed on an anode supported planar solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) tested at different anode gas conditions and at different applied voltages. This study indicates that impedance spectroscopy can resolve four different processes, as long as one of those processes does not become too large. At open circuit voltage the four processes can be resolved best; however, as a voltage is applied the processes are convoluted and cannot be resolved properly. Two of the processes seem to remain almost unchanged as the fuel conditions are changed and can be attributed to the cathode. The two anode processes change with the fuel conditions and both indicate a dependence on charge transfer and diffusion.

Results obtained showed the plant height, shoot and root biomass of wheat seedlings on average were increased by 5%, 16% and 13.0% respectively after three years of continuous applica tion of straw. Rice and wheat yields were 2.1% to 8.6% and 5.1% to 13.0% respectively higher in straw applied fields than filed with no application of straw (CK). Soil organic matter (OM) content was increased and each OM ingredient reacted discrepantly to straw application. Labile OM increased the most, being 2.5 times higher than initial soil, while total OM increased the least, the increasing ratewas 26% only. Compared with carbon management index (CPMI) of initial soil, soil CPMI of half-amount and total-amount of straw application were increased by 1.52 to 1.94 and 1.22 to 1.99, respectively. In comparison of CK, soil CPMI of half-amount and total-amount of straw application were increased by 67.7% and 72.0% respectively, indicating total-amount application of straw was more effective on improving soil CPMI. The soil CPMI in rice season was significantly lower than that of wheat season. Analysis on the correlation between crop yields and soil OM ingredients suggested labile OM and CPMI were better related to crop yields than total OM did. Consequently, soil labile OM and CPMI are better evaluation indexes than total OM in the view of soil productivity.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1451"]}

The results showed that the OC was the lowest in yield and the CC was the highest, while in quality the OC was the best and the CC was the poorest. The ascending order of the nitrate content of cucumber in the 3 practices was the OC, the SC and the CC, and the descending order of the vitamin C and soluble sugar contents of cucumber was the OC, SC and CC. Their differences in the above indexes were significant. Because the titratable acidity of cucumber had no significant change in the three cultivations, the cucumber of the OC had the highest sugar/acid ratio and so tasted the best. In the soil nutrients, the total nitrogen, alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen, total phosphorus, readily available phosphorus and readily available potassium somewhat decreased in all the three cultivations, except for a slight increase in total nitrogen under the OC.

While the species percent of Cyanobacteria and Chlorophyta decreased to 61.5%, as compared with 76.8% in control. Several diatom species, such as Synedra ulna, Nitzschia denticula, Nitzschia acicularis, Gomphonema constrictum var. capitata, Gomphonema olivaceum, which were not found in control, were observed in the silicate-enriched treatments.

At the late phase of the experiments, algal blooms mainly composed of Microcystis aeruginosa appeared in control but not in the silicate-enriched enclosures. The enrichment of silicate can promote the growth of diatoms and the other algal species and change the dominance of few Cyanobacteria and Chlorophyte species.

These mid-gap states are generated by nonmagnetic impurity bonds introduced by crystal defects, such as dislocations, stack faults, etc. Using the relation between the gap magnitude of the mid-gap state and the strength of the impurity bond, we explain the weak mid-gap spin susceptibility anomaly in the experimental data of LiVGe 2 O 6. We find that the position of the weak anomaly is well explained by assuming that it comes from nonmagnetic defects.

The experimental results indicate that magnetic field enhances the intensities of Li I spectral lines but reduces the Li II spectral lines intensities. In this study, two narrowband filters were placed before the ICCD camera to observe the evolution feature of Li II spectral line (548.39\u00a0nm, 2p3P2,1,0\u00a0\u2192\u00a02s3S1) and Li I spectral line (610.30\u00a0nm, 3d2P3/2, 5/2\u00a0\u2192\u00a02p2P1/2, 3/2), respectively. The plasma dynamic images show that with the magnetic field, the number density of luminous Li atoms is higher, while the number density of luminous Li ions is lower in comparison to the field-free case. The reduced Li II spectral intensities indicate that the quenching rate of Li ions in the excited state is greater than that without the magnetic field.

Recent work suggested that mitral annular tissue velocity measurements could be helpful for assessing left ventricular function. We aim to determine the effect of coronary artery lesion on left ventricular function using tissue Doppler imaging (TDI), and to discuss the role of mitral annular tissue velocity in the diagnosis of coronary heart disease (CHD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Coronary angiographic examinations were conducted for 68 patients with suspected CHD. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), early diastolic mitral flow velocity E, late diastolic mitral flow velocity A, mean systolic (Sa) and mean early diastolic velocity (Ea) of the septal and lateral mitral annulus were measured before the angiographic examination. Patients were grouped according to the number of branches with\u2265 50% stenosis. The control group has 15 individuals. The remaining 53 patients with stenosis in 1, 2 and 3 branches were grouped into 1-Branch, 2-Branch, 3-Branch-Light-Condition and 3-Branch-Heavy-Condition groups, respectively. No significant differences in the other general health parameters of the patients were found. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in LVEF and E/A but in Sa, Ea and E/Ea values between CHD and non-CHD patients. The E/Ea value was significantly elevated in CHD patients, aggravated by this pathological condition. The area bounded by the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve of E/Ea is the largest.

Spraying PBZ increased the pod yield of the cultivars significantly via increasing the pod number per plant, decreasing the pod number per kilogram, and increasing the percentage of double kernel. Spraying PBZ also increased the kernel fat and soluble sugar contents but decreased the kernel protein content to varying degrees, and increased the O/L ratio of high-fat cultivar Hual7 significantly. PBZ increased the kernel fat content while decreased the kernel protein content of Nongda818 significantly, but had little effects on the kernel protein or fat content of the other two cultivars. Spraying PBZ decreased the leaf nitrate reductase activity of the three cultivars at their pod setting stage, and the leaf glutamine synthetase and glutamate dehydrogenase activities at pod setting and filling stages, with the largest decrement for Nongda818 and the smaller one for KB008 and H17. Spraying PBZ decreased the leaf glutamate oxaloacetic transaminase and glutamate pyruvate transaminase activities of the three cultivars at their pod setting and filling stages, illustrating that the decrease of the nitrogen metabolism enzyme activities after spraying PBZ was the main reason of the decreased kernel protein content of the cultivars.

{"title": "Potential application of biogenic silica as an indicator of paleo-primary productivity in East Antarctic lakes\n", "abstract": " We collected two lake sediment cores (MC and DM) from the East Antarctic region for analysis of biogenic silica and other biogeochemical parameters (eg, organic matter, C, N, S, H). Based on synthetically comparative research, we focused on the potential application of biogenic silica (BSi) for the reconstruction of paleo-primary productivity in the East Antarctic lakes. Analytical results showed that a large number of diatoms were well preserved in the freshwater lake sediments, and that concentrations of biogenic silica displayed notable flctuations over diffrent water depths. The content of biogenic silica had a consistent profie over water depth, and this pattern changed with organic matter, reflcting their potential as eco-environmental proxies. Low levels of BSi and organic matter indicated reduction of lake algal production, and corresponded to decreased lake primary productivity.

With aging, both mitochondrial content and protein synthesis declined and free radicals, the by-products of mitochondrial metabolism and their oxidation to lipids, proteins and nuclear acids increased. The age-related declines in mitochondrial function and redox imbalance affect physical function, induce insulin resistance and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, thus, play a major role in regulation of life span. Therefore, mitochondrion may be the most important determinant of life span. Increasing evidence demonstrates that long-term aerobic exercise could prevent age-related diseases and improve life quality of aged people. Exercise may possibly stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis and phase II antioxidant defense system to regulate mitochondrial function and balance of redox system.

METHODS: Thirty female BALB/c mice were randomly divided into normal control, asthma model and treatment groups (10 in each group). The asthmatic mouse model was established via OVA challenge test. Mice in the treatment group were administered with aerosol budesonide (100 \u03bcg/kg) an hour before the OVA challenge test from the 28th day. Mice in the control group were treated with PBS instead of OVA. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to observe thickness of the airway wall. Masson staining was used for examing collagen deposition of lung tissues. Angiogenesis and HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF expression were measured using immunohistochemistry and Western blot. The relationship of airway wall thickness and vessel area to HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF expression was investigated. RESULTS: Vessel area, collagen deposition of lung tissues and airway wall thickness increased in the asthma model group. Levels of HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF were also elevated. Administration of budesonide significantly reduced angiogenesis, collagen deposition of lung tissues and airway wall thickening, as well as expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF. The vessel area and airway wall thickness were positively correlated with expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF. A positive correlation was also found between the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF.

Therefore, a novel computation strategy for zoom tracking curves is proposed. First, a real-time in-focus point is computed by using an image sharpness evaluation operator based on RAW format. Then, the position relations between zoom motor and focus motor are fitted to acquire the two trace curves at the near end and far end of object distances, which are regarded as the upper and lower bounds of trace curves. Finally, both geometric and adaptive zoom tracking methods are combined to be a hybrid algorithm to acquire the curves at some object distances by the method of interpolation. The trace curves for upper and lower bounds are obtained by a gradient operator on a self-developed zoom imaging system, zoom tracking is implemented with acquired trace curves and the image during zoom tracing is acquired. The obtained results show that the image quality of imaging system using proposed approach is improved by 30% as compared with that of the traditional system.

Experimental results show that the compounds synthesized exhibit high birefringence (\u0394n\u2248 0.32), have lower viscosities and smaller temperature dependence at low temperature, comparing with the other relative structure of tolane compounds. These compounds are particularly attractive for reducing the viscosity of liquid crystal materials and achieving fast response times in LCD.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1451"]}
{"title": "The applications of 3S in operational monitoring system of main crops acreage in China\n", "abstract": " Grain production is of great importance to any country, especially to China where nearly two-thirds of the population lives in rural area. Hence, it is meaningful for local and central governments to get accurate information about main crops acreage in time. Remote Sensing Applications Centre (RSAC), subjugating to the Ministry of Agricultural of China, has been working on monitoring the main crops acreage as operational task and research project for several years. In order to get such information timely, RSAC adopts sampling methods to estimate the main crops acreage every year with the help of 3S(RS-remote sensing, GIS-geographic information system, GPS-global positioning system) while the sampling parameters are acquired through GIS based on background data. Besides, RSAC orders appropriate RS images covering sampling units in certain region according to sampling information displayed in GIS\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1451"]}
{"title": "A multi-center study to evaluate the dynamic changes of uterine artery and umbilical artery flow in a normal pregnancy and hypertensive disorders in pregnancy\n", "abstract": " OBJECTIVE: To investigate the dynamic changes of uterine artery and umbilical artery in the first, second, and third trimester of normal pregnancy and hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (HDP). METHODS: A multi-center prospective study was conducted on 1098 women with normal singleton pregnancies at the first prenatal visit in the Second West China Hospital of Sichuan University, First Affiliated Hospital with Nanjing Medical University, Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University, Wuhan Union Hospital Affiliated to Medical School of Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Renji Hospital Affiliated to Medical School of Shanghai Jiao Tong University from April 2005 to July 2006, with the average age of (28.3\u00b13.3). The pulsatility indices (PI), resistance indices (RI) and systolic to diastolic velocity ratios (S/D) of uterine artery and umbilical artery were measured for all subjects in the first (10th-14th gestational weeks), second (20th-26th gestational weeks) and third trimester (30th-36th gestational weeks), respectively. In this longitudinal study, women who developed HDP were classified into HDP group, and the rest into normal pregnancy group. RESULTS:(1) Among the 1098 pregnant women, 44 developed HDP during the index pregnancy, including 20 gestational hypertension, 15 mild pre-eclampsia and 9 severe pre-eclampsia, giving an incidence of 4.17%, and the rest 1054 were normal until delivery.(2) In the normal pregnancy group, the RI, PI and S/D of uterine artery were decreased with the progress of pregnancy (RI: 0.64, 0.57, 0.50; PI: 1.24, 0.98, 0.80; S/D: 3.26, 2.58, 2.20; P< 0.01\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1451"]}
{"title": "The fracture characteristic analysis in Southwest area of Qaidam Basin\n", "abstract": " The Southwest area of Qaidam Basin has property of peripheral foreland basin, it was generated, developed and formed by extruding force from the south, and its evolution history could be divided into 4 stages, the flexure depressing stage, thrusting stage, intensive thrusting stage, and surface slippage folding stage. Based on some characteristics, such as intensity of fault activity, basement's involvement degree and fault deformation, the faults in this paper in Southwest area of Qaidam Basin were divided into the following 4 categories, the basement-involved high angle thrust fault, the basement-involved low angle thrust fault, the adjustable thrust fault and the high angle reverse thrust fault. The basement-involved high angle thrust fault and the basement-involved low angle thrust fault had coupling and synchronized development relationship with the orogeny uplifting and basin subsiding, their fault plane dips\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1451"]}
{"title": "Reform: A framework for malware packer analysis using information theory and statistical methods\n", "abstract": " Malware (malicious software) is a term used to describe computer viruses, Trojan horses, and other pieces of software that are used to attack computer systems. The increasing outbreak of malware in recent years poses a serious security threat to computer networks.Malware writers often obfuscate malware to hinder malware scanners from malicious code detection, ie, to hide the fact that the software is actually malicious. Packing is the most common obfuscation method used by malware writers. Recently, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of new packers and variants of existing ones. Moreover, packers are employing increasingly sophisticated anti-unpacker tricks and obfuscation methods.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1451"]}
{"title": "Evaluation on water resources carrying capacity in Nanjing City using principal components method [J]\n", "abstract": " Water resources carrying capacity is a comprehensive indicator changing with the development of society, economy, and science and technology. We apply principal component method to evaluate water resources carrying capacity in Nanjing City according to 9 economic development indicators from 1998 to 2008; 3 principal components which affect the dynamic changes of water resources carrying capacity are selected, including: fixed assets and household consumption, population, water resources development and utilization. Adopting the contribution ratios of three principal components as weight in combination with their scores, a comprehensive evaluation on water resources carrying capacity of Nanjing City is conducted. The results show that Nanjing water resources carrying capacity from 1998 to 2008 was declining, however, the utilization rate was relatively low with some surplus carrying capacity.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1451"]}
