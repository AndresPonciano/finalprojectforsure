We used satellite\u2010tracking and mass change during incubation to investigate the influence of sexual size dimorphism, in terms of the intersexual food competition hypothesis, on foraging and fasting strategies of northern giant petrels at South Georgia. Females foraged at sea whereas males foraged mainly on the South Georgia coast, scavenging on seal and penguin carcasses. Foraging effort (flight speed, distance covered, duration of foraging trips) was greater for females than for males. In contrast, foraging efficiency (proportionate daily mass gain while foraging) was significantly greater for males than for females. Females were significantly closer to the desertion mass threshold than males and could not compensate for the mass loss during the incubation fast while foraging, suggesting greater incubation costs for females than for\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "293\n", "authors": ["901"]}

We assessed differences in the deviation of the Optimal AFR (i.e., the species\u2010specific AFR associated with the highest LRS) from the age at sexual maturity, considering potential effects of life history as well as social and ecological factors. Most individuals adopted the species\u2010specific Optimal AFR and both the mean and Optimal AFR of species correlated positively with life span. Interspecific deviations of the Optimal AFR were associated with indices reflecting a change in LRS or survival as a function of AFR: a delayed AFR was beneficial in species where early AFR was associated with a decrease in subsequent survival or\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "31\n", "authors": ["901"]}

The emergence of pre-mating barriers is often the precursor to complete reproductive isolation. However, in recently diverged species, pre-mating barriers may be incomplete, leading to hybridization between seemingly distinct taxa. Here we report results of a long-term study at Bird Island, South Georgia, of the extent of hybridization, mate fidelity, timing of breeding and breeding success in mixed and conspecific pairs of the sibling species, Macronectes halli (northern giant petrel) and M. giganteus (southern giant petrel). The proportion of mixed-species pairs varied annually from 0.4\u20132.4% (mean of 1.5%), and showed no linear trend with time. Mean laying date in mixed-species pairs tended to be later than in northern giant petrel, and always earlier than in southern giant petrel pairs, and their breeding success (15.6%) was lower than that of conspecific pairs. By comparison, mixed-species pairs at both Marion and Macquarie islands always failed before hatching. Histories of birds in mixed-species pairs at Bird Island were variable; some bred previously or subsequently with a conspecific partner, others subsequently with a different allospecific partner, and some mixed-species pairs remained together for multiple seasons. We also report the first verified back-crossing of a hybrid giant petrel with a female northern giant petrel. We discuss the potential causes and evolutionary consequences of hybridization and back-crossing in giant petrels and summarize the incidence of back-crossing in other\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "26\n", "authors": ["901"]}

Laying date has advanced over the last three decades. A mean\u2010centering analysis demonstrated that this pattern was driven by within\u2010individual changes as opposed to appearance or disappearance of phenotypes.

Immature birds (up to age 7 years) formed only 9% of the total; this may reflect relative absence from the area but might also relate to their subordinate status to adults at fishing vessels.

This model is a development of earlier ones used in the South Georgia Integrated Study Region and incorporates new features, allowing for seasonal variation in predator weight (and hence energy requirements), diet composition and prey energy content. Specimen outputs are provided, illustrating the changes produced by using these new sub-models. Results of initial sensitivity analyses indicate particular sensitivity to estimation of metabolic energy requirements. The system is directly applicable also to fur seals and could be modified to incorporate phocid seal data, when available. Prey categories are readily modifiable to sub-divide krill into sexes and maturity stages. With existing empirical data on breeding population size, diet, activity-specific energy requirements and foraging ranges, it is possible to make realistic estimates of krill consumption of penguins and fur seals during their breeding seasons within specified areas.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["901"]}

The radio telemetry study of Grey Plovers confirmed that, on Seal Sands, some birds defended low water feeding territories, whilst others were non-territorial. This behaviour was maintained both diurnally and nocturnally, with territorial birds defending the same areas at night as by day. However territorial birds occasionally vacated their territories to forage on other areas at Teesmouth. Multivariate statistical methods characterised the conditions under which these birds changed foraging locations. The low-water time budgets of territorial birds were determined for both diurnal and nocturnal periods. No statistical differences could be found between these two budgets. The birds spent an extremely high (in excess of 90%) percentage of time foraging over the low water observation period. The diurnal low water time budget of non-territorial individuals was also determined and compared with that of territorial birds. The calorific intake rates of territorial birds during the daylight hours showed significant seasonal changes, characterised by a rise to a mid-winter peak, followed by a steady decline to mid March. This pattern may have been influenced by the temperature on the day of measurement. Respirometric measurements on Grey Plovers produced an estimate of their fasting metabolic rate, together with values for lower critical temperature and the rate of increase of metabolic rate with\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["901"]}

Much of the development that has occurred now renders protection from the existing beach systems which have typically been altered by development. Coupled with huge populations during summer, the region is of national significance therefore an understanding of coastal impacts is paramount. Analysis of the spatial and temporal variation of beaches along the eastern Coromandel Peninsula from Whangapoua in the north to Whiritoa in the south provided results ranging from single storm events to decadal scale oscillations. Beach similarity was determined by measuring parameters such as beach length, beach connectivity to neighbouring beaches, aspect, and beach slope. The analysis of variability in beach face volumes was undertaken using an extensive beach profile database collected by R. Keith Smith, Ron Ovenden and a monitoring program maintained by Environment Waikato since 1978. The database had a higher-resolution sampling interval from 1996 until present (a maximum sampling frequency of approximately bimonthly). Results showed that short term beach volume changes were explained by the beach classification devised from the Wright and Short (1984) model and available planform morphology data. Intermediate beaches overall had a greater range of variation, but had a higher frequency of low magnitude of change events. Reflective beaches had a higher frequency of large magnitude of change events and subsequently greater short term volume changes.

We used an unusually comprehensive tracking dataset from all major life-history stages (including juvenile stages), weighted according to the proportion of the population they represented (based on demographic models), in order to generate population-level distributions by month. This analysis confirms that the IOTC area is important for grey-headed and wandering albatrosses, and to a lesser extent black-browed albatrosses, with hotspots of overlap with fisheries in the southwest Indian Ocean, between the Prince Edward Islands and South Africa, and in the southeast Indian Ocean. Overlaps were particularly high with fleets from Japan and Chinese Taipei, and to a lesser extent South Korea and Spain, and highest during winter months (May\u2013September; when fishing effort south of 30 S is greatest).
