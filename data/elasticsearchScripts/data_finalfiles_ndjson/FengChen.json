{"title": "Simulated surface tensions of common water models\n", "abstract": " Initial simulated values of the surface tension for the SPC/E water model have indicated excellent agreement with experiment. More recently, differing values have been obtained which are significantly lower than previous estimates. Here, we attempt to explain the differences between the previous studies and show that a variety of simulation conditions can affect the final surface tension values. Consistent values for the surface tensions of six common fixed charge water models (TIP3P, SPC, SPC/E, TIP4P, TIP5P, and TIP6P) are then determined for four temperatures between 275 and 350K. The SPC/E and TIP6P models provide the best agreement with experiment.", "num_citations": "189\n", "authors": ["1966"]}
{"title": "5-Arylidenethioxothiazolidinones as Inhibitors of Tyrosyl\u2013DNA Phosphodiesterase I\n", "abstract": " Tyrosyl\u2013DNA phosphodiesterase I (Tdp1) is a cellular enzyme that repairs the irreversible topoisomerase I (Top1)\u2013DNA complexes and confers chemotherapeutic resistance to Top1 inhibitors. Inhibiting Tdp1 provides an attractive approach to potentiating clinically used Top1 inhibitors. However, despite recent efforts in studying Tdp1 as a therapeutic target, its inhibition remains poorly understood and largely underexplored. We describe herein the discovery of arylidene thioxothiazolidinone as a scaffold for potent Tdp1 inhibitors based on an initial tyrphostin lead compound 8. Through structure\u2013activity relationship (SAR) studies we demonstrated that arylidene thioxothiazolidinones inhibit Tdp1 and identified compound 50 as a submicromolar inhibitor of Tdp1 (IC50 = 0.87 \u03bcM).

{"title": "Theory and computer simulation of solute effects on the surface tension of liquids\n", "abstract": " A complete description of the thermodynamics of planar mixed solute\u2212solvent interfaces suitable for the analysis of computer simulation data is provided. The approach uses surface probability distributions to characterize the interface regions, coupled with radial distribution functions and the Kirkwood\u2212Buff theory of solutions to characterize the bulk solution properties. The approach is then used to understand the relationship between changes in the surface tension, the degree of surface adsorption or depletion, and the bulk solution properties of two aqueous solute systems. The first, aqueous NaCl solutions, provides an example of a surface excluded solute. The second, aqueous methanol solutions, provides an example of a surface adsorbed solute.

{"title": "Self-assembled nanoparticle of common food constituents that carries a sparingly soluble small molecule\n", "abstract": " A previously reported nanoparticle formed through the self-assembly of common food constituents (amylose, protein, and fatty acids) was shown to have the capacity to carry a sparingly soluble small molecule (1-naphthol) in a dispersed system. Potentiometric titration showed that 1-naphthol locates in the lumen of the amylose helix of the nanoparticle. This finding was further supported by calorimetric measurements, showing higher enthalpies of dissociation and reassociation in the presence of 1-naphthol. Visually, the 1-naphthol-loaded nanoparticle appeared to be well-dispersed in aqueous solution. Molecular dynamics simulation showed that the self-assembly was favorable, and at 500 ns, the 1-naphthol molecule resided in the helix of the amylose lumen in proximity to the hydrophobic tail of the fatty acid. Thus, sparingly soluble small molecules, such as some nutraceuticals or drugs, could be incorporated\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["1966"]}

Here, changes in soluble zein conformation were evaluated as the protein self-assembles in increasingly hydrophilic solvents to the concentration just before aggregation and precipitation. Circular dichroism spectra of zein showed that \u03b1-helix structures decrease in favor of random coil and \u03b2-sheets with increases in water content in an ethanol-water system, similar to observations of zein when it becomes viscoelastic in dough systems. This was further supported by changes in Thioflavin T fluorescence emission spectra and intrinsic viscosity measurements.

A total of 36 volatile compounds of the mangosteen wines were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-pulsed flame photometric detection. A total of 35 odour-active compounds were identified by gas chromatography-olfactometry analysis and by the detection frequency (DF) method. The compounds with high DF values included ethyl octanoate, ethyl hexanoate and 3-methyl-2-butene-1-thiol. Principal component analysis was used to characterise the differences of the flavour profiles of those mangosteen wines.
