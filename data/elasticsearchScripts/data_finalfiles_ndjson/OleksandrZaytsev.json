{"title": "Towards Exploratory Data Analysis for Pharo\n", "abstract": " Data analysis and visualizations techniques (such as split-apply-combine) make extensive use of associative tabular data-structures that are cumbersome to use with common aggregation APIs (for arrays, lists or dictionaries). In these cases a fluent API for querying associative tabular data (like the ones provided by Pandas, Mathematica or LINQ) is more appropriate for interactive exploration environments. In Smalltalk despite the fact that many important analysis tools are already present (for eg, in the PolyMath library), we are still missing this essential part of the data science toolkit. These specialized data structures for tabular datasets can provide us with a simple and powerful API for summarizing, cleaning, and manipulating a wealth of data-sources that are currently cumbersome to use. In this paper we introduce the DataFrame and DataSeries collections-that are specifically designed for working with structured\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2142"]}
