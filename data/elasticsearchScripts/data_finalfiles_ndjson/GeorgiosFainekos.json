However, an automated vehicle may not be able to avoid all collisions, e.g., collisions caused by other vehicles. Hence, it is important for the system developers to understand the boundary case scenarios where an autonomous vehicle can no longer avoid a collision. In this paper, an automated test generation approach that utilizes Rapidly-exploring Random Trees is presented to explore these boundary scenarios. An important advantage of the approach is the openness of the test scenarios: one can set the road geometry and the number of adversarial objects and let the system search for interesting trajectories and environment parameters. A cost function is proposed which guides the test generation toward almost-avoidable collisions or near-misses.", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["1038"]}

{"title": "An introduction to multi-valued model checking\n", "abstract": " Nowadays computer systems have become ubiquitous. Most of the resources in the development of such systems, and especially in the fail-safe ones, are allocated into the simulation and verification of their behavior. One such automated method of verification is model checking. Given a mathematical description of the real system and a specification usually in the form of temporal logics, a model checker verifies whether the specification is satisfied on the model of the system. Recently, a multi-valued extension to the classical model checking has been proposed. In this approach both the model of the system and the specification take truth values over lattices with more then just two values. Such an extension enhances the expressive power of temporal logics and allows reasoning under uncertainty. Some of the applications that can take advantage of the multi-valued model checking are abstraction techniques, reasoning about conflicting viewpoints and temporal logic query checking. In this paper, we present three different approaches to the multi-valued model checking problem. The first is a reduction from multi-valued CTL* to CTL*, the second a multi-valued CTL symbolic model checking algorithm and, finally, a reduction technique from multi-valued \u03bc-calculus to the classical one.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["1038"]}

{"title": "Risk-bounded control using stochastic barrier functions\n", "abstract": " In this letter, we design real-time controllers that react to uncertainties with stochastic characteristics and bound the probability of a failure in finite-time to a given desired value. Stochastic control barrier functions are used to derive sufficient conditions on the control input that bound the probability that the states of the system enter an unsafe region within a finite time. These conditions are combined with reachability conditions and used in an optimization problem to find the required control actions that lead the system to a goal set. We illustrate our theoretical development using a simulation of a lane-changing scenario in a highway with dense traffic.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1038"]}
{"title": "Linear hybrid system falsification with descent\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we address the problem of local search for the falsification of hybrid automata with affine dynamics. Namely, if we are given a sequence of locations and a maximum simulation time, we return the trajectory that comes the closest to the unsafe set. In order to solve this problem, we formulate it as a differentiable optimization problem which we solve using Sequential Quadratic Programming. The purpose of developing such a local search method is to combine it with high level stochastic optimization algorithms in order to falsify hybrid systems with complex discrete dynamics and high dimensional continuous spaces.

In this work, we extend time-based RRTs with Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to generate, safe motion plans in dynamic environments with many pedestrians. Our framework is based upon a human motion prediction model which is well suited for indoor narrow environments. We demonstrate our approach on a high-fidelity model of the Toyota Human Support Robot navigating in narrow corridors.

The elicitation of specifications is handled through a graphical interface. Two debugging algorithms are presented. The first checks for erroneous or incomplete temporal logic specifications without considering the system. The second can be utilized for the analysis of reactive requirements with respect to system test traces. The specification debugging framework is applied on a number of formal specifications collected through a user study. The user study establishes that requirement errors are common and that the debugging framework can resolve many insidious specification errors.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1038"]}

{"title": "Temporal logic control under incomplete or conflicting information\n", "abstract": " Temporal logic control methods have provided a viable path towards solving the single- and multi-robot path planning, control and coordination problems from high level formal requirements. In the existing frameworks, the prevalent assumption is that there is a single stakeholder with full or partial knowledge of the environment or the system. However, this assumption may not be valid in both off-line and on-line temporal logic control problems. That is, multiple stakeholders and inaccurate sources of information may produce a self-contradictory model of the world or the system. Classical control synthesis methods cannot handle non-consistent model environments even though such inconsistencies may not affect the control synthesis problem for a given formal requirement. In this work, we show how such problems can be circumvented by utilizing multi-valued temporal logics and system models.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1038"]}

{"title": "Querying parametric temporal logic properties in model based design\n", "abstract": " One of the advantages of adopting the Model Based Development (MBD) process is that it enables testing and verification at early stages of development. However, it is often desirable to not only verify/falsify certain formal system specifications, but also to automatically explore the properties that the system satisfies. In this work, we present a framework that enables property exploration for Cyber-Physical Systems. Namely, given a parametric specification with multiple parameters, our solution can automatically infer the ranges of parameters for which the property holds/does not hold on the system. In this paper, we consider parametric specifications in Metric Temporal Logic (MTL). Using robust semantics for MTL, the parameter estimation problem can be converted into a Pareto optimization problem for which we can provide an approximate solution by utilizing stochastic optimization methods. We include solutions and algorithms for the exploration and visualization of multi-parameter specifications. The framework is demonstrated on an industrial size, highfidelity engine model and examples from the related literature.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1038"]}
{"title": "Work-in-progress: towards assurance case evidence generation through search based testing\n", "abstract": " Requirements-driven search-based testing (SBT), also known as falsification, has proven to be a practical and effective method for discovering erroneous behaviors in Cyber-Physical Systems. However, SBT techniques do not provide guarantees on correctness if no falsifying behavior is found within the test budget. Hence, the applicability of SBT methods for evidence generation supporting assurance cases is limited. In this work, we make progress towards developing finite-time guarantees for SBT techniques with associated confidence metrics. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach to the F16 GCAS benchmark challenge.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1038"]}
{"title": "Efficient optimization-based falsification of cyber-physical systems with multiple conjunctive requirements\n", "abstract": " Optimization-based falsification, or search-based testing, is a method of automatic test generation for Cyber-Physical System (CPS) safety evaluation. CPS safety evaluation is guided by high level system requirements that are expressed in Signal Temporal Logic (STL). Trajectories from executed CPS simulations are evaluated against STL requirements using satisfaction robustness as a quantitative metric. In particular, robustness is the distance metric between the simulated system trajectory, associated to a specific input, and the known unsafe set, i.e., regions of the search space that violate the requirements. Identification of violations can be formulated as an optimization problem, where inputs that minimize the robustness function are of interest. In fact, an input falsifies a requirement if the associated robustness is negative.

{"title": "Mission Planning for Multiple Vehicles with Temporal Specifications using UxAS\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we present extensions to Unmanned Systems Autonomy Services (UxAS) to handle mission specifications that require a synchronization of task execution. UxAS uses Process Algebra (PA) as a formal language to specify mission requirements for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operations. However, the current implementation of PA in UxAS utilizes assigned semantics which does not guarantee the order of task completion and is unable to provide a mission planning required vehicle-synchronization. To enable the capability of UxAS in operating synchronized mission specifications, we introduce a notion of Synchronized Process Algebra (SPA) which extends PA by adding a synchronized composition operator to the syntax of PA. Such an operator allows us to specify the task\u2019s duration and enforce the next task is executed after the previous one has terminated.

Given a number of numerical computation tasks that must be executed on an embedded computer, the goal is to find a periodic schedule that minimizes the error of the implementation with respect to the ideal system.

We conjecture that the former is undecidable and that the latter is NP-Complete. In view of the previous conjectures, we present a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for the OSTTC problem.
