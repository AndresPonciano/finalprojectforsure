{"title": "Convolutional LSTM network: A machine learning approach for precipitation nowcasting\n", "abstract": " The goal of precipitation nowcasting is to predict the future rainfall intensity in a local region over a relatively short period of time. Very few previous studies have examined this crucial and challenging weather forecasting problem from the machine learning perspective. In this paper, we formulate precipitation nowcasting as a spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem in which both the input and the prediction target are spatiotemporal sequences. By extending the fully connected LSTM (FC-LSTM) to have convolutional structures in both the input-to-state and state-to-state transitions, we propose the convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) and use it to build an end-to-end trainable model for the precipitation nowcasting problem. Experiments show that our ConvLSTM network captures spatiotemporal correlations better and consistently outperforms FC-LSTM and the state-of-the-art operational ROVER algorithm for precipitation nowcasting.", "num_citations": "4748\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

{"title": "Collaborative recurrent autoencoder: Recommend while learning to fill in the blanks\n", "abstract": " Hybrid methods that utilize both content and rating information are commonly used in many recommender systems. However, most of them use either handcrafted features or the bag-of-words representation as a surrogate for the content information but they are neither effective nor natural enough. To address this problem, we develop a collaborative recurrent autoencoder (CRAE) which is a denoising recurrent autoencoder (DRAE) that models the generation of content sequences in the collaborative filtering (CF) setting. The model generalizes recent advances in recurrent deep learning from iid input to non-iid (CF-based) input and provides a new denoising scheme along with a novel learnable pooling scheme for the recurrent autoencoder. To do this, we first develop a hierarchical Bayesian model for the DRAE and then generalize it to the CF setting. The synergy between denoising and CF enables CRAE to make accurate recommendations while learning to fill in the blanks in sequences. Experiments on real-world datasets from different domains (CiteULike and Netflix) show that, by jointly modeling the order-aware generation of sequences for the content information and performing CF for the ratings, CRAE is able to significantly outperform the state of the art on both the recommendation task based on ratings and the sequence generation task based on content information.", "num_citations": "103\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

Iterative design schemes are proposed for successively improving the performance of a controller until a satisfactory design is achieved. Specifically, the exact design procedure is based on the generalized Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation of the cost function of nonlinear stochastic systems, and the approximate design procedure for the infinite-time nonlinear stochastic regulator problem, is developed by using the upper and lower bounds of the cost functions. Stability of this problem is also considered. For a given controller, both the upper and lower bounds to its cost function can be obtained by solving a partial differential inequality. These bounds, constructed without actually knowing the optimal controller, are used as measure to evaluate the acceptability of suboptimal controllers. These results establish an approxima-tion theory of optimal stochastic control and provide a practical procedure for selecting effective practical controls for nonlinear stochastic systems.

{"title": "Natural-parameter networks: A class of probabilistic neural networks\n", "abstract": " Neural networks (NN) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various applications. Unfortunately in applications where training data is insufficient, they are often prone to overfitting. One effective way to alleviate this problem is to exploit the Bayesian approach by using Bayesian neural networks (BNN). Another shortcoming of NN is the lack of flexibility to customize different distributions for the weights and neurons according to the data, as is often done in probabilistic graphical models. To address these problems, we propose a class of probabilistic neural networks, dubbed natural-parameter networks (NPN), as a novel and lightweight Bayesian treatment of NN. NPN allows the usage of arbitrary exponential-family distributions to model the weights and neurons. Different from traditional NN and BNN, NPN takes distributions as input and goes through layers of transformation before producing distributions to match the target output distributions. As a Bayesian treatment, efficient backpropagation (BP) is performed to learn the natural parameters for the distributions over both the weights and neurons. The output distributions of each layer, as byproducts, may be used as second-order representations for the associated tasks such as link prediction. Experiments on real-world datasets show that NPN can achieve state-of-the-art performance.", "num_citations": "43\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

Significant metal pollution started ca CE 1550 during a period of increased exploitation of ore resources in Spain. Colder and humid conditions in the Pyrenees during the Little Ice Age may have also favoured Hg and Pb atmospheric deposition in the lake. Therefore, the interplay between increased rainfall (wet deposition) and mining activities in the Iberian Peninsula has driven Hg and Pb AR during the Pre-industrial Period. More recently, the use of leaded gasoline in Europe in the mid-20th century may explain the highest Pb AR\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "34\n", "authors": ["1165"]}
{"title": "Transformation of mercury at the bottom of the Arctic food web: An overlooked puzzle in the mercury exposure narrative\n", "abstract": " We show 2008 seasonal trends of total and monomethyl mercury (THg and MeHg, respectively) in herbivorous (Calanus hyperboreus) and predatory (Chaetognaths, Paraeuchaeta glacialis, and Themisto abyssorum) zooplankton species from the Canadian High Arctic (Amundsen Gulf and the Canadian Beaufort Sea) in relation to ambient seawater and diet. It has recently been postulated that the Arctic marine environment may be exceptionally vulnerable to toxic MeHg contamination through postdepositional processes leading to mercury transformation and methylation. Here, we show that C. hyperboreus plays a hitherto unrecognized central role in mercury transformation while, itself, not manifesting inordinately high levels of THg compared to its prey (pelagic particulate organic matter (POM)). Calanus hyperboreus shifts Hg from mainly inorganic forms in pelagic POM (>99.5%) or ambient seawater (>90%) to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "34\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

{"title": "Transient plasma ignition for lean burn applications\n", "abstract": " Delay to ignition, peak pressure and rise time were studied for methane, propane, iso-butane, nbutane and iso-octane with air mixtures as a function of ignition of the fuel by a transient plasma. As compared with conventional spark plug ignited flame, flames ignited by transient plasma exhibited substantially shorter pressure rise times and much shorter ignition delay times (by a factor of approx. 3, averaged over a wide range of equivalence ratio), and higher maximum pressure. Experiments at sub-atmospheric pressure (0.2-1 atm.) for iso-octane/air mixtures also show similar results. Transient plasmas are on average weakly ionized over large volumes, but have locally and temporally highly variable plasma properties, and typically occur during the formative phase of a plasma discharge. The transient plasmas for these studies are the non-equilibrated spatially varying plasmas that exist after initiation of a discharge\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "30\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

As distinguished from prolate silicon, germanium, and tin clusters, amorphouslike lead clusters containing more independent pentagonal bipyramid Pb 7 units are more favorable than octahedral (O h) fragments as n up to 147. On the other hand, covalently bonded Pb 7 units obstruct the electronic delocalization process, ie, the transition from clusters to metallic bulk characters. The average bond length (charge density) within the Pb 7 unit is usually shorter (higher) than that among the Pb 7 units. By tracing two kinds of bond forms in the Pb 7 unit and between Pb 7 units, we find that the melting process begins from the weaker bond between the Pb 7 units.

Solutions of these ODEs in each cell for the transverse-averaged dependent variables are then utilized to develop the difference schemes. The discrete variables are scalar velocities and pressure, averaged over the faces of bricklike cells. The development of the MNIM is different from the conventional nodal method in two ways: (a) it is Poisson-type pressure equation based and (b) the convection terms are retained on the left side of the transverse-integrated equations and thus contribute to the homogeneous part of the solution.

The key idea is to view the secret as an image during the secret-sharing process. If the user's private key is text, we can covert the key text into an image called the original image. Specifically, we first divide the original image into original subimages by the image segmentation. Next, we encode each original subimage by DNA coding. Finally, we train the proposed network to find the key secret-sharing results. Our proposed scheme is not only a significant extension of the GANs but also a new direction for the key secret-sharing technology. The\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

{"title": "Chemical composition of river particulates in eastern China\n", "abstract": " A total of 42 aquatic particulate sample:, (suspended matter and < 63 \u03bcm surficial sediments) was collected from 11 large rivers in eastern China. Contents of both major elements (Al, Si, Ca, Mg, K, Na, Ti, Fe, Mn) and trace elements (Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd, Cr, Co, Ni, V) in the particulate samples were analyzed. The geographic variations of river particulate compositions were studied. The results showed that the Yellow River particulates contained a notably high content of Ca and a low content of Al. Except for the Yellow River, A1 contents in particulates increased from the northern rivers to the southern rivers, while K and Na decreased. Trace elements were relatively enriched in the southern river particulates. The geographic variations seemed to be related to the weathering types and geological background within the river basins. The average composition of river particulates in China was then estimated. Based\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

Sea ice acquires its initial gas content from the pool of dissolved gases in the surface ocean. This is controlled by exchange of gaseous components of the atmosphere with the surface oceanic water, biological activity and inorganic reactions, such as photochemical oxidation and ionization. Much like the dissolved ions in seawater, dissolved gases will also be subject to solute rejection and physical concentration in the residual brine that forms during seawater freezing and is trapped\u2013the small part of it that escapes gravity drainage to the underlying ocean\u2013as inclusions in thermal equilibrium with the ice crystal matrix in sea ice. Again like the dissolved ionic species, the concentrated dissolved gases will be further subject to biological and abiotic reactions, including most prominently the aqueous\u2013gaseous phase transition via gas bubble nucleation controlled by gas solubility, a thermodynamic property of gas interaction with electrolyte solutions. Such reactions will modulate the concentration of the dissolved gases in the sea ice brines away from the effect of the physical concentration mechanism. The gas content and gas composition of sea ice have become a subject of intense investigation by the glaciological and oceanographic communities on account of their potential feedback into the climate system via the influence of gas bubbles on the sea ice albedo due", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

{"title": "Stability analysis of red sandstone bedding slope under rainfall infiltration and dry-wet cycling\n", "abstract": " According to the stability of red sandstone bedding rock slope, a mechanical model is established; the hydraulic effect on slope under rainfall infiltration is calculated. Selecting a typical structural plane, through dry-wet cycling test, strength attenuation law of structural plane is analyzed. Comprehensive considering the rainfall infiltration and dry-wet cycling, the stability analysis of red sandstone bedding slope is analyzed; and the stability attenuation law is achieved. At last, by slope stability monitoring of Yan-Ru expressway, theoretical calculation results are verified. The results show that the hydraulic action is proportional to the water height in rock crack. Under dry-wet cycling, the cohesion of structural surface decays in the form of power function; and the internal frictional angle decays in the form of quadratic function. The slope stability has linear relationship with water height in rock crack and exponential relationship with dry-wet cycling. The dry-wet cycling has a greater influence on slope stability than that on water height in rock crack. Under the combined action of rainfall infiltration and dry-wet cycling, slope stability coefficient reduces by about 66%. Compared with considering single influence factor, the stability coefficient attenuation range has a great increase. The slope stability monitoring results agree well with theoretical results, the validity of theoretical results is further proved.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

In the cold and high-attitude Xizang (Tibetan) Plateau, where aragonite has been commonly found in lacustrine sediments, there is no aragonite, but low-Mg calcite, monohydrocalcite and trace dolomite. The lake receives solutes primarily from surface runoffs and remains fairly constant water chemistry for a long time. The total CaCO3 percentage in sediments could be controlled by evaporation and inflow of detrital materials. The absence of aragonite is unusual when compared to other lacustrine sediments from the Tibetan Plateau. This could be due to low Ca/Mg ratio, low salinity, low Mg and Ca concentration. Monohydrocalcite might precipitate from the lake water mediated by biological activities.

Several morphometric studies have been conducted to investigate the gray matter volume or thickness changes in ALS, whereas the cortical folding pattern remains poorly understood. In the present study, we applied a surface-based local gyrification index (LGI) from high resolution MRI data to quantify the cortical folding in matched samples of 25 ALS patients versus 25 healthy controls. Using resting-state fMRI data, we further conducted seed-based functional connectivity analysis to explore the functional correlate of the cortical folding changes. We found that ALS patients had significantly reduced LGI in right occipital cortex and that abnormality in this region associated with decreased functional connectivity in the bilateral precuneus.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for object recognition and reconstruction based on shape knowledge, which is constructed as a repository of three-dimensional shapes to reinforce the system intelligence. The method employs a feature matching algorithm to find the best matching object in the knowledge base and to implement the reconstruction of the object recognized.

{"title": "On fixed points of linguistic dynamic systems\n", "abstract": " Linguistic dynamic systems (LDS) are dynamic systems whose state variables are generalized from numbers to words. Generally speaking, LDS can model all evolving processes in word domains by using linguistic evolving laws which are naturally the linguistic extension of evolving laws in numbers. There are two kinds of LDS; namely, type-I and type-II LDS. If the word domain is modeled by fuzzy sets, then the evolving laws of a type-I LDS are constructed by applying the fuzzy extension principle to those of its conventional counterpart. On the other hand, the evolving laws of a type-II LDS are modeled by fuzzy if/then rules. Note that the state spaces of both type-I and type-II LDSs are word continuum. However, in practice, the representation of the state space of a type-II LDS consists of finite number while its computation actually involves a word continuum. In this paper, the existence of fixed points of type-II LDS is studied based on point-to-fuzzy-set mappings. The properties of the fixed point of type-II LDS are also studied. In addition, linguistic controllers are designed to control type-II LDS to goal states specified in words.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

As a result, pedestrian trajectory prediction is rather challenging. Most existing trajectory prediction methods tend to focus on just one aspect of these challenges, ignoring the temporal information of the trajectory and making too many assumptions. In this paper, we propose a recurrent attention and interaction (RAI) model to predict pedestrian trajectories. The RAI model consists of a temporal attention module, spatial pooling module, and randomness modeling module. The temporal attention module is proposed to assign different weights to the input sequence of a target, and reduce the speed deviation of different pedestrians. The spatial pooling module is proposed to model not only the social information of neighbors in historical frames, but also the intention of neighbors in the current time.

Considering the case that there are two pools, where only one pool can attack the other pool, we propose an optimal block withholding strategies for pools.

In recent years, the formal safety methods represented by Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) have encouraged low-cost autonomous driving safety research, benefitting from its accurate assessment of safety and clear division of responsibilities. However, how to maintain traffic efficiency while ensuring safety remains a challenge. To address this problem, this paper proposes a formulized negotiation-based lane-changing strategy that makes a trade-off between safety and efficiency.

Methods: The partial solubility parameters for model drug of paclitaxel (PTX) and drug carrier materials of poly (DL-lactide)(PLA) and poly (DL-lactide-co-glycolide)(PLGA) were calculated using the group contribution method (GCM). Then physicochemical analysis of drug-drug carrier material pairs were pursued using classic physicochemical techniques, including Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). Finally, PTX-loaded PEG-PLA and PEG-PLGA copolymer micelles were prepared, respectively, by rotary evaporation method. The drug content in the micelles was determined using HPLC method. Results: The calculation results for the difference of partial solubility parameters between PTX and the two copolymers showed that \u0394\u03b4p (PLA, PTX) \u0394\u03b4p (PLGA, PTX), indicating that PTX was more compatible with PLA than with PLGA.

Nevertheless, once a detection model trained on generic datasets (such as PASCAL VOC and MS COCO) is applied to a specific scene, its precision is limited by the distribution gap between the generic data and the specific scene data. It is difficult to train the model for a specific scene, due to the lack of labeled data from that scene. Even though we manage to get some labeled data from a specific scene, the changing environmental conditions make the pre-trained model perform bad. In light of these issues, we propose a parallel vision approach to scene-specific pedestrian detection.

With wider knowledge coming from multiple users, the selected samples can be more relevant to the target cluster. The challenges of this study are two-folds.

Most previous spatio-temporal based urban traffic flow prediction 3 techniques just pay attention to building the relationship between the adjacent upstream and down-4 stream road segments using various models. While in this paper, we take advantage of the spatial 5 and temporal information from all available road segments in the road network to predict the short-6 term traffic volume accurately. However, the available traffic states can be high-dimensional for 7 high-density or large scale road networks. Therefore, we present a spatio-temporal variable selec-8 tion based support vector regression (VS-SVR) model fed with the high-dimensional traffic data 9 collected from all available road segments.

With the measured pressures in sample tank and reference tank, the gas quantities in free spaces of two tanks are calculated. Once the two tanks are connected, the gas quantities in the free spaces of two tanks vary with time. Therefore, based on data processing, this study obtains the measured curve of accumulated gas desorption quantity with the change of time. The study investigates the desorption characteristics of coal samples which are in same quality but different sizes under different initial coal particles gas pressure. The experiment results show that the reciprocal of accumulated gas desorption amount and time function is in a linear relationship. For the same size coal particles, the higher the initial pressures are, the larger the maximum gas desorption amount are. Under the same initial pressure, the smaller the coal particle size is, the faster the gas desorption rate is. This study provides a significant theoretical basis for the prediction of gas emission amount in coal mine.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

To deal with this issue and to provide guidance for model selection, this paper analyzes several mainstream object detection architectures, including Faster R-CNN, R-FCN, and SSD, along with several typical feature extractors, such as ResNet50, ResNet101, MobileNet_V1, MobileNet_V2, Inception_V2 and Inception_ResNet_V2. By conducting extensive experiments using the KITTI benchmark, which is a commonly used street dataset, we demonstrate that Faster R-CNN ResNet50 obtains the best average precision (AP) (58%) for vehicle and pedestrian detection, with a speed of 8.6 FPS.

{"title": "Associations between MSE and SSIM as cost functions in linear decomposition with application to bit allocation for sparse coding\n", "abstract": " The traditional image quality assessments, such as the mean squared error (MSE), the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), are all based on the absolute error of images. Structural similarity (SSIM) index is another important image quality assessment which has been shown to be more effective in the human vision system (HVS). Although there are many essential differences between MSE and SSIM, some important associations exist between them. In this paper, the associations between MSE and SSIM as cost functions in linear decomposition are investigated. Based on the associations, a bit-allocation algorithm for sparse coding is proposed by considering both the reconstructed image quality and the reconstructed image contrast. In the proposed algorithm, the space occupied by a linear coefficient of a basis in sparse coding is reduced to only 9 to 10 bits, in which 1 bit is used\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1165"]}
{"title": "SCF-Net: Learning spatial contextual features for large-scale point cloud segmentation\n", "abstract": " How to learn effective features from large-scale point clouds for semantic segmentation has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Addressing this problem, we propose a learnable module that learns Spatial Contextual Features from large-scale point clouds, called SCF in this paper. The proposed module mainly consists of three blocks, including the local polar representation block, the dual-distance attentive pooling block, and the global contextual feature block. For each 3D point, the local polar representation block is firstly explored to construct a spatial representation that is invariant to the z-axis rotation, then the dual-distance attentive pooling block is designed to utilize the representations of its neighbors for learning more discriminative local features according to both the geometric and feature distances among them, and finally, the global contextual feature block is designed to learn a global context for each 3D point by utilizing its spatial location and the volume ratio of the neighborhood to the global point cloud. The proposed module could be easily embedded into various network architectures for point cloud segmentation, naturally resulting in a new 3D semantic segmentation network with an encoder-decoder architecture, called SCF-Net in this work. Extensive experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed SCF-Net performs better than several state-of-the-art methods in most cases.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1165"]}
{"title": "Graph attention model embedded with multi-modal knowledge for depression detection\n", "abstract": " With more than 300 million people depressed worldwide annually, depression is a global problem. The goal of depression detection is to improve diagnostic accuracy and availability, leading to faster intervention. The most important and challenging problem here is to design an effective and robust depression detection model. To this end, there are two challenges to overcome: 1) Multi-modal (audio, image, text, etc.) information must be jointly considered to make accurate inferences. 2) Existing deep learning-based work suffers from multi-modal data sufficiency problem. To address these issues, we propose a graph attention model embedded with multi-modal knowledge for depression detection.

This integration was motivated by the characteristics of multi-camera videos distributed in the urban environment, namely, large data volume, sparse distribution and complex spatial\u2013temporal correlation of MCVO, thereby resulting in low efficiency of manual browsing and retrieval of videos. To address the aforementioned drawbacks, on the basis of multi-camera video moving object extraction, this paper first analyzed the characteristics of different video-GIS Information fusion methods and investigated the integrated data organization of MCVO by constructing a spatial\u2013temporal pipeline among different cameras. Then, the conceptual integration model of MCVO and GIS was proposed on the basis of spatial mapping, and the GIS-MCVO prototype system was constructed in this study. Finally, this study analyzed the applications and potential benefits of the GIS-MCVO system, including a GIS-based user interface on video moving object expression in the virtual geographic scene, video compression storage, blind zone trajectory deduction, retrieval of MCVO, and video synopsis. Examples have shown that the integration of MCVO and GIS can improve the efficiency of expressing video information, achieve the compression of video data, rapidly assisting the user in browsing video objects from multiple cameras.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

The unique knowledge structure embedded in this network enables it to carry out adaptive changes of membership functions for both input signal patterns and output control actions, and of fuzzy conjunction operators, then recover these changes separately later.

The most important and challenging problem of visual reasoning is to design an effective and robust visual reasoning model. To this end, there are two challenges to overcome. The first is that textual and visual information must be jointly considered to make accurate inferences about reasoning. The second is that existing deep learning-based works are often too specific to a particular task. To address these issues, we propose a knowledge memory embedding model with mutual modulation for visual reasoning. This approach learns not only knowledge-based embeddings derived from key\u2013value memory network to make the full and joint of textual and visual information, but also exploits the prior knowledge to improve the performance with knowledge\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

{"title": "Webly supervised knowledge embedding model for visual reasoning\n", "abstract": " Visual reasoning between visual image and natural language description is a long-standing challenge in computer vision. While recent approaches offer a great promise by compositionality or relational computing, most of them are oppressed by the challenge of training with datasets containing only a limited number of images with ground-truth texts. Besides, it is extremely time-consuming and difficult to build a larger dataset by annotating millions of images with text descriptions that may very likely lead to a biased model. Inspired by the majority success of webly supervised learning, we utilize readily-available web images with its noisy annotations for learning a robust representation. Our key idea is to presume on web images and corresponding tags along with fully annotated datasets in learning with knowledge embedding. We present a two-stage approach for the task that can augment knowledge through an effective embedding model with weakly supervised web data. This approach learns not only knowledge-based embeddings derived from key-value memory networks to make joint and full use of textual and visual information but also exploits the knowledge to improve the performance with knowledge-based representation learning for applying other general reasoning tasks. Experimental results on two benchmarks show that the proposed approach significantly improves performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods and guarantees the robustness of our model against visual reasoning tasks and other reasoning tasks.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

In order to capture rich edge information and avoid model collapse as much as possible, we consider the learning of GANs as an evolutionary optimization and propose a novel method termed as differential-evolution-based generative adversarial networks (DEGAN) for richer edge detection. In particular, built upon GANs structure, we introduce an improved differential evolutionary algorithm to refine the input of generator, with fitness function evaluated by the discriminator. Experimental results on the well-known BSDS500 and NYUD benchmarks indicate our proposed DEGAN can achieve state-of-the-art performance while retaining a fast speed and validate its simplicity, effectiveness, and efficiency.

{"title": "A multi-scale model integrating multiple features for vehicle detection\n", "abstract": " In traffic video surveillance systems, vehicles with various distances from the camera have different sizes, resolutions, and angles in traffic images. The common multi-scale method, which scales one vehicle template or the input image for detecting vehicles with different sizes, may fail to detect vehicles with various distances from the camera due to the change of the resolution and angle. To deal with this problem, we have proposed a multi-scale model including multiple templates with different scales and features. Our method includes two steps: constructing the multi-scale model and its probability model, and detecting vehicles from traffic images. In the first step, the multi-scale model is constructed by using three templates T 1 , T 2 , T 3  which represent vehicles with the short, medium, and long distance from the camera respectively.

While the publication of six special issues is more dedication to a single topic than we have given to any of our other interests, it is a subject that demands particular attention. If we can judge by current news headlines, the topics of intelligent systems, social movement, and social management are ever relevant and present. For the past few months, world news has been dominated by a series of cyber-enabled or cyber-enhanced social movements: in Tunisia, street demonstrations led to the Jasmine revolution that then influenced its neighboring countries, and in London, protests over a shooting incident culminated in widespread riots. More recently, people have gathered in New York City\u2019s lower Manhattan in reaction to the current US economy and policies for Occupy Wall Street, which has turned into an international movement. All these events have in common the underlying influence of the Internet and its use as a rallying tool, proving itself an effective organizer of social movements.

However, the imperfect bottom-up self-assembly fabrication leads to excessive defects that have become a barrier for achieving reliable computing. In addition, transient errors continue to be a problem. The massive parallelism rendered by nanoscale integration opens up new opportunities but also poses challenges on how to manage such massive resources for reliable and high-performance computing. In this paper, we propose a nanoarchitecture solution to address these emerging challenges. By using dynamic redundancy allocation, the massive parallelism is exploited to jointly achieve fault (defect/error) tolerance and high performance.

The interesting results presented include that: 1. Any possible system deadlock can seriously degrade the system performance even if effective deadlock resolution techniques are available; 2. Conservative use of resource is likely to be the best policy; and 3. Higher resource utilization may not necessarily imply higher system production rates in a resource-sharing environment.

The proposed approach can evaluate the impact of an event, deduce the situation, and provide optimal strategies for decision-making.

With limited sources of cadaveric skulls, traditional methods of using virtual images to study the surgery are difficult for neurosurgeons and students because the surgery requires spatial imagination and good understanding of the patient\u2019s conditions as well as practical experience. The three-dimensional (3D) printing technique has played an important role in clinical medicine due to its advantages of low cost, high-efficiency and customization.OBJECTIVE: CT images are used as the source data of 3D printing. The data obtained directly from the CT machine has limited accuracy, which cannot be printed without processing. Some commercial platforms can help build an accurate model but the cost and customization are not satisfactory. In this situation, a tactile, precise and low-cost 3D model is highly desirable\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

For the sake of saving the material costs, the cutting requirement should be met exactly without producing additional garment components. For reducing the production costs, the number of lays that corresponds to the frequency of using the cutting beds should be minimized. We propose an iterated greedy algorithm for solving the fabric spreading and cutting problem. This algorithm contains a constructive procedure and an improving loop. Firstly the constructive procedure creates a set of lays in sequence, and then the improving loop tries to pick each lay from the lay set and rearrange the remaining lays into a smaller lay set.

However, the heterogeneity of demand patterns among different taxi zones has not been taken into account. To this end, this paper explores zone clustering and how to utilize the inter-zone heterogeneity to improve the prediction. First, based on the pairwise clustering theory, a taxi zone clustering algorithm is designed by considering the correlations among different taxi zones. Then, both the cluster-level and the global-level prediction modules are developed to extract intra- and inter-cluster characteristics, respectively. Finally, a Multi-Level Recurrent Neural Networks (MLRNN) model is proposed by combining the two modules. Experiments on two taxi trip\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

In practice, scene understanding is complicated, and comprises many sub-tasks, so that research of learning multiple tasks simultaneously with a single model is feasible. With the interrelated goals of these two tasks, there is a strong motivation to improve the object detection accuracy with the help of semantic segmentation, and vice versa.

Due to the intrinsic uncertainty and the significant increase in travel demand, in many cases, a traffic system still has to rely on human engineers to cope with the complicated and challenging traffic control and operation problem, which cannot be handled well by the traditional methods alone. Thus, imitating the good working experience of engineers to solve traffic signal control problems remains a practical, smart, and cost effective approach. In this paper, we construct a modelling framework to imitate how engineers cope with complex scenarios through learning from the historical record of manipulations by traffic operators.

{"title": "Stochastic simulation of branch morphological structure in oilseed rape\n", "abstract": " The structure of oilseed rape is complex due to the development patterns of inflorescence: initiate acropetally but expand basipetally. This unique physiological characteristic makes  a big difference in the morphological structure of individual plants in oilseed rape. The time lag between the appearance and elongation of a branch, called \u201cgrowth delay\u201d, needs to be quantified in order to simulate the developmental pattern of oilseed rape. This study computes the time interval between the appearance and expansion of branches by using a growth delay function. Moreover, a stochastic probabilistic model is built to simulate the differences of the numbers of branches, phytomers of the stems and branches within and among plants for four cultivars. Furthermore, model parameters can be estimated using the experimental measurements for four cultivars (ZY18, ZY50, ZS72 and ZS11) with the generalized least square method. The results indicate that the differences of structure among individual plants for different cultivars can be simulated using the stochastic model. This work provides a new and simple method to describe the differences of structure among plants using a stochastic model. This method can simulate the branch development of oilseed rape, which can be combined to a functional-structural model to simulate the growth and development of oilseed rape.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

This paper studies a type of matroids whose augmentations of independent sets have some degree of uniqueness and whose collections of bases are minimal in a sense.

We report unique observations of ikaite in unmelted ice and vertical profiles of ikaite abun-5 dance and concentration in sea ice for the crucial season of winter. Ice was examined from two locations: a 1 m thick land-fast ice site and a 0.3 m thick polynya site, both in the Young Sound area (74\u25e6 N, 20\u25e6 W) of NE Greenland. Ikaite crystals, ranging in size from a few \u00b5m to 700 \u00b5m were observed to concentrate in the interstices between the ice platelets in both granular and columnar sea ice. In vertical sea-ice profiles from both 10 locations, ikaite concentration determined from image analysis, decreased with depth from surfaceice values of 700\u2013900\u00b5molkg\u2212 1 ice (\u223c 25\u00d7 10 6 crystals kg\u2212 1) to bottomlayer values of 100\u2013200\u00b5molkg\u2212 1 ice (1\u20137\u00d7 10 6 kg\u2212 1), all of which are much higher (4\u201310 times) than those reported in the few previous studies. Direct measurements of total alkalinity (TA) in surface layers fell within the same range as ikaite concentration 15 whereas TA concentrations in bottom layers were twice as high. This depth-related discrepancy suggests interior ice processes where ikaite crystals form in surface sea ice layers and partly dissolved in bottom layers.

This effort, to develop and demonstrate a control architecture for Intelligent Vehicles that is deployable within the next 5 to 10 years, was funded by the Arizona State Legislature and administered by the Arizona Department of Transportation. In particular, the research team investigated the following\" new\" concepts as far as Automated Highway Systems and Intelligent Vehicles are concerned:(1) The use of a hierarchical control structure that requires less frequent, and less spatially dense, communication between the traffic operations center and the vehicles, and requires less computational effort for lateral and longitudinal control of the vehicle on the highway; and (2) The use of cheaper sensor technology for establishing vehicle position and implementing feedback control. It was concluded from this project that the technology is ready for affordable intelligent autonomous vehicles. The control of those vehicles is robust and reliable, and requires minimal and affordable additional highway infrastructure. It is anticipated that using intelligent vehicles would increase air quality and decrease energy consumption. Potential legal issues would be major obstacles to the public use of such vehicles.

In this work, we propose to learn from the large scale of web images and corresponding tags without any manual annotations along with limited fully annotated datasets. In particular, inspired by the recent success of webly supervised learning in deep neural networks, we capitalize on readily-available web images with noisy annotations to learn a robust representation for masked faces. Besides, except for the conventional spatial representation learning, we propose to leverage the power of frequency domain to capture the local representative information of unoccluded facial parts.

Due to the complicated non-stationary temporal dynamics in traffic flow time series and spatial dependencies on roadway networks, there is no particular method that is clearly superior to all others. Here, we focus on investigating ensemble learning that benefits from multiple base models, and propose a traffic-condition-aware ensemble approach that acts as a decision maker by stacking multiple predictions based on dynamic traffic conditions. To sense traffic conditions, we apply the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to capture the spatiotemporal patterns embedded in traffic flow. Then, the high-level features extracted by CNN are used to generate weights to ensemble multiple predictions of different models.

In particular, in the proposed FANN, we design a novel block structure consisting of feature attention module, smoothed dilated convolution and local residual learning. The local residual learning allows the less useful information to be bypassed through multiple skip connections. The feature attention module is designed to assign more weight to important features. The smoothed dilated convolution is adopted to enlarge the receptive field without the negative influence of gridding artifacts.

{"title": "Effect of ikaite precipitation on phosphate removal in sea ice\n", "abstract": " Ikaite (CaCO 3\u00b7 6H 2 O) precipitation in sea ice has been shown to affect CO 2 exchange between the atmosphere and ocean. A laboratory study indicates that it could also co-precipitate phosphate from sea ice, which has the potential to affect sea-ice biogeochemical processes. However, the relative importance of ikaite precipitation on phosphate removal under sea-ice conditions remains unknown. We investigated ikaite precipitation in both frost flowers and seaice (under two scenarios: flooded by seawater and non-flooded) in an outdoor sea-ice mesocosm experiment, and in sea ice under natural conditions in north-eastern Greenland. The ice mesocosm experiment showed that ikaite was highly enriched in frost flowers with a concentration of up to 350 \u00b5mol\u00b7 kg\u20131. Ikaite was also detected in the surface layer of sea ice, ranging from ca. 13 \u00b5mol\u00b7 kg\u20131 in the non-flooded ice to ca. 95 \u00b5mol\u00b7 kg\u20131 in the flooded ice. However, under all these conditions, no phosphate co-precipitation with ikaite was observed. The field study in Greenland showed similar results: ikaite was detected in surface ice with an average concentration of 13.8 \u00b5mol\u00b7 kg\u20131, but no phosphate removal due to ikaite precipitation was observed. These results suggest that the impact of ikaite precipitation on phosphate and the sea-ice ecosystem might not be as significant as imagined previously.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

{"title": "Quantification of calcium carbonate (ikaite) in first\u2013and multi\u2013year sea ice\n", "abstract": " Ikaite (CaCO3\u20226H2O) is a metastable calcium carbonate mineral that forms at low temperature and/or high pressure. Ikaite precipitates in sea ice and may play a significant role in air\u2013sea CO2 exchange in ice covered seas and oceans. However, the spatial and temporal dynamics of ikaite in sea ice are poorly understood due to few available measurements and time consuming analytical techniques. Here, we present a new method for quantifying ikaite in sea ice and compare it with a more time-consuming imaging technique currently in use. In short, sea ice cores were melted at low temperatures (<\u20094\u2009\u00b0C), filtered for ikaite crystals that subsequently were dissolved and analyzed as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). The new method was applied on cores from experimental sea ice in Winnipeg (49\u00b0\u2009N), Canada, first\u2013year sea ice near Cambridge Bay (69\u00b0\u2009N), Nunavut, Canada, and first\u2013 and multi\u2013year sea ice near Station Nord (81\u00b0\u2009N), Greenland. Ikaite crystals were found in all sea ice types. The new ikaite quantification method is a straightforward technique that generally agrees with the image analysis technique and is both more accurate and precise. The DIC method may give lower concentrations in first\u2013year ice and higher concentrations in multi\u2013year ice than image analysis, likely due to the large spatial variability of ikaite crystals in first\u2013year sea ice and the small crystal size in multi\u2013year ice, both of which make quantification by image analysis more difficult.

It is only found in a metastable state, and decomposes rapidly once removed from near-freezing water. Recently, ikaite crystals have been found in sea ice and it has been suggested that their precipitation may play an important role in air-sea CO2 exchange in ice-covered 5 seas. Little is known, however, of the spatial and temporal dynamics of ikaite in sea ice. Here we present evidence for highly dynamic ikaite precipitation and dissolution in sea ice grown at an out-door pool of the Sea-ice Environmental Research Facility (SERF). During the experiment, ikaite precipitated in sea ice with temperatures below\u2212 3\u25e6 C, creating three distinct zones of ikaite concentrations:(1) a mm to cm thin surface layer 10 containing frost flowers and brine skim with bulk concentrations of> 2000 \u00b5mol kg\u2212 1,(2) an internal layer with concentrations of 200\u2013400 \u00b5mol kg\u2212 1 and (3) a bottom layer with concentrations of< 100 \u00b5mol kg\u2212 1. Snowfall events caused the sea ice to warm, dissolving ikaite crystals under acidic conditions. Manual removal of the snow cover allowed the sea ice to cool and brine salinities to increase, resulting in rapid ikaite pre-15 cipitation. The modeled (FREZCHEM) ikaite concentrations were in the same order of magnitude as observations and suggest that ikaite concentration in sea ice increase with decreasing temperatures. Thus, varying snow conditions may play a key role in ikaite precipitation and dissolution in sea ice.

However, for a multi-agent systems (MAS) modelling of an ITS, the computation burden is large, as it involves the computation of the state changing of all the agents. Further, if we consider simulation based optimization, which can be simply understood as an intelligent way of running a number of micro-simulations, the computation burden is huge. Moreover, there are multiple objective optimization problems in the ITS. The Vector Ordinal Optimization (VOO) method is a powerful tool for multi-objective optimization. In this paper, we apply VOO to the problem of optimizing the stop times and delay time of an ITS. We test the method on a 4 intersection lattice road network, and on the 18 intersection road network\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1165"]}
{"title": "Enhanced production of oxidised mercury over the tropical Pacific Ocean: a key missing oxidation pathway.\n", "abstract": " Mercury is a contaminant of global concern. It is transported in the atmosphere primarily as gaseous elemental mercury, but its reactivity and deposition to the surface environment, through which it enters the aquatic food chain, is greatly enhanced following oxidation. Measurements of oxidised mercury in the polar to sub-tropical ma-5 rine boundary layer have suggested that photolytically produced bromine atoms are the primary oxidant of mercury. We report year-round measurements of elemental and oxidised mercury, along with ozone, halogen oxides (IO and BrO) and nitrogen oxides (NO2), in the marine boundary layer over the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands in the Equatorial Pacific. Elemental mercury concentration remained low throughout the year, while consid-10 erable concentrations of oxidised mercury occurred around midday. Our results show that the production of oxidised mercury in the tropical marine boundary layer cannot be accounted for by only bromine oxidation, or by the inclusion of ozone and hydroxyl. A two-step oxidation mechanism where the HgBr intermediate is further oxidised to Hg (II) depends critically on the stability of HgBr. If the current paradigm is considered, 15 another oxidant is needed to explain more than 50% of the observed oxidised mercury. We show that atomic iodine could play the role of the missing oxidant, explaining not only the Hg (II) levels observed, but also the daily variability. However, more recent theoretical calculations indicate that the thermal dissociation rate of HgBr is much faster, by an order of magnitude, than previously reported, which implies that only trace gases 20 at relatively high mixing ratios\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

It is found that it is difficult to achieve pure Cu1-xMnxO phase using standard solid phase reaction. However, sintering under a pressure of 27.7 MPa significantly reduces the undesirable second phase CuMn2O4, providing a route to achieve pure Cu1-xMnx O phase.

{"title": "An erlang-based simulation approach of Artificial Transportation Systems\n", "abstract": " Artificial Transportation Systems (ATS) can support a variety of computational experiments for different purposes, and have become important tools for transportation research. However, when the road network modeled in ATS is large or there are a lot of vehicles, ATS will run very slow or even cannot be started due to the memory limit of a standalone computer. With the acceleration of urbanization process and rapid increase of car ownership, it is necessary to find a high-performance computing method for running large-scale ATS. Therefore, the paper presents an Erlang-based approach to realize concurrent and distributed computing of ATS. To verify the feasibility, a prototype is built, and a performance test is conducted. The results show the method can achieve the efficiency utilization of computing resources.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

Since it is difficult to obtain satisfactory image data from real scenes, in this paper we propose a unified theoretical framework for image generation, called parallel imaging. The core component of parallel imaging is software-defined artificial imaging systems. Artificial imaging systems receive small-scale image data collected from real scenes, and then generate large amounts of artificial image data. In this paper, we survey the realization methods of parallel imaging, including graphics rendering, image style transfer, generative models, and so on. Furthermore, we compare the properties of artificial images and actual images, and discuss the domain adaptation strategies.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

{"title": "Visual vehicle tracking based on conditional random fields\n", "abstract": " This paper proposes an approach to moving vehicle tracking in surveillance videos based on conditional random fields (CRF). The key idea is to integrate a variety of relevant knowledge about vehicle tracking into a uniform probabilistic framework by using the CRF model. In this work, the CRF model integrates spatial and temporal contextual information of vehicle motion, and the appearance information of the vehicle. An approximate inference algorithm, loopy belief propagation, is used to recursively estimate the vehicle region from the history of observed images. Moreover, the background model is updated adaptively to cope with non-stationary background processes. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to accurately track moving vehicles in monocular image sequences. Besides, region-level tracking realizes precise localization of vehicles.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

To overcome the difficulties that vehicles in an image have various sizes, shapes, colors and poses, this model has two main characteristics: first, the model is made up of constituent parts which shared by vehicles. The locality of parts give the model the ability to recognize vehicles with different types (e.g., although vehicles have various sizes and shapes, they are usually composed by roof, windscreen, windows, etc.). Second, the spatial relationships of these parts are represented by Markov Random Field (MRF). The model is deformable to adapt to vehicles of different shapes and poses because of the appropriately changing of combinations of these parts in the MRF. Experimental results with real world images show that this method is effective in vehicle detection and vehicle-contours recognition.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

For a fractional factorial design at two levels, this method creates a follow-up design by expanding some of the factors in the initial design to four elaborately chosen levels and reversing the signs of the remaining factors.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

While mercury continues to top that list in terms of global transport and health implications, selenium is poised to be the next trace element contaminant of global concern. Selenium achieves this distinction because of its enrichment in ancient (Oligocene to Cretaceous), organic carbon-rich, marine sedimentary deposits which are widespread globally. As such, it can be released to the surface environment, and eventually the aquatic systems, readily (and unknowingly) by any disturbance to and usage of these deposits. Although point source discharges do occur (eg, mining for coal, selenium, phosphorus, and uranium), it is the non-point sources such as agricultural irrigation of semi-arid seleniferous regions and burning of fossil fuels that have placed selenium on the regulatory\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

Methods: Recombinant C2A domain of synaptotagmin I was overexpressed in E. Coli, and purified as glutathione-S-transferase, FM2 was produced through this process. FM2 was thiolated with 2-iminothiolane (2-IT) and labeled with 99 Tc m. Radiochemical purity was determined with thin layer chromatography. To ensure that the binding activity of 99 Tc m-FM2 and Ca 2+-dependent phosphatidylserine (PS) was retained, 99 Tc m-FM2 was tested by using lyses blood cell membranes in both presence and absence of Ca 2+. The radiotracer was tested with ischemia-reperfusion models in 6 pigs. Briefly, occlusion of the left descending coronary artery or circumflex branch or right coronary artery of adult pigs was induced by balloon angioplasty for 20-30 min, then followed by reperfusion. 99 Tc m-FM2 was intravenously injected and SPECT images were acquired at 3 h post-injection. Results: 99 Tc m-FM2 had good radiochemical purity (> 95%); and the binding activity of 99 Tc m-FM2 and Ca 2+-dependent PS was well preserved. There was focal uptake of radioactivity at the experimental infarct areas, with target/background (T/B) ratio being 3.36\u00b10.74 in pigs at 3 h post-injection of the radiotracer using SPECT, while T/B ratio was 11.68\u00b14.02 in direct counting of the infarct tissue and normal myocardium.

{"title": "Guest Editorial for Special Issue on Blockchain for Internet-of-Things and Cyber-Physical Systems\n", "abstract": " Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are increasingly commonplace, with applications in energy, health, transportation, and many other sectors. One of the major requirements in CPS is that the interaction between cyber-world and man-made physical world (exchanging and sharing of data and information with other physical objects and systems) must be safe, especially in bi-directional communications. In particular, there is a need to suitably address security and/or privacy concerns in this human-in-the-loop CPS ecosystem. However, existing centralized architecture models in CPS, and also the more general IoT systems, have a number of associated limitations, in terms of single point of failure, data privacy, security, robustness, etc. Such limitations reinforce the importance of designing reliable, secure and privacy-preserving distributed solutions and other novel approaches, such as those based on blockchain\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

Taking the advantage of its high stiffness and high payload-to-weight ratio, a 6-degree of freedom Stewart platform manipulator is designed to substitute the printer build plate. The kinematics and dynamics of the manipulator is formulated. Then, an extended proportion-derivation sliding mode controller is designed for trajectory tracking. The modified grey wolf optimization algorithm is applied to compute the optimal controller parameters. The integral absolute error (IAE) is used as a cost function and its global minimum value is reached in the iteration interval [75,100]. The analytical model simulation in MATLAB is run for 10 seconds, and the results show that the desired length trajectories of the six legs of the manipulator are achieved after 3.5 seconds. The performance of the analytical model is verified on the automated dynamic analysis of mechanical systems (ADAMS).", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1165"]}
{"title": "A Dragonfly Optimization Algorithm for Extracting Maximum Power of Grid-Interfaced PV Systems\n", "abstract": " Currently, grid-connected Photovoltaic (PV) systems are widely encouraged to meet increasing energy demands. However, there are many urgent issues to tackle that are associated with PV systems. Among them, partial shading is the most severe issue as it reduces efficiency. To achieve maximum power, PV system utilizes the maximum power point-tracking (MPPT) algorithms. This paper proposed a two-level converter system for optimizing the PV power and injecting that power into the grid network. The boost converter is used to regulate the MPPT algorithm. To make the grid-tied PV system operate under non-uniform weather conditions, dragonfly optimization algorithm (DOA)-based MPPT was put forward and applied due to its ability to trace the global peak and its higher efficiency and shorter response time. Furthermore, in order to validate the overall performance of the proposed technique, comparative analysis of DOA with adaptive cuckoo search optimization (ACSO) algorithm, fruit fly optimization algorithm combined with general regression neural network (FFO-GRNN), improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO), and PSO and Perturb and Observe (P&O) algorithm were presented by using Matlab/Simulink. Subsequently, a voltage source inverter (VSI) was utilized to regulate the active and reactive power injected into the grid with high efficiency and minimum total harmonic distortion (THD). The instantaneous reactive power was adjusted to zero for maintaining the unity power factor. The results obtained through Matlab/Simulink demonstrated that power injected into the grid is approximately constant when using the DOA MPPT\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

Data annotation for point clouds is one of the most challenging and costly tasks. In this paper, we propose a closed-loop and virtual\u2013real interactive point cloud generation and model-upgrading framework called Parallel Point Clouds (PPCs). To our best knowledge, this is the first time that the training model has been changed from an open-loop to a closed-loop mechanism. The feedback from the evaluation results is used to update the training dataset, benefiting from the flexibility of artificial scenes. Under the framework, a point-based LiDAR simulation model is proposed, which greatly simplifies the scanning operation. Besides, a group-based placing method is put forward to integrate hybrid point clouds, via locating candidate positions for virtual objects in real scenes. Taking advantage of the CAD models and mobile LiDAR devices, two hybrid point cloud datasets, i.e., ShapeKITTI and MobilePointClouds, are built for 3D detection tasks. With almost zero labor cost on data annotation for newly added objects, the models (PointPillars) trained with ShapeKITTI and MobilePointClouds achieved 78.6% and 60.0% of the average precision of the model trained with real data on 3D detection, respectively.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

The key problem in sparse regression is subset selection, which usually suffers from high computational cost. Recent years, many improved approximate methods of subset selection have been published. However, less attention has been paid on the non-approximate method of subset selection, which is very necessary for many questions in data analysis. Here we consider sparse regression from the view of correlation, and propose the formula of conditional uncorrelation. Then an efficient non-approximate method of subset selection is proposed in which we do not need to calculate any coefficients in regression equation for candidate predictors. By the proposed method, the computational complexity is reduced from  to  for each candidate subset in sparse regression. Because the dimension  is generally the number of observations or experiments and large enough, the proposed method can greatly improve the efficiency of non-approximate subset selection.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

Deep learning is generally regarded as a data-driven technology, heavily relying on large-scale labeled data, such as ImageNet [2] and MS COCO [3] in the visual AI community. Unfortunately, it is rather expensive to collect and annotate large-scale image data from the real world, the collected real images are often limited in coverage of all potential environmental conditions, and the real scenes from which we collect data are seldom controllable. As a result, the performance of most data-driven learning systems is limited strongly by past sampled scenarios. In general, these systems are statistically impressive as long as the future data distribution is similar to that of the large-scale data on which the classifier is trained. However, their performance is not satisfactory in real-world complex scenarios\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

To solve this problem, we propose a novel 3D display parallel system for depth sense optimization and it empirically guides how the light field should be re\u2010rendered. Structurally, the parallel system consists of an artificial perception measurement system, a display evaluation model and a light field display rendering system, which includes the display calibration, scene capture, light field data processing and display. Particularly, the system can systematically analyze and model various factors\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1165"]}
{"title": "From mind to products\n", "abstract": " After reviewing the development of industrial manufacturing, a novel concept called social manufacturing (SM) and service are proposed as an innovative manufacturing solution for the coming personalized customization era. SM can realize a customer's requirements of C from mind to products-D, and fulfill tangible and intangible needs of a prosumer, i.e., producer and consumer at the same time. It represents a manufacturing trend, and is expected to become popular in more and more industries. First, a comparison between mass customization and SM is given out, and the basis and motivation from social network to SM is analyzed. Then, its basic theories and supporting technologies, like Internet of Things-C IoT-C, social networks, cloud computing, 3D printing, and intelligent systems, are introduced and analyzed, and an SM platform prototype is developed. Finally, three transformation modes towards SM and 3D printing are suggested for different user cases.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

The rapid translational detection strategy introduces a way to establish an inner-surface\u2019s model quickly by recording key points of the axial section contour which reflects big curvature changes of the contour. The established model is feasible but imprecision. The force control algorithm is based on impedance model.

{"title": "A New Fast, Reliable Technique for the Sampling of Dissolved Inorganic Carbon in Sea Ice\n", "abstract": " For a long time, sea ice was considered to act as a lid over seawater preventing CO2 exchange between the atmosphere and ocean. Recent observations suggest that sea ice can be an active source or a sink for CO2, although its magnitude is not very clear. The direct measurements on CO2 flux based on the chamber method and eddy covariance often do not agree with each other. It is therefore important to measure the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) stock in sea ice precisely in order to better understand the CO2 flux through sea ice. The challenges in sea ice DIC sampling is how to melt the ice core without being exposed to the air gaining or losing CO2. A common practice is to seal the ice core in a self-prepared gas-tight plastic bag and suck the air out of the bag gently using a syringe (together with a needle) through a valve mounted on one side of the bag.

The dynamic response of pavement and subgrade were analyzed under the action of Dongfong truck when the speed is 72 km/h with full load and over load 80%. The calculated results show that within the scope of each 2 m around tread center, transverse stress distribution of the surface layer structure is bimodal shape. The maximum appears in place of wheel track and then attenuates toward both sides. With the increase of the depth, the stress changes gradually from the compressive stress into tensile stress, and the maximum tensile stress appears 56 cm under surface layer. Vertical dynamic stress decreases gradually with the increase of the depth in the subgrade. Vertical dynamic stress shows saddle-shaped distribution along the horizontal surface of the subgrade, and with increase of the depth, it increasingly becomes unimodal distribution. The influence depth of the dynamic loads with the action of full load and overload of 80% are 2.2 m and 2.6 m, the width are 4 m and 6.5 m.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

In contrast to providing goods in the agriculture and manufacturing sectors, knowledge and skills are provided from one party to another in the service sectors. Examples of service sectors are many, such as tailoring a suit for a customer, teaching a class, and consulting. It appears that the service sector plays an important role in the national economy while a country develops. According to the study by Spohrer and Maglio (2008), in the year 2003, 50% of the labor force of China was in agriculture, 15% in goods production, and 35% in services. When compared with the year 1978, the percentage change of the labor force of China in service sectors was increased by 191%. Nevertheless, in the United States, the labor forces in agriculture, goods production, and services were 3%, 27%, and 70%, respectively, in the year 2003.

The spatial calibration of the radar and camera is the basis for road detection with information fusion real-timely. So, a method of spatial calibration of radar and the camera has been proposed to implement the spatial calibration of the two sensors. The laser radar coordinate system is selected as the world coordinate system. Through a special calibration board to obtain radar data and image data, the transform relationship between the image coordination system and radar coordination system can be got by fitting the data set. This method realizes the calibration between the radar and the camera through the calibration broad with high precision.

{"title": "Decompositions of matrices and linear transformations\n", "abstract": " The aim of this thesis is to discuss how to express a matrix (or a linear transformation) as the sum of two invertible matrices (or invertible linear transformations) with some constraints. The work for this thesis is two-fold. Firstly, it is proved that if R is a semilocal ring or an exchange ring with primitive factors Artinian then R satisfies the Goodearl-Menal condition if and only if no homomorphic images of R is isomorphic to either Z\u2082 or Z\u2083 or M\u2082 (Z\u2082). These results correct two existing results in the literature. Secondly, for the ring R of linear transformations of a right vector space over a division ring D, two results are proved in this thesis: (1) If |D| > 3, then for any a \u2208 R there exists a unit u of R such that both a + u and a - u\u207b\u00b9 are units of R; (2) If |D| > 2, then for any a \u2208 R there exists a unit u of R such that both a - u and a - u\u207b\u00b9 are units of R. Result (1) extends a result of H. Chen [7] that the ring of linear transformations of a countably generated right vector space over a division ring D with  |D| > 3 satisfies the condition that for any a \u2208 R, there exists u \u2208 U (R) such that a + u and a - u\u207b\u00b9 \u2208 U (R).

For control purpose, base on the occurring time of operation event, man-made systems are modeled by stochastic timed discrete event systems with probabilistic distribution function. To control stochastic systems, traditional methods, which gives supervisors by using supremal controllable sub-languages of given specification, can not show the stochastic characteristic. Soft control specifications are presented to replace the given ones, and the probabilistic of those in soft specifications going beyond the given ones is in a range of tolerance constraints. Firstly, the probabilistic projections and cost functions of occurring timed event are introduced in timed discrete event systems. By using logical characteristic, expected cost function of occurring event sequence is established. And then, the relation between control objection and cost function is established through the optimal equation on markov decision process. Next, by calculating cost value of timed event sequence, an approach to determined soft control specification is presented by using finite cost value. And then, optimal supervisors can be given as that of logical discrete event systems.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) provides a quick and gentle technique that allows the examination of biomolecules under near-physiological conditions. This means that direct observations of weak biomolecular interactions can be made, which in contrast with other techniques, prevents the necessity for averaging over a bulk number of molecules (typically> 109).

This study is to determine the potential of this agent for imaging acute venous thrombosis. A stainless steel was placed in femoral vein for inducing venous thrombi in 5 dogs, which were injected each with 185 MBq of 99 Tc m-Syt I-C2A. Images of legs were acquired at 1, 2 and 3 h after injection. ROI analysis was applied to measure the thrombus-to-contralateral location and thrombus-to-background ratios. The samples of thrombus, blood, and muscle were separated and were counted in a \u03b3 well counter for percent injected dose% ID\u00b7 g-1. Thrombus-to-blood and thrombus-to-muscle ratios were calculated from the% ID\u00b7 g-1 value. In in vivo imaging, the thrombus-to-contralateral location ratios were 3.01\u00b10.30, 3.22\u00b10.21 and 3.37\u00b10.57, respectively, and thrombus-to-background ratios were 3.10\u00b10.39, 3.32\u00b10.31 and 3.50\u00b10.45, respectively, at 1, 2 and 3 h after injection.

The influence of the imperfect interface on the reflectivity of the multilayer is simulated. The Cr/C multilayer of 200 periods is deposited on the super smooth silicon substrate by the direct current magnetron sputtering technique. The periodic thickness and structure of the multilayer are measured by X-ray diffractometer (XRD). The reflectivity of the multilayer is measured at Bessy \u2161 synchrotron radiation (SR), and the peak reflectivity is measured to be 7.5%. The grazing incident reflection index curve measured by XRD and reflection index curve by SR are fitted. The fitted thickness ratio and interface roughness of the two curves are close to each other.

However, it is not easy for people to estimate tire pressure, temperature and tire/road friction force etc. correctly, especially when driving on road. As a result, numerous novel tire sensors and inspection devices were developed in the last two decades to make driving more safe and comfortable. In addition, these approaches relates to resolving scrap tire pollution and highway noise reduction.

Single track vehicles usually refer to passenger cars or car-like vehicles/robots which can be viewed as a single steering tractor. Track-trailer systems consist of a steering tractor and one (sometimes more than one) passive trailer(s) linked with rigid free joints. From the viewpoint of steering, single track vehicles can be further classified into two types. front steering vehicles (2WS) in which only the two front tires can be steered, and full steering vehicles (4WS) of which the front and rear tires can be steered independently. Since discussion track-trailers steering control requires a dedicated book chapter due to its broad range, only single track vehicles are discussed here", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

{"title": "Modular Wavelet-Fuzzy Networks\n", "abstract": " This chapter presents a novel approach to combining wavelet networks and multilayer feedforward neural network for fuzzy logic control systems. While most of the existing neuro-fuzzy systems focus on implementing the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy inference model, they fail to keep the knowledge structure that is critical in interpreting the learning process and providing insights to the working mechanism of the underlying systems. It is our intention to utilize individual subnets to implement decision-making process of the fuzzy logic control systems based on the Mamdani model, Center average defuzzification has seen its implementation by a neural network so that a succinct network structure is obtained. More importantly, wavelet networks have been adopted to provide better locality capturing capability and therefore better performance in terms of learning speed and training time. Offline orthogonal least squares method is used for training the wavelet subnets and the overall system is updated using the steepest descent algorithm.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1165"]}
{"title": "Abstraction and Linguistic Analysis of Conventional Numerical Dynamic\n", "abstract": " Linguistic dynamic systems (LDS) are dynamic processes involving mainly computing with words instead of numbers for modeling and analysis of complex systems and human-machine interfaces. The goal of studying LDS is to establish a methodology of design, modeling, and analysis of complex decisionmaking processes bridging the machine world in numbers and the human world in words. Specifically in this chapter, conventional dynamic systems are converted to different types of LDS for the purpose of verification and comparison. The evolving laws of a type-I LDS are constructed by applying the fuzzy extension principle to those of its conventional counterpart with linguistic states. The evolution of type-I LDS represents the dynamics of state uncertainty derived from the corresponding conventional dynamic process. In addition to linguistic states, the evolving laws of type-II LDS are modeled by a finite number of linguistic decision rules. Analysis of fixed points is conducted based on point-to-fuzzy-set mappings and linguistic controllers are designed for goals specified in words for type-IILDS. An efficient numerical procedure called c\u00ba-cuts mapping is developed and applied to obtain extensive simulation results.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

The as-deposited films were annealed at 350, 450 and 570 \u2103 respectively for 1 h. After annealing at 570 \u2103, the anisotropic magnetoresistance ratio(RAM) of the films is greatly improved. It increases to 3%- 3.5% nearly about three times of that of the as-deposited films. The grain size increases with the annealing temperature and the [111] crystal orientation is obviously enhanced after annealing at temperature above 450 \u2103. The internal stress in the films deposited on K9 glass is compressive and the resistance measurement shows that RM\u2225 is larger than RM\u22a5 in these films. However, in the films deposited at the same conditions but on oxidized silicon substrates, the internal stress is tensile and RM\u22a5 is larger than RM\u2225.

{"title": "The coming of CSP: automated assembly processes for high-volume chip scale packaging\n", "abstract": " Chip scale packaging (CSP) is emerging as a major player within the semiconductor packaging market. Processing in the back-end requires optimizing the use of intermediate carrier configurations such as tape-in-carrier and strip-based substrates. This optimization of carrier configurations must occur in all processes related to CSP assembly, including die attach, wire bond, encapsulation, ball attach, laser mark, singulate, inspect, and test. CSP is considered an SMT and, as such, can be processed using existing lines. However, CSP is different from SMT and has its own assembly problems. One of the critical problems is that, with thinner package profile requirement, thinner substrate is necessary. Another important problem that should be considered is the failure of solder joints because of the coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch among the substrate, lead packages, and the board when the thermal load is\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

The following concepts related to automated highway systems (AHS) and intelligent vehicles (IV) were investigated: 1) the use of a hierarchical control structure requiring less frequent and less spatially dense communication between a traffic operations center and the vehicles, and requiring less computational effort for lateral and longitudinal control of the vehicle on the highway; 2) the use of less expensive sensor technology for establishing vehicle position and implementing feedback control. Proofs of concept were demonstrated for three new technologies for automated vehicle driving: 1) calibration-based vehicle control; 2) long-range vehicle trajectory planning and optimization,; and, 3) distributed hierarchical agent programming control involving fuzzy logic.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

Their use will lead to higher productivity and less energy consumption than is common with heavier, rigid arms. However, due to the flexibility involved with link deformation and the complexity of distributed parameter systems, modeling and control of flexible manipulators still remain a major challenge to robotic research. A compromise between modeling costs and control efficiency for real-time implementation is inevitable. The interdependency of subsystems results in a local optimal performance in the traditional design scheme. An important research topic in flexible manipulator design is the pursuit of better system performance while avoiding model-intensive or control-intensive work.

The chapter emphasizes those processes that are most relevant to biological Hg uptake and the consequent development of risk from Hg exposure in wildlife and human health, which will be explored in Chapters 5, 6, and 8. The chapter begins with a discussion of the chemical transformations of net deposited atmospheric Hg in aquatic and terrestrial environments and their associated snow and ice (Section 3.2). This is followed by a discussion of the movement of Hg from the abiotic environment into food webs (Section 3.3). Methylation, a key process controlling the fate of Hg in most ecosystems, is the focus of Section 3.4 while Section 3.5 addresses how trophic processes control Hg in higher order animals. Case studies on Eastern Beaufort Sea beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) and landlocked Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) provide salient examples of the relationship between ecosystem trophic processes and biological Hg levels. Section 3.6 explores whether atmospheric mercury depletion events (AMDEs) contribute to increased Hg levels in Arctic biota. The effects of organic carbon on Hg speciation, dynamics, and bioavailability are explored in Section 3.7. Finally, Section 3.8 focuses on long-term sequestration of Hg into non-biological archives.Mercury and its various chemical forms are discussed by reference either to chemically-defined species (eg, gaseous elemental Hg, and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

{"title": "Speciated Atmospheric Mercury during Haze and Non-haze Days in 1 an Inland City in China 2\n", "abstract": " Long-term continuous measurements of speciated atmospheric mercury 25 were conducted at Hefei, a mid-latitude inland city in east central China, from July 26 2013 to June 2014. The mean concentrations (\u00b1standard deviation) of gaseous 27 elemental mercury (GEM), reactive gaseous mercury (RGM) and particle-bound 28 mercury (PBM) were 3.95\u00b11.93 ng m-3, 2.49\u00b12.41 pg m-3 and 23.3\u00b190.8 pg m-3, 29 respectively, during non-haze days, and 4.74\u00b11.62 ng m-3, 4.32\u00b18.36 pg m-3 and 30 60.2\u00b1131.4 pg m-3, respectively, during haze days. Potential source contribution 31 function (PSCF) analysis suggested that the atmospheric mercury pollution during 32 haze days was caused primarily by local mercury emissions, instead of via long-range 33 mercury transport. In addition, the disadvantageous diffussion during haze days will 34 also enhance the level of atmospheric mercury. Compared to the GEM and RGM, 35 change in PBM was more sensitive to the haze pollution. The mean PBM 36 concentration during haze days was 2.5 times that during non-haze days due to 37 elevated concentrations of particulate matter. A remarkable seasonal trend in PBM 38 was observed with concentration decreasing in the following order in response to the 39 frequency of haze days: autumn, winter, spring, summer. A distinct diurnal 40 relationship was found between GEM and RGM during haze days, with the peak 41 values of RGM coinciding with the decline in GEM. Using HgOH as an intermediate 42 product during GEM oxidation, our results suggest that NO2 aggregation with HgOH 43 could explain the enhanced production of RGM during the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

{"title": "miR-124 Inhibits STAT3 Signaling to Enhance T Cell\n", "abstract": " Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most aggressive primary brain tumors because of its rapid cell growth and immunosuppressive capabilities. Because of the ineffectiveness of many chemotherapy agents and drug treatments, immunotherapeutic strategies are an appealing approach; however, they are limited by the profound immunosuppression that these tumors mediate. Increased antitumor immune responses have been linked to enhanced survival in many cancers, including GBM (1\u20137). STAT3 is a transcription factor that is a potent regulator of tumorigenesis and immunosuppression (8, 9). STAT3 is upregulated in many cancers, including gliomas (10) and promotes tumorigenesis by preventing apoptosis and enhancing proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis (11, 12). The STAT3 pathway can also become active in tumor-infiltrating immune cells, markedly impairing their antitumor effector responses (9), whereas enhancing the functional activity of immunosuppressive cells (13, 14). Glioma cancer stem cells (gCSC) show activation of the STAT3 pathway (12), which has been shown to modulate their profound immunosuppressive properties (13, 14). Recent studies have shown that the levels of distinct miRNAs (miR) in the glioma environment differ from those in peritumor tissue. These miRs are noncoding molecules involved in posttranscriptional gene regulation, which have been shown to modulate tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis and to act as oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes (15\u201318). Although miRs have been linked to tumor progression, the connection between tumor-mediated immunosuppression\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

However, such method has inborn defects in capturing synchrony across time-bins and detecting synchrony with large time-delay. Therefore, in this work, we propose to use sliding time-bin instead of non-overlapped time-bin to overcome these drawbacks. The comparison experiments for two methods are taken based on spike train data simulated from benchmark artificial networks.

In particular, despite the best data collection efforts, information concerning contact-based infections can be significantly under-reported in epidemiological surveys and interviews. In this paper, we experiment with a number of computational techniques to infer missing infectious links, using the 2003 Beijing SARS outbreak data as the test case. We conclude that a Bayesian network-based approach outperforms other benchmark methods and can provide a viable solution to help alleviate the missing data challenge.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1165"]}

Methods Within 2 weeks after AMI, 35 patients underwent ultasonic tissue characterization from the parasternal papillary short axis view. The cyclic variation of integrated backscatter (CVIB) and echo intensity (CVEI) of three different myocardial regions perfused by left anterior descending coronary artery, left circumflex coronary artery and right coronary artery (on the frozen frame of parasternal short axis image, those position were approximately at the 12, 4 and 8 o'clock direction to the center of the left ventricle, respectively) were measured with HP 5500 ultrasonic system and DFY ultrasonographic quantitative analysis system. The values of CVIB and CVEI\u2264 half of the highest value of three different myocardial regions on a same view were defined as the criteria for diagnosing AMI, and the results from some patients were compared with that from coronary angiography. Results The sensitivity of diagnosing AMI by both ultrasonic tissue characterizations with integrated backscatter and echo intensity were 91.43%. The location of myocardial infarction detected by this technique was correspond with the damaged myocardial region determined by coronary angiography.

The DPT scheduling can effectively reduce context switching by thresds ssslgnment and changing task dynamic preemption threshold at runtime. Meanwhile, because the algorithm is based on dynamic scheduling, it can achieve higher pmxssar utilizstion with relatively low cos18 in preemption switching and memory requirements.

It is based on structure identification and parameter optimization. The structure identification includes mean shift clustering (MSC) and mean firing strength (MFS). The parameter optimization consists of simulated annealing enhancing chaotic particle swarm optimization (SA-ECPSO) and modified back-propagation (MBP). In the hybrid learning algorithm, the MSC partition the input vector space to form a set of clusters, ie, the initial structure. Then it is refined by the MFS to prune the redundant fuzzy rules. The SA-ECPSO is used to seek the near-optimal free parameters solution. Then, it used as the initial weights of the fuzzy neural network is continued to learn until the terminal condition is satisfied. The superior performance of the learning algorithm is verified in the simulation experiment.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1165"]}
