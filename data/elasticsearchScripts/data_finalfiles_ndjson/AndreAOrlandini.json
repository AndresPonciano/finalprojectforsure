However, the lack of methodologies for a productive and effective motion planning and scheduling of human\u2013robot cooperative (HRC) tasks is still limiting the spread of HRC systems.

In this context, the paper introduces an innovative integrated motion planning and scheduling methodology that (i) provides a set of robot trajectories for each task as well as an interval on the robot execution time for each trajectory and (ii) optimizes, at relevant time steps, a task plan, minimizing the cycle time through trajectory selection, task sequence and task allocation.

In temporal planning problems, actions come with a time duration and can overlap in time, which noticeably increase the complexity of the reasoning process. Action-based temporal planning has been thoroughly studied from the complexity-theoretic point of view, and it has been proved to be EXPSPACE-complete in its general formulation. Conversely, timeline-based planning problems are represented as a collection of variables whose time-varying behavior is governed by a set of temporal constraints, called synchronization rules. Timelines provide a unified framework to reason about planning and execution under uncertainty.

{"title": "Complexity of Timeline-based Planning\n", "abstract": " Timeline-based planning is a paradigm that models temporal planning domains as sets of independent, but interacting, components.

This paradigm is different from the one underlying the common action-based formalisms, such as PDDL, where the focus is on what can be done by an executive agent. Although successfully used in many real-world applications, little work has been done on the expressiveness and complexity of the timeline-based formalism. The present paper provides a characterization of the complexity of non-flexible timeline-based planning, by proving that a general formulation of the problem is EXPSPACE-complete. Such a result extends a previous work where the same complexity bound was proved for a restricted fragment of timeline-based planning that was shown to be expressive enough to capture action-based temporal planning.

A distinguishing feature of timeline-based planning systems is the ability to integrate planning with execution by synthesising control strategies for flexible plans. However, flexible plans can only represent temporal uncertainty, while more complex forms of nondeterminism are needed to deal with a wider range of realistic problems. In this paper, we propose a novel game-theoretic approach to timeline-based planning problems, generalising the state of the art while uniformly handling temporal uncertainty and nondeterminism. We define a general concept of timeline-based game and we show that the notion of winning strategy for these games is strictly more general than that of control strategy for dynamically controllable flexible plans.

This paper presents a recent research initiative which aims at endowing autonomous robots with the capabilities needed to represent and reason on sensor data and to autonomously make decisions\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1401"]}
{"title": "A Language for Timeline-based Planning.\n", "abstract": " In order to represent planning problems, Artificial Intelligence planning languages are used to describe environment\u2019s conditions and operators which can lead to desired goals by generating a chain of actions based on these conditions and operators. Historically, several languages have been defined according to different planning paradigms. Most of these languages are often strongly related to specific planning systems and lack a clear formal semantics. A recent work defines a formal framework for timeline-based planning and scheduling providing a clear semantics for planning concepts needed to specify timeline-based planning problems. This abstract introduces ghost, a new specification language for timeline-based planning and scheduling based on such a framework. The main aim of ghost is to provide a concrete and compact specification language for timeline-based planning and scheduling domains and problems dealing also with uncertainty.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1401"]}
{"title": "On timeline-based games and their complexity\n", "abstract": " In timeline-based planning, domains are described as sets of independent, but interacting, components, whose behaviour over time (the set of timelines) is governed by a set of temporal constraints. A distinguishing feature of timeline-based planning systems is the ability to integrate planning with execution by synthesising control strategies for flexible plans. However, flexible plans can only represent temporal uncertainty, while more complex forms of nondeterminism are needed to deal with a wider range of real-world domains. In this paper, we propose a novel game-theoretic approach to timeline-based planning problems, generalising the state of the art while uniformly handling temporal uncertainty and nondeterminism. We define a general concept of timeline-based game and we show that the notion of winning strategy for these games is strictly more general than that of control strategy for dynamically\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1401"]}
{"title": "Modeling Affordances and Functioning for Personalized Robotic Assistance\n", "abstract": " A key aspect of robotic assistants is their ability to contextualize their behavior according to different needs of assistive scenarios. This work presents an ontology-based knowledge representation and reasoning approach supporting the synthesis of personalized behavior of robotic assistants. It introduces an ontological model of health state and functioning of persons based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. Moreover, it borrows the concepts of affordance and function from the literature of robotics and manufacturing and adapts them to robotic (physical and cognitive) assistance domain. Knowledge reasoning mechanisms are developed on top of the resulting ontological model to reason about stimulation capabilities of a robot and health state of a person in order to identify action opportunities and achieve personalized assistance. Experimental tests assess the performance of the proposed approach and its capability of dealing with different profiles and stimuli.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1401"]}

{"title": "Defining metrics for autonomous controllers assessment\n", "abstract": " Intelligent systems capabilities are increasing and its application to robotics has become largely popular. Some literature has been produced about autonomous controllers for robotics, demonstrating that they can face a variety of domains. However, we can observe that the experiments performed lack of a common scientific methodology. Generally, isolated case studies are presented, without providing enough details to enable other researchers to replicate or to compare their works with the previous results in the field. The aim of this work is to contribute defining and operationalizing a framework for plan-based controllers assessment. Such effort is supported on a set of generally applicable metrics to entail evaluation of different aspects of robotics controllers.

{"title": "Long-Term Evaluation of a Telepresence Robot for the Elderly: Methodology and Ecological Case Study\n", "abstract": " Telepresence robotic systems are proposed in different contexts and specifically in the area of social robotics for assisting older adults at home. Similarly to other robotic systems, such robots are often designed and then evaluated in laboratory settings for a limited period of time. Lab-based evaluations present limitations because they do not take into account the different challenges imposed by the fielding of robotic solutions into real contexts for longer periods. In order to perform long-term experiments in real ecological settings it is very important to define a structured approach to assess the impact of a prolonged and constant use of the telepresence robot.

{"title": "Merging planning, scheduling & verification-a preliminary analysis\n", "abstract": " Designing Artificial intelligence (AI) planning and scheduling systems suitable for supporting human mission planners in their daily work is an increasing and challenging research stream at ESA. One of the key points to take into account for raising an effective introduction of AI based systems is the acceptability of these technologies for the end users. In fact, automated planning and scheduling systems often brings solutions to the users which are not\u201d obvious\u201d and immediately acceptable for them. This is due to the fact that these tools are able to take into account quite an amount of temporal and causal constraints and the employed resolution processes are often designed to optimize the solution with respect to non trivial evaluation functions. Thus, the study of tools for verifying and validating plans and schedules produced by AI systems might help in facilitating the introduction of these technologies.

{"title": "Contingency planning in linear time logic\n", "abstract": " The \u201cplanning as satisfiability\u201d approach for classical planning establishes a correspondence between planning problems and logical theories, and, consequently, between plans and models. This work proposes a similar framework for contingency planning: considering contingent planning problems where the sources of indeterminism are incomplete knowledge about the initial state, non-inertial fluents and nondeterministic actions, it shows how to encode such problems into Linear Time Logic. Exploiting the semantics of the logic, and the notion of conditioned model introduced in this work, formal characterizations are given of the notions of contingent plan (a plan together with the set of conditions that ensure its executability).", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1401"]}
{"title": "A Parallel Computation Technique for Linear Time Logic Tableaux\n", "abstract": " This paper presents and discusses a parallel approach for tableaux construction that provides a fine grained parallelism acting over formulas to be expanded. In particular the attention is devoted to tableaux for propositional Linear Time Logic (LTL). The parallelization acts over every time state: each time state is arbitrarily divided into k sub-formulas (with k= number of parallel processors) that are manipulated, generating nodes ready for the next state generation. The results obtained by the different processors are combined, before the next states are computed. In principle, this approach can be applied to any tableau system. This work, however, presents experiments performed on LTL tableaux only. The (simulated) performances of the parallel algorithm compared to the corresponding sequential version lead to interesting results: the computational speed up of computations is very high in most cases.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1401"]}
