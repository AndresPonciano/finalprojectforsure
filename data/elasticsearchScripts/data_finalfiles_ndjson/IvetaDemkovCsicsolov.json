{"title": "Code review in high school programming\n", "abstract": " Code review is an activity when a computer program is reviewed by colleagues of the program author. This technique is widely used in development of software projects because it demonstrably leads to a significant improvement in the quality of the program code. The code review can also serve as an activity suitable for educational purposes, where it can bring various benefits to students. In this paper we present preliminary results from our experimental use of code review in informatics classes at secondary school.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["977"]}
{"title": "University Students Were Creating Activities for Leisure Time Robotic Lessons with Constructionist Approach\n", "abstract": " In this article we describe process, content and participants of the university compulsory elective course \u201cThe Robotic Kits in Education 2\u201d, which we taught in the winter semester of 2017. We explain specific conditions and circumstances, which encourage transformation of the organization of the course. We focus on analysis of the knowledge our students acquired as the result of this modification. In our research we used the qualitative methods of data collection and data analysis. We compared all students\u2019 work and products with the theory of Design of thematic unit and we also present students\u2019 conclusions and recommendations for creation of leisure time lessons with robotics.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["977"]}
{"title": "Code Review at High School? Yes!\n", "abstract": " Mutual evaluation of students\u2019 work is an educational strategy recently investigated by educational professionals. It can be implemented into the programming teaching in the form of code review. As supported by several studies, this activity can help substantially improve the program code and increase its development efficiency. Moreover, it can provide students with various benefits, such as soft skills development, streamlining their learning, promotion of social learning, and so on. In this paper, we present partial results from our research on using code review in informatics classes at secondary school.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["977"]}
