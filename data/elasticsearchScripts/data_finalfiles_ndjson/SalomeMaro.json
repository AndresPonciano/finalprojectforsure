{"title": "Traceability maintenance: Factors and guidelines\n", "abstract": " Traceability is an important concern for numerous software engineering activities. Establishing traceability links is a challenging and cost-intensive task, which is uneconomical without suitable strategies for maintaining high link quality. Current approaches to Traceability Management (TM), however, often make important assumptions and choices without ensuring that the consequences and implications for traceability maintenance are feasible and desirable in practice.", "num_citations": "41\n", "authors": ["2259"]}
{"title": "Software traceability in the automotive domain: Challenges and solutions\n", "abstract": " In the automotive domain, the development of all safety-critical systems has to comply with safety standards such as ISO 26262. These standards require established traceability, the ability to relate artifacts created during development of a system, to ensure resulting systems are well-tested and therefore safe. This paper contrasts general traceability challenges and solutions with those specific to the automotive domain, and investigates how they manifest in practice. We combine three data sources: a tertiary literature review to identify general challenges and solutions; a case study with an automotive supplier as validation for how the challenges and solutions are experienced in practice; and a multi-vocal literature review to identify challenges and solutions specific to the automotive domain. We found 22 challenges and 16 unique solutions in the reviews. 17 challenges were identified in the case study; six remain\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "40\n", "authors": ["2259"]}
{"title": "Capra: A configurable and extendable traceability management tool\n", "abstract": " Traceability is a known problem both in academia and industry. One of the main challenges is that there is no one solution that will solve traceability problems for everyone in industry. Traceability needs are dependent on the context of the organization and can differ from project to project in the same organization. To cater for this problem we have developed Capra, an open source, flexible, configurable and extendable traceability management tool. Capra can be tailored according to specific traceability needs of individual projects and organizations.", "num_citations": "35\n", "authors": ["2259"]}
{"title": "Collaborative traceability management: Challenges and opportunities\n", "abstract": " Traceability and trace link management are important for various reasons, including managing knowledge about a complex software system, monitoring the progress of its development, and proving that it is developed in accordance to regulations. However, it is difficult to maintain and use trace links in real-world projects where artifacts undergo constant change and multiple stakeholders are involved. In this paper, we extend the current body of knowledge on traceability management by regarding its collaborative aspects in an industrial setting. Based on 15 industrial cases and semi-structured interviews with 24 practitioners, we identify challenges involved in collaborative traceability management, and how traceability management can be used to enable collaboration. Our findings show that main challenges are boundaries between organizations and tools, a lack of common goals and responsibilities, and the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "34\n", "authors": ["2259"]}
{"title": "Collaborative traceability management: a multiple case study from the perspectives of organization, process, and culture\n", "abstract": " Traceability is crucial for many activities in software and systems engineering including monitoring the development progress, and proving compliance with standards. In practice, the use and maintenance of trace links are challenging as artifacts undergo constant change, and development takes place in distributed scenarios with multiple collaborating stakeholders. Although traceability management in general has been addressed in previous studies, there is a need for empirical insights into the collaborative aspects of traceability management and how it is situated in existing development contexts. The study reported in this paper aims to close this gap by investigating the relation of collaboration and traceability management, based on an understanding of characteristics of the development effort. In our multiple exploratory case study, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 individuals from 15 industrial\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["2259"]}
{"title": "On integrating graphical and textual editors for a UML profile based domain specific language: an industrial experience\n", "abstract": " Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) are an established means of reducing the gap between problem and solution domains. DSLs increase productivity and improve quality as they can be tailored to exactly fit the needs of the problem to be solved. A DSL can have multiple notations including textual and graphical notations. In some cases, one of these notations for a DSL is enough but there are many cases where a single notation does not suffice and there is a demand to support multiple notations for the same DSL. UML profile is one of several approaches used to define a DSL, however most UML tools only come with graphical editors. In this paper, we present our approach and industrial experience on integrating textual and graphical editors for a UML profile-based DSL. This work was conducted as part of an explorative study at Ericsson.

{"title": "Challenges of establishing traceability in the automotive domain\n", "abstract": " Traceability, i.e., relationships between artifacts in software development, is prescribed by quality standards such as ISO 26262 and therefore mandatory for automotive companies that develop safety-critical systems. However, establishing traceability is a challenge for many automotive companies. The objective of this study is to identify traceability challenges and solutions in this domain and compare these challenges and solutions with the ones in literature. To achieve this, we conducted a case study with a large automotive supplier to discover their traceability challenges and a tertiary literature review on existing traceability literature surveys to identify reported challenges and their solutions. We found 13 challenges from the literature study, of which ten were also found at the company. Three challenges are solved at the company with solutions that correlate with those proposed in literature, three are\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["2259"]}
{"title": "Managing Traceability Information Models: Not such a simple task after all?\n", "abstract": " Practitioners are poorly supported by the scientific literature when managing traceability information models (TIMs), which capture the structure and semantics of trace links. In practice, companies manage their TIMs in very different ways, even in cases where companies share many similarities. We present our findings from an in-depth focus group about TIM management with three different systems engineering companies. We find that the concrete needs of the companies as well as challenges such as scale and workflow integration are not considered by existing scientific work. We thus issue a call-to-arms for the requirements engineering and software and systems traceability communities, the two main communities for traceability research, to refocus their work on these practical problems.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["2259"]}
{"title": "Charting coordination needs in large-scale agile organisations with boundary objects and methodological islands\n", "abstract": " Large-scale system development companies are increasingly adopting agile methods. While this adoption may improve lead-times, such companies need to balance two trade-offs:(i) the need to have a uniform, consistent development method on system level with the need for specialised methods for teams in different disciplines (eg, hardware, software, mechanics, sales, support);(ii) the need for comprehensive documentation on system level with the need to have lightweight documentation enabling iterative and agile work. With specialised methods for teams, isolated teams work within larger ecosystems of plan-driven culture, ie, teams become agile\" islands\". At the boundaries, these teams share knowledge which needs to be managed well for a correct system to be developed. While it is useful to support diverse and specialised methods, it is important to understand which islands are repeatedly encountered\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["2259"]}
{"title": "An ISO 26262 compliant design flow and tool for automotive multicore systems\n", "abstract": " Model-based design processes in the automotive industry must support standards like ISO\u00a026262. Especially for smaller suppliers developing software for OEMs, large-scale methodologies like AUTOSAR are impractical. Instead, smaller, focused processes that still allow ISO\u00a026262 compliance are required. In addition, the steps in the process must be well-supported by the development tool-chain, in particular when developing complex multicore systems. In this paper, we show such a process based on existing design flows and the current state of an automotive modelling tool. We structure the design flow to ensure compliance with the ISO\u00a026262, where necessary complementing it with required steps to ensure safety. Furthermore, supporting tools extending the modelling tool are discussed. As a result, the presented design flow covers all development phases.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["2259"]}

The task of vetting trace links is considered boring due to its repetitive nature and tools that are not engaging to the analyst.

[Objective] In this study, we examine whether two gamification features, levels and badges, have a positive effect on human analysts\u2019 engagement and ultimately on the quality of vetted trace links. [Method] We have conducted a controlled experiment with 24 participants that vetted trace link candidates and recorded their speed, correctness, enjoyment, and perceived usability of the tool.

{"title": "Addressing Traceability Challenges in the Development of Embedded Systems\n", "abstract": " Context: Currently, development e orts in embedded systems development lead to a large number of interconnected artifacts. Traceability enables understanding and managing these artifacts as they evolve. However, establishing traceability is not a trivial task, it requires the development organization to plan how traceability will  t into its processes and provide tools to support traceability establishment. In practice, guidelines for how traceability should be established are lacking. Therefore, companies struggle with establishing traceability and making the most of traceability once it is established. Objective: The overall objective of this research is to improve traceability processes and tools for embedded systems development. In this thesis, we started with  rst understanding the domain and practical traceability challenges and also investigated how traceability tools can be improved. Method: Since establishing traceability is a practical problem, our research is conducted in close collaboration with industry partners. We conducted qualitative empirical studies to understand which traceability challenges exist in reality and designed solutions for some of these challenges. Concretely, we used action research, case study and design science methods for the di erent studies. Results: Our studies show that establishing traceability in practice still has several challenges, the most prominent ones being: the manual work of establishing traceability is high; the engineers responsible for creating the links perceive it as an overhead; lack of tools to enable using traceability; lack of methods and tools to measure its quality; no universal standards for traceability to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["2259"]}

However, we do not fully understand yet what techniques really help novices, to comprehend a software system. In this paper, we present a master level project course on software evolution, which has a large focus on software comprehension. We collected data about student's experience with diverse comprehension techniques during focus group discussions over the course of two years. Our results indicate that systematic code reading can be supported by additional techniques to guiding reading efforts. Most techniques are considered valuable for gaining an overview and some techniques are judged to be helpful only in later stages of software comprehension efforts.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2259"]}

The car no longer contains mechanical components only, but more and more functionality is controlled by embedded systems. Due to this, the domain is multi-disciplinary, involving engineers from mechanical, electrical, electronics and software disciplines. However, this is now changing as the problems being addressed in the domain are becoming more complex. Problems are now societal such as smart cities or green mobility. Solving such complex problems requires going beyond multi-disciplinarity and towards transdisciplinarity. This involves including stakeholders that represent the users and also the societal interests.
