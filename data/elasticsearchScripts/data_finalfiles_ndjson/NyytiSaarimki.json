{"title": "Does migrating a monolithic system to microservices decrease the technical debt?\n", "abstract": " Background:The migration from a monolithic system to microservices requires a deep refactoring of the system. Therefore, such a migration usually has a big economic impact and companies tend to postpone several activities during this process, mainly to speed up the migration itself, but also because of the demand for releasing new features.Objective:We monitored the technical debt of an SME while it migrated from a legacy monolithic system to an ecosystem of microservices. Our goal was to analyze changes in the code technical debt before and after the migration to microservices.Method:We conducted a case study analyzing more than four years of the history of a twelve-year-old project (280K Lines of Code) where two teams extracted five business processes from the monolithic system as microservices. For the study, we first analyzed the technical debt with SonarQube and then performed a qualitative study\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["1332"]}
{"title": "Methodological Issues in Observational Studies\n", "abstract": " Background: Starting from the 1960s, practitioners and researchers have looked for ways to empirically investigate new technologies such as inspecting the effectiveness of new methods, tools, or practices. With this purpose, the empirical software engineering domain started to identify different empirical methods, borrowing them from various domains such as medicine, biology, and psychology. Nowadays, a variety of empirical methods are commonly applied in software engineering, ranging from controlled and quasi-controlled experiments to case studies, from systematic literature reviews to the newly introduced multivocal literature reviews. However, to date, the only available method for proving any cause-effect relationship are controlled experiments. Objectives: The goal of the thesis is introducing new methodologies for studying causality in empirical software engineering. Methods: Other fields use\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1332"]}
