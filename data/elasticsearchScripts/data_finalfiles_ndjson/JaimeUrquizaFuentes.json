{"title": "Human-centered aspects\n", "abstract": " Humans have remarkable perceptual capabilities. These capabilities are heavily underestimated in current visualizations [759]. Often, this is due to the lack of an in-depth user study to set the requirements for optimal visualizations. The designer does not understand what kind of information should be visualized, how it should be presented or what kind of interactions should be supported. The key elements of successful information visualization are the correct data using the best visualization technique and the best interaction techniques with respect to users. If one of these elements is ignored, people might interpret the data in the wrong way and thus might not understand the underlying information or a pattern.

This paper provides several intuitive and attractive algorithms that rely on mutual recursion, and which have been designed to help strengthen students' ability to decompose problems and apply induction.

The results show that students in the Flipped Classroom group were more responsible of their learning process, consequently they got significant better learning outcomes either during or at the end of the learning process. Students' satisfaction was highly positive as well. This work increases the amount of experiments about Flipped Classroom\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["931"]}

Comparando la opini\u00f3n de los estudiantes, los datos de presentaci\u00f3n al examen y las calificaciones obtenidas, concluimos que: el uso de animaciones, ya sea construy\u00e9ndolas o como herramienta de consulta, mejora significativamente el aprendizaje de los conceptos estudiados, adem\u00e1s la opini\u00f3n de los alumnos coincide con este resultado; sin embargo, la construcci\u00f3n de las animaciones motiva significativamente m\u00e1s a los estudiantes, mejorando su inter\u00e9s por la asignatura.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["931"]}
{"title": "An evaluation of a symbol table visualization tool\n", "abstract": " This paper presents the evaluation of SOTA, an educational tool for the visualization of symbol tables in compiler courses. A controlled experiment was conducted where pedagogical efficiency and the students\u2019 opinion were evaluated. Students (n= 45) were asked to answer three tests on symbol table concepts and a questionnaire on the tool. The evaluation indicates that SOTA fosters students to use it. They feel comfortable with it because they believe that: it has good quality, it is easy to use and useful, and it helps them in studying symbol table concepts. More importantly, SOTA facilitates learning, in the sense that it reinforces their trust in the knowledge acquired. Students who used the tool solved the problems correctly and significantly faster than students who did not use the tool.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["931"]}

Pensando que la visualizaci\u00f3n ayudar\u00e1 a esta comprensi\u00f3n, este estudio analizar\u00e1 las soluciones publicadas para la visualizaci\u00f3n de la traducci\u00f3n dirigida por la sintaxis. Tras buscar en la bibliograf\u00eda se identificaron las herramientas LISA, CUPV, VCOCO y EvDebugger. De estas se analizaron par\u00e1metros como el \u00e1mbito de uso, aspectos visualizados o la concordancia que existe entre la visualizaci\u00f3n y la especificaci\u00f3n del traductor. El resultado m\u00e1s sorprendente es que la herramienta no dise\u00f1ada para el \u00e1mbito educativo, LISA, presenta mayor concordancia entre la visualizaci\u00f3n y la especificaci\u00f3n. Aparte de esto cabe destacar: la coherencia con la asignatura y concordancia entre especificaci\u00f3n y visualizaci\u00f3n de EvDebugger, las posibilidades interactivas de LISA y el uso de notaciones est\u00e1ndar en LISA, CUPV y VCOCO.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["931"]}

{"title": "Visualization of the syntax error recovery within the compilation process\n", "abstract": " This work is focused on syntax error recovery, a complex aspect of syntax analysis. We have enhanced a parser visualization tool called VAST to produce educational visualizations of this topic. Compiler visualization is not a new research field, but the authors have not found any visualization tool dealing with this topic. We have evaluated the enhanced version of VAST and its visualizations about syntax error recovery strategies. We have detected that students who used the enhanced tool improved their performance developing syntax specifications with error recovery. Consequently, these students significantly improved their learning outcomes regarding error recovery exercises.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["931"]}

The framework of the evaluation is an interface to deal with large sets of items with specific structural properties (sequential order, heterogeneous sizes), and behavior requirements (flexible interaction, maximizing screen space, minimizing changes in screen). The evaluation involved 43 participants. We studied the effect of three factors (namely, experience with the tasks, size of the sets, and tasks performed with the same set) on effectiveness, efficiency and user\u2019s satisfaction. The results show that experienced users of the interface enhanced with the Focus+Context features obtained the best results on effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, a satisfaction questionnaire showed that users felt more comfortable with the Focus+Context approach.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["931"]}
