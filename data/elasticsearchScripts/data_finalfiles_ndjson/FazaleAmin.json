{"title": "A Blockchain-Based Solution for Enhancing Security and Privacy in Smart Factory\n", "abstract": " Through the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), a smart factory has entered the booming period. However, as the number of nodes and network size become larger, the traditional IIoT architecture can no longer provide effective support for such enormous system. Therefore, we introduce the Blockchain architecture, which is an emerging scheme for constructing the distributed networks, to reshape the traditional IIoT architecture. First, the major problems of the traditional IIoT architecture are analyzed, and the existing improvements are summarized. Second, we introduce a security and privacy model to help design the Blockchain-based architecture. On this basis, we decompose and reorganize the original IIoT architecture to form a new multicenter partially decentralized architecture. Then, we introduce some relative security technologies to improve and optimize the new architecture. After that we design the data\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "161\n", "authors": ["2194"]}

The software process model is used to ensure software quality, represent a variety of task settings, manage project duration, improve the process and range to execute the process understanding, and to appropriate implicit conjecture for all task settings. Several software processes models exist in software albeit with limited scope. Given this viewpoint, this paper presents a new software development life cycle model, \u201cAZ-Model\u201d, for software development by introducing new activities during software development life cycle. It overcomes the limitations of traditional models and significantly impacts the production of a quality product in a time-box.

{"title": "Co-EEORS: Cooperative Energy Efficient Optimal Relay Selection Protocol for Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks\n", "abstract": " Cooperative routing mitigates the adverse channel effects in the harsh underwater environment and ensures reliable delivery of packets from the bottom to the surface of water. Cooperative routing is analogous to sparse recovery in that faded copies of data packets are processed by the destination node to extract the desired information. However, it usually requires information about the two or three position coordinates of the nodes. It also requires the synchronization of the source, relay, and destination nodes. These features make the cooperative routing a challenging task as sensor nodes move with water currents. Moreover, the data packets are simply discarded if the acceptable threshold is not met at the destination. This threatens the reliable delivery of data to the final destination. To cope with these challenges, this paper proposes a cooperative energy-efficient optimal relay selection protocol for underwater\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "46\n", "authors": ["2194"]}

One of the ways to attain these reuse benefits is the use of components to develop software and is termed component-based software development. Reuse is facilitated by employing a systematic reuse methodology, such as is used with software product lines. Reusability is the degree to which software can be reused. Several approaches to assessing the reusability of software components have been proposed. Each is applicable to a specific programming language or paradigm. This study discusses the current state of the art of the reusability assessment of software components.

{"title": "Reusability Assessment of Open Source Components for Software Product Lines\n", "abstract": " Software product lines and open source software are two emerging paradigms in software engineering. A common theme in both of these paradigms is \u201ereuse\u201f. Software product lines are a reuse centered approach that makes use of existing assets to develop new products. At the moment, a motivation for using open source software is so as to gain access to source code, which can then be reused. The product line community is being attracted to open source components. The use of open source software in software product lines is not for one time reuse but, being a core asset, the component is intended to be used repeatedly for the development of other products in the family. In this paper the results of an exploratory study is presented; it was conducted to explore the factors affecting the reusability of open source components. On the basis of the results of the exploratory study a reusability attribute model is presented which makes use of established object oriented metrics accompanied with newly defined metrics. The assessment using the proposed metrics is compared with the rankings assigned by human evaluators.", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["2194"]}
{"title": "A weighted linear combining scheme for cooperative spectrum sensing\n", "abstract": " Cooperative spectrum sensing exploits spatial diversity of secondary-users (SUs), to reliably detect the availability of a spectrum. Soft energy combining schemes have optimal detection performance at the cost of high cooperation overhead, since actual sensed data is required at the fusion center. To reduce cooperation overhead, in hard combining only local decisions are shared; however the detection performance is suboptimal due to the loss of information. In this paper, a weighted linear combining scheme is proposed in which a SU performs a local sensing test based on two threshold levels. If local test result lies between the two thresholds then the SU report neither its local decision nor sequentially estimated unknown SNR parameter values, to the fusion center. Thereby, uncertain decisions about the presence/absence of the primary-user signal are suppressed.

Soft energy combining schemes provide optimal detection performance by combining the actual sensed information from SUs. For reliable data fusion, these techniques mandate weight estimation for individual SUs in each sensing interval, resulting in high cooperation overhead in terms of time, processing and bandwidth. Alternately, a hard energy combining scheme offers lower cooperation overhead in which only local SU decisions are reported to the fusion center.

{"title": "Towards feature subset selection in intrusion detection\n", "abstract": " Intrusion is a serious issue in computer and network systems because a single intrusion can cause a heavy loss in few seconds. To prevent an intrusion, a robust intrusion detection system is highly needed. Existing intrusion detection techniques are not robust; the number of false alarms is high. One of the reasons of false alarms is due to the use of a raw dataset that includes redundancy. To overcome this issue, the recent approaches used (PCA) for feature subset selection where features are first transformed into an eigen space and then features are selected based on their variances (i.e. eigenvalues), but the features corresponding to the highest eigenvalues may not have the optimal sensitivity for the classifier. Instead of using traditional approach of selecting features with the highest eigenvalues, an optimization approach is needed because the selection of most discriminative subset of transformed features is\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["2194"]}

Several researchers have presented their work on the development of core assets using aspect-oriented techniques.

In this paper, we propose a novel cooperative spectrum sensing scheme which is based on the Log-Likelihood ratio (LLR).

Usability heuristics are lightweight inspection methods that can be applied to identify usability problems, requiring less time and human resources.

Virtual reality is beneficial to many applications, especially in surgical training with safety-critical procedures that pose a relatively high risk for patients. Thus, there is a need for a specific set of surgical simulation heuristics based on virtual reality, since the interaction style is markedly different from direct manipulation of graphical user interface.
