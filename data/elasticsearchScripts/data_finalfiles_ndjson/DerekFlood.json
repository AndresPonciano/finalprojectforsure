{"title": "Medical device standards' requirements for traceability during the software development lifecycle and implementation of a traceability assessment model\n", "abstract": " Developing safety critical software is a complex process. Due to the fact that medical device software failure can lead to catastrophic consequences, numerous standards have been developed which govern software development in the medical device domain. Risk management has an important role in medical device software development as it is important to ensure that safe software is developed. Demonstrating traceability of requirements right throughout the medical device software development and maintenance lifecycles is an important part of demonstrating that \u2018safe\u2019 software has been produced through adopting defined processes. Consequently, medical device standards and guidelines emphasise the need for traceability.This paper outlines the extent and diversity of traceability requirements within medical device standards and guidelines, and identifies the requirements for traceability through each\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "45\n", "authors": ["1362"]}

These standards, however, do not outline how these requirements should be implemented causing difficulties for organisations entering the medical device domain. The goal of this study is to validate a roadmap for the implementation of the ISO 14971 standard. The validation examined the arrangement of the milestones within the roadmap and grouping of the goals into milestones. Five experienced risk management personnel in the medical device domain were asked to complete an online questionnaire examining their opinion on the structure and content of the roadmap. Overall participants found the roadmap, in general, to be well structured and well organised and made some recommendations for improving the roadmap through merging of specific goals and rearrangement of the milestones within the roadmap.

Traceability of requirements through the software development lifecycle (SDLC) is essential in the development of safety critical software. Organisations such as the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Aviation Authority in the United States require traceability as part of their approval process. However, despite its criticality there is extensive digression in the practices and usefulness of traceability across development projects. Many projects\u2019 traceability efforts are simply focused on satisfying regulations and do not leverage the many benefits of traceability. Traceability, if fully implemented is an important tool for managing system development and there are a number of published best practices to help companies with this implementation. By means of a literature review we record a list of the commonly accepted best practices for traceability im-plementation.

Furthermore a recent analysis of traceability documentation submitted to the Administration has revealed that the traceability data was incomplete, incorrect, and conflicting in many cases.

This lack of compliance means that organisations find it difficult to assess the safety of their software and thus ensure its safety. One reason for non-compliance with regards to traceability is a lack of guidance on what traceability to implement or how to implement it.

This study is the first to compare the performance of a set of expert spreadsheet developers that debugged a spreadsheet using voice-control technology and another set that debugged the same spreadsheet using keyboard and mouse.
