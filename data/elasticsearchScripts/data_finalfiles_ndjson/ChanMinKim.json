The dropout problem can be attributed to a number of reasons, with a lack of interaction between learners and the instructor constituting one of the main reasons. The lack of interaction also leads to learners' feeling of isolation. Learning communities can provide learners with an environment conducive to increased interactions and alleviate their feeling of isolation. Unfortunately, there are no clear rules that instructors can follow to help learners create learning communities.

Focusing on individual differences, personalized instruction aims to accommodate a variety of students to help them achieve mastery learning and performance (Ferguson, 2001). It is hard to promote students' personalized learning if there is no support for teachers' personalized instruction. The flexibility that technology brings to personalized instruction can help teachers contextualize their teaching practice for student diversity and student accountability for learning (Smith & Throne, 2009). However, the availability of technology itself does not promise effective technology integration for personalized instruction.

The refined model was applied in a technology integration course with 38 preservice teachers. A case study approach was used in this implementation study. Data were collected from the participants\u2019 discussion worksheets and lesson plans, along with associated artifacts and the researchers\u2019 field observation notes. Data analysis results revealed that (a) preservice teachers\u2019 had an entry-level understanding of TPACK through discussions on the meaning of TPACK and evaluations of technology-integrated teaching examples;(b) designing several technology-integrated lesson plans improved preservice teachers\u2019 teaching-related knowledge and facilitated their TPACK learning; and (c) preservice\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1820"]}
{"title": "A design framework for a virtual tutee system to promote academic reading engagement in a college classroom\n", "abstract": " Poor academic reading habits among students in higher education have been commonly acknowledged. Pre-service teachers are not exceptions as they do not always complete assigned course readings and frequently exhibit a shallow level of reading strategies. This paper proposes one approach to improve college students\u2019 engagement in academic reading, a Virtual Tutee System (VTS). The VTS presents a Web-based peer-tutoring environment in which students take the role of tutor and teach a virtual avatar character. According to research on peer tutoring, students are likely to develop active engagement in learning when they adopt the role of a tutor. This paper provides an elaboration of the design framework of the VTS with design examples applied to a teacher-education course. The framework consists of four design principles, including component guidelines for each principle, grounded in role theory and self-determination theory. The peer tutoring literature is briefly reviewed along with two theories that provide the foundation of the VTS. The paper concludes with a presentation of the potential for the VTS in college classrooms and directions for future research.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1820"]}

{"title": "Design guidelines for scaffolding pre\u2010service teachers\u2019 reflection\u2010in\u2010action toward culturally responsive teaching\n", "abstract": " Pre-service teachers need to prepare for diverse classrooms. Being culturally responsive, they should affirm students from diverse cultures and acknowledge that both their own and these students\u2019 cultural practices may shape learning in classrooms. Yet, many teacher education programs often fall behind in terms of focusing on cultural elements. One way to prepare pre-service teachers for culturally responsive teaching is integrating critical reflection into teacher education curricula. Pre-service teachers\u2019 reflections tend to be descriptive rather than in-depth. Also, usually, retrospective reflection is practiced in teacher education programs, but pre-service teachers should also learn reflection-in-action, reflection in the moment of an action, for effective teaching in dynamic atmosphere of classrooms.

While some efforts have been made in gamification for teaching and learning, insufficient attention has been paid to gamification grounded in both theories and evidence from empirical studies. After identifying five motivational needs of students from the literature on online discussions, this article offers five design guidelines to address these five needs by taking a gamification approach. Each guideline consists of several implementations of how to effectively use common game elements to address each of the needs. The implementations were constructed based on theories pulled from the literature on games and prior studies on gamification in teaching and learning.

In providing formative feedback, it is important that the teacher take the full complexity of the student into account, examining not only what the student learned or failed to learn but also why. There are numerous factors that are associated with why students did learn or fail to learn, and affective and motivational factors are considered especially important. However, these factors are often difficult for teachers to assess in the classroom, and as such can be overlooked in efforts to promote student success. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the need for formative assessments that take affective and motivational factors into consideration. In doing so we introduce a non-commercial tool, the Subtle Stone, that can be integrated into the classroom to make the affective and motivational experience of students more\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1820"]}

K-12 teachers are expected to engage students in scientific modeling, which entails constructing, testing, evaluating, and revising their own models of science phenomena while pursuing an epistemic goal. However, conceptualizing models of unobservable science phenomena without support is daunting for students. We propose that creating science simulations with block-based coding in Scratch is a promising approach to support student\u2019s scientific modeling and learning to code.

{"title": "Professional development that considers teachers\u2019 attitudes toward an innovation\n", "abstract": " This study investigated the extent to which teachers' motivation and attitudes for professional development training facilitated their willingness to implement reform strategies. Teachers completed surveys prior to training and after receiving training. Analysis compared the responses of beginning teachers (new to the process) and advanced teachers (receiving advanced training). Advanced teachers showed that their instructional strategies and goals corresponded to the innovations at the start. At the end of the training, Beginning teachers gave positive ratings for the training and their emotions toward implementing the training. Introduction Researchers have suggested that potential adopters' attitudes toward an innovation should be considered for it's diffusion (e.g., Ellsworth, 2000). However, few studies have examined how to address this (Ertmer, Conklin, Lewandowski, Osika, Selo, & Wignall, 2003). This study investigated the extent to which a professional development training, one that regards teachers' attitudes and beliefs as being important elements to consider when designing professional development, may facilitate teachers' willingness to adopt instructional ideals and strategies of the innovation. The professional development training in this study was Great Expectations (GE) in Oklahoma. As a whole-school reform model, primary objectives of the training is to instruct teachers on ways to increase students' knowledge, self-esteem, and social competencies while also focusing on instructional strategies that align with constructivist principles.
