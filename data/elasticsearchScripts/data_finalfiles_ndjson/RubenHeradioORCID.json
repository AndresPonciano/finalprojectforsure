{"title": "Speeding up derivative configuration from product platforms\n", "abstract": " To compete in the global marketplace, manufacturers try to differentiate their products by focusing on individual customer needs. Fulfilling this goal requires that companies shift from mass production to mass customization. Under this approach, a generic architecture, named product platform, is designed to support the derivation of customized products through a configuration process that determines which components the product comprises. When a customer configures a derivative, typically not every combination of available components is valid. To guarantee that all dependencies and incompatibilities among the derivative constituent components are satisfied, automated configurators are used. Flexible product platforms provide a big number of interrelated components, and so, the configuration of all, but trivial, derivatives involves considerable effort to select which components the derivative should include. Our approach alleviates that effort by speeding up the derivative configuration using a heuristic based on the information theory concept of entropy.

{"title": "Binary Decision Diagram Algorithms to Perform Hard Analysis Operations on Variability Models.\n", "abstract": " Variability models play a key role in software product line engineering as they are used to represent the common and variable features that products may include, and what constraints among the features must be satisfied to guarantee the validity of the products. Valuable analysis operations on variability models can be performed by black box reusing logic engines, such as SAT-solvers and binary decision diagram libraries. Unfortunately, such kind of reuse implies long computation times for operations that need calling the engines many times. To overcome this problem, we propose new algorithms that directly deal with the data structure of a binary decision diagram encoding a variability model. In particular, our algorithms are specifically designed to detect core & dead features, and the impact & exclusion sets of every feature.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1530"]}

High costs associated with equipment, space, and maintenance staff, impose certain constraints on resources for traditional laboratories.

Some actions are repetitive in nature, cannot be executed trivially or in reasonable time by a user. Some others might be simply impossible without computer help.

Those analyses could be addressed through statistical inference, ie, working with a much more tractable sample that later supports generalizing the results obtained to the entire configuration space. To make this possible, the laws of statistical inference impose an indispensable requirement: each member of the population must be equally likely to be included in the sample, ie, the sampling process needs to be\" uniform\". Various SAT-samplers have been developed for generating uniform random samples at a reasonable computational cost. Unfortunately, there is a lack of experimental validation over large configuration models to show whether the samplers indeed produce genuine uniform samples or not.

The remaining variability can be specified by means of domain specific languages.

{"title": "Using Extended Logical Primitives for Efficient BDD Building\n", "abstract": " Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) have been used to represent logic models in a variety of research contexts, such as software product lines, circuit testing, and plasma confinement, among others. Although BDDs have proven to be very useful, the main problem with this technique is that synthesizing BDDs can be a frustratingly slow or even unsuccessful process, due to its heuristic nature. We present an extension of propositional logic to tackle one recurring phenomenon in logic modeling, namely groups of variables related by an exclusive-or relationship, and also consider two other extensions: one in which at least n variables in a group are true and another one for in which at most n variables are true. We add XOR, atLeast-n and atMost-n primitives to logic formulas in order to reduce the size of the input and also present algorithms to efficiently incorporate these constructions into the building of BDDs. We prove, among other results, that the number of nodes created during the process for XOR groups is reduced from quadratic to linear for the affected clauses. the XOR primitive is tested against eight logical models, two from industry and six from Kconfig-based open-source projects. Results range from no negative effects in models without XOR relations to performance gains well into two orders of magnitude on models with an abundance of this kind of relationship.

Software Product Lines focuses on creating a family of products instead of individual products.

Although there are well-documented examples of cost reduction, shorter development times, and quality improvement achieved by introducing the product line paradigm in industry, the approach is not always the best economic choice for building a family of related systems.

In addition, valuable information can be inferred from FDs; for instance, the total number of possible products of a SPL. A common approach to calculate the number of products is translating FDs into propositional logic formulas, which are processed by off-the-shelf tools, such as SAT solvers. However, this approach only works for small FDs. We think more scalable solutions can be reached avoiding the diagram-to-logic transformation and taking advantage of the tree organization of FDs. Due to the profusion of feature modeling notations, this paper formally defines a pivot language, named Neutral Feature Tree (NFT), where FDs are restricted to be trees. Most popular FD notations can be easily and efficiently translated to NFT.
