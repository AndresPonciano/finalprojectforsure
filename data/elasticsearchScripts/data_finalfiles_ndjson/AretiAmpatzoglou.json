{"title": "Technical debt quantification through metrics: an industrial validation\n", "abstract": " Technical Debt is a software engineering metaphor that refers to the intentional or unintentional situation in which a software industry, produces a software at a lower quality, to achieve business goals (eg, shorten time to market). Nevertheless, similarly to financial debt, technical debt does not come without negative consequences. The accumulation of technical debt leads to additional maintenance. The technical debt metaphor is built around three major notions: principal, interest, and interest probability. The quantification of these notions is the first step towards the efficient management of technical debt, in the sense that \u201cyou cannot control what you cannot measure\u201d. In this paper, we employ an established method for quantifying technical debt, namely FITTED, to measure the technical debt of an industrial software product, and contrast it to the perception of the software engineers.
