{"title": "COCOMO model for software based on Open Source: Application to the adaptation of TRIADE to the university system\n", "abstract": " Today, within the software industry, Open Source Software has many qualities that need to be analyzed. This kind of software has gained a lot of attraction nowadays from researchers since it offers technical and economical advantages compared to paid software. This article shows that the development of software based on Open Source has many cost-oriented advantages. The present work adapts an Open Source Software and evaluates the cost of its adaptation. This evaluation was performed according to the model Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO).", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["2019"]}
{"title": "Application of Function Points to Software Based on Open Source: A Case Study\n", "abstract": " Many software are developed from Open Source. There is a crucial need to estimate the efforts spent in a project development based on Open Source. These estimates give room for comparison between the development model based on Open Source and others and lead to a decision making concerning a project, if it is judged worthy to be continued, discarded or combined with traditional approaches. In the present paper, a case study is made using approximation of functional size to the software based on Open Source in order to show that the development of applications based on Open Source has many advantages in terms of efforts. For this purpose, the present work sets out to adapt an Open Source software called TRIADE and to evaluate its functional size matching. The results show that this adaptation can decrease the functional size of software up to 90% compared to a development from scratch. The\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["2019"]}
