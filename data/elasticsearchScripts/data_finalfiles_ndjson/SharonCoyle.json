{"title": "A case study of risk management in agile systems development\n", "abstract": " A principal objective of agile development methods is to reduce risk thereby resulting in more successful and effective information systems. However, while there is an extensive body of academic literature on risk management, very little research has attempted to rigorously apply this as a lens to study risk management in agile development projects. The purpose of this research was to ascertain the extent to which risk management practices are incorporated into agile development projects. A case study was conducted involving a change management consultancy firm whose main business involved the deployment of agile approaches. The study found that while there is a perception that risk management practices are not carried out in agile environments, the extent to which risk management is conducted on these projects is in some cases just as substantial to that carried out on traditional projects. In fact, in this case it appeared that the teams were more rigorous in their risk management than is often the case.", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["2248"]}

{"title": "An exploration of the relationship between contribution behaviours and the decision making process in agile teams\n", "abstract": " Agile software development teams are self-managed; setting and complying their own rules, defining their own behaviours and encompassing a devolved decision-making structure. They rely heavily on the input of their team members for decision making. Research has indicated how ASD teams are susceptible to group process losses and coupled with traditional complexities, this produces some significant challenges. In the context of ASD teams, this research proposes that alternative-generation during decision making may only be achieved when group members engage in contribution behaviours. Drawing on existing literature, the paper examines the relationship between contribution behaviours and decision making. Utilising a multiple case study approach, it investigates the occurrence and impact of contribution behaviours during the group decision making process in ASD. Findings shed light on the important role that contribution behaviours play and reveal that many factors can influence their occurrence such as time pressure, skillset, experience and communication.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["2248"]}
{"title": "Group Process Losses in Agile Software Development Decision Making\n", "abstract": " The importance of effective decision making in organisations has been well documented. Despite the many benefits associated with groupwork, groups are often subjected to process losses such as groupthink, which in turn have a negative impact on group decision making. Limited prior research has suggested that such process losses may be even more prevalent in agile software development characterised by highly cohesive, self-managing teams. This study is one of the first to rigorously investigate the group process losses most prevalent in agile software development teams and assesses how the implementation of agile practices can reduce the impact or occurrence of such losses.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["2248"]}
{"title": "Guidelines for Using Pilot Projects in the Fourth Industrial Revolution\n", "abstract": " Pilot projects are popular in companies for experimenting with industry 4.0 concepts. However, few studies have addressed the specificities of piloting transformation, whose requirements are quite different than those for implementing a project with clear goals. Pilot projects can be used for the purpose of exploring, demonstrating, optimizing and disseminating solutions. In this paper we identify the role of pilot projects in digital transformation and define a successful pilot project so that it transcends to a full project. We provide accessible guidelines for the deployment of pilot projects in industry 4.0, drawing from a structured literature review and from lessons learned in an action research project implementing mixed reality in household ceramics production. A sound approach to pilot projects is important to reduce unknowns and risks in ensuing full projects and to contributing to organizational knowledge, offering an opportunity to rethink business strategies and train employees in digital transformation.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["2248"]}
{"title": "Developing Socially-Constructed Quality Metrics in Agile: A Multi-Faceted Perspective\n", "abstract": " This research proposes development of socially-constructed metrics for quality assessment and improvement in Agile Software Development (ASD) projects. The first phase of our research includes an extensive literature review, which indicates that traditional (outcome-focused) metrics that evaluate quality are not directly transferable to adaptive, ASD projects. We then conduct semi-structured interviews confirming the necessity of considering people and process aspects for quality considerations in agile. We propose three dimensions for composite metrics in ASD, namely,(1) evidence (2) expectation and (3) critical evaluation. This combines quantitative and qualitative information drawn from people, process, and outcome-related factors. The proposed model allows ASD teams to concurrently conduct quality assessment and improvement during their projects, producing innovative metrics, adhering to the core principles of the agile manifesto. In our next research stage, this reference model will be tested and validated in practice.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["2248"]}
{"title": "People over process: key people challenges in agile development\n", "abstract": " There is a common perception that, while there may be some 'teething' problems experienced during the initial transition to agile, people are much happier, engaged and ultimately more productive in these environments. This study shows that this belief may not always hold true, identifying many serious \u00bfpeople\u00bf challenges experienced by 17 large multinational organisations, all using agile for more than three years. The cases provide an interesting insight in that they involve instances where agile was implemented in a top-down manner across the organisations or at least across business units. This is in contrast to most accounts of agile which involve voluntary, bottom up adoption on small co-located teams developing systems deemed to be suitable for agile development. The people issues uncovered include a broad range of problems from recruitment of agile staff, to training, motivation and performance\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["2248"]}

{"title": "People over process: the implications of agile for IS skills and human resource management\n", "abstract": " Agile approaches to information systems development have become increasingly popular in recent years, as more and more IS organisations are eager to capitalise on the alleged opportunities and benefits they provide. However, transition to these approaches is often far from trivial, and can be extremely problematic. Our study of 20 organisations will focus on the skill gaps caused by the emergence of agile and will identify the top ten key distinctive skills required in an agile environment. Our study will also identify the major strategic human resource challenges and practices to address skill needs and career development in today\u2019s agile environments e.g. recruitment, training and performance evaluation. Particular emphasis will be placed on the distinctive implications of global, and thus distributed, systems development on these challenges.

{"title": "Towards a research agenda for adopting Agile Project Management in Creative Industries\n", "abstract": " Agile Project Management (APM) has gained strong acceptance in software development but its adoption in other industries has not been as swift. We look at the visual effects (VFX) component of the film industry to explore this issue. Using an abductive research approach combined with a survey of existing practices, we aim to investigate an industry whose projects are large, expensive and time critical. Our study hopes to show that VFX companies exhibit many characteristics conducive to APM adoption but it is only within their internal software development teams that they explicitly state their use of APM. We explore why these companies, who exhibit predisposed adoption characteristics use something other than Agile for their non-software related projects. In exploring this surprising position, we hope to gain insights into how other industries may adopt APM and to set a research agenda for APM in non-software development creative companies.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["2248"]}
{"title": "Contribution behaviours in systems development-a position paper\n", "abstract": " This development research paper explores concepts associated with contribution behaviours. Contribution, in its simplest context occurs in organization settings where employees share knowledge with one another. Usually, this is preceded by a request for help from a colleague however; individuals may decide to contribute in the absence of help requests for example, by preparing a generic instructions document. Contribution can also be considered from the context of influencing decision-making within project teams for example decisions will always need to be made in relation to project schedules and deliverables. Individuals can directly contribute by influencing and participating in such decisions. In reviewing the literature to-date, contribution behaviors are intrinsically linked to concepts embedded in knowledge management, in particular knowledge sharing. Therefore the literature reviewed has explored some primary elements of knowledge management literature including tacit and explicit knowledge. Decision-making process activities (of awareness, searching and matching and formulation and delivery) involved in making contributions are also discussed.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["2248"]}
