An ethnographic study of a real store was made first in order to gather the requirements of store, and to identify the main processes that it involves. Early designs of the interface were evaluated by means of paper prototypes. Then, technology was assessed and a decision was made to carry on the development using VRML97 and Java. The system architecture is based on a client/server model, where the server manages the description of the items, the 3D models that are rendered in the interface, the recorded information of registered users and the adaptation rules. For the adaptation of the system to the each possible target platform, different levels of detail are used for each 3D model, and for the adaptation to the user, the system serves different 3D worlds according to the user\u2019s preferences while taking into account the policies defined by the store manager, as reflected in a set of adaptation rules. In addition, a rule editor was implemented so that the store manager can add, modify or remove the adaptation rules that direct the presentation of the 3D online store.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["590"]}
{"title": "Towards an architecture for a scalable and collaborative ami environment\n", "abstract": " In recent years, much research has focused its attention on Ambient Intelligence (AmI). Its potential applications to smart homes, hospitals, health monitoring or daily life assistance make this paradigm a very promising field of research that can have a great and positive impact in our lives. The combination of AmI environments and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) has emerged as a perfect solution for the development of this kind of applications. However, there are many challenges to be addressed before such applications can be put into practice. In this paper, we propose an architecture based on MAS aimed to build rehabilitation systems for people with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) and explain how this architecture has been applied for the development of Vi-SMARt: a system for defining and planning therapies for people with ABI, and to control and evaluate their rehabilitation process.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["590"]}

Moreover, patients, especially those carrying out a physical therapy, cannot use a traditional Window, Icon, Menu, Pointer (WIMP) system, but they need to interact in a natural way, that is, there is a need to move from WIMP systems to Post-WIMP ones. Moreover, tele-rehabilitation systems should be developed following the context-aware approach, so that they are able to adapt to the patients\u2019 context to provide them with usable and effective therapies. In this work a model-based approach is presented to assist stakeholders in the development of context-aware Post-WIMP tele-rehabilitation systems. It entails three different models:(i) a task model for designing the rehabilitation tasks;(ii) a context model to facilitate the adaptation of these tasks to the context; and (iii) a bio-inspired presentation model to specify thoroughly how such tasks should be performed by the patients. Our proposal overcomes one of the limitations of the model-based approach for the development of context-aware systems supporting the specification of non-functional requirements. Finally, a case study is used to illustrate how this proposal can be put into practice to design a real world rehabilitation task. View Full-Text", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["590"]}

Here is where adaptation comes to play.Adaptation to the surrounding context of use of interaction has become a daily routine in the interaction with our devices, ie the brightness of our screen is automatically adapted to current lightning conditions, the screen is switched off when we take the phone close to our cheek to talk, and the user interface is rearranged when we rotate the device. Furthermore, the assorted types of users also impose strong considerations regarding the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["590"]}
{"title": "Assesing the Understandability of Collaborative Systems Requirements Notations: an Empirical Study-Experimental Material\n", "abstract": " In this Technical Report we show the materials given to the experiment\u2019s subjects. First, we gave the students a datasheet to fill with his/her personal data (pages 4 and 5) and we divided them into two groups (G1 and G2). This document also contained the questionnaires to be answered. Also, with this document, we gave a description of Workspace Awareness in order to facilitate the concept comprehension. Just after giving this documentation, we gave the students, depending of his/her group belonging, the jigsaw domain modeled with i*(pages 7 and 8) or CSRML (pages 11 and 12). Once all the subjects finished filling the first questionnaire, we remove them the jigsaw model and gave them the conference domain one, once again modeled with i*(pages 9 and 10) or CSRML (pages 13 and 14).", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["590"]}
{"title": "An extension of i* to Model CSCW Requirements Applied to a Collaborative Conference Review System\n", "abstract": " In collaborative systems, users work together in order to collaborate, communicate and coordinate each other. To perform these tasks, users should be aware of other users actions, usually by means of a set of awareness techniques. In this paper, CSRML (Collaborative System Requirements Modelling Language) is presented as an extension of i* to deal with the specification of the CSCW requirements. In these systems collaboration and awareness of other users presence/actions are paramount. We apply CSRML to a conference review system, where papers are reviewed in a collaborative way.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["590"]}
{"title": "Dise\u00f1o de reglas de adaptaci\u00f3n y transformaci\u00f3n para interfaces de usuario\n", "abstract": " La especificaci\u00f3n de las reglas necesarias para la adaptaci\u00f3n de la interfaz de usuario, as\u00ed como de la reglas de transformaci\u00f3n necesarias para la generaci\u00f3n de una interfaz de usuario basada en modelos, es un tema de gran importancia para la comunidad de desarrollo de interfaces de usuario, ya que cada d\u00eda aparecen m\u00e1s y m\u00e1s aproximaciones basadas en modelos, y es adem\u00e1s hacia donde las tendencias de desarrollo de software en general est\u00e1n actualmente encaminadas. La ubiquidad en la interacci\u00f3n y los distintos perfiles de usuario son dos de los retos m\u00e1s importantes actualmente en el desarrollo de software. Adem\u00e1s, el contexto de uso evoluciona a lo largo del tiempo. Por lo tanto, existe una necesidad real de proporcionar una serie de reglas de adaptaci\u00f3n que permitan a la interfaz de usuario cambiar de acuerdo a la evoluci\u00f3n del contexto de uso. En este art\u00edculo se presenta un metamodelo para la definici\u00f3n de reglas de adaptaci\u00f3n de una manera sistem\u00e1tica, para tratar de alcanzar una visi\u00f3n ingenieril del dise\u00f1o del proceso de adaptaci\u00f3n. Finalmente, tambi\u00e9n se presenta una herramienta, denominada T: XML que permite la especificaci\u00f3n de las reglas de adaptaci\u00f3n de una manera visual, simplificando el proceso de dise\u00f1o de adaptaciones para entornos basados en modelos.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["590"]}
{"title": "De Plat\u00f3n al Desarrollo de Interfaces de Usuario\n", "abstract": " Uno de los mayores problemas con el que nos encontramos al desarrollar interfaces de usuario (IU) es el nivel de abstracci\u00f3n con el que se trabaja. Dise\u00f1adores y desarrolladores no disponen de herramientas con las que poder especificar a nivel abstracto una parte tan importante de cualquier aplicaci\u00f3n. Aportar soluciones en este sentido facilitar\u00eda el mantenimiento, la multiplataforma y la plasticidad de los IU generados. En este sentido existe literatura abundante que contempla el dualismo abstracto vs concreto para la especificaci\u00f3n de IU, de una forma similar al dualismo que planteaba Plat\u00f3n en su mito de la caverna [9] y su mundo de las ideas y de los conceptos. En este art\u00edculo se plantea la necesidad de contemplar, a la hora de desarrollar IU, una arquitectura metanivel en el que actividades ortogonales y comunes asignadas a la interfaz pueden establecerse a nivel meta y mediante un proceso de reflexi\u00f3n, ya partir de la contemplaci\u00f3n de casos, cristalizar en componentes concretos de interfaz para un dispositivo concreto. Para la implementaci\u00f3n de dicha propuesta se abusa del concepto de patr\u00f3n en todas sus versiones; arquitect\u00f3nico, de dise\u00f1o, idioms y, por supuesto, de interacci\u00f3n con el fin \u00faltimo de garantizar la usabilidad de las interfaces finalmente generadas.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["590"]}
