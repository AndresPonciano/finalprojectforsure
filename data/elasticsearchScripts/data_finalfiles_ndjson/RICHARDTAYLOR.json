These entities, called peers, interact directly with each other and make local autonomous decisions in order to achieve their individual goals. In the absence of a single authority that maintains all the data and handles all the queries, peers themselves are responsible for seeking, storing, and sharing information efficiently. Placing a large amount of information on every peer or broadcasting a request to every peer greatly reduces the performance and efficiency of the system. Hence, it is essential that decentralized applications employ efficient storage mechanisms and reliable search mechanisms. Further, an open decentralized system that does not regulate the joining of peers can be subject to grave risks. In particular, malicious peers may be encouraged to resort to a variety of attacks, including sending spurious information, posing as other peers, etc. It is important for each peer in the system to defend against such attacks.

These courses typically introduce programming language constructs such as branches and loops in addition to basic design principles such as abstraction, modularity, and separation of concerns.

However, as system complexity increases, these techniques are insufficient for ensuring a successful outcome that fulfills the requirements and quality goals set out.

Our model describes recalled feature values as the output of an optimal decoding of spikes generated by a tuned population of neurons. This neural model provides a better account of human recall data than an influential model that assumes errors can be described as a mixture of normally distributed noise and random guesses. The retro-cue benefit is revealed to be consistent with a higher firing rate of the population encoding the cued versus uncued items, with no difference in tuning specificity. Additionally, a retro-cued item is less likely to be swapped with another item in memory, an effect that can also be explained by greater activity of the underlying population\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["31"]}

Coordinated evolution of the various elements of a decentralized system may be difficult, if not impossible, as individual organizations evolve their service offerings in response to organization- and service-specific pressures, including market demand, technology, competitive and cooperative interests, and funding. Consequently, decentralized services offer unique challenges for evolution and adaptation that reach well beyond any one single organizational boundary.

{"title": "Debugging real-time software in a host-target environment\n", "abstract": " A common paradigm for the development of process-control or embedded computer software is to do most of the implementation and testing on a large host computer, then retarget the code for final checkout and production execution on the target machine. The host machine is usually large and provides a variety of program development tools, while the target may be a small, bare machine. A difficulty with the paradigm arises when the software developed has real-time constraints and is composed of multiple communicating processes. If a test execution on the target fails, it may be exceptionally tedious to determine the cause of the failure. Host machine debuggers cannot normally be applied, because the same program processing the same data will frequently exhibit different behavior on the host. Differences in processor speed, scheduling algorithm, and the like, account for the disparity. This paper proposes a partial solution to this problem, in which the errant execution reconstructed and made amenable to source language level debugging on the host. The solution involves the integrated application of a static concurrency analyzer, an interactive interpreter, and a graphical program visualization aid. Though generally applicable, the solution is described here in the context of multi-tasked real-time Ada* programs.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["31"]}

{"title": "A generic framework for modeling decentralized reputation-based trust models\n", "abstract": " Decentralized applications do not have a single centralized authority that can safeguard peers in the system from malicious attacks. Each peer is autonomous and must adopt measures to protect itself. Reputation-based trust management systems enable peers to develop trust relationships with each other based on their reputations. These trust relationships help a peer determine the trustworthiness of other peers in the system and thus help safeguard itself from malicious peers. A number of decentralized reputation-based trust models have been discussed in the literature. However, a common understanding of what a trust model is and what its constituents are has been lacking. Further, there has been little work directed towards the creation of a generic framework that will comprehensively help to express existing reputation models as well as create new models. In this paper, we present the 4C framework for modeling decentralized reputation-based trust models.

Furthermore, it does so in the context of a joint, combined arms environment with the complete range command and control and combat service support elements essential to actual military operations. All of the elements that can affect the outcome of a battle are represented in this engagement, with victory likely to go to that unit which is able to plan, orchestrate, and execute their combined-arms battle operations better than their opponent. Whatever the outcome, combat units will benefit from this opportunity to practice collective, combined arms, joint war fighting skills at a fraction of the cost of an equivalent exercise in the field. While simulators to date have been shown to be effective for training specific military skills, their high costs, have made it impossible to buy enough simulators to fully train the force. Further, because of the absence of a technology to link them together, they have not been a factor in collective, combined arms, joint training.

BACKGROUND Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that results from defects in insulin secretion and insulin action. The resulting build up of glucose in the blood can cause a range of diabetic complications, including microvascular and macrovascular damage to various organs as small blood vessels or large arteries become narrow or blocked. People with diabetes are at particularly high risk of cardiovascular disease. This appears to be related directly to hyperglycaemia, but also to hypertension and adverse lipid profiles. Evidence from the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) has shown that maintaining good control of blood glucose reduces the incidence of diabetic complications. It is thought that the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes is around 800,000 for England and Wales. Guidelines recommend a \u0393\u00c7\u00a3step-up\u0393\u00c7\u00a5 policy of treatment for Type 2 diabetes, starting with diet and lifestyle advice, adding oral glucose-lowering agents (principally metformin and the sulphonylureas) and ultimately insulin if targets are not achieved.

{"title": "Taming changes With 1. x-Way architecture-implementation mapping\n", "abstract": " A new approach is presented to maintain the conformance between software architecture and code in the presence of changes to both artifacts. Its novel features include suppression of mistaken changes of architecture-prescribed code, explicit recording of architecture changes, and automatic mapping of specific kinds of architecture changes to code in specific ways. In particular, a new code separation mechanism is presented to decouple architecture-prescribed code from user-defined details. It is supported by three important technologies developed in this study to manage architecture changes, including an architecture change model, architecture-based code regeneration, and architecture change notification. The approach is implemented and integrated in ArchStudio, an Eclipse-based architecture development environment.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["31"]}

Providing an efficient ASIP data cache solution requires that the cache design be tailored to the target application. Multiple caches or caches with multiple ports allow simultaneous parallel access to data, alleviating the bandwidth problem if data is placed effectively.

Curarization as suggested by Bennett in 1940, has certainly minimized some of the dangers but, on the other hand, often requires more staff than are available if large numbers of patients are being treated in the one session. In addition, the mental confusion, frequently prolonged, following any form of full convulsion therapy, may give rise to difficulties of an administrative nature as, for example, in out-patient E.C.T.

{"title": "E. James Whitehead, and Jason E. Robbins. A component-and message-based architectural style for gui software\n", "abstract": " While a large fraction of application system code is devoted to user interface (UI) functions, support for reuse in this domain has largely been confined to creation of UI tool-kits (\" widgets\u0393\u00c7\u00a5). We present a novel architectural style directed at supporting larger grain reuse and flexible system composition. Moreover, the style supports design of distributed, concurrent, applications. A key aspect of the style is that components are not built with any dependencies on what typically would be considered lower-level components, such as user interface toolkits. Indeed, all components are oblivious to the existence of any components to which notification messages are sent. Asynchronous notification mes-sages and asynchronous request messages are the sole basis for inter-component communication. While our focus has been on applications involving graphical user interfaces, the style has the potential for broader applicability. Several trial applications using the style are described'. ically made use of two primary run-time architectures: the client-server style (as exemplified by X windows) and the call-back model, a control model in which application functions are invoked under the control of the user interface. Also well known is the model-view-controller (MVC) style [KP88), which is commonly exploited in Smalltalk applica-tions. The Arch style is more recent, and has an associated meta-model [Wor92).This paper presents a new architectural style. It is designed to support the particular needs of applications that have a graphical user interface aspect, but the style clearly has the potential for supporting other types of applications.

Areas that audit should consider include: eligibility, recruitment, and patient age, sex and ethnicity. We surveyed cardiac rehabilitation centres to assess these parameters. We contacted 51 centres in 2002. Thirty-three (65%) reported that audit had been undertaken and 24 (47%) were prepared to share information obtained. Reasons for not collecting audit data were lack of time, resources, computing facilities, personnel, training or support. Fifty per cent of audits supplied relied on a'paper system'with retrospective data extraction, and the others used regularly updated computerised databases. Ninety-one per cent of centres with audit reported information on recruitment but only 43% reported numbers eligible. Information on sex, age and ethnicity was collected by 70-87% of centres but more complete information (adequate for analysis of equity of service use by sex, age and minority ethnic group) was collected by only 30%, 26% and 22% of centres, respectively.

Currently in its third year, the goal of the program is to develop the technology to build a large-scale network for interactive combat simulators. This simulated battlefield will provide, for the first time, an opportunity for fully-manned platoon-, company-, and battalion-level units to fight force-on-force engagements against an opposing unit of similar composition. Furthermore, it does so in the context of a joint, combined arms environment with the complete range of command and control and combat service support elements essential to actual military operations. All of the elements that can affect the outcome of a battle are represented in this engagement, with victory likely to go to that unit which is able to plan, orchestrate, and execute their combined-arms battle operations better than their opponent. Whatever the outcome, combat units will benefit from this opportunity to practice collective, combined arms, joint war fighting skills at a fraction of the cost of an equivalent exercise in the field. While simulators to date have been shown to be effective for training specific military skills, their high costs have made it impossible to buy enough simulators to fully train the force. Further, because of the absence of a technology to link them together, they have not been a factor in collective, combined arms, joint training. krDescriptors:", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["31"]}

However, there is uncertainty regarding potential differential effects of ExCR across HF patient subgroups. Objectives: To undertake an individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis to; (i) assess the impact of ExCR on HRQoL and exercise capacity in patients with HF, and (ii) to investigate differential effects of ExCR according to a range of patient characteristics: age, sex, ethnicity, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, ischaemic aetiology, ejection fraction, and exercise capacity. Methods: A single dataset was produced, comprising randomised trials where ExCR (delivered for 3 weeks or more) was compared with a no exercise control group. Each trial provided IPD on HRQoL or exercise capacity (or both), with follow-up of 6 months or more. We used one- and two-stage meta-analysis models to investigate the effect of ExCR overall and the interactions between ExCR and participant characteristics. Results: IPD was obtained from 13 trials for 3990 patients, predominantly (97%) with reduced ejection fraction HF. Compared with control, there was a statistically significant difference in favour of ExCR for HRQoL and exercise capacity. At 12-month follow-up, improvements were seen in 6-minute walk test (mean: 21.0 metres, 95% CI: 1.57 to 40.4, p=0.034) and Minnesota Living with HF score (mean improvement: 5.9, 95% CI 1.0 to 10.9, p=0.018).

Rather than defining the dependencies between activities, our focus is on the structure of coordination within the organization. The approach is guided by a need for scoped information and communication spaces, decentralized ownership of work product and process, and support for varying levels of work definition, integrating structured models of work process with ad-hoc activities. The base of the approach is a peer-to-peer style with peers supporting work participants. Peers are subdivided into active task spaces, associating information resources, software components, and communication. Independent connectors define the relationships between peers and provide the mechanism for defining larger more complex structures.

{"title": "An Indicator Species Approach to Monitoring Forest Fragmentation in New Brunswick, Canada\n", "abstract": " Concern about forest fragmentation has emerged in recent decades with the accumulation of scientific literature supporting the notion that biodiversity is negatively influenced by anthropogenic changes to landscape pattern. We measured the extent and rate of habitat loss and fragmentation in the Fundy Model Forest (FMF), eastern Canada as it applies to potentially fragmentation-sensitive local indicator species. Maps were developed using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and satellite imagery change detection for three time periods: 1984, 1993, and 1999. We report on four general categories of fragmentation metrics in the FMF: habitat cover, patch size, edge effect and nearest neighbour.Between 1993 and 1999 20,450 ha of forest land was classified by satellite image analysis as having> 30% of canopy cover removed. This is 4.5% of the total Fundy Model Forest land area and 5.6% of the forested land within the FMF. Of the five habitat types examined, mixedwood and spruce-fir types are under the most serious harvesting pressure. Habitat removal is below replacement rate for all habitat types expect for pine. Large mixedwood patches have declined the most substantially in number (11% over 7 years). Nearest neighbour distances reveal that the majority of habitat patches fall into the most proximal category (0-500 m). However, since 1993 the number of proximal patches has declined for all habitat types except spruce-fir and pine habitat. Edge density has increased for most habitat types over the 1993-1999 period. Without actively planning for contiguous patches of habitat types, there will likely be a continued decline in mean patch\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["31"]}

This chapter provides a coherent set of definitions for architecture, highlights key techniques for designing, and illustrates their application in well-known, influential applications. The development of the central concepts is traced from early beginnings in both domain-specific and domain-independent contexts. Techniques for analysis of architectures are discussed, and particular emphasis is placed on the distinctive role that connectors play in complex systems. Cost-benefit trade-offs are examined, the importance of maintaining conceptual integrity is stressed, and future directions for the field are explored.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["31"]}

It is widely accepted that a major suture passes immediately west of Madagascar, close to the Vohibory Unit of southwest Madagascar, which has an oceanic arc affinity (J\u251c\u2562ns and Schenk, 2008) and correlates with the juvenile Eastern Granulites of Tanzania metamorphosed at 0.65-0.60 Ga (M\u251c\u2562ller et al., 1998, 2000). This suture separates basement rocks of Madagascar from the Congo Craton, but more controversial is the proposed Betsimisaraka Suture in eastern Madagascar (Collins and Windley, 2002), separating the Malagasy basement from the Dharwar Craton.Some workers have used the presence of 2.52-2.48 Ga basement in both central Madagascar and the Dharwar Craton to argue that Madagascar had been contiguous with the Dharwar Craton since the Neoarchaean (Tucker et al., 1999).

Several reputation-based trust models exist in the literature. PACE is an architectural style for decentralized trust management. PACE provides specific principles that guide the incorporation of trust and reputation models within the architecture of each decentralized peer. However, a software architect using PACE to build a trust-enabled decentralized application must study the trust model being incorporated, then design and build the relevant trust components corresponding to the trust model, and finally integrate them within the PACE architecture. This design process is long and tedious but essential. In order to address this, in this paper, we present an approach that facilitates the automation of several parts of this design process in order to ease the burden on the architect. Specifically, we first use the 4C reputation framework to generate an XML-based description of a reputation model. This description is used by a tool called the PACE Support Generator to automatically generate and modify relevant trust components and utilities as well as to modify the existing architectural description that can be instantiated to build a trust-enabled decentralized application.

First, a process programming language must be customizable, allowing the user to fit the language into the existing environment, rather than requiring the user to change existing work environments, work procedures, or corporate culture to meet the language's worldview. Second, the process programming language should be accessible to all project personnel, both technical and non-technical. This paper presents the Teamware category object model, a new object model which has been developed to help meet these key requirements. This object model supports development of customized activity types, resource types, and artifact types to support the needs of a particular corporation or project. These new types are presented to non-technical end users as part of a \"pre-existing\" language. The paper shows how the model differs from traditional class systems.
