{"title": "CID: an efficient complexity-invariant distance for time series\n", "abstract": " The ubiquity of time series data across almost all human endeavors has produced a great interest in time series data mining in the last decade. While dozens of classification algorithms have been applied to time series, recent empirical evidence strongly suggests that simple nearest neighbor classification is exceptionally difficult to beat. The choice of distance measure used by the nearest neighbor algorithm is important, and depends on the invariances required by the domain. For example, motion capture data typically requires invariance to warping, and cardiology data requires invariance to the baseline (the mean value). Similarly, recent work suggests that for time series clustering, the choice of clustering algorithm is much less important than the choice of distance measure used.In this work we make a somewhat surprising claim. There is an invariance that the community seems to have missed\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "277\n", "authors": ["1082"]}

Virtually every piece of information collected from human, natural, and biological processes is susceptible to changes over time, and the study of how these changes occur is a central issue in fully understanding such processes. Among all time series mining tasks, classification is likely to be the most prominent one. In time series classification there is a significant body of empirical research that indicates that k-nearest neighbor rule in the time domain is very effective. However, certain time series features are not easily identified in this domain and a change in representation may reveal some significant and unknown features.

Along with the title, it is used by researchers to disseminate their research in scientic circles. In this context, Feltrim (2004) proposed an environment to support the writing of Abstract and Introduction sections called SciPo. This environment provides writing support by means of criticism and suggestions presented to the user with respect to the rhetorical (or schematic) structure identified in text submitted for analysis. Although the SciPo provides feedback indicating which parts of the text should be improved, it does not analyze features related to semantics, such as coherence, which is essential to the readability and interpretability of the text. Therefore, the main goal of this research was to develop computional resources to the automatic detection of semantic aspects of the Abstract section. We use these resources for the return of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1082"]}
{"title": "PyGER: Uma Ferramenta Geradora de Express\u00f5es Regulares a partir de um Conjunto de Express\u00f5es em Linguagem Natural\n", "abstract": " A very common procedure used in the natural language processing is the analysis of natural language expressions as well as their transformation into regular expressions. The transformation mentioned before can help finding other important expressions into the body of a text article and also contributes as input data to lexical analyzer generators (scanners). Unfortunately, the mentioned tasks are still made manually and for that reason the development of new strategies are needed, in a way of overcoming the mentioned problems, the present work aims at presenting a computational tool with this goal In a more specific context, the proposed software will reduce the cost of adaptation of the SciPo texts to other domains.Resumo. Um procedimento recorrente no processamento de linguagem natural, consiste na an\u00e1lise de express\u00f5es em linguagem natural e transforma\u00e7\u00e3o das mesmas em express\u00f5es regulares para que se possa identificar outras express\u00f5es de import\u00e2ncia no texto, e tamb\u00e9m servindo de entrada para geradores de analisadores l\u00e9xicos (scanners). Essa tarefa \u00e9 at\u00e9 o momento realizada de forma manual e neste trabalho foram investigadas formas de automatizar tal processo, resultando na implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de uma ferramenta com esse objetivo. Em um contexto mais espec\u00edfico, este trabalho reduzir\u00e1 o custo de adapta\u00e7\u00e3o do ambiente SciPo a textos de outros dom\u00ednios.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1082"]}
