The genomes of 12 Drosophila species, ten of which are presented here for the first time (sechellia, simulans, yakuba, erecta, ananassae, persimilis, willistoni, mojavensis, virilis and grimshawi), illustrate how rates and patterns of sequence divergence across taxa can illuminate evolutionary processes on a genomic scale. These genome sequences augment the formidable genetic tools that have made Drosophila melanogaster a pre-eminent model for animal genetics, and will further catalyse fundamental research on mechanisms of development, cell biology, genetics, disease, neurobiology, behaviour, physiology and evolution. Despite remarkable similarities among these Drosophila species, we identified many putatively non-neutral changes in protein-coding genes, non-coding RNA genes, and cis-regulatory regions. These may prove to underlie differences in the ecology and behaviour of these diverse species.", "num_citations": "2052\n", "authors": ["847"]}

Here, we use the genomes of 12 Drosophila species for the de novo discovery of functional elements in the fly. Each type of functional element shows characteristic patterns of change, or \u2018evolutionary signatures\u2019, dictated by its precise selective constraints. Such signatures enable recognition of new protein-coding genes and exons, spurious and incorrect gene annotations, and numerous unusual gene structures, including abundant stop-codon readthrough. Similarly, we predict non-protein-coding RNA genes and structures, and new microRNA (miRNA) genes. We provide evidence of miRNA processing and functionality from both hairpin arms and both DNA strands.

{"title": "Espnet: Efficient spatial pyramid of dilated convolutions for semantic segmentation\n", "abstract": " We introduce a fast and efficient convolutional neural network, ESPNet, for semantic segmentation of high resolution images under resource constraints. ESPNet is based on a new convolutional module, efficient spatial pyramid (ESP), which is efficient in terms of computation, memory, and power. ESPNet is 22 times faster (on a standard GPU) and 180 times smaller than the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation network PSPNet, while its category-wise accuracy is only 8% less. We evaluated EPSNet on a variety of semantic segmentation datasets including Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC, and a breast biopsy whole slide image dataset. Under the same constraints on memory and computation, ESPNet outperforms all the current efficient CNN networks such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and ENet on both standard metrics and our newly introduced performance metrics that measure efficiency on edge devices. Our network can process high resolution images at a rate of 112 and 9 frames per second on a standard GPU and edge device, respectively.", "num_citations": "399\n", "authors": ["847"]}

Using the availability of several nearly complete Drosophila genomes and developments in whole genome alignment methods, we introduce a large-scale comparative method for identifying repetitive mobile DNA regions. These regions are highly enriched for transposable elements. Our method has two main features distinguishing it from other repeat-finding methods. First, rather than relying on sequence similarity to determine the location of repeats, the genomic artifacts of the transposition mechanism itself are systematically tracked in the context of multiple alignments. Second, we can derive bounds on the age of each repeat instance based on the phylogenetic species tree. We report\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "73\n", "authors": ["847"]}

This paper introduces interaction proxies, defines a design space of interaction re-mappings, identifies necessary implementation abstractions, presents details of implementing those abstractions in Android, and demonstrates a set of Android implementations of interaction proxies from throughout our design space\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "42\n", "authors": ["847"]}

{"title": "Is more autonomy always better? exploring preferences of users with mobility impairments in robot-assisted feeding\n", "abstract": " A robot-assisted feeding system can potentially help a user with upper-body mobility impairments eat independently. However, autonomous assistance in the real world is challenging because of varying user preferences, impairment constraints, and possibility of errors in uncertain and unstructured environments. An autonomous robot-assisted feeding system needs to decide the appropriate strategy to acquire a bite of hard-to-model deformable food items, the right time to bring the bite close to the mouth, and the appropriate strategy to transfer the bite easily. Our key insight is that a system should be designed based on a user's preference about these various challenging aspects of the task. In this work, we explore user preferences for different modes of autonomy given perceived error risks and also analyze the effect of input modalities on technology acceptance. We found that more autonomy is not always better\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["847"]}

Government stakeholders\u2014such as municipalities, transportation agencies, and city planners\u2014require accurate descriptions of the urban pedestrian environment to equitably carry out their mandates. However, pedestrian-centric data are generally unavailable in a standardized format, making it challenging to maintain and disseminate relevant information.

Moreover, reducing access to street-spaces translates to reduced access to other public information and services that are increasingly made available to the public along urban streets.

{"title": "Stereo imagery based depth sensing in diverse outdoor environments: Practical considerations\n", "abstract": " Urban mapping for street-side environments (ie, sidewalk environments rather than auto-centric ones) is just one of many new applications requiring simultaneous object detection and localization in outdoor scenes. Automated mapping has focused on car environments in support of vehicle travel, though pedestrian infrastructure maps, historical structure maps and recreational trail maps are as important in supporting urban life. Unfortunately, many of the auto-centric automated approaches cannot be leveraged in other outdoor use cases due to challenging and cost-prohibitive depth sensing hardware involving LiDar sensors and large computing resources. Using depth-sensing stereo cameras is cost-efficient, but little information is available detailing the best uses and efficacy of different systems in diverse outdoor environments.

{"title": "Mapping for accessibility: A case study of ethics in data science for social good\n", "abstract": " Ethics in the emerging world of data science are often discussed through cautionary tales about the dire consequences of missteps taken by high profile companies or organizations. We take a different approach by foregrounding the ways that ethics are implicated in the day-to-day work of data science, focusing on instances in which data scientists recognize, grapple with, and conscientiously respond to ethical challenges. This paper presents a case study of ethical dilemmas that arose in a \"data science for social good\" (DSSG) project focused on improving navigation for people with limited mobility. We describe how this particular DSSG team responded to those dilemmas, and how those responses gave rise to still more dilemmas. While the details of the case discussed here are unique, the ethical dilemmas they illuminate can commonly be found across many DSSG projects. These include: the risk of exacerbating disparities; the thorniness of algorithmic accountability; the evolving opportunities for mischief presented by new technologies; the subjective and value- laden interpretations at the heart of any data-intensive project; the potential for data to amplify or mute particular voices; the possibility of privacy violations; and the folly of technological solutionism. Based on our tracing of the team's responses to these dilemmas, we distill lessons for an ethical data science practice that can be more generally applied across DSSG projects. Specifically, this case experience highlights the importance of: 1) Setting the scene early on for ethical thinking 2) Recognizing ethical decision-making as an emergent phenomenon intertwined with the quotidian\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["847"]}
{"title": "Rethinking Semantic Segmentation Evaluation for Explainability and Model Selection\n", "abstract": " Semantic segmentation aims to robustly predict coherent class labels for entire regions of an image. It is a scene understanding task that powers real-world applications (e.g., autonomous navigation). One important application, the use of imagery for automated semantic understanding of pedestrian environments, provides remote mapping of accessibility features in street environments. This application (and others like it) require detailed geometric information of geographical objects. Semantic segmentation is a prerequisite for this task since it maps contiguous regions of the same class as single entities. Importantly, semantic segmentation uses like ours are not pixel-wise outcomes; however, most of their quantitative evaluation metrics (e.g., mean Intersection Over Union) are based on pixel-wise similarities to a ground-truth, which fails to emphasize over- and under-segmentation properties of a segmentation model. Here, we introduce a new metric to assess region-based over- and under-segmentation. We analyze and compare it to other metrics, demonstrating that the use of our metric lends greater explainability to semantic segmentation model performance in real-world applications.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["847"]}

{"title": "Homology mapping with Markov random fields\n", "abstract": " 1 Background.Evolution through divergence gives rise to different, though related, present-day genomes that shared common ancestors. Portions of genomes could be seen as genomic entities spawned through some dynamic changes in content and order of the ancestral genome. Certain regions, through selection, are conserved over time. Such genomic portions (be they gene-coding regions, conserved non-coding regions, etc.) that are related due to their derivation from the same element in a common ancestral genome are termed homologs. Comparative genomic techniques aim to infer genome organization and structure, as well as the evolutionary mechanisms that shaped present day genomes. Since much of our understanding of evolution comes from a comparative framework, it is important to accurately identify homologs in order to compare components that are actually linked by common ancestry. The challenge in pairwise and multiple sequence comparison is to develop methods that are both biologically relevant (ie, that account for the multitude of known evolutionary mechanisms) and that are also statistically sound (ie, there should be a meaningful framework within which to compare alignments, and with which to evaluate the significance of an alignment). Furthermore, methods need to be practical for whole genome comparison.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["847"]}

These include methods for multimodal trip service areas, access to businesses and public services, diverse metrics of \u201cwalkability\u201d, and the interpretation of location data. Infrastructure performance metrics in particular are an increasingly important means by which to understand and provide services to an urbanizing population. In contrast to traditional one-size-fits all analyses of street networks, as more detailed pedestrian-specific transportation network data becomes available, the opportunity arises to model the pedestrian network in terms of individual experiences. Here, we present a formalized and city-scale framework, personalized pedestrian network analysis (PPNA), for embedding and retrieving pedestrian experiences. PPNA enables evaluation of new, detailed, and open pedestrian transportation network data using a quantitative parameterization of a pedestrian\u2019s preferences and requirements, producing one or more weighted network(s) that provide a basis for posing varied urban pedestrian experience research questions, with four approaches provided as examples.
