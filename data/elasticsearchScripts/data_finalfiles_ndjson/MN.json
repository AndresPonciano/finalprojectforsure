{"title": "Classification of Attacks on Wireless Sensor Networks: A Survey\n", "abstract": " Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is one of the fastest rising emerging technologies that find widespread use in various applications comprising of military, health, agriculture, habitat etc. Seen as sensor network deployed at sites which can be considered as remote and hostile, the technology is seriously faced with challenges to the network and functional security at the cost of their inherent limitations in energy capacity and computing power. In this paper we have delved upon and summarized earlier research on security challenges poised to WSNs, classified the threats and then presented a generic WSN security model keeping in line with the intended security targets to be met. We have also tried to give a realistic theoretical analysis of our WSN security model against these threats.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["1277"]}
{"title": "Clustering Algorithms of Wireless Sensor Networks : A Survey\n", "abstract": " In the recent few years the research on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and its variants have risen enormously. The researchers all across the globe are trying to develop a routing protocol that is energy efficient and provides adequate security level in data communication. One of the techniques the researchers use is Clustering of the sensor network. This technique inherently consumes less energy during data communication as the nodes have assigned a dedicated task to perform. A total of 35 clustering algorithms/protocols have been surveyed and comparison of these protocols based on the metrics like heterogeneity, clustering method, size of the cluster etc. have been presented.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["1277"]}
{"title": "Implementation and Comparison of Text-based Image Retrieval Schemes\n", "abstract": " Search engines, ie, Google, Yahoo pro-vide various libraries and API\u2019s to assist programmers and researchers in easier and efficient access to their collected data. When a user generates a search query, the dedicated Application Programming Interface (API) returns the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file which contains the desired data. Scraping techniques help image descriptors to separate the image\u2019s URL and web host\u2019s URL in different documents for easier implementation of different algorithms. The aim of this paper is to propose a novel approach to effectively filter out the desired image (s) from the retrieved data. More specifically, this work primarily focuses on applying simple yet efficient techniques to achieve accurate image retrieval. We compare two algorithms, ie, Cosine similarity and Sequence Matcher, to obtain the accuracy with a minimum of irrelevance. Obtained results prove Cosine similarity more accurate than its counterpart in finding the maximum relevant image (s).", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1277"]}
{"title": "Implementation of Kanban Techniques in Software Development Process: An Empirical Study Based on Benefits and Challenges\n", "abstract": " It has been observed that there is an increasing trend of implementing Lean Techniques as a whole in general and Kanban in particular in the software development process all across the globe to reap the proclaimed advantages of these techniques as documented in the available literature and verified by the Lean practitioners. The main goal of this paper is to highlight the present state of implementation and usage of Kanban techniques in the software development process, its obtained and to-be-obtained benefits, challenges that are being faced by the software development companies and the reason (s) of motivation that compels the organization to adopt Kanban technique. Furthermore, the solutions for challenges identified during the study will also be suggested. In order to achieve this, an empirical study has been conducted encompassing a survey followed by complementing thematic interview sessions with 241 employees of 67 software companies of Pakistan. The companies involved in the empirical study have reasonable years of experience in practicing Agile and Lean techniques. Generally, the obtained results depict that the usage of Kanban techniques is rather positive and appreciative; however, the challenges that are being faced in Kanban adoption are lack of specialized training and experience pertaining to its usage and a too conventional organizational culture.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1277"]}
{"title": "Development of a Secure SMS Application using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) on Android Platform\n", "abstract": " When we live in a global village, then maintaining privacy and confidentiality becomes reasonably challenging. Short Message Service (SMS) is the oldest application for exchanging messages between communicating parties in cellular network used by mobile phones. These messages are encrypted over-the-air with A5/1 algorithm and stored as clear text at network operator. Recent developments have shown that this algorithm is not secure any more. Compromising an access to network operator registers gains access to SMS also. Current scenarios of hacks and exploitation demands confidentiality, and encryption is one of the techniques, which is used, in this subsequent project of designing a secure SMS android application. Cryptographic manipulation of the data is performed using AES 128-bit algorithm to secure the data, which is essential to us and the safe transmission of confidential data over the GSM network. AES (Advanced Encryption Standards) algorithm is the considered impregnable even to super computers brute force attacks. The AES algorithm technique uses very befuddled and sporadic encryption making data impregnable to attackers or hackers. This android app will allow the user to encrypt and decrypt the SMS (Short Message Service) efficiently and just at one click. Subsequent explanation is given afterwards.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1277"]}
{"title": "Social Success Factors Affecting  Implementation of  Agile Software Development Methodologies  in Software Industry of Pakistan:  An Empirical Study\n", "abstract": " During the past few years it has been observed that the implementation of Agile software development methodologies have become a part and parcel in software development projects not only in large and developed organizations but also in small organizations despite the existence of misapprehension that Agile methodologies are only valid for large scale projects and established organizations. Keeping in view the potential of Agile software methodologies and with the aim of eliminating this misconception, a mixed method methodology was adopted to conduct a study for determining the social factors that contribute or have influence in the successful implementation of Agile software development methodologies. In this study, face-to-face interview sessions were conducted with 271 software professionals that include Portfolio/Program/Project Managers, Scrum Masters and Product Owners representing 28 software development companies operating in Pakistan to gauge the influence of social factors on the success of Agile software projects. The study concluded that the size of the project has nothing to do with the success of a project or otherwise but there exist certain other factors like visionary leadership, degree or level of Agile software practices, congruence value, etc. contribute significantly in success of a project.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1277"]}

{"title": "Energy Efficient MAC Protocols for Wireless Sensor Networks : A Survey\n", "abstract": " Wireless sensor networks (WSN) have been used in many important fields such as target detection and tracking, environmental monitoring, industrial process monitoring and tactical systems. As nodes in wireless sensor networks typically operate unattended with a limited power source, energy efficient operations of the nodes are very important. Although energy conservation in communication can be performed at different layers of the TCP/IP protocol suite, energy conservation at MAC layer is found to be the most effective one due to its ability to control the radio directly. Therefore, to ensure a long-lived network of wireless communicating sensors, we are in need of a MAC protocol that is able to improve energy efficiency by maximizing sleep duration, minimizing idle listening and overhearing, and eliminating hidden terminal problem or collision of packets. In this paper, we investigated the available energy-efficient MAC protocols for wireless sensor networks and provide a fair comparison based on certain metrics.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1277"]}
