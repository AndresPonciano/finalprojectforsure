{"title": "Bringing usability concerns to the design of software architecture\n", "abstract": " Software architects have techniques to deal with many quality attributes such as performance, reliability, and maintainability. Usability, however, has traditionally been concerned primarily with presentation and not been a concern of software architects beyond separating the user interface from the remainder of the application. In this paper, we introduce usability-supporting architectural patterns. Each pattern describes a usability concern that is not supported by separation alone. For each concern, a usability-supporting architectural pattern provides the forces from the characteristics of the task and environment, the human, and the state of the software to motivate an implementation independent solution cast in terms of the responsibilities that must be fulfilled to satisfy the forces. Furthermore, each pattern includes a sample solution implemented in the context of an overriding separation based pattern such\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "51\n", "authors": ["1360"]}

This book addresses these new trends in software process modeling related to:\u2022 Processes for open source software;\u2022 Systems dynamics to model and simulate the software process;\u2022 Peopleware: the importance of people in the software development and by extension in the software process. One new software development trend is the development of open source projects. As such projects are a recent creation, the process model governing this type of developments is unfamiliar. This book deals with process modeling for open source software. It also deals with software process simulation applied to the management of software projects and improves the software development process capability according to CMM (Capability Maturity Model). Software development is a conjunction of: the organizational environment, the social environment and the technological environment. The inclusion of these environments will make it possible to output software process models that meet the specified organizational, cultural and technological requirements, providing an exhaustive analysis of the people in the software process, as well as supporting people-oriented software development.

The successful use in the future of Distributed Virtual Environments for complex tasks, beyond simple chatting systems, might depend on our ability to provide the user with powerful virtual representations (avatars), which can be used not just as a presence indicator, but also as a tool to communicate with other users and establish interesting interactions. On the other hand, a very complex avatar, with many features and controls, can make it very difficult and tedious for the user to fully exploit the avatar\u2019s possibilities. This paper presents a proposal for an internal model of avatars that allows the user to delegate some actions on an underlying intelligent agent. The main component of the model, the psychological model, is explained in detail. The use of the model is based on a fuzzy valuation and a definition of fuzzy relationships among the parameters. A dynamic updating process is also defined to maintain the internal state of the avatar.

Many interventions, including the use of analogies and graphical manipulations, to counteract this failure and help people integrate the flow information have been tested with little or no success. We suggest that this error relates to the valence of a problem: the framing of the inflow or outflow direction as \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d is associated with the direction of its accumulation over time. To explore the effects of valence on accumulation judgments, we employ a scenario of a common health problem: blood glucose control through sugar consumption and insulin flows.

{"title": "Transactive Memory System Proposal to Foster Collaborative Learning and Knowledge Sharing into Organizations.\n", "abstract": " Knowledge management on learning organizations is a broad area that still needs more research in order to offer to organizations a set of methodologies, technologies and strategies that allow them to capitalise their knowledge. This paper proposes as a solution the development of a transactive memory system to allow organizations and their members to collectively encode, store, and retrieve knowledge in a smart manner, where every piece of knowledge could be accessible to all organization members in order to help them to perform their daily activities, and at the same time to allow organizations to assess the quality of their knowledge as well as to represent, use and reuse all their know-how towards their organizational and business goals.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1360"]}

{"title": "A Process for the Analysis of Virtual Environments\n", "abstract": " Virtual Environments (VEs) are a relatively new type of software application, with a 3D graphical scenario in which avatars, as representations of the human users, and autonomous virtual agents inhabit and interact with each other and with the objects in the environment. Despite the increasing use of VEs and growing number of developed systems, the methodological issues related to the development process of VEs have been largely ignored, applying ad-hoc informal processes and techniques. This paper presents the software development processes proposed within a methodological framework for VE development called SENDA, and it describes in more detail the tasks included within the Analysis process. New techniques and artifacts are proposed for some activities in the analysis process for which no appropriate solutions have been found in traditional software engineering methodologies.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1360"]}

{"title": "Knowledge governance maturity assessment can help software engineers during the design of business digitalization projects\n", "abstract": " Software engineers and IT professionals face the challenge of envisioning the needs and wishes of their client companies, whose long\u2010term survivability depends on their adaptability to the digital business ecosystem, which is impregnating more or less every single sector of the economy. Looking at the data reported on the business digitalization project success rate, we realize that there is a lot of room for improvement. In this paper, we focus on the results of developing 10 business digitalization projects for 10 small and medium enterprises, where the software engineers in charge of the projects assessed the knowledge governance maturity of client companies before proposing any specific projects to support their digital businesses. We surveyed the software engineers participating in the above projects to gather their impressions of using knowledge governance assessment as a tool to predictively visualize the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1360"]}

This orientation through capabilities, processes and strategic/business goals achievement for knowledge governance is auditable, traceable and sustainable along the time.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1360"]}

This creates problems for the correct administration of the organization's procedures and in administrating a shared jargon, increasing costs related to the procedures. The objective of this paper is to present the MONPRO methodology, which supports the management of organizational procedures through the creation of specific ontologies of the organizational domain (including employee jargon and natural language), allowing any person with knowledge in computer science to create ontologies, without needing to be an expert. MONPRO is composed of five phases. The activities in each of them define a series of forms and diagrams that lead the ontology developer to break down the procedure and obtain the necessary resources to build the ontology.
