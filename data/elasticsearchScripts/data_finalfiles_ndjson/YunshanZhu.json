{"title": "Ordered semantic hyper-linking\n", "abstract": " The ordered semantic hyper-linking strategy is complete for first-order logic and accepts a user-specified natural semantics that guides the search for a proof. Any semantics in which the meanings of the function and predicate symbols are computable on ground terms may be used. This instance-based strategy is efficient on near-propositional problems, is goal sensitive, and has an extension to equality and term rewriting. However, it sometimes has difficulty generating large terms. We compare this strategy with some others that use semantic information, and present a proof of soundness and completeness. We also give some theoretical results about the search efficiency of the strategy. Some examples illustrate the performance of the strategy.", "num_citations": "93\n", "authors": ["1796"]}
{"title": "Conformational analysis of molecular chains using nano-kinematics\n", "abstract": " We present algorithms for 3\u2013D manipulation and conforma\u2013tional analysis of molecular chains, when bond lengths, bond angles and related dihedral angles remain fixed. These algorithms are useful for local deformations of linear molecules, exact ring closure in cyclic molecules and molecular embedding for short chains. Other possible applications include structure prediction, protein folding, conformation energy analysis and 3D molecular matching and docking. The algorithms are applicable to all serial molecular chains and make no asssumptions about their geometry. We make use of results on direct and inverse kinematics from robotics and mechanics literature and show the correspondence between kinematics and conformational analysis of molecules. In particular, we pose these problems algebraically and compute all the solutions making use of the structure of these equations and matrix\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "91\n", "authors": ["1796"]}
{"title": "A fast algorithm and system for the inverse kinematics of general serial manipulators\n", "abstract": " We present fast and robust algorithms for the inverse kinematics of serial manipulators consisting of six or fewer joints. When stated mathematically, the problem of inverse kinematics reduces to simultaneously solving a system of algebraic equations. In this paper, we use a series of algebraic and numeric transformations to reduce the problem to computing the eigenstructure of a matrix pencil. To efficiently compute the eigenstructure, we make use of the symbolic formulation of the matrix and use a number of techniques from linear algebra and matrix computations. The resulting algorithm computes all the solution of a serial manipulator with six or fewer joints in the order of tens of milliseconds on the current workstations. It has been implemented as part of a generic package, KINEM, for the inverse kinematics of serial manipulators.< >", "num_citations": "50\n", "authors": ["1796"]}
{"title": "Guiding SAT diagnosis with tree decompositions\n", "abstract": " A tree decomposition of a hypergraph is a construction that captures the graph\u2019s topological structure. Every tree decomposition has an associated tree width, which can be viewed as a measure of how tree-like the original hypergraph is. Tree decomposition has proven to be a very useful theoretical vehicle for generating polynomial algorithms for subclasses of problems whose general solution is NP-complete. As a rule, this is done by designing the algorithms so that their runtime is bounded by some polynomial times a function of the tree width of a tree decomposition of the original problem. Problem instances that have bounded tree width can thus be solved by the resulting algorithms in polynomial time. A variety of methods are known for deciding satisfiability of Boolean formulas whose hypergraph representations have tree decompositions of small width. However, satisfiability methods based on tree\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "43\n", "authors": ["1796"]}

{"title": "Kinematic Manipulation of Molecular Chains Subject to Rigid Constraint.\n", "abstract": " We present algorithms for kinematic manipulation of molecular chains subject to xed bond lengths and bond angles. They are useful for calculating conformations of a molecule subject to geometric constraints, such as those derived from two-dimensional NMR experiments. Other applications include searching out the full range of conformations available to a molecule such as cyclic con gurations. We make use of results from robot kinematics and recently developed algorithms for solving polynomial systems. In particular, we model the molecule as a serial chain using the Denavit-Hartenberg formulation and reduce these problems to inverse kinematics of a serial chain. We also highlight the relationship between molecular embedding problems and inverse kinematics. As compared to earlier methods, the main advantages of the kinematic formulation are its generality to all molecular chains without any restrictions on the geometry and e ciency in terms of performance. The algorithms give us real time performance (order of tens of milliseconds) on smaller chains and are applicable to all chains.", "num_citations": "31\n", "authors": ["1796"]}
{"title": "Using cutwidth to improve symbolic simulation and boolean satisfiability\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we propose cutwidth based heuristics to improve the efficiency of symbolic simulation and SAT algorithms. These algorithms are the underlying engines of many formal verification techniques. We present a new approach for computing variable orderings that reduce CNF/circuit cutwidth. We show that the circuit cutwidth and the peak number of live BDDs during symbolic simulation are equal. Thus using an ordering that reduces the cutwidth in scheduling the gates during symbolic simulation can significantly improve both the runtime and memory requirements. It has been shown that the time complexity of SAT problems can be bounded exponentially by the formula cutwidth and many practical circuits has cutwidth logarithmic of the size of the formulas. We have developed cutwidth based heuristics which in practice can speed up existing SAT algorithms, especially for SAT instances with small cutwidth\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "30\n", "authors": ["1796"]}
{"title": "Method and apparatus for performing generator-based verification\n", "abstract": " One embodiment of the present invention provides a system that verifies whether a trace can be produced by a generator. A generator is defined as a finite state machine with a set of input and output signals. A trace is defined as a sequence of assignments of non-parametric input and output signals of the generator. The generator may contain parametric inputs to model non-determinism. The trace does not contain assignments of the parametric inputs. During operation, the system builds a data structure to determine if there exists a sequence of parametric input assignments that can match the non-parametric inputs and outputs of the generator with the ones specified in the trace.", "num_citations": "25\n", "authors": ["1796"]}
