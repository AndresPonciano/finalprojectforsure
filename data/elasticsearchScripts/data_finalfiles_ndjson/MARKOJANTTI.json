{"title": "Implementing an ITIL-based IT service management measurement system\n", "abstract": " The IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) provides guidelines for IT service providers how to design, manage and support IT services. ITIL is the most widely used IT service management framework. It consists of best practices that can be used in implementing, for example service support processes, such as incident management and problem management. Although ITIL includes a wide list of process metrics, it does not provide sufficient information how IT service management process measurements should be done in practice. The research problem in this paper is how the measurement of the IT service support processes can be improved? In this paper, an ITIL-based IT service management measurement system (ITSM-MS) and its implementation project are presented. The ITSM-MS can be used to measure the performance of IT service support processes. The ITSM-MS was developed in cooperation between MaISSI\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "65\n", "authors": ["98"]}

Software engineers do not understand organization's value creation objectives and their influence on software production and structure. For this reason software does not fulfill the requirements of business and software quality is inadequate too often. The objective of the authors in the service-oriented software engineering project (SOSE) is to develop methods and tools to improve quality and profitability of software development. In this paper the authors described SOSE framework and clarify with examples its phases, utility, and application in pilot projects. SOSE framework's first activity is to create a well-defined business case. Then, business processes and data concepts are identified, to meet business requirements of the business case, and modelled with informal diagrams\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "46\n", "authors": ["98"]}

An action research project involving three organizations explored current IT service operation activities and challenges and initiated projects to improve service operation at each organization. The findings indicate that the major challenges include reactive rather than proactive approach to IT operations management, measurement and reporting, classification of incidents, management of customer feedback, and interfaces between IT service operation processes.

However, current service science literature has not adequately addressed how these activities differ from each other. Focusing solely on IT service management and ignoring service governance aspects may cause difficulties in measuring the performance of service management, defining and deploying the roles and responsibilities of service management, allocating the resources for right service improvements and adopting the service-oriented process culture.
