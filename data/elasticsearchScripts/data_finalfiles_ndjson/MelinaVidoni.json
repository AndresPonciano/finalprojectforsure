{"title": "A systemic approach to define and characterize Advanced Planning Systems (APS)\n", "abstract": " Advanced Planning Systems (APS) have become an important tool for manufacturing and production companies that require a specific system to optimize production, logistic, material and human resources, etc. with the goal of improving the economy of the companies and offer a good customer service. An APS must be integrated to the Enterprise\u2019s System (such as an ERP), but this task usually lacks of a specific methodology to be performed and is generally made ad-hoc. With the ultimate objective to provide an approach to facilitate this integration, this work presents a characterization of the APS from a systemic point of view, using standardized Software Engineering concepts. The idea is to provide a definition and characterization of Advanced Planning Systems, by establishing the main goals of this type of system, and considering Functional Requirements, Quality Attributes and a reference model for the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "26\n", "authors": ["1342"]}
{"title": "An intelligent agent for ERP's data structure analysis based on ANSI/ISA-95 standard\n", "abstract": " This paper presents an intelligent agent to analyze the ERP's (Enterprise Resource Planning) system data structure and its compliance on the ANSI/ISA-95 standard. The knowledge base of the agent is generated using the manufacturing categories information provided by mentioned standard. The approach proposes an infrastructure of a knowledge-based agent that interacts with the database of an ERP system, in order to classify the information of ERP's database tables according to the standard. Several study cases are evaluated and the results obtained are shown in different graphs. This is a first step to improve the interoperability between an Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) system that needs to be integrated with ERP's especially in manufacturing and production companies.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1342"]}
{"title": "Towards a Reference Architecture for Advanced Planning Systems.\n", "abstract": " Advanced Planning Systems (APS) are important for production companies that seek the optimization of its operations. However there are gaps between the companies\u2019 needs and its implementation in the Enterprise Systems, such as the lack of a commonly accepted definition, the short insight on its software architecture, and the absence of Software Engineering (SE) approaches to this type of system. Consequently, it is important to study APSs from a SE point of view. The motivation of this work is to present a Reference Architecture for APS, providing a standard-based characterization and a framework to simplify the design, development and implementation of APS. Therefore, two views are presented, which are based on the\" 4+ 1\" View Model endorsed by the international standard ISO/IEC 42010: 2011; those Views are represented using UML diagrams and they are described including variation points for a number of possible situations.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1342"]}
{"title": "Agile operational research\n", "abstract": " As project management has become a critical subject in modern-world organisations, Operational Research (OR) needs to incorporate mechanisms to deal with rapid, unplanned changes as well as confusing information and stakeholders with conflicting values. Agile methods are widely used and tested in Software Engineering (SE) to deal with problems of the characteristics above. Because of this, after establishing that both OR interventions, as well as SE developments, have common stages and information evolution, this proposal aims to pose the challenge of applying agility to manage OR projects. Guidelines to adapt Agile Methodologies to OR are proposed, and a case vignette is studied as an initial test. Finally, future lines of work are considered to define how the larger project in which this proposal is embedded will continue.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1342"]}
{"title": "E2OL: Sistema de Planeamiento y Scheduling Personalizable e Integrable con ERPs\n", "abstract": " Los sistemas conocidos como Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) surgieron con el objetivo de proveer funcionalidades avanzadas en el planeamiento y scheduling, intentando mejorar las capacidades que los ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) poseen en esa \u00e1rea. Se han realizado muchas investigaciones pertinentes, pero aquellas que realmente lograron implementarse, fueron llevadas a cabo para empresas particulares, o como \u201caplicaciones empaquetadas\u201d que utilizan modelos matem\u00e1ticos gen\u00e9ricos para su funcionamiento. La investigaci\u00f3n presentada en este trabajo propone un sistema denominado E2OL (ERP to Optimizer Linkage), que posee las caracter\u00edsticas de los APS, pero permitiendo que la empresa que desee implementarlo pueda utilizar sus propios modelos matem\u00e1ticos, a su vez de integrarlo con el sistema empresarial que utilice. E2OL no se ata a un ERP, sistema de gesti\u00f3n de bases de datos, optimizador o modelos matem\u00e1ticos, habilitando la modificaci\u00f3n controlada del mismo y su adaptabilidad a diversos entornos; se trata de un sistema desarrollado en Java, portable y amigable al usuario que permite considerar las caracter\u00edsticas m\u00e1s particulares de cada negocio donde se implemente. E2OL est\u00e1 acompa\u00f1ado por su sistema complementario E2OL Configurer, el cual presenta todas las herramientas necesarias para adaptar a E2OL-de forma guiada y transparente-a la empresa donde se desee implementar, sin la necesidad de modificar el c\u00f3digo, o invertir tiempo en la adaptaci\u00f3n del mismo.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1342"]}
{"title": "Analysis, design and development of advanced planning systems\n", "abstract": " Small and medium-sized organisations (SMO) often need to optimise their operations to improve their effectiveness in a competitive world. Advanced planning systems (APS) emerged to provide optimal operations in several areas of an organisation, including production planning and scheduling, logistics, financial, among others. Currently, there is a gap in the literature regarding proposals, from a software engineering perspective, to assist SMOs in the design and development of APS systems. This article proposes an architecture for the APS domain that supports the implementation of specific applications and can be adapted through variation points. The proposal is evaluated with architecture trade-off analysis method (ATAM) involving two different groups of stakeholders. Also, a process is included to show how to use the architecture in the implementation of a specific case.

{"title": "An Empirical Framework to Applying Unit Testing in Operational Research\n", "abstract": " Operational Research (OR) models usually deal with uncertain, changing requirements. This leads to a continuous process of adapting and reworking the mathematical code. However, there are scarce mechanisms to control its quality. This is essential to Software Engineering (SE), as it enforces the use of Unit Testing: automatically running tests after any alterations, to assess specific parts of the code. This is done to discover where and how errors are happening, simplifying its correction while evaluating their possible ramifications. This article aims to define how these concepts can be adapted to them, how tests should be used to detect faults and to provide a workflow to use them while developing an OR model. It provides guidelines on what should be tested and what to expect of possible errors and a process to use it.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1342"]}
{"title": "Project and Team-Based Strategies for Teaching Software Architecture\n", "abstract": " Software Architecture remains a difficult topic to teach. This is because of the problem?s complexity, and the integration of interpersonal and technical skills with knowledge from different areas. This paper presents the introduction of Project-Based Learning (PBL) and Team-Based Learning (TBL) in a Software Architecture undergraduate course. The goal for students is to apply in practice the concepts learned using ATAM (Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) to evaluate case studies of real-world architecture. PBL is known for allowing students to experiment with realistic problems and improve their negotiation and communication skills. TBL offers a different approach to group-based activities, by using them to determine the structure of the course. This approach is applied in an optional course in a Systems Engineering degree; its results are positive, having increased students? attendance and active participation levels. A student survey also shows acceptance of the new methodology.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1342"]}
