{"title": "Dealing with risk: a practical approach\n", "abstract": " Most software projects take place in a volatile environment in which many dangers exist that may affect the successful outcome of the project. After completion of the project an evaluation may show that many of the problems encountered during the project could have been foreseen before they actually occurred. Risk management is an approach that is aimed at predicting the occurrence of this type of problem and at taking counter measures to either prevent them from affecting the project or to soften their impact. In this paper the basic activities related to risk management are described. Furthermore a concrete method aimed at supporting risk management is presented. This method has been used successfully in practice. Some of the results obtained by using it are presented on the basis of five cases. Some conclusions are that:(1) the use of a short and structured checklist will ease identification of and discussions\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "120\n", "authors": ["416"]}

Because of the practical difficulties of obtaining hard project-specific defect data, an approach was taken that relied upon accumulated expert knowledge. The accumulated expert knowledge based approach was found to be a practical alternative to an in-depth defect causal analysis on a per-project basis. Defect injection causes are concentrated in the Requirements Specification phases. Thus defect dispersion is likely to increase, as requirements specifications are input for derived requirements specifications in multiple, related sub-projects.

To manage the resulting organizational complexity, projects need a lifecycle that explicitly reflects the concurrent and distributed nature of the project context.

An adequately modeled lifecycle allows the localization and recognition of defect-sensitive areas in complex product development. A case study involving real-life development projects indicates that transitions between constituent sub-projects are in particular defect-sensitive. A second case study shows that by a defect detection-driven construction of a project-specific lifecycle, fewer residual defects can be expected.", "num_citations": "36\n", "authors": ["416"]}

Value is in particular based on co-creation with customers, making use of their experiences and leading to so-called integrated solutions. The longitudinal view on relationships with customers requires networked collaboration of multiple partners with their mutual customers within the context of a product-service system (PSS) value network. A customer-centric view on solution offerings motivates PSS value networks to enhance their understanding of customers\u2019 needs. To achieve a shared understanding of customers\u2019 needs across a network, customer knowledge can be seen as a prerequisite. Prior research has been primarily focused on an intra-organizational perspective on customer knowledge management (CKM), in which customer knowledge (CK) is obtained in a one-to-one relationship. In the context of PSS value networks, besides the individual CK of each partner, CK is also co-created through the interaction of several partners with customers during solution processes. However, this asks for a broader conceptualization of CKM. Moreover, a long term relationship with customers demonstrates new opportunities for CKM. Hence, a firm-centric approach is inadequate for managing the network-level processes of CK creation, storage/retrieval, transfer, and application across a PSS value network. Based on a systematic literature review on both CKM within a PSS value network, and collaborative knowledge management, we present in this paper a conceptual framework of the value network customer knowledge management (VN-CKM) lifecycle\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "25\n", "authors": ["416"]}

Our objective is to propose a coherent set of definitions for data governance and information governance within and across organisations in relation with data and information as underlying concepts. As a research method, we explore elements from existing definitions in literature about the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom pyramid and about data governance and information governance. Classification of these elements and coding them in concepts during discussions among peers resulted in a new vocabulary.

Organizational agility fosters sustainable competitive advantage under these turbulent conditions. Prior research demonstrated that strategic IT alignment could enhance organizational agility. Many organizations implemented an enterprise architecture management (EAM) function to achieve benefits such as strategic IT alignment and agility. However, there is little research that explains the pathways between these focal concepts. Hence, we ground our work in the dynamic capabilities view and develop a conceptual model to explain how EAM investments lead to agility mediated by strategic IT alignment. We conducted survey research and collected a sample of 110 respondents. Based on this dataset, we performed a PLS-SEM and cluster analysis to test our model and associated hypotheses. Our results indicate that EAM enhances organizational agility. Strategic IT alignment mediates this effect.

Becoming more agile is an essential capability for organizations and a necessity to respond to the rapidly changing environment. The way these EA benefits are established is seen as complex and involves interconnections of multiple organizational facets. However, currently, there is a lack of empirical studies on EA and how it contributes to benefit realization. Moreover, empirically validated work on EA processes is even more scarce. This research addresses this gap and investigates the effect of an EA management approach on organizational agility. A conceptual model was developed proposing a mediation effect of IT capabilities on the relationship between enterprise architecture management and agility. A survey was performed among key EA stakeholders. Based on a sample of 110 responses, a partial least squares structural equation modeling analysis was performed to test the mediation model. The results indicate that the effect of enterprise architecture management on organizational agility is indeed mediated by IT capabilities.

With respect to concrete software architectures several evaluation methods exist, for example the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM). These methods evaluate in particular system quality attributes. Architectural qualities, ie reflecting the quality of the architecture itself, are hardly addressed. This paper investigates the architectural qualities of reference architectures. We present a set of extensions for an architecture evaluation method in order to evaluate the quality of a reference architecture. The set of extensions is validated in a case study.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["416"]}

De productspecificaties zijn onduidelijk, onvolledig en instabiel, verantwoordelijkheden en bevoegdheden zijn niet helder, bij ontwikkelaars is weinig materiekennis aanwezig, er is weinig inzicht in kosten en baten enzovoort. In dit artikel staat het managen van risico\u2019s bij automatiseringsprojecten centraal. Begonnen wordt met een redelijk uitvoerige beschrijving van risico\u2019s bij automatiseringsprojecten, van risicomanagement en van methoden van risicomanagement. Na deze aanloop worden twee hypothesen geformuleerd, waarmee \u2014 indien bewaarheid \u2014 bestaande tekortkomingen van risicomanagement voor een deel kunnen worden opgeheven.

It is traditionally associated with risk and failure. But complexity also works: it delivers functionality, creativity, innovation. This paper proposes a conceptual framework to support IT Project Complexity Management in a structured, systematic way, consisting of the following processes: plan, identify, analyze, plan response strategies, monitor and control. The processes interact with each other and with other project management processes; they overlap, are incremental and iterative. They are described in terms of inputs and outputs, with a detailed inventory of available tools and techniques proposed for each process and step.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["416"]}

Because of the influence of non-controllable variables, it actually seems to be impossible to directly compute or determine the contribution of Information Systems to organizational performance, or to overall organizational effectiveness. As an alternative, perception of system success is often used as a surrogate measure. However, this raises the question of the validity of this surrogate measure.

It is assumed that these processes are organised in the form of a project. Such a project can be managed and carried out by the organisation requiring the software itself, or by an outside service company with various types and degrees of participation.In spite of progress made in the field of constructing software during the past decades, it can easily be defended that software engineering is still in its childhood. Although today less projects end in total failure than in the early days of Information Technology, still frequently budgets are over-run, committed delivery dates are violated and users are dissatisfied if not disappointed with the end-result. The bottom-line is that the net returns from such newly developed systems are less than foreseen at the start of the project. The logical question arising from this situation is; what can be done to minimise the probability of these undesirable effects? This touches the essence of risk management, as risk management in general focuses on ways for reducing the discrepancies between the intended and the actual outcomes of human endeavour.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["416"]}

Selecting requirements however is difficult. Despite all work done on this problem, known as the next release problem, what is missing, is a comprehensive overview of the factors that complicate selecting software requirements. This paper aims at getting such overview. The authors performed a systematic literature review, searching for occurrences in the literature where a causal relation was suggestedbetween certain conditions and the difficulty of selecting software requirements. Analyzing 544 papers led to 156 findings. Clustering them resulted in 33 complicating factors that were classified in eight groups. The complicating factors were validated in semi-structured interviews with twelve experts from three different industrial organizations. These interviews consisted of questions about participant\u2019s experiences with the complicating factors, and of questions how these factors complicated selecting requirements. The results aid in getting a better understanding of the complexity of selecting requirements.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["416"]}

{"title": "Specifying general activity clusters for erp projects aimed at effort prediction\n", "abstract": " ERP implementation projects affect large parts of an implementing organization and lead to changes in the way an organization performs its tasks. The costs needed for the effort to implement these systems are hard to estimate. Research indicates that the size of an ERP project can be a useful measurement for predicting the effort required to complete an ERP implementation project. However, such a metric does not yet exist. Therefore research should be carried out to find a set of variables which can define the size of an ERP project. The authors hypothesize that ERP projects consist of a collection of clusters of activities with their own focus on implementation costs and project size. This was confirmed in a survey among domain experts. This chapter describes a first step in retrieving these clusters.

When customizing these packages, most organizations only take into account the extra costs during the implementation phase and neglect the ongoing use and maintenance costs. A reason for this is the lack of a good estimation tool which can be used to estimate the expected use and maintenance cost as a function of the degree of customization (DOC). To develop such a tool, data should be gathered from practice on degree of customization and cost of use and maintenance but in order to be able to do that first a validated measurement instrument is needed. This research focuses on developing and validating such an instrument which can be used to quantify the DOC and estimate the cost of use and maintenance.

Introduction Recent years have shown an increase in the total expenditure for heaith services in the Netherlands from 7.3 billion dutch guilders in 1970 to 31.9 billion in 1982, an increase of 337% compared with a rise in the cost of living of 12~% in the same period. If you look at these figures you will not find it strange that there has been a growing call for cost control, expecially if you take in mind the economic situation, which is not exactly flourishing. This problem is not confined to the Netherlands only. In other countries researches have been'carried out in order to control expenditure and to increase the efficiency of health service institutions. One of the methods by which this is attempted is operational research, with the aid of which studies are made into the efficiency of operations and. the optimal deployement of resouv. ces. A general overview of work in this area can be found in Stimson and Stimson (111), in Milsum', Turban and Vertinsky (80), and more. recently in Boldy and 0'Kane (12). The scope of the following review will be confined to the subject of hospitals. I will look at the possibilities of controlling the inflow of patients into the hospital. First a description will be given of the system under consideration, the means of controlling this system and the measures by which the performance of the system may be judged. Then the subjects of length of stay, census, waiting lists and emergency patients, which all have their influence on the system, will be discuss, ed, and an overview will be given of existing models.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["416"]}
{"title": "Reference Model for Generic Capabilities in Maturity Models\n", "abstract": " Many Maturity Models (MMs) have been designed for over 40 years now but selecting the constructs which chart the application areas is at variance. When comparing MMs, application area-specific constructs appear to be divers. Nevertheless, some constructs are often similar. This research aims at finding generic constructs in existing MMs as reference for con-structing MMs. We conducted literature research for generic MM constructs in organisational readiness MMs. We applied card sorting as a classification method and sorted cards according to Metaplan technique with peers. This research resulted in a limited set of generic capabilities for constructing MMs. Organising these capabilities according to widely accepted reference models in Information Systems (IS) literature results in the Generic Capability Reference (GCR) model. The GCR model serves as a reference model for (re-) designing MMs for the part\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["416"]}

{"title": "The impact of lean techniques on factors influencing defect injection in software development.\n", "abstract": " In this paper we will focus on the impact that lean may have in preventing the injection of defects. We will research the impact of a number of lean techniques on defect injection factors. Date have been obtained from a single large Dutch governmental organization which has been using lean techniques routinely for more than three years. To investigate the impact of lean on defect injection we developed a survey which focused on the perceptions of the software developers of this organisation. The results suggest that the link between lean techniques and factors influencing defect injection is real and they explain to a certain extent the positive impact of the usage of lean techniques on software productivity.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["416"]}
{"title": "Structuring Software Measurement\n", "abstract": " This paper presents results of a case study in a software engineering department of a large industrial company. This software engineering department struggles with the monitoring and control of the performance of software projects. The current measurement processes doesn\u2019t provide adequate and sufficient information to both project and organisational management. Based on an analysis of the current measurement processes four guidelines for measurement process improvement have been proposed. Following these guidelines a three-level feedback loop has been developed and been implemented. This multi-level feedback loop distinguishes measurement, analysis and improvement on respectively the project, the multi-project and the organisational level. In the context of this feedback loop new \u2018process oriented\u2019metrics have been identified in collaboration with project and organisational management. Preliminary results show that these \u2018process oriented\u2019metrics, ie regarding different types of effort deviations, provide useful insights in the performance of software projects for managers on the different levels of the implemented feedback loops.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["416"]}
{"title": "Process mining support for CMMI-based software process assessment, in principle and in practice\n", "abstract": " Currently used software process improvement methods such as the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) rely in their process assessments on information, which is gathered during interviews, in oral audit sessions, and from quality manuals and process standard reviews. Although valuable information about software processes can be gained in these assessments, the resulting data quality can be improved upon. This paper investigates the potential of process mining to support current software process assessment and improvement approaches. Based on an analysis of CMMI from a process mining perspective, particular CMMI model components are identified for which it is in principle possible to apply process mining techniques. Subsequently, criteria have been defined to select, with respect to these particular CMMI components, software processes for which process mining has an added value. These criteria have been applied in the selection of a particular'minable'software process, ie a change control process. Subsequently the results of a case study from industrial practice, on the process mining of a Change Control Board process, are used to illustrate that process mining can provide CMMI assessors with relevant information. This information reflects the actual or'real'software processes in practice and as such it offers an excellent basis to support assessors in understanding the'actual'software processes.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["416"]}
{"title": "Data from configuration management tools as sources for software process mining\n", "abstract": " Process mining has proven to be a valuable approach that provides new and objective insights into processes within organizations. Based on sets of wellstructured data, the underlying \u2018actual\u2019processes can be extracted and process models can be constructed automatically, ie, the process model can be \u2018mined\u2019. Successful process mining depends on the availability of wellstructured and suitable data. This paper investigates the potential of software configuration management (SCM) and SCM-tools for software process mining. In a validation section, data collected by a SCM tool in practice are used to apply process-mining techniques on a particular software process, ie, a Change Control Board (CCB) process in a large industrial company. Application of process mining techniques revealed that although people tend to believe that formally specified and well-documented processes are followed, the \u2018actual\u2019process in practice is different. Control-flow discovery revealed that in the CCB process in most of the cases, ie, 70%, an important CCB task \u2018Analysis\u2019 was skipped.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["416"]}

{"title": "Market Analysis of Disruptive Innovations: Concept Testing in an Innovative Environment\n", "abstract": " Innovation is often the key for companies to survive for many years. Being able to react to changes in the environment and to innovate in order to stay ahead of competition is very important. Adidas has this ability as it has expanded in 85 years from a small shoe company into a large international company offering a wide range of products. Recently research has started on intelligent sports equipment in which electronics are combined with sports. Combining electronics in sports equipment provides many opportunities and early products on the market show great potential. In recent years most of the innovation for Adidas has been on \u201cthe firm\u201d. Innovations directed to \u201cthe firm\u201d are mostly production related and therefore invisible for customers. Innovation in \u201cthe market\u201d and \u201ctechnology\u201d has been smaller and therefore mostly incremental. The development of products in which steps are made in \u201cthe market\u201d and \u201ctechnology\u201d has for years been based on a similar model. In this model Adidas aims its development firstly on high-end athletes. These products and ideas, developed for the high-end athletes, are in the following phase used for the development of products for the lower segments. This is also the case in running equipment. Running is an excellent sport for people interested in getting or staying fit and improving health. In the last decades more and more health related problems (such as obesity) have arisen in the world. These are mostly due to bad nutrition and less opportunities for exercise in the lifestyles of people. Running could play a major role in aiding these health problems, but it is clear that the focus should not be directed to the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["416"]}
