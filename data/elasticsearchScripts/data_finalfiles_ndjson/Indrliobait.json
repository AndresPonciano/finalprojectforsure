Patterns and relations in such data often evolve over time, thus, models built for analyzing such data quickly become obsolete over time. In machine learning and data mining this phenomenon is referred to as concept drift. The objective is to deploy models that would diagnose themselves and adapt to changing data over time. This chapter provides an application oriented view towards concept drift research, with a focus on supervised learning tasks. First we overview and categorize application tasks for which the problem of concept drift is particularly relevant. Then we construct a reference framework for positioning application tasks within a spectrum of problems related to concept drift.

When discovering a process model from event logs, it is assumed that the process at the beginning of the recorded period is the same as the process at the end of the recorded period. Obviously, this is often not the case due to the phenomenon known as concept drift. While cases are being handled, the process itself may be changing.

Processes may change suddenly or gradually. The drift may be periodic (e.g., because of seasonal influences) or one-of-a-kind (e.g., the effects of new legislation). For the process management, it is crucial to discover and understand such concept drifts in processes. This paper presents a generic framework and specific techniques to detect when a process changes and to localize the parts of the process that have changed. Different features are proposed to characterize relationships among activities. These features are used to discover differences between successive populations.

For a fixed'transition period'around the change, we derive a generic relationship between the size of the moving window and the classification error rate. We derive expressions for the error in the transition period and for the optimal window size for the case of two Gaussian classes where the concept change is a geometrical displacement of the whole class configuration in the space.

We propose a new active learning method for evolving data streams based on a combination of density and prediction uncertainty (DBALStream). Our approach decides to label an instance or not, considering whether it lies in an high density partition of the data space. This allows focusing labelling efforts in the instance space where more data is concentrated; hence, the benefits of learning a more accurate classifier are expected to be higher.

Anomalies are prominent in areas dominated by pastoralism, such as the Sahel in Africa, suggesting humancompetitive pressure against the wild animal communities. Question: What might explain such dental ecometric anomalies? Data: Occurrence of large, plant-eating mammals worldwide; quantitative characteristics of their teeth; global net primary productivity derived from temperature and precipitation relationships.Analyses: We analyse dental ecometrics of present-day Africa, with the aim to understand the ecology behind such anomalies. By identifying dental traits that are differentially sensitive to human activities, we can develop tailored models for accurate reconstruction of tropical habitats while taking human activities into account. Results: A combination of dental crown height and reinforcement of cusps helps to distinguish continuous, moist forests from patchy forest fragments within arid grasslands. We demonstrate how dental traits that have different sensitivity to competition with livestock can capture anthropogenic effects on wild animal communities in climatically sensitive zones. We produce a methodology for understanding the present and guiding the future of terrestrial ecosystems.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["1071"]}

In many real world applications the values of some attributes are not only observable, but can be proactively chosen by a decision maker.

For example, a direct marketing manager can choose the color of an envelope (actionable attribute), in which the offer is sent to a client, hoping that the right choice will result in a positive response with a higher probability.

Here, we use a data mining method, namely redescription mining, to discover and analyze patterns of association between large herbivorous mammals and their environments via their functional traits. We focus on functional properties of animal teeth, characterized using a recently developed dental trait scoring scheme. The teeth of herbivorous mammals serve as an interface to obtain energy from food, and are therefore expected to match the types of plant food available in their environment. Hence, dental traits are expected to carry a signal of environmental conditions. We analyze a global compilation of occurrences of large herbivorous mammals and of bioclimatic conditions. We identify common patterns of association between dental traits distributions and bioclimatic conditions and discuss their implications. Each pattern can be considered as a computational biome. Our analysis distinguishes three global zones, which we refer to as the boreal-temperate moist zone, the tropical moist zone and the tropical-subtropical dry zone. The boreal-temperate moist zone is mainly characterized by seasonal cold temperatures, a lack of hypsodonty and a high share of species with obtuse lophs. The tropical moist zone is mainly characterized by high temperatures, high isothermality, abundant precipitation and a high share of species with acute rather than obtuse lophs.

Several repairs for selected algorithms have already been proposed, but the underlying mechanisms how such discrimination happens from the computational perspective are not yet scientifically understood. We need to develop theoretical understanding how algorithms may become discriminatory, and establish fundamental machine learning principles for prevention. We need to analyze machine learning process as a whole to systematically explain the roots of discrimination occurrence, which will allow to devise global machine learning optimization criteria for guaranteed prevention, as opposed to pushing empirical constraints into existing algorithms case-by-case.

In addition to defending our original interpretation, we will clarify some terms used in our paper, as we feel that much of the apparent discrepancy may actually reflect differences in terminology.We used the term savannah in a broad sense, common in Neogene and Quaternary palaeoecology 3, meaning a woodland to grassland biome characterized by co-dominance of trees and grasses 4\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1071"]}

Otherwise, the energy required by the wireless communication of raw sensor data will prohibit battery lifetime, the backbone of IoT. One option to achive this intelligence is to implement a variety of machine learning algorithms on the IoT sensor instead of the cloud. Shown here is sub-milliwatt machine learning accelerator operating at the Ultra-Low Voltage Minimum-Energy Point. The accelerator is a Transport Triggered Architecture (TTA) Application-Specific Instruction-Set Processor (ASIP) targeted for running various Machine Learning algorithms. The ASIP is implemented in 28\u00a0nm FDSOI (Fully Depleted Silicon On Insulator) CMOS process, with an operating voltage of 0.35\u00a0V, and is capable of 5.3pJ/cycle and 1.8nJ/iteration when performing conventional machine learning algorithms.

{"title": "Handling concept drift in medical applications: Importance, challenges and solutions\n", "abstract": " In the real world data is often non stationary. In supervised learning, concept drift means that the statistical properties of the target variable, which the model aims to predict, change over time unexpectedly. This causes problems because the predictions might become less accurate as the time passes or opportunities to improve the accuracy might be missed. With the proposed tutorial we intend to reach the following goals: 1) highlight the importance of concept drift handling mechanisms in medical applications; 2) overview existing approaches for handling different types of drift in supervised learning, emphasizing the underlying assumptions that these approaches implicitly or explicitly make about the nature and causes of changes; 3) discuss practical aspects of applying drift handling mechanisms to a wide range of medical applications and present a foreseen development in this field.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1071"]}

The editor John Brockman, a highly accomplished literary agent, has mingled with the elites of the arts and sciences since the 1960s, gathering news and views, sharing gossip and highlighting unanswered questions. The essays are sequenced and interleaved by intros and various anecdotes from the editor, such that the collection almost reads like a monograph. The themes stream from machines, via human minds, to forms of dissidence and control in society, and then back to AI and the future of civilization. The book stays clear from discussing anthropomorphic cyborgs or ever-advancing hardware solutions; it is essentially about how the mind works, artificial or real, and makes for an enjoyable read.

{"title": "Dental functional morphology predicts the scaling of chewing rate in mammals\n", "abstract": " How food intake and mastication scale to satisfy the metabolic needs of mammals has been the subject of considerable scientific debate. Existing theory suggests that the negative allometric scaling of metabolic rate with body mass is compensated by a matching allometric scaling of the chewing rate. Why empirical studies have found that the scaling coefficients of the chewing rate seem to be systematically smaller than expected from theory remains unknown. Here we explain this imparity by decoupling the functional surface area of teeth from overall surface area. The functional surface area is relatively reduced in forms emphasizing linear edges (e.g., lophodont) compared with forms lacking linear structures (e.g., bunodont). In forms with reduced relative functional surface, the deficit in food processed per chew appears to be compensated for by increased chewing rate, such that the metabolic requirements are\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1071"]}
{"title": "A survey of computational methods for fossil data analysis\n", "abstract": " Aim: to survey and organize computational approaches to fossil data analysis into a methodological framework; to highlight what kind of research questions about evolutionary and environmental change can be answered by applying computational algorithms to mammal fossil data to better understand past ecosystems and climates.Questions: What kind of models have been used for what research questions? What is their scope of application? What are their potential limitations?Search methods: The literature selection is based on our personal knowledge, as well as keyword-based searches. Papers are considered relevant if data-driven computational methods are used for analyzing relationships between organisms and their environments at evolutionary time scales.Conclusions: We demonstrate that different research questions may be answered with the same computational algorithm, and different algorithms may be needed to answer the same question in different contexts. Our position is that in order to move forward we need to match knowledge of methods with knowledge of the fossil record in a research question-driven way. Figure 2 presents a proposed workflow. Following this framework, we survey existing work and highlight what research questions can potentially be answered with which methods, some of which may not have been reported in the evolutionary paleontology literature yet. The outcome of this survey is a proposal for a research agenda in computational fossil data analysis.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1071"]}

We studied the applicability of data-driven approach ie different regression models in analysing high-dimensional data set including continuous and comprehensive measurements over meteorology, ecosystemscale water and carbon fluxes and the annual variation in the growth of app. 50-year-old Scots pine stand in southern Finland. Even though our dataset covered only 16 years, it is the most extensive collection of interactions between a Scots pine ecosystem and atmosphere. The analysis revealed that height growth was favoured by high water potential of the tree and carbon gain during the bud forming period and high water potential during the elongation period. Diameter growth seemed to be favoured by a winter with high precipitation and deep snow cover and a spring with high carbon gain. The obtained models had low generalization performance and they would require more evaluation and iterative validation to achieve credibility perhaps as a mixture of data-driven and first principle modeling approaches.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1071"]}
{"title": "Predicting Position of a Functional Target from an External Marker in Radiotherapy.\n", "abstract": " The main goal of radiotherapy is to destroy the tumor while minimizing harm to nearby healthy tissue. Advances in the digital control have enabled planning and performing accurate treatments. However, todays technology is unable to compensate respiration induced motion, and therefore, ensure sufficient precision. One of the tasks in compensating respiratory motion is predicting position of the functional target (tumor) from an external marker during fraction. Performance of techniques, such as Pearson correlation, Gaussian filters, Fourries transformation, cross correlation, linear interpolation and partial-least squares, still leave plenty space for the improvement. We reports results of work in progress, ie experiments of applying different types of regressions to predict motion of functional target from different external markers. Results seem to be promising in most of the cases.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1071"]}

{"title": "Application of multiple linear regression for indirect tracking of functional target for respiratory compensation in radiotherapy\n", "abstract": " The main goal of radiotherapy is to eliminate cancerous tumors from the patient body while limiting damage to healthy tissue. Current technologies allow rather precise and effective treatment. However, respiratory motion management still remains a considerable issue. A number of different solutions, such as gating or restricted breathing, can be used for addressing this issue, but the majority of them compensate for respiratory motion only partially, while considerably extending the treatment time. In this paper we investigate multiple linear regression as a tool for predicting the position of the functional target (tumor) from an external marker. This study extends our previous work, where a standard linear regression, and a linear regression with first-order autoregressive errors were analyzed. Our computational analysis suggests that using the proposed approach for prediction of lung tumor motion is expected to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1071"]}
{"title": "Predictive user modeling with actionable attributes\n", "abstract": " Different machine learning techniques have been proposed and used for modeling individual and group user needs, interests and preferences. In the traditional predictive modeling instances are described by observable variables, called attributes. The goal is to learn a model for predicting the target variable for unseen instances. For example, for marketing purposes a company consider profiling a new user based on her observed web browsing behavior, referral keywords or other relevant information. In many real world applications the values of some attributes are not only observable, but can be actively decided by a decision maker. Furthermore, in some of such applications the decision maker is interested not only to generate accurate predictions, but to maximize the probability of the desired outcome. For example, a direct marketing manager can choose which type of a special offer to send to a client (actionable attribute), hoping that the right choice will result in a positive response with a higher probability. We study how to learn to choose the value of an actionable attribute in order to maximize the probability of a desired outcome in predictive modeling. We emphasize that not all instances are equally sensitive to changes in actions. Accurate choice of an action is critical for those instances, which are on the borderline (e.g. users who do not have a strong opinion one way or the other). We formulate three supervised learning approaches for learning to select the value of an actionable attribute at an instance level. We also introduce a focused training procedure which puts more emphasis on the situations where varying the action is the most\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1071"]}
