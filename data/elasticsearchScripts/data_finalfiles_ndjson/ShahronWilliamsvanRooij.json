{"title": "Scaffolding project-based learning with the project management body of knowledge (PMBOK\u00ae)\n", "abstract": " This paper reports the results of a study of the extent to which processes and procedures from the discipline of project management can scaffold online project-based learning in a graduate-level instructional technology course, by facilitating intra-team interaction, enhancing project outcomes and promoting a positive project team experience. With one course section using tools and templates from project management and one section using only free-form text forms and instructor guidelines as project scaffolding tools, team interactions were compared via qualitative and quantitative analyses of team threaded discussions over an 8-week project lifecycle. Project outcomes were assessed by comparing project product scores using the t-test for independent samples, while project experience was assessed via a post-project survey using the University of Wisconsin-Madison Student Assessment of Learning Gains\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "167\n", "authors": ["875"]}

This paper describes the results of a case study of collaboration between the Instructional Design and Technology faculty and the Assistive Technology Initiative (ATI) group at a 4-year public institution to address both of these issues simultaneously during the development of an online course designed to teach undergraduates to cultivate the self-discipline and self-direction required to become successful online learners.

{"title": "Project management in instructional design: ADDIE is not enough\n", "abstract": " In the digital age, instructional designers must possess both a sound instructional design knowledge base and solid project management skills that will enable them to complete courseware projects on time, on budget and in conformance with client expectations. Project management skills include the ability to apply repeatable processes, along with interpersonal skills such as communication and leadership skills. However, courses in project management are often absent from the higher education instructional design curriculum, creating a gap between what is learned in instructional design programmes and real\u2010world practice. In this paper, the author draws on the education and project management fields to examine this gap.

Open Source is presumed to be more flexible and less costly than commercial software.

A Web survey was conducted among 103 public and private sector organizations worldwide that develop educational/training products. Results show no significant difference by project management maturity level in the roles of instructional designer and project manager, although there is some relationship between maturity level and how organizations perceive the skills/competencies of project managers versus those of instructional designers.

This article critically examines the current state of research on the use of systematic instructional design procedures to develop work\u2010related training that is inclusive of older workers. The review reveals a disconnect between what the literature recommends to achieve age\u2010inclusive design and what is offered as evidence of age\u2010inclusive design. Age\u2010related generalizations about cognition and learning capacity often serve as the basis for design decisions, with little attention paid to the role of training context and content.

The study also explored reactions to a concept for outsourcing campus-wide deployment and maintenance of open source. Data collected from telephone interviews were analyzed, emergent themes identified, and a model of differentiators of open source versus commercial software was created, which was then used to evaluate reactions to the outsourcing concept. Interviews revealed perceived barriers to open source adoption and the extent to which the outsourcing concept could alleviate risks. Recommendations for overcoming adoption barriers are offered and future research opportunities identified to ensure that open source software applications are both technically efficient and supportive of engaged learning.", "num_citations": "59\n", "authors": ["875"]}
