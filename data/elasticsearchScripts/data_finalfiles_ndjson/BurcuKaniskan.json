{"title": "The performance of RMSEA in models with small degrees of freedom\n", "abstract": " Given that the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) is currently one of the most popular measures of goodness-of-model fit within structural equation modeling (SEM), it is important to know how well the RMSEA performs in models with small degrees of freedom (df). Unfortunately, most previous work on the RMSEA and its confidence interval has focused on models with a large df. Building on the work of Chen et al. to examine the impact of small df on the RMSEA, we conducted a theoretical analysis and a Monte Carlo simulation using correctly specified models with varying df and sample size. The results of our investigation indicate that when the cutoff values are used to assess the fit of the properly specified models with small df and small sample size, the RMSEA too often falsely indicates a poor fitting model. We recommend not computing the RMSEA for small df models, especially those with small\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1536\n", "authors": ["1534"]}
{"title": "The effects of differentiated instruction and enrichment pedagogy on reading achievement in five elementary schools\n", "abstract": " This experimental study examined the effect of a differentiated, enriched reading program on students\u2019 oral reading fluency and comprehension using the schoolwide enrichment model\u2013reading (SEM-R). Treatment and control conditions were randomly assigned to 63 teachers and 1,192 second through fifth grade students across five elementary schools. Using multilevel modeling, significant differences favoring the SEM-R were found in reading fluency in two schools (Cohen\u2019s d effect sizes of .33 and .10) and in reading comprehension in the high-poverty urban school (Cohen\u2019s d = .27), with no achievement differences in the remaining schools. These results demonstrate that an enrichment reading approach, with differentiated instruction and less whole group instruction, was as effective as or more effective than a traditional whole group basal approach.", "num_citations": "387\n", "authors": ["1534"]}
{"title": "Using time-varying covariates in multilevel growth models\n", "abstract": " This article provides an illustration of growth curve modeling within a multilevel framework. Specifically, we demonstrate coding schemes that allow the researcher to model discontinuous longitudinal data using a linear growth model in conjunction with time varying covariates. Our focus is on developing a level-1 model that accurately reflects the shape of the growth trajectory. We demonstrate the importance of adequately modeling the shape of the level-1 growth trajectory in order to make inferences about the importance of both level-1 and level-2 predictors.", "num_citations": "99\n", "authors": ["1534"]}
{"title": "Grading as a Reform Effort: Do Standards\u2010Based Grades Converge With Test Scores?\n", "abstract": " Standards\u2010based progress reports (SBPRs) require teachers to grade students using the performance levels reported by state tests and are an increasingly popular report card format. They may help to increase teacher familiarity with state standards, encourage teachers to exclude nonacademic factors from grades, and/or improve communication with parents. The current study examines the SBPR grade\u2013state test score correspondence observed across 2 years in 125 third and fifth grade classrooms located in one school district to examine the degree of consistency between grades and state test results. It also examines the grading practices of a subset of 37 teachers to determine whether there is an association between teacher appraisal style and convergence rates. A moderate degree of grade\u2013test score convergence was observed using three agreement estimates (coefficient kappa, tau\u2010b correlations, and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "71\n", "authors": ["1534"]}
{"title": "Building Resiliency in Families with Young Children Exposed to Violence\n", "abstract": " This study investigated the relationship between risk and protective factors among families with young children who have been exposed to violence and Safe Start treatment outcomes as measured by the Parenting Stress Index\u2013Short Form. Three groups of clients receiving different interventions were studied over the course of two years to investigate changes in parental stress and parent-child interaction. The results suggest that the groups differed in number of needs and protective factors and that these differences were strong predictors of variation in Parenting Stress Index\u2013Short Form scores. Based on this finding, we conclude that families with higher levels of stress require immediate attention and support in linking with services that promote resiliency by reducing parental stress.", "num_citations": "26\n", "authors": ["1534"]}
