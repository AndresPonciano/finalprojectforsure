{"title": "Symbolic controller synthesis for discrete and timed systems\n", "abstract": " This paper presents algorithms for the symbolic synthesis of discrete and real-time controllers. At the semantic level the controller is synthesized by finding a winning strategy for certain games defined by automata or by timed-automata. The algorithms for finding such strategies need, this way or another, to search the state-space of the system which grows exponentially with the number of components. Symbolic methods allow such a search to be conducted without necessarily enumerating the state-space. This is achieved by representing sets of states using formulae (syntactic objects) over state variables. Although in the worst case such methods are as bad as enumerative ones, many huge practical problems can be treated by fine-tuned symbolic methods. In this paper the scope of these methods is extended from analysis to synthesis and from purely discrete systems to real-time systems.

{"title": "Hybridization methods for the analysis of nonlinear systems\n", "abstract": " In this article, we describe some recent results on the hybridization methods for the analysis of nonlinear systems. The main idea of our hybridization approach is to apply the hybrid systems methodology as a systematic approximation method. More concretely, we partition the state space of a complex system into regions that only intersect on their boundaries, and then approximate its dynamics in each region by a simpler one. Then, the resulting hybrid system, which we call a hybridization, is used to yield approximate analysis results for the original system. We also prove important properties of the hybridization, and propose two effective hybridization construction methods, which allow approximating the original nonlinear system with a good convergence rate.", "num_citations": "218\n", "authors": ["1891"]}
{"title": "Reachability analysis of nonlinear systems using conservative approximation\n", "abstract": " In this paper we present an approach to approximate reachability computation for nonlinear continuous systems. Rather than studying a complex nonlinear system x = g(x), we study an approximating system x = f(x) which is easier to handle. The class of approximating systems we consider in this paper is piecewise linear, obtained by interpolating g over a mesh. In order to be conservative, we add a bounded input in the approximating system to account for the interpolation error. We thus develop a reachability method for systems with input, based on the relation between such systems and the corresponding autonomous systems in terms of reachable sets. This method is then extended to the approximate piecewise linear systems arising in our construction. The final result is a reachability algorithm for nonlinear continuous systems which allows to compute conservative approximations with as great degree\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "199\n", "authors": ["1891"]}
{"title": "A Kleene theorem for timed automata\n", "abstract": " In this paper we define timed regular expressions, and extension of regular expressions for specifying sets of dense-time discrete-valued signals. We show that this formalism is equivalent in expressive power to the timed automata of Alur and Dill by providing a translation procedure from expressions to automata and vice versa. the result is extended to /spl omega/-regular expressions (Buchi's theorem).", "num_citations": "160\n", "authors": ["1891"]}
{"title": "Perturbed Turing machines and hybrid systems\n", "abstract": " Investigates the computational power of several models of dynamical systems under infinitesimal perturbations of their dynamics. We consider models for both discrete- and continuous-time dynamical systems: Turing machines, piecewise affine maps, linear hybrid automata and piecewise-constant derivative systems (a simple model of hybrid systems). We associate with each of these models a notion of perturbed dynamics by a small /spl epsi/ (w.r.t. to a suitable metric), and define the perturbed reachability relation as the intersection of all reachability relations obtained by /spl epsi/-perturbations, for all possible values of /spl epsi/. We show that, for the four kinds of models we consider, the perturbed reachability relation is co-recursively enumerable (co-r.e.), and that any co-r.e. relation can be defined as the perturbed reachability relation of such models. A corollary of this result is that systems that are robust (i.e\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "63\n", "authors": ["1891"]}
