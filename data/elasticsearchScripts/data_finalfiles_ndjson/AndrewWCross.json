Unlike classical bits that are subject to only digital bit-flip errors, quantum bits are susceptible to a much larger spectrum of errors, for which any complete quantum error-correcting code must account. Whilst classical bit-flip detection can be realized via a linear array of qubits, a general fault-tolerant quantum error-correcting code requires extending into a higher-dimensional lattice. Here we present a quantum error detection protocol on a two-by-two planar lattice of superconducting qubits.

{"title": "A general purpose architectural layout for arbitrary quantum computations\n", "abstract": " Exploiting recent advances in quantum trapped-ion technologies, we propose a scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computing architecture that overcomes the fundamental challenges of building a full-scale  quantum computer and leaves the fabrication a daunting but primarily  an engineering concern. Using a hierarchical array-based design and a  quantum teleportation communication protocol, we are able to  overcome the primary scalability challenges of reliability, communication, and quantum resource distribution.   In particular, we present a reconfigurable quantum circuit substrate, or \"quantum FPGA'' (qFPGA) which allows efficient implementation of universal quantum gates and error correction.  We  use this qFPGA as a basic building block for an array structure that scalably provides communication channels and quantum resource  distribution.  We exploit a hierarchical combination of ballistic transport of data\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["534"]}
{"title": "Experimental implementation of non-Clifford interleaved randomized benchmarking with a controlled- gate\n", "abstract": " Hardware-efficient transpilation of quantum circuits to a quantum device native gate set is essential for the execution of quantum algorithms on noisy quantum computers. Typical quantum devices utilize a gate set with a single two-qubit Clifford entangling gate per pair of coupled qubits; however, in some applications access to a non-Clifford two-qubit gate can result in more optimal circuit decompositions and also allows more flexibility in optimizing over noise. We demonstrate calibration of a low-error non-Clifford controlled-\u03c0 2 phase (cs) gate on a cloud-based IBM Quantum system using the Qiskit Pulse framework. To measure the gate error of the calibrated cs gate we perform non-Clifford cnot-dihedral interleaved randomized benchmarking. We are able to obtain a gate error of 5.9 (7)\u00d7 10\u2212 3 at a gate length 263 ns, which is close to the coherence limit of the associated qubits, and lower error than the back-end\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["534"]}
{"title": "OpenQASM 3: A broader and deeper quantum assembly language\n", "abstract": " Quantum assembly languages are machine-independent languages that traditionally describe quantum computation in the circuit model. Open quantum assembly language (OpenQASM 2) was proposed as an imperative programming language for quantum circuits based on earlier QASM dialects. In principle, any quantum computation could be described using OpenQASM 2, but there is a need to describe a broader set of quantum circuits beyond the language of qubits and gates. By examining interactive use cases, we recognize two different timescales of quantum-classical interactions: real-time classical computations that must be performed within the coherence times of the qubits, and near-time computations with less stringent timing. Since the near-time domain is adequately described by existing programming frameworks, we choose in OpenQASM 3 to focus on the real-time domain, which must be more tightly coupled to the execution of quantum operations. Motivated by the need for real-time classical computation, we add support for arbitrary control flow as well as calling external classical functions. In addition, we recognize the need to describe circuits at multiple levels of specificity, and therefore we extend the language to include timing, pulse control, and gate modifiers. These new language features create a multi-level intermediate representation for circuit development and optimization, as well as control sequence implementation for calibration, characterization, and error mitigation.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["534"]}
{"title": "Correlated randomized benchmarking\n", "abstract": " To improve the performance of multi-qubit algorithms on quantum devices it is critical to have methods for characterizing non-local quantum errors such as crosstalk. To address this issue, we propose and test an extension to the analysis of simultaneous randomized benchmarking data -- correlated randomized benchmarking. We fit the decay of correlated polarizations to a composition of fixed-weight depolarizing maps to characterize the locality and weight of crosstalk errors. From these errors we introduce a crosstalk metric which indicates the distance to the closest map with only local errors. We demonstrate this technique experimentally with a four-qubit superconducting device and utilize correlated RB to validate crosstalk reduction when we implement an echo sequence.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["534"]}

Quantum software optimizations can provide an accelerated pathway to the first generation of quantum computing (QC) applications that might save years of engineering effort. Current quantum software stacks follow a layered approach similar to the stack of classical computers, which was designed to manage the complexity. In this review, we point out that greater efficiency of QC systems can be achieved by breaking the abstractions between these layers. We review several works along this line, including two hardware-aware compilation optimizations that break the quantum instruction set architecture (ISA) abstraction and two error-correction/information-processing schemes that break the qubit abstraction.

{"title": "Fault-tolerant quantum computer architectures using hierarchies of quantum error-correcting codes\n", "abstract": " Quantum computers have been shown to efficiently solve a class of problems for which no efficient solution is otherwise known. Physical systems can implement quantum computation, but devising realistic schemes is an extremely challenging problem largely due to the effect of noise. A quantum computer that is capable of correctly solving problems more rapidly than modern digital computers requires some use of so-called fault-tolerant components. Code-based fault-tolerance using quantum error-correcting codes is one of the most promising and versatile of the known routes for fault-tolerant quantum computation. This dissertation presents three main, new results about code-based fault-tolerant quantum computer architectures. The first result is a large new family of quantum codes that go beyond stabilizer codes, the most well-studied family of quantum codes. Our new family of codeword stabilized codes contains all known codes with optimal parameters. Furthermore, we show how to systematically find, construct, and understand such codes as a pair of codes: an additive quantum code and a classical (nonlinear) code. Second, we resolve an open question about universality of so-called transversal gates acting on stabilizer codes. Such gates are universal for classical fault-tolerant computation, but they were conjectured to be insufficient for universal fault-tolerant quantum computation. We show that transversal gates have a restricted form and prove that some important families of them cannot be quantum universal. This is strong evidence that so-called quantum software is necessary to achieve universality, and, therefore, fault-tolerant\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["534"]}

{"title": "Critical faults of leakage errors on the surface code\n", "abstract": " Leakage is a particularly damaging error that occurs when a qubit leaves the defined computational subspace. Leakage errors limit the effectiveness of quantum error correcting codes by spreading additional errors to other qubits and corrupting syndrome measurements. The effects of leakage errors on the surface code has been studied in various contexts. However, the effects of a leaked data qubit versus a leaked ancilla qubit can be quite different. Here, we study the effects of data leakage and ancilla leakage separately. We find that data leakage is much less damaging. We show that the surface code maintains its distance in the presence of leakage by either confining leakage to data qubits or eliminating ancilla qubit leakage at the critical fault location. To demonstrate this, we introduce new techniques for handling leakage: taking advantage of gates with one-sided leakage, effectively isolating leakage events\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["534"]}
