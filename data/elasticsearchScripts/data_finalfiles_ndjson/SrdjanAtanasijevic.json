{"title": "Variability of number of kernels per spike in wheat cultivars (Triticum aestivum L.)\n", "abstract": " In this paper was analyzed number of kernels per spike in 20 genetically divergent wheat cultivars originated from different breeding centers in Serbia. Investigation conducted during two seasons which characterized different climatic condition. For analysis used samples of 60 wheat plants (20 plants in 3 replications) which were harvested in full maturity stage. The differences in average values for number of kernels per spike in studied cultivars were determined. The variability of number of kernels per spike was established. In average, number of kernels per spike for all cultivars was higher in second year 72.22 than in first experimental year 68.73. The highest number of kernels/spike in both year expressed Tanjugovka cultivar and the lowest Yugoslavia cultivar. Average value of coefficientvariation for all cultivars varied from 14.19 in first year to 12.92 in second year. Average number of kernels per spike for both year of growing, varied from 54.56 in cultivar Yugoslavia to 77.83 in cultivar Tanjugovka. Significant differences for number of kernels/spike were found among cultivars in both years as well between years. Heritability in wide sense for number of kernels/spike was 79.13%.", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["1264"]}

{"title": "RAISING THE SKILLS OF BUSINESS ANALYSTS-THE BENEFITS OF ELEARNING TECHNOLOGIES IN CORPORATE EDUCATION\n", "abstract": " A Learning for an employee during working hours, is challenged by limitation of work to deliver, and working timeframe. Accordingly, educational training for employee development should have an efficient impact and a frame for learning. A course for business analysts, UML, covers a wide range of employee profiles who will learn from it. This one covers basic and expanded levels of knowledge, including understanding a variety of cases, using the eLearning platform, to cover elementary knowledge of UML through different employee profiles. Here we describe how to find the measurement for course content, scope, volume, examples, estimated learning time, and how to evaluate knowledge, so employees can learn among their working obligations, to spend fewer hours for more knowledge, to learn online from different locations.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1264"]}

Some of the critical challenges that PMO has in store are standardization of the process, the unification of project management tools, the onboarding of new PMs into the project organization and training them for Comtrade specific project practices, sharing knowledge and experiences from their projects. The Comtrade PMO EDUCT portal is a focal point, a landing page of all PMs in Comtrade. The separate segment is the sub-portal for internal education and certification (pmo. teslacloud. org), which contains over 150 training and educational content. This paper aims to present Comtrade experiences and practices in the implementation of eLearning technologies in corporate education aimed at increasing business excellence and excellence through Knowledge sharing, Knowledge acquisition, Collaborative learning, and Internal certification and standardization.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1264"]}
{"title": "Expanding the level of engineer knowledge for software modeling within corporate education by active and collaborative learning\n", "abstract": " Educational training for employee development inside an IT company should result in an efficient increase in professional knowledge. The reasons are the significant impact on work productivity and the high dependency on project success, influenced by that knowledge. The bottleneck in communication between engineers, architects, business analysts, and the client is the basis to gain mutual understanding in defining requirements, transposing into specifications, and finally accepting a software. To reach that demand for efficiency, everyone in the chain of software development should be familiar with the mastery of software modeling. In this paper, authors share their experiences and explain how to leverage that knowledge through project-based learning, active and collaborative learning, delivered as face-to-face, self-paced e-learning, and online training courses, under the mentorship of experienced business\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1264"]}
{"title": "Variability of grain mass per spike in cultivars of triticale (\u00d7 Triticosecale Wittm.)\n", "abstract": " Triticale is a cereal species created by crossing the wheat and rye species. It is characterized by good quality and high yielding capacity which is specific for wheat and high tolerance to abiotic and biotic stress factors which is specific for rye. The high yield potential of triticale is determined by genetics and influenced by environmental factors. The aim of the paper is to present the results obtained at different triticale varieties under different climatic conditions regarding the grain mass spike-1. Five triticale (xTriticosecale Wittm.) cultivars (KG 20, Bolero, Rtanj, Odisej and Bogo) were investigated in field experiment which was conducted as a randomised block design in five replications on 5m 2 size of unit plot, during three years period (2010-2013). In full stage of maturity 100 plants (20 plants per replication) were used for analysis of grain mass spike-1. Obtained results for grain mass spike-1 showed significant differences among studied triticale cultivars, years of experiment and interaction genotype/year. The average value of grain mass spike-1 for all three years and all five tested cultivar of triticale was 2.28 g. The cultivar Bolero had the lowest average value (2.15 g) and Odisej the highest value (2.52 g) of grain mass spike-1 in average for three years period.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1264"]}

The    mode of inheritance, gene effect, heritability in parent cultivars and F2    hybrids were studied. The different mode of inheritance: partial dominance,    intermediate and overdominance for analyzed trait was established. Among    parent cultivars, the highest nitrogen contents had Novosadska Rana 2    (3.52%).
