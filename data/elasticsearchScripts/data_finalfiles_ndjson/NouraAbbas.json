{"title": "Perioperative patient outcomes in the African Surgical Outcomes Study: a 7-day prospective observational cohort study\n", "abstract": " BackgroundThere is a need to increase access to surgical treatments in African countries, but perioperative complications represent a major global health-care burden. There are few studies describing surgical outcomes in Africa.MethodsWe did a 7-day, international, prospective, observational cohort study of patients aged 18 years and older undergoing any inpatient surgery in 25 countries in Africa (the African Surgical Outcomes Study). We aimed to recruit as many hospitals as possible using a convenience sampling survey, and required data from at least ten hospitals per country (or half the surgical centres if there were fewer than ten hospitals) and data for at least 90% of eligible patients from each site. Each country selected one recruitment week between February and May, 2016. The primary outcome was in-hospital postoperative complications, assessed according to predefined criteria and graded as mild\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "299\n", "authors": ["2237"]}
{"title": "Historical roots of agile methods: Where did \u201cAgile thinking\u201d come from?\n", "abstract": " The appearance of Agile methods has been the most noticeable change to software process thinking in the last fifteen years [16], but in fact many of the \u201cAgile ideas\u201d have been around since 70\u2019s or even before. Many studies and reviews have been conducted about Agile methods which ascribe their emergence as a reaction against traditional methods. In this paper, we argue that although Agile methods are new as a whole, they have strong roots in the history of software engineering. In addition to the iterative and incremental approaches that have been in use since 1957 [21], people who criticised the traditional methods suggested alternative approaches which were actually Agile ideas such as the response to change, customer involvement, and working software over documentation. The authors of this paper believe that education about the history of Agile thinking will help to develop better\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "211\n", "authors": ["2237"]}

The inclusion criteria were all consecutive patients (aged \u226518 years) admitted to participating centres having elective and non-elective caesarean delivery during the 7-day study cohort period. To ensure a representative sample, each hospital had to provide data for 90% of the eligible patients during the recruitment week. The primary outcome was in-hospital maternal mortality and complications, which were assessed by local investigators.

{"title": "Using factor analysis to generate clusters of agile practices (a guide for agile process improvement)\n", "abstract": " In this paper, factor analysis is applied on a set of data that was collected to study the effectiveness of 58 different agile practices. The analysis extracted 15 factors, each was associated with a list of practices. These factors with the associated practices can be used as a guide for agile process improvement. Correlations between the extracted factors were calculated, and the significant correlation findings suggested that people who applied iterative and incremental development and quality assurance practices had a high success rate, that communication with the customer was not very popular as it had negative correlations with governance and iterative and incremental development. Also, people who applied governance practices also applied quality assurance practices. Interestingly success rate related negatively with traditional analysis methods such as Gantt chart and detailed requirements specification.", "num_citations": "58\n", "authors": ["2237"]}
{"title": "The impact of organization, project and governance variables on software quality and project success\n", "abstract": " In this paper we present a statistically tested evidence about how quality and success rate are correlated with variables reflecting the organization and aspects of its project's governance, namely retrospectives and metrics. The results presented in this paper are based on the Agile Projects Governance Survey that collected 129 responses. This paper discuss the deep analysis of this survey, and the main findings suggest that when applying agile software development, the quality of software improves as the organization measures customer satisfaction more frequently, and as the impact of retrospective increases. Project success improves as quality, frequency of measuring customer satisfaction, organization experience in agile development, retrospective impact, the team participation in retrospective and the team contribution to retrospective, increases.", "num_citations": "25\n", "authors": ["2237"]}

Existing risk assessment tools are not valid for use in this population because the pattern of risk for poor outcomes differs from high-income countries. The objective of this study was to derive and validate a simple, preoperative risk stratification tool to identify African surgical patients at risk for in-hospital postoperative mortality and severe complications.MethodsASOS was a 7-day prospective cohort study of adult patients undergoing surgery in Africa. The ASOS Surgical Risk Calculator was constructed with a multivariable logistic regression model for the outcome of in-hospital mortality and severe postoperative complications. The following preoperative risk factors were entered into the model; age, sex, smoking status, ASA physical status, preoperative chronic comorbid\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["2237"]}
{"title": "Software quality and governance in agile software development\n", "abstract": " Looking at software engineering from a historical perspective, we can see how software development methodologies have evolved over the past 50 years. Using the right software development methodology with the right settings has always been a challenge. Therefore, there has always been a need for empirical evidence about what worked well and what did not, and what factors affect the different variables of the development process. Probably the most noticeable change to software development methodology in the last 15 years has been the introduction of the word \u201cagile\u201d. As any area matures, there is a need to understand its components and relations, as well as the need of empirical evidence about how well agile methods work in real life settings. In this thesis, we empirically investigate the impact of agile methods on different aspects of quality including product quality, process quality and stakeholders\u2019 satisfaction as well as the different factors that affect these aspects. Quantitative and qualitative research methods were used for this research, including semi-structured interviews and surveys. Quality was studied in two projects that used agile software development. The empirical study showed that both projects were successful with multiple releases, and with improved product quality and stakeholders\u2019 satisfaction. The data analysis produced a list of 13 refined grounded hypotheses out of which 5 were supported throughout the research. One project was studied in-depth by collecting quantitative data about the process used via a newly designed iteration monitor. The iteration monitor was used by the team over three iterations and it\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["2237"]}

{"title": "Choosing the Appropriate Strategy for a Particular Software Development Project\n", "abstract": " The main goal of software engineering is to build high-quality software products, using a specific budget and timescale, in order to satisfy the customer\u2019s requirements. Hence, the use of an inappropriate software development strategy may reduce the quality or the usefulness of the software product and it will increase the development cost. In this report we investigate the problem of choosing the appropriate software development strategy for a particular software project, in particular we discuss how we can balance flexibility and discipline in software development, we starts with introducing various software development methodologies. In addition we present their strengths and weaknesses and when to use them, and we found that project\u2019s characteristics are extremely important in choosing the software development methodology, in particular, we argued that criticality, size and dynamism are the most important\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["2237"]}
