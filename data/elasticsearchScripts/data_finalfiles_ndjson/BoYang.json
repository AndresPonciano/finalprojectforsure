However, it lacks of a systematic means to address an important aspect of IT operation, i.e., managing the knowledge separated in various tools and experts' minds. In this paper, a novel knowledge-enhanced architecture is proposed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of ITSM. The essential contribution of this novel architecture is to involve a Knowledge Management Database (KMDB) which provides assistance for knowledge capture, mining, storage and sharing. The paper will discuss an approach of how to construct such a KMDB with motivating scenarios and detailed\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1952"]}
{"title": "Research and Implementation of Knowledge-Enhanced Information Services\n", "abstract": " Information isolation has been identified as a big challenge in IT Service Management (ITSM). Existing ITSM practices mostly rely on configuration information and are geared towards individual applications and processes. However, information available in complicated IT infrastructure goes beyond data from the configuration management domain. How to efficiently extract and integrate the hidden knowledge from a wide variety of information sources is a major pain point for ITSM. In this paper, a threading strategy (TS) with KPI mark and knowledge-enhanced information services is proposed to improve ITSM quality. The essential contribution of this work is to organize the highly complex IT service information with KPI mark and to build a knowledge repository for accumulateing and reusing experts\u2019 knowledge.

{"title": "Hybrid algorithm based on attention model.\n", "abstract": " A hybrid algorithm based on attention model (HAAM) is proposed to speed up the training of back-propagation neural networks and improve the performances. The algorithm combines the genetic algorithm with the BP algorithm based on magnified error signal. The key to this algorithm lies in the partition of the BP training process into many chips with each chip trained by the BP algorithm. The chips in the same iteration are optimized by the GA operators, and those in different iterations constitute the whole training. Therefore, the HAAM obtains the ability of searching the global optimum solution relying on these operations, and it is easy to be parallelly processed. The simulation experiments show that this algorithm can effectively avoid failure training caused by randomizing the initial weights and thresholds, and solve the slow convergence problem resulted from the Flat-Spots when the error signal becomes too small. Moreover, this algorithm improves the generalization of BP network by improving the training precision instead of adding hidden neurons.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1952"]}

Hence, the challenge for the service providers becomes to accommodate the planned maintenance windows to keep them to a minimum duration in order to reduce the impact on the consumers of their services. In this paper, we assess the continuous delivery methodology called Blue/Green deployment which targets to enable service updates with zero maintenance windows, and thus with no disruption to the end users. To overcome current issues we proposed an optimized Blue/Green technique based on automated service discovery, dynamic routing and automated application deployment.

Today, the task of diagnosing thermal anomalies entails expert but tedious analysis of data collected manually from disparate management systems. Our ultimate goal is to substantially reduce the time, tedium and expertise required to diagnose thermal hotspots by developing a system that generates accurate diagnoses automatically. We describe a substantial step towards this goal: a loosely-coupled, semi-automated thermal diagnosis system that integrates IT and facilities data, uses simple heuristics to highlight the most likely culprits, and provides a graphical interface that enables an administrator to narrow the list further by exploring data correlations.

Design and implementation of automatic and accurate asset management has become an important task for data center management. Although there are many asset management solutions with RFID, the value of asset traceability in data center management is not being considered as a whole infrastructure. The key issue to add values on traceability of asset is to integrate the traceability system with the business process management and use the traceability data to support making decisions for manager and improve performance of business management.

{"title": "Research on back-propagation learning algorithm based on weight adjustment parameters\n", "abstract": " When the initial weights and thresholds of back-propagation network are optimized by genetic algorithm, the learning process is more likely trapped into\" flat spot\" which results in slow or even suppressed learning process and weight adjustment due to the large scope of weight-initializing in genetic algorithm. To solve this problem and inspired by the research fruits of neuroscience and physiological anatomy, an improved learning algorithm based on weight adjustment parameters is proposed. It avoids premature saturation problem that the weight adjustment reaching zero by introducing an excitation unit into the neuron model to excitation the back-propagated error signal. Simulation results show that the new method can avoid the learning process being trapped into the\" flat spot\" efficiently and improve the capability of fine-tuning to the result optimized by the genetic algorithm. The new algorithm also outperforms the other traditional methods in terms of the convergence rate, stability, and the capability of searching optimum in large space.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1952"]}

{"title": "Applying knowledge sharing for business intelligence collaboration\n", "abstract": " IT services need an automatic and flexible ability to react to dynamic changes in their environment. Managing change effectively and reducing the negative effects of day-today operations has become one of the most important tasks in IT service management, which require hiring highly skilled IT professionals with correspondingly high labor costs. There is a challenge to select, implement and integrate the right resources quickly and effectively. Although there is a growing body of research into IT management, many techniques are either too narrow (focusing on a single component rather than the entire system), or they address only configuration data collection and integration. Instead, one needs to scale or respond to special domain knowledge, collaboration and the right data for helping IT professionals to improve their work.

The key to this algorithm lies in varying the error item of output layer, which magnify the backward propagated error signal especially when the weight adjustment of output layer is slow or even suppressed. Therefore, the algorithm is able to get rid of the influence of \"flat spot\" problem, and solve the slow convergence problem. Consequently the convergence rate can be accelerated, and the training has great capability in meeting the convergence criteria quickly with a simple network structure.
