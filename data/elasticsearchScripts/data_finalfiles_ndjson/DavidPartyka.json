{"title": "Building blocks for mobile free-space-optical networks\n", "abstract": " Existence of line of sight (LOS) and alignment between the communicating antennas are one of the key requirements for free-space-optical (FSO) communication. To ensure uninterrupted data flow, auto-aligning transmitter and receiver modules are necessary. We propose a new optical antenna design that employs spherical antennas covered with transmitter and receiver modules for maintaining optical links even when antennas are in relative motion. In this paper, for proof-of-concept, we design and test an auto-configurable circuit integrated with light sources and detectors placed on spherical surfaces. We also perform simulation-based analysis of these multi-element FSO modules that can enable mobility and high bandwidth in wireless, particularly indoor, networks. Broader impact of our work is to make FSO communication technology widely applicable in mobile, ad-hoc, and multi-hop wireless networks.", "num_citations": "83\n", "authors": ["1124"]}
