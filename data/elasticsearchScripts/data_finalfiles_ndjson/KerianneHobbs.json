For use in mission-critical and safety-critical applications, however, it is important to be able to analyze what a neural network can and cannot do. For feed-forward neural networks with ReLU activation functions, although exact analysis is NP-complete, recently-proposed verification methods can sometimes succeed. The main practical problem with neural network verification is excessive analysis runtime. Even on small networks, tools that are theoretically complete can sometimes run for days without producing a result. In this paper, we work to address the runtime problem by improving upon a recently-proposed geometric path enumeration method. Through a series of optimizations, several of which are new algorithmic improvements, we demonstrate significant speed\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "36\n", "authors": ["1426"]}

In the past, losses from midair mishaps were mitigated through training and ineffective warning systems. Now, an Automatic Air Collision Avoidance System Auto ACAS has been identified as a technology that could significantly reduce midair accidents. The Air Force Research Laboratory AFRL and Lockheed Martin are developing Auto ACAS for fighter aircraft operating in an air combat training environment. In this environment, emphasis is placed on providing protection for aircraft performing air combat maneuvers while eliminating nuisance. Auto ACAS is not a pilot advisory system or a de-confliction system rather, Auto ACAS performs an automatic, aggressive maneuver to avoid collisions with other aircraft and returns control to the pilot as soon as the collision is prevented. The system coordinates maneuver trajectories between aircraft, determines which combination of maneuvers provides the best separation, and initiates maneuvers when a collision is imminent. The maneuvers incorporate pilot preferences and rules of the road where applicable and possible. Most maneuvers last only two to three seconds and occur well within the reaction time of an alert pilot.Descriptors:", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["1426"]}

{"title": "Foundations of intelligent additive manufacturing\n", "abstract": " During the last decade, additive manufacturing has become increasingly popular for rapid prototyping, but has remained relatively marginal beyond the scope of prototyping when it comes to applications with tight tolerance specifications, such as in aerospace. Despite a strong desire to supplant many aerospace structures with printed builds, additive manufacturing has largely remained limited to prototyping, tooling, fixtures, and non-critical components. There are numerous fundamental challenges inherent to additive processing to be addressed before this promise is realized. One ubiquitous challenge across all AM motifs is to develop processing-property relationships through precise, in situ monitoring coupled with formal methods and feedback control. We suggest a significant component of this vision is a set of semantic layers within 3D printing files relevant to the desired material specifications. This semantic layer provides the feedback laws of the control system, which then evaluates the component during processing and intelligently evolves the build parameters within boundaries defined by semantic specifications. This evaluation and correction loop requires on-the-fly coupling of finite element analysis and topology optimization. The required parameters for this analysis are all extracted from the semantic layer and can be modified in situ to satisfy the global specifications. Therefore, the representation of what is printed changes during the printing process to compensate for eventual imprecision or drift arising during the manufacturing process.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1426"]}

The problem appears to require methods capable of quickly analyzing high-dimensional nonlinear systems, but we take advantage multiple kinds of problem structure to show that reachability analysis may be viable for this problem. In particular we present an initial analysis approach that uses numerical simulation for reachability analysis, and interval arithmetic with AABB trees for fast collision detection. The analysis uses a variable size time step with a counter-example guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR) method to increase analysis speed without sacrificing accuracy.

{"title": "Efficient n-to-n Collision Detection for Space Debris using 4D AABB Trees\n", "abstract": " Collision detection algorithms are used in aerospace, swarm robotics, automotive, video gaming, dynamics simulation and other domains. As many applications of collision detection run online, timing requirements are imposed on the algorithm runtime: algorithms must, at a minimum, keep up with the passage of time. In practice, this places a limit on the number of objects, n, that can be tracked at the same time. In this paper, we improve the scalability of collision detection, effectively raising the limit n for online object tracking. The key to our approach is the use of a four-dimensional axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) tree, which stores each object's three-dimensional occupancy region in space during a one-dimensional interval of time. This improves efficiency by permitting per-object variable times steps. Further, we describe partitioning strategies that can decompose the 4D AABB tree search into several smaller-dimensional problems that can be solved in parallel.

The primary control may come from a human operator, an advanced control approach, or an autonomous control approach that cannot be verified to the same level as simpler control systems designs.

In many cases, RTA systems can functionally be described as containing a monitor that watches the state of the system and output of a primary controller, and a backup controller that replaces or modifies control input when necessary to assure safety. An important quality of an RTA system is that the assurance mechanism is constructed in a way that is entirely agnostic to the underlying structure of the primary controller.
