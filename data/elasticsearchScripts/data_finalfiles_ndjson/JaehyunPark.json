{"title": "Diabetes and cancer: cancer should be screened in routine diabetes assessment\n", "abstract": " Cancer incidence appears to be increased in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). DM represents a risk factor for cancer, particularly hepatocellular, hepatobiliary, pancreas, breast, ovarian, endometrial, and gastrointestinal cancers. In addition, there is evidence showing that DM is associated with increased cancer mortality. Common risk factors such as age, obesity, physical inactivity and smoking may contribute to increased cancer risk in patients with DM. Although the mechanistic process that may link diabetes to cancer is not completely understood yet, biological mechanisms linking DM and cancer are hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, increased bioactivity of insulin-like growth factor 1, oxidative stress, dysregulations of sex hormones, and chronic inflammation. However, cancer screening rate is significantly lower in people with DM than that in people without diabetes. Evidence from previous studies suggests that some medications used to treat DM are associated with either increased or reduced risk of cancer. However, there is no strong evidence supporting the association between the use of anti-hyperglycemic medication and specific cancer. In conclusion, all patients with DM should be undergo recommended age-and sex appropriate cancer screenings to promote primary prevention and early detection.

These ecosystems are nitrogen-limited due to slow mineralization rate of the soil organic nitrogen. Recently, abundant field studies have found that organic nitrogen is another important nitrogen supply for boreal forest and tundra ecosystems. In this study, we incorporated a mechanism that allowed boreal plants to uptake small molecular amino acids into a process-based biogeochemical model, the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM), to evaluate the impact of organic nitrogen uptake on ecosystem carbon cycling. The new version of the model was evaluated for both boreal forest and tundra sites. We found that the modeled organic nitrogen uptake accounted for 36\u201387% of total nitrogen uptake by plants in tundra ecosystems and 26\u201350% for boreal forests, suggesting that tundra ecosystem might have more relied on the organic form of nitrogen than boreal forests. The simulated monthly gross ecosystem production (GPP) and net ecosystem production (NEP) tended to be larger with the new version of the model since the plant uptake of organic nitrogen alleviated the soil nitrogen limitation especially during the growing season. The sensitivity study indicated that the most important factors controlling the plant uptake of organic nitrogen was the soil amino acid diffusion coefficient (De) in our model, suggesting that the organic nitrogen uptake by plants is likely to be regulated by the edaphic characteristics of diffusion.

However, little is known regarding the appropriate duration of BMP-2 stimulation for sufficient osteogenic differentiation and new bone formation because of the short half-life of BMP-2 in the physiological environment and the lack of a well-defined delivery matrix that can regulate the release period of BMP-2. In this study, we prepared porous poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) beads with different surface pore sizes that can regulate the release period of BMP-2 (i.e., 7, 17, and 30 days) while providing the BMP-2 concentration required for bone regeneration.

The Ct values of candidate reference genes were analyzed by geNorm software to clarify stable expression regardless of experimental conditions. Thus, Pearson\u2019s correlation was applied to determine correlation between the three most stable reference genes (NF3) and optimal number of reference genes (NFopt). In assessment of stability of reference gene across experimental conditions by geNorm analysis, undifferentiated MSCs and each differentiated status into mesenchymal lineages showed slightly different results but similar patterns about more or less stable rankings. Furthermore, Pearson\u2019s correlation revealed high correlation () between NF3 and NFopt. Overall, the present study showed that HMBS, YWHAZ, SDHA, and TBP are suitable reference genes for qRT-PCR in porcine MSCs.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["684"]}

Thoracotomy is expected to reduce the risk of reoperation and to enhance the surgical outcomes. We retrospectively analyzed two operative approaches (thoracotomy vs. sternotomy) in cardiac reoperation. Materials and Methods: From September 2007 to December 2010, 35 patients who required reoperation of the mitral valvular disease following previous median sternotomy were included. Average age of patients was 45.8\u00b115.4 years (range, 14 to 76 years) and male-to-female was 23: 12. Interval period between primary operation and reoperation was 135.8\u00b1105.6 months (range, 3.3 to 384.9 months). Results: Comparative analysis was done dividing the patient group into two groups that are thoracotomy group (22 patients) and sternotomy group (13 patients). Thoracotomy group was significantly lower in operative time (415.2\u00b190.3 vs. 497.5\u00b1148.0, p< 0.05), bleeding control time (108.0\u00b129.5 vs. 146.4\u00b166.8, p< 0.05) and chest tube drainage (287.5\u00b1211.5 mL vs. 557.3\u00b1365.5 mL, p< 0.05) compared to sternotomy group.

Extensive simulations and measurements demonstrate up to a 3.6% memory access time reduction for commercial PCM devices and a 31.7% reduction with optimistic parameters of the PCM research prototypes in industries.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["684"]}
{"title": "Preemptive switched ethernet for real-time process control system\n", "abstract": " The real-time performance of control network between process control system(PCS) in a nuclear power plant is an important factor to ensure safety and reliability of power plant. Ethernet network is widely adopted in modern PCS even though it does not guarantee hard real-time performance in the non-safety region of a nuclear power plant. To achieve better real-time performance and QoS(Quality of Service), PCS usually uses switched Ethernet with the priority feature, which is based on the IEEE 802.1Q/p protocol. However, the IEEE 802.1Q/p protocol also has a priority inversion problem when transmission of a higher-priority frame is requested during transmission of a lower-priority frame. To resolve this problem, this paper proposes Preemptive Switched Ethernet(PSE) that is based on the IEEE 802.1Q/p protocol with a preemption mechanism. This paper shows that PSE provides better real-time performance\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["684"]}

Local dielectric spectroscopy was applied to investigate relaxation dynamics of the polymer close to such interface, at variance of temperature and moisture content, within a thin film supported on a conductive substrate. An intense relaxation process is observed at the polymer/nanoinclusions interface, which could be a secondary relaxation process of the polymer enhanced by the proximity to the conductive nanowires. Furthermore, its relaxation dynamics becomes slower when moisture content is increased which could be explained by the hindering of pyrrolidone ring motions due to hydrogen bonding.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["684"]}

{"title": "Radioactive waste disposal of LILW and HLW in Korea\n", "abstract": " The radioactive waste disposal program in Korea consists of a low-and intermediate-level waste (LILW) component and a high-level waste (HLW) component. For the LILW component, the Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co., Ltd.,(KHNP) is seeking a repository site through voluntary participation of local governments and will determine the proper site through screening of candidate sites. According to the new plan of radioactive waste management established in 1997, the repository for LILW will be in operation by 2008, and the initial disposal capacity of LILW will be about 100,000 drums (based on a 200-liter-per-drum capacity). Conceptual design and generic safety assessment have been completed for both rock cavern and engineered vault disposal options as reference disposal methods. Preliminary probabilistic risk assessment and deterministic dose assessment were undertaken with the appropriate computer code scheme set up for the purpose of performance assessment for each disposal concept. The results of a radiological impact assessment showed good compliance of the conceptual design to performance objectives. The results indicate, however, that the performance will be strongly dependent on the geology and hydrogeology of the disposal facility location, and it should be noted that the assessment was carried out with limited understanding of the site-specific characteristics. These preliminary assessments of the conceptual disposal facilities provide a firm foundation for future site-specific assessment activities.

{"title": "Welding Of Single Crystal Nickel-Based Superalloys\n", "abstract": " A series of laser welds were made at different weld speeds and powers on thin sheet samples of a single crystal nickel-based superalloy (Rene N5). The welds were evaluated by optical microscopy to identify the extent of stray grain formation. The welds were made along an asymmetric crystallographic direction and the micrographs showed that stray grain formation and associated cracking were also asymmetric with respect to the weld centerline. Furthermore, stray grain formation was more prevalent at higher weld speeds and weld power (but lower heat input). A thermal model was used to predict the weld pool shape for the different welding conditions and this model was used in conjunction with a geometric model to determine the dendrite solidification microstructure. The thermal model was also used to identify the variation in the thermal gradient along the weld pool solidification interface. The model results showed a clear correlation between the stray grain formation tendencies and the value of the parameter G N/V (G= gradient, V= velocity, N= constant). The results agree very well with expectations based on the mechanism of constitutional supercooling for stray grain formation.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["684"]}

The specimens composed of glass powder with average particle size of 8.27 micron and 0-40 vol% alumina powder were sintered for 3 h at temperatures between 850 and 1350 C. The sintering mechanism consists of the redistribution of particles occurring at 750 C and the viscous flow at 850-950 C. The degree of crystallisation and sintering temperature were dependent upon the ratio of glass/alumina. The second phase from the reaction between glass and alumina was not observed, which was confirmed by XRD and properties analysis. The density, dielectric constant and specific resistivity of specimen were 2.30-3.26 g/cm3, 5.8-7.38 at 1 GHz and 1.23-4.70 x 10 exp(7) ohm.m respectively. 21 refs.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["684"]}

{"title": "Control-theoretic cyber-physical system modeling and synthesis: A case study of an active direct methanol fuel cell\n", "abstract": " A joint optimization of the physical system and the cyber world is one of the key problems in the design of a cyber-physical system (CPS). The major mechanical forces and/or chemical reactions in a plant are commonly modified by actuators in the balance-of-plant (BOP) system. More powerful actuators requires more power, but generally increase the response of the physical system powered by the electrical energy generated by the physical system. To maximize the overall output of a power generating plant therefore requires joint optimization of the physical system and the cyber world, and this is a key factor in the design of a CPS. We introduce a systematic approach to the modeling and synthesis of a CPS that emphasize joint power optimization, using an active direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) as a case study.

{"title": "Analysis of Team Communication Characteristics Using SNA Technique\n", "abstract": " An important aspect of human behavior in nuclear power plants (NPPs) is team interaction since operating NPPs involves the coordination of several team members among and within workplaces. In this environment, operators in NPPs communicate with each other to share situational information. Unfortunately, inappropriate communication can cause a lack of situational information and lead to serious consequences of systems [1-2]. This implies that it is requisite to study the communication characteristics of operating team to secure the safety of NPPs. Many researchers have endeavored to investigate the characteristics of team communications. However, previous studies seem to characterize team communications based on a single perspective such as communication contents as well as communication structure [3].In this regard, it seems that social network analysis (SNA) would be a comprehensive method which enables analysts to characterize team communications from both perspectives. In this study, a density score which is one of the communication characteristics was obtained by using SNA. Moreover, the ratio of inappropriate communications was calculated using the taxonomy for inappropriate communication [4]. Finally, the communication characteristic distinguished by the density score is compared with the ratio of inappropriate communications to extract meaningful insights which could contribute to prevent the occurrence of inappropriate communications.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["684"]}

{"title": "Holistic payload optimization for avionics computer systems\n", "abstract": " Payload is a critical metric to achieve a longer flying range especially for a down-scaled aircraft. Avionics computer systems for an unmanned aircraft performs dedicated missions such as image capture and recognition as well as flight control and navigation. As the performance demand is increasing fast, avionics computer systems should have a high-performance microprocessor and in turn results in high power consumption. A longer flight range with a high-power microprocessor involves a large-capacity battery, which significantly increases the payload of the aircraft. Thus, a holistic optimization of an avionics computer systems is not only achievable by the minimum weight of the avionics computer systems including a microprocessor, memory, an RF transceiver, power converters, a camera, and so forth, but by the reduced weight of the battery, which mandates low-power consumption. In this paper, we introduce avionics computer systems and their holistic payload optimization. We break down the weight and power consumption of the whole avionics systems, and figure out two major power consumers that are in a trade-off relationship, the microprocessor and RF transceiver while other components have consistent and independent amount of power consumption though some of them are dominant. We model the tasks of avionics computer systems with computing and communication power annotations, and derive a task partitioning problem. We formulate the partitioning problem in ILP (integer linear programming) and achieve the power-optimal task partitioning, which results in the least total payload.

To analyze ten preservatives, two or three tests of the current official determination methods are required for each sample. The methods are involved the analysis by GC after distillation and by high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) after sep-pak cartridge or direct solvent extraction. But the method we developed in this study can determine 10 preservatives simultaneously and easily. Ten preservatives (propionic acid, sorbic acid, benzoic acid, methyl p-, ethyl p-, iso-propyl p-, propyl p-, iso-butyl p-, butyl p-hydroxy benzoate and dehydroacetic acid) were extracted with ethanol. The limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantification (LOQs) for ten preservatives were 0.27~ 8.02\u338d/mL and 1.61~ 32.97\u338d/mL, respectively. Mean recoveries of ten preservatives from samples of cheese and sausage spiked at the levels of 25, 50 and 100\u338d/mL were 89.99~ 107.66% and 91.17~ 102.39%, respectively, and coefficients of variation were 4.58~ 8.11%. These data indicate that the developed method in this study can be used as a screening test for determining 10 preservatives in livestock products, and the method will be offered as a rapid and effective tool for analyzing preservatives.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["684"]}

The fatty liver index (FLI) was used to identify subjects with NAFLD. CVD was defined as occurrence of a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or coronary revascularization. The association between FLI and CVD incidence was analyzed using time-dependent Cox regression analyses.ResultsThe study population was categorized into quartile groups according to FLI (range: Q1, 0-4.9; Q2, 5.0-12.5; Q3, 12.6-31.0; Q4,> 31.0). The median follow-up duration was 5.4 years, during which subjects with higher FLIs experienced CVD more frequently than did those with lower FLIs [Q1, 215 (0.3%); Q2, 498 (0.6%); Q3, 753 (0.9%); Q4, 981 (1.2%); P< 0.001]. Adjustment of baseline characteristics revealed that a higher FLI was independently associated with an increased risk for CVD [hazard ratio between Q4 and Q1, 1.86; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.59-2.17; P< 0.001]. The association between them remained statistically significant (hazard ratio between Q4 and Q1, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.63-2.25; P< 0.001) after further adjustment for the interim events (diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation).ConclusionsOtherwise healthy NAFLD patients progressed to develop CVD independently of the interim\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["684"]}

Since then, a total of more than 6 units including Shin Hanul Units 1/2 and Shin Kori Units 5/6 have been designed and under construction. The MMIS of the APR1400 model is implemented in a computer-based digital method from the existing analog method, which has high accuracy and efficiency, but the importance of cyber security has increased in proportion. In existing nuclear power plants, all instrumentation and control (I&C) systems have been based on the hard-wiring devices, but recently, network-based instrumentation and control systems such as high-speed fieldbus have been used instead of hard-wiring. However, as the proportion of digital device-based measurement and control systems increases, cyber security, especially network security, has also emerged as a very important issue. Due to increasing national anxiety about nuclear safety caused by cyber threats from a group of nuclear hackers in December 2014, Korea nuclear regulatory agency requires nuclear licenses to establish Cyber Security Plan in accordance with the Radiological Emergency Preparedness Law and related regulatory guidelines [1-5] and to implement the plan in seven phases by 2018 [6]. The network used in the safety and non-safety control system of a nuclear power plant must satisfy a special requirement to meet high reliability, such as one-way communication and network buffering, unlike the network used in general factory automation.

To evaluate the effect of puffer supplementation, lipid-soluble antioxidant vitamin and conjugated diene (CD) levels, DNA damage, and mRNA expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) were assessed. Animals that were fed ethanol showed reduced plasma levels of lipid-soluble antioxidant vitamin and significantly increased levels of lipid peroxides, DNA damage, and HO-1 expression.

{"title": "A PWSCC Mechanism in alloy 600\n", "abstract": " [en] Comprehensive facts for a primary water stress corrosion cracking (PWSCC) of Alloy 600 can be summarized as follows: 1) PWSCC occurs along a high angle grain boundary always. 2) PWSCC is reproducible by a slow strain rate test (SSRT). 3) PWSCC occurs in a cold worked region in Alloy 600 and in a dissimilar weld metal of the 82/182 type, frequently. 4) The critical stress for a PWSCC can be assumed to be over 250 MPa since a plastic deformation at a crack tip is necessary for a continued propagation of a crack. However, the applied design stress for a component made of Alloy 600 during an operation is relatively low, compared to a critical stress for the PWSCC. Thus, it has been assumed there had been a high residual stress where a PWSCC occurred at present. It is understood that a stress is a driving force for all stress corrosion cracking (SCC) processes. Thus, the nature of a thermal activation process in a PWSCC should be related to a stress producing phenomenon. Therefore, the PWSCC in Alloy 600 is explained by an introduction of an additional stress source due to a contraction of a lattice by an ordering reaction in this paper. Although the PWSCC phenomenon have been explained by an action of an unknown stress before, the PWSCC phenomenon will be explained by a self induced stress source due to ordering, here", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["684"]}

The backward radiation profile, which is the amplitude variation of backward radiated ultrasound according to the incident angle, of the specimens were measured in water at room temperature after the corrosion fatigue test. The velocity of Rayleigh surface wave, determined from the incident angle at which the profile of the backward radiated ultrasound became maximum, decreased for the specimen that had the large number of cycles to failure in the corrosion fatigue test. This fact implies that the corrosion degradation occurred at specimen surface in this specific test is dominantly dependant on the me exposed to corrosion environment.

The modified TCP/IP layer provides a specially designed mechanism for the asynchronous and isochronous data transmission of IEEE-1394 to guarantee the real-time communication. The proposed TCP/IP protocol over IEEE-1394 is implemented into Linux kernel, and the performance is evaluated and compared with those of the standard TCP/IP over Ethernet.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["684"]}
{"title": "Evaluation of the communication latency over real-time channel in HARTS\n", "abstract": " In this paper, the end-to-end communication latency in HARTS (Hexagonal Architecture for Real-Time Systems) is evaluated, which depends on the intra-node delay as well as the inter-node delay. While the inter-node delay is bounded due to the point-to-point real-time channel, the intra-node delay is variable according to the message traffic and the internal structure of a HARTS node. The intra-node delay is evaluated analytically and by computer simulation for the various implementational models, and an arbitration algorithm is proposed to provide real-time scheduling for VMEbus-based HARTS node.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["684"]}
