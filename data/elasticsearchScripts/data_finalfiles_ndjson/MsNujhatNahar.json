Levels of grit were significantly higher in female students, older students and postgraduates. Grit correlated highest with self-control. Study 2 looked at 340 University students. In addition to measuring self-control, mental wellbeing and grit, measures of resilience and mindsets were also added. A construct validity test of the grit scale showed that high grit scorers had significantly higher levels of self-control and mental well-being, were more resilient and were more likely to have a more growth oriented mindset. Grit varies with age and is most closely associated with the concept of self-control. The third study was a qualitative investigation with ten successful graduates. Semi-structured interviews were coded using thematic analysis. Three broad themes emerged. The first, Passion and Perseverance, included themes of having short and long terms goals, resilience, dedication and endurance. The second, Self-Control, included time management, self-awareness, prioritising tasks and knowing strengths and weaknesses. The third theme identified was Positive Mindsets.

We conducted a study to evaluate bats\u2019 access to date palm sap. We mounted infrared cameras that silently captured images upon detection of motion on date palm trees from 5: 00 pm to 6: 00 am. Additionally, we placed two locally used preventative techniques, bamboo skirts and lime (CaCO3) smeared on date palm trees to assess their effectiveness in preventing bats access to sap. Out of 20 camera-nights of observations, 14 identified 132 visits of bats around the tree, 91 to the shaved surface of the tree where the sap flow originates, 4 at the stream of sap moving toward the collection pot, and no bats at the tap or on the collection pots; the remaining 6 camera-nights recorded no visits. Of the preventative techniques, the bamboo skirt placed for four camera-nights prevented bats access to sap. This study confirmed that bats commonly visited date palm trees and physically contacted the sap collected for human consumption. This is further evidence that date palm sap is an important link between Nipah virus in bats and Nipah virus in humans. Efforts that prevent bat access to the shaved surface and the sap stream of the tree could reduce Nipah spillovers to the human population.", "num_citations": "82\n", "authors": ["633"]}

Results show contrasts between local and biomedical views on causal explanations and appropriate care. Social norms demanded that family members maintain physical contact with sick patients, potentially increasing the risk of human-to-human transmission. Initial treatment strategies by community members involved home remedies, and public health officials encouraged patient hospitalization. Over time, communities linked the outbreak to supernatural powers and sought care with spiritual healers.

We evaluated four types of physical barriers that may prevent bats from contacting sap.   Methods During 2009, we used a crossover design and randomly selected 20 date palm sap producing trees and observed each tree for 2 nights: one night with a bamboo skirt intervention applied and one night without the intervention. During 2010, we selected 120 trees and randomly assigned four types of interventions to 15 trees each: bamboo, dhoincha (local plant), jute stick and polythene skirts covering the shaved part, sap stream, tap and collection pot. We enrolled the remaining 60 trees as controls. We used motion sensor activated infrared cameras to examine bat contact with sap.   Results During 2009 bats contacted date palm sap in 85% of observation nights when no intervention was used compared with 35% of nights when the intervention was used [p<0.001]. Bats were able to contact the sap when the skirt did not entirely cover the sap producing surface. Therefore, in 2010 we requested the sap harvesters to use larger skirts.

{"title": "Bangladeshi backyard poultry raisers\u2019 perceptions and practices related to zoonotic transmission of avian influenza\n", "abstract": " Introduction: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) virus (known as\" bird flu\") is an important public health concern due to its potential to infect humans and cause a human pandemic. Bangladesh is a high-risk country for an influenza pandemic because of its dense human population, widespread backyard poultry raising, and endemic H5N1 infection in poultry. Understanding poultry raisers' perceived risks and identifying their risk exposures can help to develop interventions to reduce the risk of avian influenza transmission. This paper explores the perception of Bangladeshi backyard poultry raisers regarding poultry sickness and zoonotic disease transmission and relevant practices.Methodology: We conducted a qualitative study using social mapping (n= 2), in-depth interviews (n= 40), household mapping (n= 40) and observation (n= 16), in two backyard poultry-raising communities.Results: The poultry raisers recognized various signs of poultry illness but they did not distinguish among diseases using biomedical classifications. They perceived disease transmission from poultry to poultry, but not from poultry to humans. They usually kept sick poultry under the bed. If the poultry did not recover, they were slaughtered and consumed or sold. The poultry raisers had close contact with sick birds while handling and slaughtering poultry.Conclusions: The poultry raisers are unlikely to follow instructions from health authorities to prevent\" bird flu\" transmission because many of the instructions ask low-income producers to change their existing practices and require time, money, and financial loss.

The measurements were based on sampling using two Air Metrics simultaneously operating samplers. The concentrations of OC and BC concentrations in PM2.5 varied from 5\u201396 \u03bcg/m3 and 4\u201348 \u03bcg/m3, respectively. The concentrations of PM2.5 varied from 11\u2013328 \u03bcg/m3. The annual particulate organic matter (POM) accounted for 46 \u00b1 11% in PM2.5 whereas BC stayed at 33 \u00b1 12%. The effects of meteorological conditions on the variability of OC and BC concentration were examined and the contribution of secondary organic aerosol to the total OC was calculated. The concentrations of OC and BC relative to the total PM2.5 are high and have good correlation with wind speed and temperature. The OC/BC ratio correlated with wind speed, temperature and sulfur concentration. Based on these relationships, it can be concluded that both local and regional sources of OC and BC are important. The local sources are traffic, coal and biomass burning. Distant sources include areas where there is extensive agricultural burning.", "num_citations": "61\n", "authors": ["633"]}

Incidence of low birth weight was highest in urban slum (36.8%) followed by rural area (20.9%) and lowest in urban affluent community (18.3%). The area of residence had a significant influence on birth weight suggesting that environmental stress had detrimental effect on birth weight. Age, weight and height of mothers were also risk factor for low birth weight of their babies. Mothers of less than 20 years and more than 35 years, weighing less than 40 kg and having height less than 140 cm had the higher risk of giving birth to low birth weight babies. Incidence of low birth weight was highest (73.2%) among the primigravidae mothers and 36.8% among the mothers who had no antenatal check-up, but it was 15.9% among those who had check-up more than 7 times. The distribution of low birth weight babies was higher (48.2%) among the mothers who had never gone to school.

The results showed that in nondiabetic rat C speciosus and N tuberosa had no significant effect in the fasting or postprandial state when freeze-dried juices were fed simultaneously with glucose. However, when fed 30 min before the glucose load both C speciosus (p< 0.05) and N tuberosa (p< 0.003) showed hypoglycemic effect. To the contrary, S hernandifolia increased the serum glucose levels of nondiabetic rats in all the series of experiments (p< 0.05 or p< 0.01). In NIDDM model rats N tuberosa opposed the rise in serum glucose level when it was fed 30 min before the glucose load (p< 0.02), whereas S hernandifolia had a tendency to raise the serum glucose level. In IDDM model rats, none of these three freeze-dried juice showed any effect in the fasting state. However, C speciosus showed significant hypoglycemic effect (p< 0.002) when the juice was fed with simultaneous glucose load. In marked contrast to the findings with nondiabetic and NIDDM model rats S hernandifolia showed significant hypoglycemic effect (p< 0.05-0.006) in both the stages (fed simultaneously with, and 30 min before the glucose load) of prandial states of the IDDM model rats.

The plant protein ingredients were incorporated as sole protein sources into test diets containing 30% protein and animal protein ingredients into 35% protein diets. A protein-free diet was used to study the true protein digestion coefficients. Of the plant proteins tested, soybean meal produced significantly (p< 0.05) the highest APD (84.67%) and TPD (88. 77%). There was no significant (p> 0.05) difference between the APD values of linseed (81.44%) and sesame meal (81.89%) but these APD values were significantly higher than that of mustard oilcake (78.86%). Similarly, among the animal proteins tested both HCOOH-and H2SO4-treated fish silage produced significantly (p< 0.05) the highest APDs (88.23% and 88.85% respectively), while fishmeal produced the lowest (81.98%). There was no significant difference (p> 0.05) between the APDs of silkworm pupae (85.74%) and deoiled silkworm pupae meal (84.95%). The TPD values for the ingredients showed similar trends. In general, the ALD values for all the diets tested were higher than those of the APD values. The results of the study indicated that tilapia may be able to utilize the above-mentioned ingredients efficiently.One of the constraints for the development of aquaculture in Southeast Asia is the formulation of a low-cost nutrient-balanced diet for the fish cultured.

The mature and fresh leaves of UD were collected from the mountain range of Assam, in India. Type 2 diabetes was induced in 48 hour old male Long Evans pups by a single intraperitoneal (IP) injection of Streptozotocin (STZ). Experiments for chronic effects were done with continuous feeding of aqueous extract for 28 days at a dose of 1.25 g/kg body weight, in type 2 diabetic male rats. Serum glucose was estimated by GODPOD method. Serum triglycerides and cholesterol were measured by enzymatic-colorimetric method. The aqueous extract showed significant effect on lowering of fasting serum glucose levels on the 28th day (13.7\u00b12.6 mmol/l in control vs 7.1\u00b11.0 mmol/l in the treated group, p= 0.01). Body weights was increased in both the groups, after 28 days, although there was significant decrease in the body weight of the treated group in comparison to the control group (175\u00b18 g in control vs in 168\u00b19 g in the treated group on 0 day, p= ns; 193\u00b126 g in control vs in 180\u00b125 g in the treated group on the 28th day, p= 0.002). Beneficial effects were observed on the lipids; cholesterol levels were significantly lowered in the extract treated group, after 28 days, in comparison with the 0 day value of the same group (p< 0.05). Triglyceride and LDL values were lower in extract treated group, although the values were not statistically significant. The results obtained in this study suggest that UD has antihyperglycemic and anti-hyperlipidemic activity in type 2 diabetic model rats.", "num_citations": "46\n", "authors": ["633"]}

Gentamicin (100 mg/kg/day for 7 days) was administered and nephrotoxicity was evaluated biochemically (significantly decreased reduced glutathione in renal cortex and significantly increased serum creatinine and serum urea) and histologically (moderate degree of proximal tubular damage). The n-hexane extract of N. sativa (5 mL/kg/day) was administered as pre, post and concomitant treatment for 7 days in the nephrotoxic rats. Statistically significant amelioration in all the biochemical parameters supported by significantly improved renal cortical histology was observed in the n-hexane extract of N. sativa treated nephrotoxic rats, which was more evident in the post treatment group than the pre treatment and the concomitantly-treated group. It is suggested that some ingredients contained in the n-hexane extract of N. sativa effected in ameliorating the signs of nephrotoxicity and that the specific active principle of the n-hexane extract of N. sativa responsible for this amelioration if obtained, would be more useful.", "num_citations": "45\n", "authors": ["633"]}

Studies indicate that the incidence of JE is high in northwestern Bangladesh. Pigs are amplifying hosts for JE virus (JEV) and a potentially important source of virus in the environment. The objectives of this study were to describe the transmission dynamics of JEV among pigs in northwestern Bangladesh and estimate the potential impact of vaccination to reduce incidence among pigs.  Methodology/Principal Findings We conducted a comprehensive census of pigs in three JE endemic districts and tested a sample of them for evidence of previous JEV infection. We built a compartmental model to describe JEV transmission dynamics in this region and to estimate the potential impact of pig vaccination. We identified 11,364 pigs in the study area. Previous JEV infection was identified in 30% of pigs with no spatial differences in the proportion of pigs that were seropositive across the study area. We estimated that JEV infects 20% of susceptible pigs each year and the basic reproductive number among pigs was 1.2. The model suggest that vaccinating 50% of pigs each year resulted in an estimated 82% reduction in annual incidence in pigs.  Conclusions/Significance The widespread distribution of historic JEV infection in pigs suggests they may play an important role in virus transmission in this area. Future studies are required to understand the contribution of pig infections to JE risk in humans and the potential impact of pig vaccination on human disease.", "num_citations": "44\n", "authors": ["633"]}

While analyzing the risk-return profile, the research incorporated both market price and net asset value (NAV) of the mutual funds.NAV depends on the price of securities included in a fund's portfolio whereas, the market price is determined by demand and supply forces. Thus, the market price of a fund is not always equal to its NAV. The study uses market price as a basis for analyzing the risk-return profile of the funds for evaluating the performance of the funds in the market. With the purpose of assessing the performance of asset managers, the study uses NAV as a basis for computing Jensen's a and M squared measure. While assessing performance the study focuses on Jensen\u2019s a and M squared measure as other measures like Sharpe and Treynor do not work with negative numerators and do not provide information on whether the mutual fund outperformed the market portfolio. Both Jensen\u2019s a and M squared measure can independently describe whether a fund beat the market or not. A positive value of Jensen\u2019s a and M squared measure indicates that the fund outperformed the market considering respectively \u00df and s as a measure of risk. SEBL1STMF, POPULAR1MF, and IFILISLMF1 were among top four funds considering both M2 and Jensen\u2019s alpha measures based on both market price and NAV.

Among the 1,777 respondents interviewed, half (50%) reported drinking raw sap during the previous sap collection season and 37% consumed raw sap at least once per month. Few respondents (5%) heard about NiV. Thirty-seven percent of respondents reported hearing about a disease transmitted through raw sap consumption, inclusive of a 10% who related it with milder illness like diarrhea, vomiting or indigestion rather than NiV. Respondents who harvested date palm trees in their household were more likely to drink sap than those who did not own date palm trees (79% vs. 65% PR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1\u20131.3, p<0.001). When sap was available, respondents who heard about a disease from raw sap consumption were just as likely to drink it as those who did not hear about a disease (69% vs. 67%, PR 1.0, 95% CI 0.9\u20131.1, p = 0.512).

Taxol and its related compounds, produced by this endophyte were extracted by growing the fungus in simple nutrient media (potato dextrose broth, PDB). Taxol was identified and characterized by different analytical techniques (TLC, HPLC, FTIR, LC-ESI-MS/MS) following its extraction by ethyl acetate. In PDB media, this fungus was found to produce 382.2 \u03bcgL-1 of taxol which is about 7.6 x103 fold higher than the first reported endophytic fungi, Taxomyces andreanae. The extracted taxol exhibited cytotoxic activity in an in vitro culture of HeLa cancer cell line. The fungal extract also exhibited antifungal and antibacterial activities against different pathogenic strains. This is the first report of a jute endophytic fungus harboring the capacity to produce taxol and also the first reported taxol producing species that belongs to the Basidiomycota phylum, so far unknown to be a taxol producer. These findings suggest that the fungal endophyte, Grammothele lineata can be an excellent source of taxol and can also serve as a potential species for chemical and genetic engineering to enhance further the production of taxol.", "num_citations": "29\n", "authors": ["633"]}

Quality assessment was studied by monitoring the chemical (TVN, TMA), microbiological (TBC, TMC) and organoleptic changes in irradiated and non-irradiated (control) samples. Among chemical indicators of spoilage, total volatile nitrogen (TVN) values increased to 55 mg/100 g for nonirradiated samples whereas for irradiated fish lower values of 45 mg/100 g, 27.5 mg/100 g and 18.7 mg/100g were recorded at 3, 5 and 8 kGy respectively (day 90). Significantly lower values were obtained for irradiated samples reaching a final trimethylamine (TMA) value of 7.1, 5.3 and 4.9 mg N/100 g at 3, 5 and 8 kGy respectively whereas for non-irradiated samples it increased slowly attaining a value of 32.5 mg N/100 g after 90 days. Total bacterial counts as well as total mould counts for non-irradiated pomfret were higher than that of irradiated fish. The organoleptic scores of control sample were gradually decreased with the progress of storage period whereas irradiated samples showed the acceptable score upto 90 days. This study concludes that gamma radiation in combination with low temperature showed maximum shelf-life extension (90 days) in each dose of radiation used but in 8 kGy radiation, Pampus chinensis showed best quality.", "num_citations": "27\n", "authors": ["633"]}

Methods and Findings We identified cases presenting to local hospitals and described their clinical signs and symptoms. We interviewed patients and their families to collect illness histories and generate hypotheses about exposures associated with disease. An epidemiological study was conducted in two outbreak villages to investigate risk factors for developing illness. 76 patients were identified from 9 villages; 25% (19/76) died. Common presenting symptoms included vomiting, elevated liver enzymes, and altered mental status. In-depth interviews with 33 cases revealed that 31 (94%) had consumed ghagra shak, an uncultivated plant, in the hours before illness onset. Ghagra shak was consumed as a main meal by villagers due to inaccessibility of other foods following destructive monsoon flooding and rises in global food prices.

Consumption of certain foods such as fava beans, legumes; infection with bacteria or virus; and use of certain drugs such as primaquine, sulfa drugs etc. may result in lysis of RBCs in G6PD deficient individuals. The genetic defect that causes G6PD deficiency has been identified mostly as single base missense mutations. One hundred and sixty G6PD gene mutations, which lead to amino acid substitutions, have been described worldwide. The purpose of this study was to detect G6PD gene mutations in hospital-based settings in the local population of Dhaka city, Bangladesh. Qualitative fluorescent spot test and quantitative enzyme activity measurement using RANDOX G6PDH kit were performed for analysis of blood specimens and detection of G6PD-deficient participants. For G6PD-deficient samples, PCR was done with six sets of primers specific for G6PD gene. Automated Sanger sequencing of the PCR products was performed to identify the mutations in the gene. Based on fluorescence spot test and quantitative enzyme assay followed by G6PD gene sequencing, 12 specimens (11 males and one female) among 121 clinically suspected patient-specimens were found to be deficient, suggesting a frequency of 9.9% G6PD deficiency. Sequencing of the G6PD-deficient samples revealed c.C131G substitution (exon-3: Ala44Gly) in six samples, c.G487A substitution (exon-6:Gly163Ser) in five samples and c\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["633"]}

There were ten treatment combinations taking two varieties of mungbean viz. BARI mung-3 and BARI mung-4, and five bacterial and chemical fertilizers viz. control, Bradyrhizobium, Azotobacter, Bradyrhizobium plus Azotobacter and 20 kg N ha-1. The experiment was laid out in a split plot design with three replications assigning varities in main plots and bacterial and chemical fertilizers in subplots. The unit plot size was 4 mx 3 m. After 35 days of sowing, 10 plants were randomly uprooted from each plot to study nodulation. At maturity yield and yield contributing characters were recorded. Variety BARI mung-3 recorded significantly higher nodule number and weight, and shoot weight compared to BARI mung-4. On the other hand, BARI mung-4 produced significantly higher seed and stover yields than BARI mung-3 did. Application of Bradyrhizobium or Azotobacter or their combination significantly increased nodulation, and root and shoot weights at 35 days after sowing. Similarly, the number of seeds pod-1 and seed yield were significantly influenced by the bacterial biofertilizer. These results indicate that use of both Bradyrhizobium and Azotobacter inoculants appears to be an effective method for successful mungbean production at BAU farm.", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["633"]}

Rangpur division is more favorable for rice production. Monthly and yearly precipitation data (1983-2013) were collected from Bangladesh Meteorological department (BMD), Agargaon, Dhaka; Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council (BARC), Farmgate, Dhaka and rice production data were collected from Bangladesh Rice research Institute (BRRI); Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), Rangpur, Bangladesh. From the analyzed precipitation data, it was clearly found that in 1984, 1985, 1987, 1999 and 2005, there were heavy precipitations and resulting flash flood. The average precipitation of Rangpur was higher (1344 mm) in 1987 than 1984, 1985, 1999 and 2005. In Rangpur district, rice production was the highest in the year of 1983, 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 and lower in the year of 1984, 1985, 1987, 1994, 1999, 2000, 2005, and 2006 on the basis of total annual precipitation. Rice production reduced main two reasons such as, heavy precipitation causes flash flood and lower precipitation causes drought stress condition. Both are threat-full for higher rice production.

It focuses on soils mainly in Khulna City, Bangladesh that comprise fine-grained alluvium deposits of mostly silt and clay with some organic content and sand. A detailed geological and geotechnical investigation of the city and its surroundings was conducted to generalize the subsoil condition of the study area based on soil type and SPT values. The investigation results showed that the city is divided into four geological units and three geotechnical zones. To develop the GRNN model, more than 2326 field SPT values (N) have been collected from 42 clusters containing 143 boreholes spread over an area of 37\u2009km2.

The objectives of this manuscript are to understand pig raising patterns in Bangladesh, interactions between pigs and humans, social stigma and discrimination that pig raisers experience and to explore the implications of these findings for public health interventions. The study team conducted an exploratory qualitative study by interviewing backyard pig raisers and nomadic herders (n= 34), observing daily interactions between pigs and humans (n= 18) and drawing seasonal diagrams (n= 6) with herders to understand the reasons for movement of nomadic herds. Pig raisers had regular close interaction with pigs. They often touched, caressed and fed their pigs which exposed them to pigs\u2019 saliva and feces. Herders took their pigs close to human settlements for scavenging. Other domestic animals and poultry shared food and sleeping and scavenging places with pigs. Since pigs are taboo in Islam, a majority of Muslims rejected pig raising and stigmatized pig raisers. This study identified several potential ways for pigs to transmit infectious agents to humans in Bangladesh. Poverty and stigmatization of pig raisers make it difficult to implement health interventions to reduce the risk of such transmissions. Interventions that offer social support to reduce stigma and highlight economic benefits of disease control might interest of pig raisers in accepting interventions targeting pig borne zoonoses.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["633"]}

{"title": "Screening for congenital hypothyroidism-a new era in Bangladesh\n", "abstract": " Neonatal screening is a new concept, in Bangladesh. Currently a pilot program is ongoing where newborns are screened for congenital hypothyroidism (CH). In a country like Bangladesh, where people are still fighting childhood problems like malnutrition, diarrhea and other communicable diseases with a high infant and child mortality rate, instituting a newborn screening program is a challenge. TSH is measured on filter paper using IRMA methods. Both cord and heel prick blood are used. A cut off value of 20 mlU/I is used above which all babies are recalled for serum T4 evaluation. Approximately 2600 newborns have been screened in the pilot program. Of these, 2 newborns were detected with CH (incidence rate 1: 1300). Since it is a new program in Bangladesh, effort is mainly given on popularizing the program and building necessary infra-structure. The newborn screening program has been accepted with mixed reaction in the community. Hopefully, the government is developing a positive attitude towards the program. The paediatricians and obstetricians are also interested. The program needs more publicity. Patronization by the government and other international bodies will be essential for continuation of the program.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["633"]}

In addition, TSP is considered as a NP-hard problem as well as an optimal minimization problem. Selection, crossover and mutation are the three main operators of GA. The algorithm is usually employed to find the optimal minimum total distance to visit all the nodes in a TSP. Therefore, the research presents a new crossover operator for TSP, allowing the further minimization of the total distance. The proposed crossover operator consists of two crossover point selection and new offspring creation by performing cost comparison. The computational results as well as the comparison with available well-developed crossover operators are also presented. It has been found that the new crossover operator produces better results than that of other cross-over operators.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["633"]}

Therefore, utilizing maximum power point tracking (MPPT) becomes essential for PV systems. In this paper, a novel internet of things (IoT)-equipped MPPT solar charge controller (SCC) is designed and implemented. The proposed circuit system utilizes IoT-based sensors to send vital data to the cloud for remote monitoring and controlling purposes. The IoT platform helps the system to be monitored remotely. The PIC16F877A is used as a main controller of the proposed MPPT-SCC besides implementing the perturb and observe (P&O) technique and a customized buck\u2013boost converter. To validate the proposed system, both simulation and hardware implementation are carried out by the MATLAB/SIMULINK environment and laboratory set up, respectively. The proposed MPPT-SCC can handle the maximum current of 10 A at 12 V voltage. Results show that the efficiency of the proposed system reaches up to 99.74% during a month of performance testing duration. View Full-Text", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["633"]}
{"title": "Folk medicine in Bangladesh: Healing with plants by a practitioner in Kushtia district\n", "abstract": " Folk medicine or treatment by individuals without any formal training, supervision or registration is a common form of medicinal practice in Bangladesh and is generally done with whole plants or plant parts. Folk medicinal practitioners (FMPs) are a common feature in rural Bangladesh with practically every village having one or more FMPs. The unique feature of the FMPs is their remarkable diversity in the selection of plants for treatment. Since folk medicinal practice has been going on in Bangladesh for centuries, it follows that this system of practice has to be found beneficial by the patients or otherwise it would have disappeared a long time ago. As such, the various plants used by FMPs need to be documented for they can serve as important sources of novel drug discoveries. The objective of this study was to document the plant-based remedies of a rural FMP in Kushtia district, Bangladesh. The FMP was found to use a total of 12 plants in his treatment. The plants were distributed in twelve families and were used for the treatment of rheumatic fever, pain, piles, hormone disorders in male, skin disorders, leprosy, hernia, and antidote to poisoning. The advantage with herbal medicine lies in the availability and affordability of medicinal plants. If the FMP\u2019s formulations prove to be scientifically sound, the plants can prove to be possibly a less expensive alternative to allopathic treatments. At the same time, these would create awareness and spur conservation of the plants, quite a few of which are rapidly becoming endangered in the wild.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["633"]}

{"title": "Bakery Science of Bread and the Effect of Salt Reduction on Quality: A Review\n", "abstract": " Salt or sodium chloride is widely used in most homemade dishes or processed foods. It can be considered as a crucial ingredient because, without adding salt most dishes or food products may have less flavor, become tasteless and not appetizing. The addition of salt can provide salty taste or can even mask the bitter taste. It is also widely used as a preserving agent and can increase product\u2019s shelf life. Bread is widely consumed and serves as a staple food for certain countries. Not only that, bread is one of the world\u2019s oldest foods and is said to be the largest contributor of salt in our diet. While bread is believed to supply the major percentage of daily salt intake, reduction of salt in this product can assist in reducing the consumption of salt in human\u2019s diet. Salt is also found to have detrimental impact on human health as it can cause cardiovascular diseases. Nevertheless, the salt reduction in bread is not easy to apply as salt play important roles in bread-making and its reduction can affect the quality of bread. Salt in bread has been observed to improve dough-making process, enhances the flavor of bread and produces nice brown colour of the bread's crust through Maillard reaction. Besides that, salt also helps in improving the texture, decreasing staling and increasing the microbial shelf life of the bread.

Elder people with neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson disease often fall. This leads to the damage of physical condition and also mental condition. Therefore, elderly people should be taken care of all the time. However, it is not possible to take care of them every moment. Therefore, an automatic fall detection system is required to track elderly at any time. An automated fall detection system will provide timely assistance and hence, it will reduce medical care costs significantly. The recent developments in motion- sensor technologies have allowed the efficient use of wearable sensors in the overall treatment of the elderly.

A Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) speed control strategy is performed to adjust the rotor speed. The framework is modelled and simulated by using Proteus software.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["633"]}

{"title": "Predicting Neonatal Hyperbilirubinemia Using First Day Serum Bilirubin Level in Late Preterm and Term Healthy Newborn.\n", "abstract": " Hyperbilirubinemia is a common problem during the neonatal period and is the most common reason for readmission after early hospital discharge of the healthy near term and term infants. This early discharge policy along with limited follow-up facilities in developing countries and inadequate communication between physicians and parents necessitates a prognostic test to predict hyperbilirubinemia in these newborns; for early and effective management and prevention of potential complication before it occurred. This observational analytical study was done to determine the predictability of day1 total serum bilirubin (TSB) level as a screening test and identify the best cutoff value which would predict neonates likely to develop significant hyperbilirubinemia. The study was carried out in the Department of Neonatology and Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka, Bangladesh from 1st April 2013 to 31st March 2014. A TSB level of\u2265 17mg/dl after 72 hours was defined as significant hyperbilirubinemia. By purposive sampling method, 100 healthy late preterm and term neonates fulfilling the inclusion criteria were enrolled and 89 were finally analyzed. Among 89 neonates 14 (15.74%) developed significant hyperbilirubinemia (Group II) and 75 (84.26%) did not develop hyperbilirubinemia (Group I). Mean time of sample collection was similar in both groups. Mean TSB level on day1 was significantly higher in Group II (5.97\u00b11.74 mg/dl) than Group I (3.19\u00b11.4 mg/dl).

The physicochemical properties such as intrinsic solubility (solubility of unionized form) in water (logS), partition coefficient (logP), H bond donor and acceptor count were calculated using MarvinSketch software. The pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties were calculated using online server PreADMET. The calculated aqueous solubility demonstrated that all the seven compounds possess limited solubility which ranged from very slightly soluble to practically insoluble. The calculation of partition coefficient suggested that all the compounds are lipophilic in nature and have higher affinity to reside in n-octanol than in water. The human intestinal absorption (HIA), Caco-2 cell penetrability, plasma protein binding (PPB) and Cbrain/Cblood of the seven compounds were ranged from 94.89%-100.00%, 20.18-54.75 nm/s, 73.52%-100.00% and 0.353-2.331, respectively. The computed metabolism demonstrated that DNF, AL, IA, PC and TC are substrate for cytochrome P450 3A4. However, all the compounds displayed inhibitory characteristics against cytochrome P450 3A4. The virtual screening also demonstrated that AL, PG and BPG are 2C19 inhibitors and all the natural agents except DNF are 2C9 inhibitors. In\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["633"]}

In Bangladesh, risk factors for cervical cancer are related to early marriage, early sexual activities, multiparity, STD, s and low socioeconomic condition. Lack of knowledge about the risk factors is also an important determinant behind the incidence of these cancers. With the objectives to assess whether they can mention the name of female genital cancer and risk factors for those cancers, this study was conducted. Methodology: This was a prospective observational study. Total 297 women attending the outpatient department of obstetrics and Gynaecology Unit of Dhaka National Medical College Hospital were interviewed with a preset questionnaire during a period of January to March 2009. Results: About 85.8% of women could mention that they had heard of genital cancers. Among those they mentioned the name of uterus (65%), cervix (5.5%) and breast (29.5%).

However, the transformation of model test results to prototype is so much complex (scale effect). This paper highlights a FE ideology for evaluation of the response of shallow circular anchor foundations in sands with sophisticated strain hardening-softening behaviour. In these soils, the progressive failure can occur because of the non-mobilization of pinnacle strength of soil on potential failure surface and softening behaviour of soils. The presented paradigm allows this failure phenomenon to be properly evaluated by using a non-associated elastoplastic constitutive model coupled with explicit dynamic relaxation method considering yield surface as the MC material model and the potential surface is the smooth DP model having shear band effect.

Avoiding the Gauss-Bonnet density becoming a total derivative is achieved by employing the formalism of metric-independent non-Riemannian spacetime volume-forms. The non-Riemannian volume element triggers dynamically the Gauss-Bonnet scalar to become an arbitrary integration constant on-shell. We describe in some detail the class of static spherically symmetric solutions of the above modified D=4 Gauss-Bonnet gravity including solutions with deformed (anti)-de Sitter geometries, black holes, domain walls and Kantowski-Sachs-type universes. Some solutions exhibit physical spacetime singular surfaces not hidden behind horizons and bordering whole forbidden regions of space. Singularities can be avoided by pairwise matching of two solutions along appropriate domain walls. For a broad class of solutions the corresponding matter source is shown to be a special form of nonlinear electrodynamics whose Lagrangian L(F^2) is a non-analytic function of F^2 (the square of Maxwell tensor F_mu_nu), i.e., L(F^2) is not of Born-Infeld type.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["633"]}

Biorefinery processing steps are interrelated and trade-offs between process parameters impact the cost and efficiency of the overall system. Although densified biomass as a biorefinery feedstock would improve biomass supply logistics, it has not been considered viable due to high energy and emissions associated with the densification process. However, the potential synergies of biomass densification with downstream processing steps are critical. An energy-efficient system with improved supply logistics, reduced severity pretreatment, and improved hydrolysis efficiency will lower the cost of sugar production from cellulosic biomass. The objective of this research was to increase overall process efficiency of biorefineries by understanding how different process parameters affect the hydrolysis efficiency. Processing trade-offs in pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis for densified and non-densified biomass for economical sugar production were evaluated. A life cycle perspective was taken to compare fossil energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from pelleted and non-pelleted corn stover during transportation and soaking in aqueous ammonia (SAA) pretreatment. A model developed to demonstrate the interaction of enzymatic hydrolysis factors to improve hydrolysis efficiency showed that enzyme loadings had a more significant effect on hydrolysis rates than pH or temperature.

{"title": "Assessment of overweight, obesity and metabolic variables among students of a private medical college in Dhaka city\n", "abstract": " Background: Overweight and obesity are recognized as recent threat which affecting both developing and developed countries. Obesity and its associated morbidities are leading cause of most non-communicable diseases. Few recent studies have indicated the presence of increase in overweight and obesity among children and adolescent but there is no study among adult groups. Method and material: This cross sectional study was done to assess the prevalence of overweight, obesity and metabolic variables with their relation among medical students. Result: Our result reveals that 8.6% & 1.9% male and 15% & 3.2% female are suffering from overweight and obesity (based on BMI) respectively. More females (31.3% and 65.2%) are centrally obese than males (3.5% and 34.8%)(According to Waist Hip ratio and Waist Height ratio respectively). But according to Waist circumference more males (30.7%) are obese than females (24%). There is also significant difference of male and female BP. DBP and SBP of male (79.22 mmHg & 118.9 mmHg) have high normal level than female (72.71 mmHg and 108.67 mmHg)(P< 0.001). There is no significant difference of glycaemic status (p<. 286) and lipid profile (p<. 347) with central obesity. Conclusion: Although male students have high upper level of blood pressure, female students are more obese than males (both according to BMI and central obesity). High blood pressure and obesity both acts as risk factors for the development of non communicable disease. Students awareness therefore should be increased to reduce central obesity and BP within normal range.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["633"]}

Sampling was carried out at the continuous air monitoring station (CAMS-2) at the Farm Gate site, a location near a major traffic intersection. It was observed from the analysis, that the PM 2.5 concentrations were not varying so much between day and night time. This might be due to the rainfall and high humidity during these days. As the PM 2.5 is less, so BC/PM 2.5 becomes high compared to winter season. Therefore PM 2.5/PM 10 ratio is also less compared to winter time, as PM 2.5 is the part of PM 10. The black carbon (BC) value is less during this period compared to winter due to both local and meteorological effect. It was also found that although there was heavy rainfall on 13 July 2010, the PM concentration is also high.

Sugarbeet pulp has not received a great deal of attention because of its limited supply on a national basis. On a regional basis, however, Minnesota and North Dakota combined typically produce more than 50% of the total US sugarbeets [1]. Ethanol from non-sucrose sugars in beet pulp could produce regionally up to 75-90 million gallons of ethanol per year. This could potentially be combined with sucrose ethanol from excess beet production if fermentation facilities were developed.As a potential feedstock, sugarbeet pulp has some significant logistical advantages over more conventional biomass sources such as corn stover, wheat straw, or perennial bioenergy crops. Biomass harvest, storage and transportation may all be limiting factors in conventional biomass processing while beet pulp requires little or no extra cost or technical development in these areas. In addition, the relatively unique composition of beet pulp gives it some processing advantages. Other biomass feedstocks require expensive thermochemical pretreatment prior to enzymatic hydrolysis of the cellulose fraction [2]. Sugarbeet pulp has a large percentage of pectin and hemicellulose that may be hydrolyzed using commercial enzyme mixtures without the need for thermochemical processing [3, 4].", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["633"]}

Software companies are under increasing competitive pressure for improving delivery parameters such as cost, quality, and time. Systematic reuse is an opportunity of continued cost reduction, quality improvement and lead time reduction in software delivery. Systematic reuse largely depends on the scope of delivering customized software applications in the same market segment repeatedly to multiple customers. Thorough market analysis provides basic inputs for defining generic product concept for delivering mass customized solutions. The problem of establishing a successful new business around a generic software product concept is not challenging because of shortage of ideas, but rather problems exist in proper analysis of the market and adoption of reuse capability for continued price reduction and quality improvement to deal with evolving market forces for delivering mass customized solutions. This paper, therefore, suggests the application of market positioning strategy to benefit from software reuse for delivering customized software solutions.

The world's consumption of toxic and hazardous materials has increased in this century. Their contribution to raise the living standard in modern society cannot be ignored. This is because the attitude of the industries towards hazardous materials, the main components of many important commercial products, has undergone a definite change in recent years.

A~ t.'Jeirname implies, these materials require special attention as they may result in severe health and environmental effects. Industries in Bangladesh, are the prime consumers of toxic and hazardous materials and they are producers as well. Among them are steel, non-ferrous metals, fertilizer, pesticides, asbestos, cement, toxic chemicals and leather. Many of them produce lots of hazardous wastes. They discharge their wastewater untreated and the high biological and chemical contaminants degrade the aquatic life in the nearby rivers. Ground water pollution is a strong possibility too. The growth of industries in the country has generally been unplanned without keeping the issue of environment protection in careful considerations. There are many industries in the residential areas causing air and water pollution through smoke emission and dumping of untreated effluent. Industrial wastes have polluted the water of major rivers in the country like the Buriganga, the Sitalakhya, the Karnaphuli and theRupsha rivers. The Bay of Bengal is also not spared.

Emergence of antibiotic resistance has further complicated the scenario. A wide range of virulence factors and resistance genes are present in Campylobacter species and it is hypothesized there are genotypic variations in the prevalence of these genes. The study was conducted to investigate the presence of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes as well as to investigate difference in prevalence rate based on genotype through in silico tools. Among 26 species studied, sixteen isolates (61.54%) had the cdtB gene that breaks the double helix bonds. The cdtA genes were detected in ten (38.46%) C. jejuni strains while fifty percent (n= 13) isolates harbored the cdtC genes. Ten isolates that harboured all three adjacent cdt genes were most toxigenic. The lipo-oligosaccharides associated genes, cgtB and wlaN, responsible for \u03b2-1, 3 galactosyltransferase production, were found in 7.69% and 30.77% of the isolates, respectively. About 57.69% isolates expressed waaC genes.

The purpose of this review was to describe the pervasiveness of malnutrition and HIV and also categorize the associated determinants in Bangladesh. An attempt was being made through this review to highlights various situate of malnutrition problems and HIV/AIDS. For this purpose, data was reviewed during 1980 to 2011 from different secondary sources. As in Bangladesh the rapidity of under nutrition is too elevated, although slow, the rate of overweight and obesity in children and women is also rising and in the mid-1980s Bangladesh initiated an early retort to the HIV outbreak. Because of lack of acquaintance about reproductive health issues, youngsters are more in danger than adults and in the midst of the youngsters, girls are more at risk. On the other hand malnutrition is anticipated to be causes of about 60% of maternal childhood and deaths in Bangladesh. Information plays a vital role to have exact understanding of people about HIV/AIDS spread and the strategies for prevention of malnutrition and various informative drives through media should be more regular because still the knowledge stage seems to be low and misconceptions apprehended.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["633"]}
