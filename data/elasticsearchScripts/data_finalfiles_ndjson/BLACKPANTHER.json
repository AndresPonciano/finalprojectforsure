Both levels of processing and generation effects were found to occur only for recognition accompanied by conscious recollection. Recognition in the absence of conscious recollection, although less likely, was generally reliable and uninfluenced by encoding conditions. These results are consistent with dual-process theories of recognition, which assume that recognition and priming in implicit memory have a common component.

A promising area of interest-but one fairly new to the real-time community-is object-oriented programming. Java, for example, draws heavily from object orientation and is highly suitable for extension to real-time and embedded systems. Recognizing this fit between Java and real-time software development, the Real-Time for Java Experts Group (RTJEG) began developing the real-time specification for Java (RTSJ) in March 1999 under the Java Community Process. This article explains RTSJ's features and the thinking behind the specification's design.

It is designed to be simple enough that many programmers can achieve fluency in the language. The Java programming language is related to C and C++ but is organized rather differently, with a number of aspects of C and C++ omitted and a few ideas from other languages included. It is intended to be a production language, not a research language, and so, as CAR Hoare suggested in his classic paper on language design, the design has avoided including new and untested features.The Java programming language is strongly typed. This specification clearly distinguishes between the compile-time errors that can and must be detected at compile time, and those that occur at run time. Compile time normally consists of translating programs into a machine-independent byte code representation. Run-time activities include loading and linking of the classes needed to execute a program, optional machine code generation and dynamic optimization of the program, and actual program execution.", "num_citations": "458\n", "authors": ["17"]}

This view no longer seems tenable. There are now several studies showing that an auditory recency advantage occurs not only in long-term memory, but under conditions in which it cannot possibly be attributed to echoic memory. Also, similar recency phenomena have been discovered in short-term memory when the items are lip-read, or presented in sign-language, rather than heard.

The approach is an experiential one, introduced by Tulving (1985) with his distinction between remember and know responses. Remember and know responses are subjective reports of the kinds of experiences that occur during memory retrieval. Experiences that are characterized by the speci\ufb01c recollection of contextual details involving one\u2019s self at a particular time, in a particular place, are de\ufb01ned as remembering. Experiences of memory that lack these characteristics but are characterized instead by a more abstract awareness of familiarity are de\ufb01ned as knowing.

These findings led Nairne et al. to conclude that generation effects depend on the extent to which words are associatively linked to other words in semantic memory, not on lexical representation per se. In a series of experiments designed to test the generality of Nairne et al.'s low-frequency finding, we found not only that generation effects occurred for low-frequency words but also that those effects were on the whole indistinguishable from effects obtained with high-frequency words. These findings indicate that word frequency does not define an essential boundary condition for generation effects and so provides no basis for preferring an associative hypothesis to a lexical one.(PsycINFO\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "54\n", "authors": ["17"]}

The sprite objects define the images on the output display, and the locations of the sprite objects are changed to create the animation. The computer system includes three areas of physical memory assigned the status of a front buffer, a back buffer, and a cache buffer. The front buffer stores a frame currently displayed on the output display. The cache buffer is utilized to store a subset of the sprite objects so that all sprite objects need not be rendered for each frame of animation. The contents of the cache buffer are copied to the back buffer during display of the front buffer. To display a subsequent frame, the front and back buffers are switched. A cache buffer permits display of full-motion animation by minimizing use of processor and computer resources.", "num_citations": "42\n", "authors": ["17"]}

{"title": "The Java language Specificition\n", "abstract": " Java\u00ae programming language is a general-purpose, concurrent, classbased, object-oriented language. It is designed to be simple enough that many programmers can achieve fluency in the language. The Java programming language is related to C and C++ but is organized rather differently, with a number of aspects of C and C++ omitted and a few ideas from other languages included. It is intended to be a production language, not a research language, and so, as CAR Hoare suggested in his classic paper on language design, the design has avoided including new and untested features.The Java programming language is strongly and statically typed. This specification clearly distinguishes between the compile-time errors that can and must be detected at compile time, and those that occur at run time. Compile time normally consists of translating programs into a machine-independent byte code representation. Run-time activities include loading and linking of the classes needed to execute a program, optional machine code generation and dynamic optimization of the program, and actual program execution. The Java programming language is a relatively high-level language, in that details of the machine representation are not available through the language. It includes automatic storage management, typically using a garbage collector, to avoid the safety problems of explicit deallocation (as in C's free or C++'s delete). High-performance garbage-collected implementations can have bounded pauses to support systems programming and real-time applications. The language does not include any unsafe constructs, such as array accesses\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["17"]}

{"title": "The Real-Time for Java Expert Group\n", "abstract": " In 1997 the idea of writing real-time applications in the Java programming language seemed unrealistic. Real-time programmers talk about wanting consistent timing behavior more than absolute speed, but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t require excellent overall performance. The Java runtime is sometimes interpreted, and almost always uses a garbage collector. The early versions were not known for their blistering performance.Nevertheless, Java platforms were already being incorporated into real-time systems. It is fairly easy to build a hybrid system that uses C for modules that have real-time requirements and other components written to the Java platform. It is also possible to implement the Java interpreter in hardware (for performance), and integrate the system without a garbage collector (for consistent performance). aJile Systems produces a Java processor with acceptable real-time characteristics. Until the summer of 1998, efforts toward support for real-time programming on the Java platform were fragmented. Kelvin Nilsen from NewMonics and Lisa Carnahan from the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) led one effort, Greg Bollella from IBM led a group of companies that had a stake in Java technology and real-time, and Sun had an internal real-time project based on the Java platform.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["17"]}

{"title": "RECOLLECTIVE EXPERIENCE\n", "abstract": " The function of conscious awareness in memory has gained a fresh import-ance in contemporary memory research. This importance stems largely from two related sets of findings: neuropsychological findings from studies with amnesic patients and findings of related patterns of functional dissociation from studies with memory-unimpaired adults. Both sets of findings can be described in terms of the distinction that has been made between explicit and implicit memory tests (Graf & Schacter, 1985; see Schacter, 1987, for a recent review). Explicit memory tests are those in which subjects are asked to remember, in the sense of being able consciously to recollect, prior events and experiences. Such tests include conventional episodic memory tests such as recognition and recall. Implicit memory tests are those in which the conscious recollection of prior events and experiences is not required. Such tests include perceptual identification, lexical decision, and word-stem and word-fragment completion.

{"title": "2.17 Remembering and Knowing\n", "abstract": " Tulving's (1983, 1985) original proposal was of three kinds of consciousness, each reflecting one of three memory systems. The three kinds of con-sciousness were autonoetic, noetic, and anoetic, which respectively mean self-knowing, knowing, and not knowing. The three corresponding memory systems were episodic, semantic, and procedural memory. Only autonoetic and noetic consciousness involve awareness of memory. Anoetic consciousness is bound to the present, not the past, and involves awareness of the current situation. Autonoetic con-sciousness allows awareness of oneself in a previous situation, in the sense of what has been called mental time travel. It allows one to reexperience previous events and to relive them mentally, including one's own part in them. It is characteristic of episodic memory, which therefore entails something more than, or other than, autobiographical memory.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["17"]}
{"title": "The role of attention and consistency with schema expectation in memory for objects in place\n", "abstract": " The role of attention and consistency with schema expectation in memory for objects in place were examined in one experiment. Forty participants were asked to study a picture of either the graduate student office or the preschool classroom, and either under full attention condition or under divided attention condition. Sixteen stimulus items, half consistent and half inconsistent with schema expectation about the room settings were placed throughout the room. Participants were later given a free recall test, followed by a same-changed recognition memory test immediately after that. The results show that participants remembered better under full attention condition than under divided attention condition. Items inconsistent with schema expectation were better recalled and recognized than items consistent with schema expectation both under full attention and divided attention conditions. These results support the findings on the consistency effect in some previous studies. More importantly, the present study reveals the influence of manipulation of attention on the consistency effect. The results show that consistency effect occurs in both conditions, with a greater effect reported under divided attention condition than under full attention condition. Reducing the participants\u2019 attention increases the consistency effect.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["17"]}

{"title": "Hello World (s)!: From Code to Culture: a 10 Year Celebration of Java Technology\n", "abstract": " Foreword 2005 marks t he 10th birthday of Java technology. Starting out as just a programming language, Java technology has exploded into a ubiquitous technology platform that today touches the lives of people everywhere. The 10th birthday celebration book tells the story of how Java technology came to influence technologists, then businesses, then consumers, and now has become the predominate software on the planet. In the early 1990s, a small group of us from Sun Microsystems were given the opportunity to spend all of our time thinking of what\" the next big thing in technology\" would be. What we created was a hardware-independent software platform unlike any other. We thought it was pretty cool, and so did our developer friends. But at that time, I don't think that any of us really had any idea of what we had done, not to mention how it would change the world. I certainly know I didn't. Of course, it wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for the Java developer community. Developers are the ones who made the technology a success over the years. Their ingenuity, creativity, and millions of hours of contributed help has made the platform what it is today.

{"title": "Source Memory in Adults with Asperger's Syndrome\n", "abstract": " The memory difficulties of people with Asperger's syndrome/autism may relate to the degree of support available to the subject and the degree of control needed during remembering (Bowler et al., 1997). This observation may explain the mixed findings on source memory in autism: Benetto et al (1996) report increased intrusions of items from earlier lists in a multi-list free-recall paradigm (no support), yet Farrant (1998) reported no impairment in identification of which of two experimenters had spoken a particular word (support present). We report two studies of the effects of presence or absence of suport on source memory in individuals with Asperger's syndrome. In Experiment 1, subjects were asked to perform one of four things (think of an associate, generate the opposite of the word, think of an action related to the word or think of a word that rhymes with it) on studied words.

Subjects also typically tend to include a non-studied word in free recall when that word is a strong associate of the study list items. Since individuals with autistic spectrum disorder have been shown not to make use of category information to aid their free recall, we hypothesised that they would not show the illusory memory effect just described. We asked high-functioning adults with autism and IQ-matched controls to recall 12 lists of words. Each list comprised the 15 strongest associates of a non-presented target word.

Tulving has argued that free recall employs the episodic memory system, in which recall is accompanied by a distinct recollective experience and can be measured experimentally in a recognition memory paradigm by asking subjects to indicate whether they consciously'remember'a study-list item, or whether they just'know'that it was on the list, without recollection of the specific episode. In view of the hypothesised link between free recall and episodic memory, we asked high-functioning individuals with autism (HFA) and controls matched on age, gender and verbal IQ. to study lists of high-and low-frequency words and, after a delay, to indicate whether they remembered having seen a study list item before.

It takes a pragmatic approach and restricts itself to a narrow but very useful domain. The algorithms used by MAGRITI'E, an editor for simple line drawings, are presented. A major portion of the work concerns the algebraic transformation of sets of constraints. It describes algorithms for identifying difficult subregions of a constraint graph and replacing them with a transformed and simplified new constraint.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["17"]}
{"title": "Some remarks on the relationship between initial output order and subsequent performance in free recall\n", "abstract": " The function reported by Morris seems very similar to that observed here, and both these results contrast with those obtained by Darley & Murdock (1971) and by Rundus, Loftus & Atkinson (1970). In those earlier studies, Vincentization procedures had been used to examine the output order function following immediate free recall. Over the later output positions, Darley & Murdock found that the function increased, whereas Rundus et al. found that it declined: in neither study did the trend appear to be particularly dramatic. The most likely explanation of the discrepant pattern of results over these several studies may lie in certain problems associated with the procedures used to calculate the output order function. Vincentization corrects for a possible subject-selection artifact in that not all subjects", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["17"]}

{"title": "Java (programming language) Information\n", "abstract": " Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.

{"title": "13 Rehearsal and directed forgetting in adults with Asperger syndrome\n", "abstract": " Episodic memory impairments in individuals with autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs) are quite selective and can be interpreted in terms of both retrieval and encoding impairments. For example, whilst recall of test items without specific cues (free recall) is often impaired in children with autism in relation to comparison groups, performance is relatively unimpaired when appropriate retrieval cues are provided at the test stage of the procedure (Boucher & Lewis, 1989; Boucher & Warrington, 1976; Tager-Flusberg, 1991). Bowler, Matthews and Gardiner (1997) found that adults with Asperger syndrome (AS), defined as high-functioning individuals on the autistic spectrum that met the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10; World Health Organization, 1993) criteria for AS excluding the language criteria, were also unimpaired in cued-recall in comparison to typical adults.

{"title": "Binding of Multiple Features in Memory by High-Functioning Adults with\n", "abstract": " Diminished episodic memory and diminished use of semantic information to aid recall by individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are both thought to result from diminished relational binding of elements of complex stimuli. To test this hypothesis, we asked highfunctioning adults with ASD and typical comparison participants to study grids in which some cells contained drawings of objects in non-canonical colours. Participants were told at study which features (colour, item, location) would be tested in a later memory test. In a second experiment, participants studied similar grids and were told that they would be tested on object-location or object-colour combinations. Recognition of combinations was significantly diminished in ASD, which survived covarying performance on the Color Trails Test (D\u2019Elia, Satz, Uchiyama et al., 1996), a test of executive difficulties. The findings raise the possibility that medial temporal as well as frontal lobe processes are dysfunctional in ASD.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["17"]}

{"title": "Effects of Related and Unrelated Context on Recall and Recognition by\n", "abstract": " Memory in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterised by greater difficulties with recall rather than recognition and with a diminished use of semantic or associative relatedness in the aid of recall. Two experiments are reported that test the effects of item-context relatedness on recall and recognition in adults with highfunctioning ASD (HFA) and matched typical comparison participants. In both experiments, participants studied words presented inside a red rectangle and were told to ignore context words presented outside the rectangle. Context words were either related or unrelated to the study words. The results showed that relatedness of context enhanced recall for the typical group only. However, recognition was enhanced by relatedness in both groups of participants. On a behavioural level, these findings confirm the Task Support Hypothesis (Bowler, Gardiner & Berthollier, 2004), which states that individuals with ASD will show greater difficulty on memory tests that provide little support for retrieval. The findings extend this hypothesis by showing that it operates at the level of relatedness between studied items and incidentally-encoded context. By showing difficulties in memory for associated items, the findings are also consistent with conjectures that implicate medial temporal lobe and frontal lobe dysfunction in the memory difficulties of individuals with ASD.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["17"]}

The upper left pixel is at coordinate (0, 0) and coordinates increase down and to the right. The width and height of the window may be interrogated by calling wm_GetDimensions. Performing operations at coordinates outside of the window area causes the operation to be properly clipped. One unit in the horizontal or vertical direction corresponds to one pixel. There is a current position which moves around as operations are performed.This extremely simple coordinate system was explicitly chosen in preference to a more general one with full homogenous transformations. Many client programs are insensitive to which coordinate system is chosen: any one is good as any other; others have such specialized requirements that they need to do their own coordinate transformations themselves, anyway.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["17"]}

When support is present, such as in cued recall, difficulties are less evident. Such observations may explain the mixed findings on source memory in autism. Bennetto, Pennington and Rogers (1996) found increased earlier-list intrusions in a multi-list free-recall paradigm (support absent), yet Farrant, Blades and Boucher (1998) reported no impairment in identification of who had spoken a particular word at study (support present). We tested the effects on source memory of presence or absence of support for source in participants with Asperger\u2019s syndrome.

{"title": "The Java\u2122 Series\n", "abstract": " THE Java\u2122 programming language was originally called Oak, and was designed for use in embedded consumer-electronic applications by James Gosling. After several years of experience with the language, and significant contributions by Ed Frank, Patrick Naughton, Jonathan Payne, and Chris Warth it was retargeted to the Internet, renamed, and substantially revised to be the language specified here. The final form of the language was defined by James Gosling, Bill Joy, Guy Steele, Richard Tuck, Frank Yellin, and Arthur van Hoff, with help from Graham Hamilton, Tim Lindholm, and many other friends and colleagues. The Java programming language is a general-purpose concurrent class-based object-oriented programming language, specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It allows application developers to write a program once and then be able to run it everywhere on the Internet. This book attempts a complete specification of the syntax and semantics of the language. We intend that the behavior of every language construct is specified here, so that all implementations will accept the same programs. Except for timing dependencies or other non-determinisms and given sufficient time and sufficient memory space, a program written in the Java programming language should compute the same result on all machines and in all implementations.We believe that the Java programming language is a mature language, ready for widespread use. Nevertheless, we expect some evolution of the language in the years to come. We intend to manage this evolution in a way that is completely compatible with\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["17"]}
