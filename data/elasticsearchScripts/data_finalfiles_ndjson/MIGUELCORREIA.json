{"title": "Lucy in the sky without diamonds: Stealing confidential data in the cloud\n", "abstract": " Cloud Computing is a recent paradigm that is creating high expectations about benefits such as the pay-per-use model and elasticity of resources. However, with this optimism come also concerns about security. In a public cloud, the user's data storage and processing is no longer done inside its premises, but in data centers owned and administrated by the cloud provider. This may be a concern for organizations that deal with critical data, such as medical records. We show that a malicious insider can steal confidential data of the cloud user, so the user is mostly left with trusting the cloud provider. The paper achieves this goal by showing a set of attacks that demonstrate how a malicious insider can easily obtain passwords, cryptographic keys, files and other confidential data. Additionally, the paper shows that recent research results that might be useful to protect data in the cloud, are still not enough to deal with the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "239\n", "authors": ["338"]}
{"title": "Practical hardening of crash-tolerant systems\n", "abstract": " Recent failures of production systems have highlighted the importance of tolerating faults beyond crashes. The industry has so far addressed this problem by hardening crash-tolerant systems with ad hoc error detection checks, potentially overlooking critical fault scenarios. We propose a generic and principled hardening technique for Arbitrary State Corruption (ASC) faults, which specifically model the effects of realistic data corruptions on distributed processes. Hardening does not require the use of trusted components or the replication of the process over multiple physical servers. We implemented a wrapper library to transparently harden distributed processes. To exercise our library and evaluate our technique, we obtained ASC-tolerant versions of Paxos, of a subset of the ZooKeeper API, and of an eventually consistent storage by implementing crash-tolerant protocols and automatically hardening them using our library. Our evaluation shows that the throughput of our ASC-hardened state machine replication outperforms its Byzantine-tolerant counterpart by up to 70%.", "num_citations": "74\n", "authors": ["338"]}

Diagnosis is challenging, since high-throughput applications with frequent interactions between the different components allow fast error propagation. It is desirable to consider applications as blackboxes for the diagnostic process. In this paper, we propose a Monitor architecture for diagnosing failures in large-scale network protocols. The monitor only observes the message exchanges between the protocol entities (PEs) remotely and does not access the internal protocol state. At runtime, it builds a causal graph between the PEs based on their communication and uses this together with a rule base of allowed state-transition paths to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "54\n", "authors": ["338"]}

Because of that, DTN routing protocols employ a store-carry-and-forward approach, holding messages until a suitable node to forward them is found. But, the selection of the best forwarding node poses a considerable challenge. Additional network information (static or dynamic) can be leveraged to aid routing protocols in this troublesome task. One could use centrality metrics, therefore providing means to differentiate the importance of nodes in the network. Among these metrics, betweenness centrality is one of the most prominent, as it measures the degree to which a vertex is in a position of brokerage by summing up the fraction of shortest paths between other pairs of vertices passing through it.

{"title": "Making hadoop MapReduce byzantine fault-tolerant\n", "abstract": " MapReduce is a programming model and a runtime environment designed by Google for processing large data sets in its warehouse-scale machines (WSM) with hundreds to thousands of servers [2, 4]. MapReduce is becoming increasingly popular with the appearance of many WSMs to provide cloud computing services, and many applications based on this model. This popularity is also shown by the appearance of open-source implementations of the model, like Hadoop that appeared in the Apache project and is now extensively used by Yahoo and many other companies [7]. At scales of thousands of computers and hundreds of other devices like network switches, routers and power units, component failures become frequent, so fault tolerance is central in the design of the original MapReduce as also in Hadoop. The modes of failure tolerated are reasonably benign, like component crashes, and communication or file corruption. Although the availability of services based on these mechanisms is high, there is anecdotal evidence that more pernicious faults do happen and that they can cause service unavailabilities. Examples are the Google App Engine outage of June 17, 2008 and the Amazon S3 availability event of July 20, 2008. This combination of the increasing popularity of MapReduce applications with the possibility of fault modes not tolerated by current mechanisms suggests the need to use fault tolerance mechanisms that cover a wider range of faults.

The solution is implemented through five major components: i) the consortium smart contract, ii) the HEI smart contract, iii) the HEI client, iv) the recruiter app, and v) the consortium app. A prototype of the implementation is tested in a real blockchain (a testnet) and the challenges raised with the experiment are identified and discussed with a main focus on the decentralization mechanism\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["338"]}
{"title": "Justicechain: Using blockchain to protect justice logs\n", "abstract": " The auditability of information systems plays an essential role in public administration. Information system accesses are saved in log files so auditors can later inspect them. However, there are often distinct stakeholders with different roles and different levels of trust, namely the IT Department that manages the system and the government ministries that access the logs for auditing. This scenario happens at the Portuguese judicial system, where stakeholders utilize an information system managed by third-parties. This paper proposes using blockchain technology to make the storage of access logs more resilient while supporting such a multi-stakeholder scenario, in which different entities have different access rights to data. This proposal is implemented in the Portuguese Judicial System through JusticeChain. JusticeChain comprises the blockchain components and blockchain client components.

In web applications, user identification usually involves an authentication process, e.g., providing a username and a password. Identification is also possible without explicit authentication using cookies or device fingerprints.

Recently some interest appeared in the problem of cross-device fingerprinting, i.e., of the identification of the same user in different devices using fingerprinting. We target a variation of the problem that we call related group fingerprinting. We define a related group as a set of persons (e.g., a family) that share the same home network. We devised a related group fingerprinting scheme that we evaluated experimentally with data from hundreds of users.

This paper studies the use of blockchain technology as an enhancer of secure, distributed, and more automatized audits. The proposed solution uses a permissioned, consortium, blockchain to store audit logs. The blockchain is then leveraged to perform distributed and automatic audits over the recorded logs, aiming to reduce costs associated with audits.

Most code running in these processors today was initially written for 32-bit processors. However, when porting software written in C language from one architecture to another that represents numbers with a different number of bits it is easy to introduce bugs and even security vulnerabilities. This abstract shows how these vulnerabilities can be introduced, presents a source code analysis tool that finds such vulnerabilities and summarizes the results of applying the tool to test more than 20 open source applications with a total of more than 4.5 million lines of code. The main problem when porting C programs from 32 to 64-bits CPUs is the following. Programs in C for 32-bit CPUs follow the ILP32 model [4]. In this model, three types have a size of 32 bits: int, long and pointer. This fact is well-known by programmers that abuse it to rather freely exchange data between variables of these three types. When programs with such liberties are ported for 64 bits and no care is taken to deal with the lack of conversion, vulnerabilities can be introduced. For 64-bit CPUs three models are used. In the LP64 model the int type remains with 32 bits but long and pointer are upgraded to 64 bits. This is the model adopted by Unix variants, including Linux, and open source software. In the LLP64 model, int and long remain with 32 bits and the pointer type changes to 64 bits. This model was adopted by Microsoft. In the ILP64 model the three types are upgraded to 64 bits.

Diagnosis is challenging because fast error propagation may occur in high throughput distributed applications. The diagnosis often needs to be probabilistic in nature due to imperfect observability of the payload system, inability to do white-box testing, constraints on the amount of state that can be maintained at the diagnostic process, and imperfect tests used to verify the system. In this paper, we extend an existing Monitor architecture, for probabilistic diagnosis of failures in large-scale network protocols. The Monitor only observes the message exchanges between the protocol entities (PEs) remotely and does not access internal protocol state. At runtime, it builds a causal & aggregate graph between the PEs based on their communication and uses this together with a rule base for diagnosing the failure. The Monitor computes for each suspected PE, a probability for the error having originated in that PE and propagated to the failure detection site. The framework is applied to a test-bed consisting of a reliable multicast protocol executing on the Purdue campus-wide network. Error injection experiments are performed to evaluate the accuracy and the performance overhead of the diagnostic process.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["338"]}

We overcome the limitation by organizing participants in a fat-tree overlay: when the maximum number of connections of a tree node is reached, the new participants connect to the node's children. Our design quickly scales when a large number of participants join in a short amount of time, by relying on a novel scheme that only requires local information to route connection messages: the destination is derived from the hash value of the combined identifiers of the message's source and of the node that is holding the message. The scheme provides deterministic routing of a sequence of connection messages from a single source and probabilistic balancing of newer connections among the leaves. We show that this design puts at least 83% of nodes at the same depth as a deterministic algorithm, can connect a thousand browser windows in 21-55 seconds in a local network, and can be deployed for volunteer computing to tap into 320 cores in less than 30 seconds on a local network to increase the total throughput on the Collatz application by two orders of magnitude compared to a single core.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["338"]}

A blockchain is a data structure\u2013an append-only sequence of blocks\u2013that stores transactions. Moreover, the term also denominates a distributed system that maintains copies of that data structure in a set of nodes. To add new information to a blockchain there is a consensus protocol that ensures that the blocks are appended in the same order in all the nodes. Bitcoin and most blockchains tolerate arbitrary (Byzantine) faults. Ethereum is a blockchain that both provides a cryptocurrency and supports the execution of smart contracts written in a Turing-complete language [2]. Smart contracts are similar to legal contracts but instead of having the terms recorded in a legal language they are coded as a computer program, written in a programming language [3],[2]. The advantages of the usage of smart contracts include low contracting enforcement, compliance costs, and no need for a trusted third party to validate the contract.Building software that works as expected is easier than checking that nobody can use it in a way that is no supposed to. Smart contracts often handle valuable assets. Furthermore, every execution happens in a public network and the source code is often available, so having security in perspective is important while developing smart contracts.

There are often concerns about the strength of the encryption mechanisms used in TLS channels.

Neste artigo \u00e9 apresentado um algoritmo e prot\u00f3tipo de sistema de processamento de grafos distribu\u0131do capaz de lidar com essas faltas, baseado no GPS, uma implementa\u00e7 ao de c\u00f3digo aberto do Pregel.

Transactions commit is a problem much discussed both in theoretical and systems research. This paper presents a modular approach to solve this problem on environments that are subject to Byzantine faults. Our protocol is safe and is built on top of total order broadcast abstraction. On the contrary of previous solutions in the literature, our solution assures strong consistency and does not need centralized control.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["338"]}

{"title": "Asynchronous Byzantine Consensus with 2f+ 1 Processes (extended version)\n", "abstract": " Byzantine consensus in asynchronous message-passing systems has been shown to require at least  processes to be solvable in several system models (e.g., with failure detectors, partial synchrony or randomization). Recently a couple of solutions to implement Byzantine fault-tolerant state-machine replication using only  replicas have appeared. This reduction from  to  is possible with a hybrid system model, i.e., by extending the system model with trusted/trustworthy components that constrain the power of faulty processes to have certain behaviors. Despite these important results, the problem of solving Byzantine consensus with only  processes is still far from being well understood. In this paper we present a methodology to transform crash consensus algorithms into Byzantine consensus algorithms with different characteristics, with the assistance of a reliable broadcast primitive that requires trusted/trustworthy components to be implemented. We exemplify the methodology with two algorithms, one that uses failure detectors and one that is randomized. We also define a new flavor of consensus and use it to solve atomic broadcast with only  processes, showing the practical interest of the consensus algorithms presented.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["338"]}
{"title": "On the effects of finite memory on intrusion-tolerant systems\n", "abstract": " Intrusion tolerance has been proposed as a new paradigm for computer systems security. The idea is to apply the fault tolerance paradigm in the domain of systems security accepting that malicious faults (attacks, intrusions) can never be entirely prevented, and that highly resilient systems have to tolerate these faults. Research in this area has produced a set of clever intrusion-tolerant protocols and systems (I/T protocols and I/T systems for short). However, we believe that an issue has been overlooked: that servers have, finite memory, so the number of messages that can be stored in their buffers is limited. Intuitively, this can be a problem in systems in which there are many messages being exchanged. Moreover, all of these systems assume that the environment is essentially asynchronous, i.e., that there are no bounds on communication and processing delays. Assuming this kind of model is very important in\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["338"]}
