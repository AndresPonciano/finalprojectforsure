{"title": "Determining the influence of the reliability of service quality on customer satisfaction: The case of Libyan E-commerce customers\n", "abstract": " Customer satisfaction is a collective outcome of perception, evaluation, and psychological reaction to the Service quality. Due to the increasing competition of E-commerce business and the high demand of the customers, service quality is the fundamental factor to measure customer\u00a1\u00afs satisfaction within such business.? The primarily purpose of this study is to determine the influence of reliability dimension of E-commerce on Libyan customers satisfaction. Required data was collected through customers\u00a1\u00af survey. For conducting customers\u00a1\u00af survey likert scale based questionnaire was developed after review of literature. However, customers were selected by random sampling method and a sample size of 384 has been taken. The reliability of construct was tested by using Cronbach\u00a1\u00afs alpha test, using SPSS18. Cronbach\u00a1\u00afs alpha coefficients were calculated 0.8 for the questionnaire survey, Because Alpha \u00a1\u00dd 0.7, the reliability of the questionnaire is acceptable. The findings show that there is a very strong relationship between quality of service (Reliability) and customer satisfaction. On the basis of the conclusion made, Reliability E-commerce business was representing the ability of the web site to fulfill orders correctly, deliver promptly, and keep personal information secure. Additionally, E-commerce customers in Libya argued that \u00a1\u00b0reliability dimension\u00a1\u00b1 has a direct positive effect on perceived service quality and their satisfaction on E-commerce business within the country.

{"title": "E-government systems success evaluating under principle islam: A validation of the delone and mclean model of islamic information systems success\n", "abstract": " With the proliferation of the Internet and World Wide Web applications, people are increasingly interacting with government to citizen (G2C) e-government systems. It is, therefore, important to measure the success of G2Ce-government systems from citizens' perspective. While information systems (IS) success models have received much attention among researchers, little research has been conducted to assess the success of e-government systems. Whether traditional IS success models can be extended to investigating e-government systems success needs to be addressed. This study provides the first empirical test of an adaptation of DeLone and McLean's IS success model in the context ofG2C e-government. The model consists of six dimensions: Information Quality, System Quality, Service Quality, Use, User Satisfaction, and Perceived Net Benefit. Structural equation modeling techniques were applied to data\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1263"]}

{"title": "Hybrid search approach for retrieving Medical and Health Science knowledge from Quran\n", "abstract": " Keyword-based technique has low accuracy and always leads to wrong information retrieved. Therefore, many researchers implement semantic search to overcome the above problems. Many researchers have built different Quran ontology in various domains to facilitate the knowledge representation in the Quran. Nevertheless, there are many domain concepts mentioned in the Quran which are not yet covered, especially for the Medical and Health Science domain. Hence, this research presents the development of ontology for the Medical and Health Science domain in the Quran and implementation of ontology-based search method to answer related queries in the Quran. The development of ontology adopts the ontology 101 approach which later evaluated by Quran experts. Furthermore, a hybrid search tool was developed that encompassed semantic-based and keyword based technique to answer a user query. The search tool was evaluated using the Recall and Precision measurements, which shows high accuracy in retrieving the Medical and Health Science knowledge in the Quran. For future work, this research can be used as a reference and basis to answer user queries, data integration with other applications or existing ontology can be further expanded.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1263"]}
{"title": "Multi-class scheduling technique using dual threshold\n", "abstract": " Future network should be able to handle many types of traffic such as video conferencing, audio and data transfer. Each of this traffic has specified Quality of Service (QoS). It is crucial for the switch design to guaranteed QoS for all applications. In this paper, a new ways of handling multi-class traffic is presented. The analysis is done on N \u00d7 N switch with two traffic classes, high priority for delay sensitive cells and low priority for loss sensitive cells. To avoid starvation problem in low priority class, a novel approach have been introduced in the scheduling technique. By applying dual threshold setting, a better control on priority setting for both classes can be achieved. The threshold value is set based on the waiting time and threshold serving probability value. The proposed method has been simulated to show that the starvation problem can be overcome.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1263"]}
{"title": "Enhanced TCPW's fast retransmission and fast recovery mechanism over high bit errors networks\n", "abstract": " In this paper we introduced two enhancement modifications to the well-known TCP Westwood fast retransmission and fast recovery mechanisms. Firstly, a new modification is introduced to fasten the fast retransmission procedure by preventing the TCP sender side from waiting the third duplicate ACKs to retransmit lost packets. Secondly, further modification is presented to achieve better recovery for the congestion window size in the fast recovery phase based on last round trip time and bandwidth estimation. The two modifications are implemented and evaluated using ns-3 simulator. We compared the throughput and congestion window size of the new proposed modifications to TCPW and NewReno. As a result, the proposed algorithm has shown significant improvement over the two implementations.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1263"]}
{"title": "Enhanced TCP Westwood slow start phase\n", "abstract": " Many end-to-end TCP implementations have been presented in the past decade. Despite that they used different methods to improve transport protocols over wireless networks; they mostly shared the same original TCP principles. TCP Westwood introduced a novel end-to-end bandwidth estimation mechanism. Nevertheless, it maintains the same slow start phase presented in TCP Reno. For the initial slow start phase, there is no safe slow start threshold value. In this paper, we propose to use the bandwidth estimation to calculate the initial slow start threshold value after the second round trip time. Furthermore, we introduce a faster state in which TCP increases the transmission rate once the link is underutilizing. As a result, the new proposed method shows better performance comparing to TCP Westwood, and TCP NewReno techniques.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1263"]}
{"title": "Priority Control Scheduling for Downlink and Uplink in WiMAX Network\n", "abstract": " In a WIMAX scheduler, when scheduling scheme needs to be designed for downlink and uplink, the issues of packet delay is paramount. This is even more when considering real time sensitive packets. In this paper, a Priority Control Scheme (PCS) is proposed to provide better QoS for real time delay sensitive packets in uplink and downlink channel. This is done by classifying the service flow priority of the packets into two types, which are time-delay sensitive and non-time delay sensitive. The performance from the proposed PCS is compared with the WIMAX classification service flow priority. The simulation results using OPNET show that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing scheme by having less delay.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1263"]}
{"title": "Risk assessment of mined areas using fuzzy inference\n", "abstract": " During the World War I, II over fifty countries in the world today have been inherited a legacy of antipersonnel landmines and unexploded ordnance (UXO) which represents a major threat to lives, and hinders reconstruction and development efforts. Landmines have specific properties that make it harder to detect. Therefore; these properties lead landmine detectors to become more complex. Many examples can be found to address the increasing complexity of Landmines detection; unfortunately, these new techniques are high of cost and need experts to deal with it. Many developing countries face financial difficulties to get advanced technologies for detection landmines such as Robotic systems, this due to their high cost, use and maintenance difficulties which makes them unaffordable to these countries. The safety of operators, transportability, ease of maintenance and operation are the most factors that must take into consideration to improve the applicability and effectiveness of landmines tracking systems. The aim of the study is to proposed architecture of Intelligent Wireless Landmines Tracking System (IWLTS) with new decision model based on fuzzy logic. To find an affordable, light and easy to use alternative which meet users\u2019 needs to protect and warn them from the risk of landmines during practice their lives, we suggested the design and development of Fuzzy Inference Model for IWLTS using Smart Phone. Fuzzy model require three step which are definitions of Linguistic Variable and fuzzy sets, determine fuzzy rules and the process of Fuzzy Inference.

{"title": "Enhanced TCP Westwood Congestion Control Mechanism over Wireless Networks\n", "abstract": " The poor performance of TCP over wireless networks is a well study issue. Intensive optimizations to the TCP congestion control mechanisms have been proposed in the past few years. TCPW presents a novel solution to enhance the performance of the TCP congestion control over wired and wireless networks. TCPW proposed a new mechanism to estimate the network bandwidth to properly calculate both the congestion window and the slow start threshold whenever congestion is observed. Nevertheless, TCPW still behave like traditional TCP variants whenever a packet is dropped. Once a packet\u2019s timeout is expired, TCPW starts a hard congestion avoidance procedure. In this paper, a new modification to the TCPW congestion control mechanism is presented. In this method, we have changed the TCPW response whenever a packet is dropped. We tried to prevent it from unnecessary resting the congestion window unless real congestion is shaped. The new presented method is validated through ns-3 simulator. As a result, significant improvement has been shown using the new modification scheme comparing to the traditional TCPW.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1263"]}
