{"title": "On retransmission-based error control for continuous media traffic in packet-switching networks\n", "abstract": " Distribution of continuous media traffic such as digital audio and video over packet-switching networks has become increasingly feasible due to a number of technology trends leading to powerful desktop computers and high-speed integrated services networks. Protocols supporting the transmission of continuous media are already available. In these protocols, transmission errors due to packet loss are generally not recovered. Instead existing protocol designs focus on preventive error control techniques that reduce the impact of losses by adding redundancy, e.g., forward error correction, or by preventing loss of important data, e.g., channel coding. The goal of this study is to show that retransmission of continuous media data often is, contrary to conventional wisdom, a viable option in most packet-switching networks. If timely retransmission can be performed with a high probability of success, a retrasmission-based\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "160\n", "authors": ["869"]}

{"title": "A quantitative profile of a community of open source Linux developers\n", "abstract": " Open source software, or free software, has generated much interest and debate in the wake of a number of high-impact applications and systems produced under open source models for development and distribution. Despite the high degree of interest, little hard data exists to-date on the membership of collaborative open source communities and the evolutionary process of their repositories. This paper contributes a baseline quantitative study of one of the oldest continuous repositories for the Linux open source project (the UNC MetaLab Linux Archives), including demographic information on its broad community of developers. Our methodology is a close examination of collection statistics, including custom monitoring scripts on the server, as well as an analysis of the contents of user-generated metadata embedded within the Archives. User-generated metadata files in a format known as the Linux Software Map (LSM) are required when submitting open source software for inclusion in non-mirrored portions of the MetaLab Linux Archives. The over 4500 LSMs in the Archives then provide a demographic profile of contributors of LSM-accompanied software as well as other information on this broad subset of the Linux community. To explore repository evolution directly, an instrumented Linux Archives mirror was developed, and aggregate statistics on content changes seen over a month-long period are reported. In sum, our results quantify aspects of the global Linux development effort in dimensions that have not been documented before now, as well as providing a guide for more detailed future studies.", "num_citations": "104\n", "authors": ["869"]}

Our approach is to develop a novel retransmission protocol framework, MESH, that protects delay-sensitive multicast data streams against most network errors and delay variations.

Novel features of our protocol include an explicit model for delay-sensitive retransmission, run-time evaluation at an active receiver to determine its retransmission partner, and the ability to handle multiple multicast data sources without building a per-source control framework.

This approach, called Slack automatic repeat request (ARQ) (S-ARQ), proposes an extension of the control time mechanism for jitter control in order to provide error recovery through retransmissions in the case of packet losses in the network. While existing packet voice protocols do not use retransmission schemes, the authors' simulation studies indicate that extended control time can provide significant error coverage while remaining within the same order of magnitude as the control time required for jitter control.

We implement a prototype of this service as a lightweight implementation enhancement to an existing protocol, the Xpress Transfer Protocol.

{"title": "Destination buffering for low-bandwidth audio transmissions using redundancy-based error control\n", "abstract": " Digital audio is becoming increasingly prevalent with the advent of software for Internet telephony and real-time audio playback for World Wide Web browsers. Since audio quality depends on timely delivery of the packet stream, protocol mechanisms must address the control of delays and packet losses in an integrated fashion. Two critical mechanisms for high-quality audio delivery are the receiver buffering strategy and error control. Buffering at the audio receiver is required for continuous playback in the presence of network delay variations (jitter), and a number of algorithms have been proposed. Timely recovery of packet loss protects audio quality against network errors. Recent work has suggested the effectiveness of an approach that sends multiple copies of the audio data in consecutive packets so that small burst losses in the network are overcome.

{"title": "Distributed Error Recovery for Continuous Media Data in Wide-Area Multicast\n", "abstract": " This paper proposes new mechanisms to improve the quality of wide-area disseminations of time-sensitive streams, such as packet voice and video, from a single source to multiple receivers. Most current packet-switched networks provide no end-to-end quality-of-service guarantees for packet delay or loss, which can reduce the playback quality at receivers. Bu ering at the multicast receivers can be used to minimize the playback degradation due to network delay variations. Addressing packet losses is more problematic. Solutions are constrained by the long latencies that may exist between the source and some of its receivers, the danger of simultaneous messages from a large number of receivers overwhelming network and endsystem resources (multicast implosion), and the limited bandwidth available on most wide-area links. Adapting the transmission rate of the multicast source to the available network bandwidth prevents excessive packet loss and protects the network from severe congestion due to any single source. However, rate control does not recover packet losses. To recover packets dropped by the network, the transmission of redundant information in the data stream (forward error correction) has been shown e ective, but redundancy may consume signi cant network bandwidth and is ine cient when receivers have heterogeneous error rates. In this paper we develop and evaluate a novel retransmission-based error recovery strategy. Unlike previous reliable multicast protocols, our protocol relies on retransmissions from one receiver to another, thus avoiding the limitations of long latencies and multicast implosion inherent to source\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["869"]}

This paper presents a project that will provide and extend library services through the development of a sharium-a workspace with rich content and powerful tools where people can collaborate with others or work independently to explore information resources, learn, and solve their information problems. A sharium is a learning environment that combines the features of a collaboratory, where people collectively engage in research by sharing rich information resources, and a local library, where people come to meet, find information resources, and discuss common interests. To achieve this, collaboration services that build on synchronous and asynchronous communication technology should be integrated with other digital library services, including searching, browsing, and information management and authoring services.

XTP multicast gives the application flexibility in determining the robustness of the communication while insulating the application from managing multipoint delivery.

The key questions surround the construction of a portable, scalable software infrastructure that will support replicated content channels in a highly heterogeneous network. This software infrastructure and its associated content model must be developed in the context of I2-DSI's two main architectural concepts: replication of servers to provide identical services and transparent resolution of client requests to the most proximate replica. We set the stage for our discussion of portable content channels by presented a unified account of replication and resolution in Internet information systems that encompasses caching and replicated servers. Against this background we present the issues of content portability raised by trying to replicate servers in heterogeneous environments, describe a deliberately limited strategy that will allow us to deploy some initial channels quickly, and discuss the requirements that more robust models must meet to achieve a solid, longterm solution for I2-DSI.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["869"]}

This manual describes the services provided by each Ada package in terms of the data types and subprograms defined therein. Portions of this report were prepared while one of the authors (Jeff Michel) was in residence at the Software Engineering Institute in July 1992.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["869"]}
{"title": "Improving the Availability of Internet2 Applications and Services\n", "abstract": " We describe the methods of content replication and service resolution location that we plan to use for the Internet2 Distributed Storage Infrastructure (I2-DSI) project. The resolution service will take into account a variety of factors, so that its choice improves the global welfare of the applications. If the resolution is done poorly, applications will not be able to take full advantage of the I2-DSI resources and will likely underperform. We propose combining two resolution technologies to address this problem: SonarDNS and Narwhal. SonarDNS measures and orders resources based on a variety of criteria, and exports its recommendations via DNS. Narwhal provides an application-transparent proxy that can configure, monitor, manage and provide additional functionality to network applications. We intend to deploy extremely lean servers on the periphery \u201cramp\u201d of I2 that integrate the functionality of both components. Such co-location provides a focal point for administrative control, traffic monitoring, implementation of differentiated services, and enforcement of traffic policies. Content will be replicated using Rsync+, an efficient technique that leverages an existing differential file update algorithm and enables the use of multicast transport solutions for performance and scalability.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["869"]}
{"title": "Issues in designing transport layer multicast facilities\n", "abstract": " Multicasting denotes a facility in a communications system for providing efficient delivery from a message's source to some well-defined set of locations using a single logical address. While modem network hardware supports multidestination delivery, first generation Transport Layer protocols(eg the DoD Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)[15] and ISO TP-4 [41]) did not anticipate the changes over the past decade in underlying network hardware, transmission speeds, and communication patterns that have enabled and driven the interest in reliable multicast. Much recent research has focused on integrating the underlying hardware multicast capability with the reliable services of Transport Layer protocols. In this paper we explore the communication issues surrounding the design of such a reliable multicast mechanism. Approaches and solutions from the literature are discussed, and four experimental Transport Layer protocols that incorporate reliable multicast are examined.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["869"]}
