{"title": "Operational semantics of goal models in adaptive agents\n", "abstract": " Several agent-oriented software engineering methodologies address the emerging challenges posed by the increasing need of adaptive software. A common denominator of such methodologies is the paramount importance of the concept of goal model in order to understand the requirements of a software system. Goal models consist of goal graphs representing AND/OR-decomposition of abstract goals down to operationalisable leaf-level goals. Goal models are used primarily in the earlier phases of software engineering, for social modelling, requirements elicitation and analysis, to concretise abstract objectives, to detail them and to capture alternatives for their satisfaction. Although various agent programming languages incorporate the notion of (leaf-level) goal as a language construct, none of them natively support the definition of goal models. However, the semantic gap between goal models used at design-time and the concept of goal used at implementation and execution time represent a limitation especially in the development of self-adaptive and fault-tolerant systems. In such systems, design-time knowledge on goals and variability becomes relevant at run-time, to take autonomous decisions for achieving high level objectives correctly. Recently, unifying operational semantics for (leaf) goals have been proposed [15]. We extend this work to define an operational semantics for the behaviour of goals in goal models, maintaining the flexibility of using different goal types and conditions. We use a simple example to illustrate how the proposed approach effectively deals with the semantic gap between design-time goal models and run-time\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "41\n", "authors": ["1460"]}

In this position paper, we describe a methodology to integrate i* variants through the ontological representation of the i* metamodel, and a mechanism to support the understanding of models expressed in those variants. As example of application, we present the integration of i*, Tropos and Service-oriented i* by using ontologies and a tool to automatically transform models expressed with those variants in terms of that ontology", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["1460"]}

To help fill in this gap, we describe some results of our work on an integrated agent-oriented methodology to develop KM system, using a KM typical scenario. We consider all humans, organizations and existing systems as agents. The model enables the designer to understand and describe relations between entities before development of the system.

The work was performed in frame of the national R&D MICA project under the umbrella of the ENEA\u2019s long term strategic MINDES Program synchronized with indications of the worldwide GEMINI (Global Emergency Management Information Network Initiative) of the G7 Committee. IDA is an approach to the design of intelligent-agent based kernel of IDSS. In frame of the generic TOGA (Top-down Object-based Goal-oriented Approach) model of abstract intelligent agent, IPK (Information Preferences Knowledge) architecture is employed. The IDA objectives were to develop and verify the properties of information managed agent and knowledge managed agent, where the last should suggest an action or plan after every new significant event in the emergency domain. The IDA functional kernel is composed with three simple agents:-DirectAdvisor, it interacts with human user and emergency domain,-InfoProvider, it manages of information and intervention goals, and-IDAPlanner, it plans adequate interventions. For the design, UML (Unified Modeling Language) has been employed. MDP (Markov Decision Process) and CBR (Case Base Reasoning) are used for plans construction. Owing to a generic agent model and object-based conceptualization, the IDA system should be adaptable to the different roles of emergency managers.

Its main feature is the expressibility to represent intentional social relations among stakeholders. In i* models, each modeling component is described explicitly through text labels. However, the process of labeling model elements is usually an activity which is not rigorous and not well documented for designers. Performing the labeling with freedom and subjectivity often results in unclear labels that are not helpful for interoperability and the understanding of the model semantics. In this paper, we deal with this problems by extending i* models with ontologies. Taking advantage of an ontological definition of concepts and well-defined relationships, we improve the unambiguous interpretation of labels and thus interoperability, reuse and machine-readability of a model. A guided process and tool support for the integration of i* models with an ontology are described in this paper.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1460"]}

The novelty of the proposed approach is mainly due to the use of advanced techniques for lazy learning, the application of the case-based paradigm to the planning of the first fire attack and the integration of the case-based reasoner with a constraint solver, mainly in charge of temporal reasoning", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1460"]}

{"title": "Mobile technologies to enable users' informed decisions\n", "abstract": " The significant wide impact of mobile technologies (e.g., smartphones, tablets) and the difficulty of mastering their complexity (due to factors like constant emergence and evolution) pose new challenges to many (if not all) software engineering disciplines. We particularly see these challenges when thinking of average citizens that carry out their daily activities in smart environments where mobile technologies and sensors installed provide many potential advantages to support them. Applications that could enable informed decision-making are currently beyond what software developers can provide. This position paper discusses challenges, and highlights current approaches available in order to support decision-making for thoughtful living. We present an initial version of a comprehensive framework to overcome the challenges identified and analyse which software engineering research lines may help to implement it. A motivating scenario is used to conduct the discussion.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1460"]}
{"title": "Towards Supporting Business Services Discovery Through the Integration of Organizational Models with Ontologies.\n", "abstract": " We argue that the integration of organizational models with ontologies is useful to discover business services because we consider that a domain concept that integrated different elements of the model could represent new business services to the organization. These additional services could improve the performance of an enterprise and detect new opportunity areas. Moreover, a model annotated with domain concepts improves the analysis process because included additional information can facilitate a semi-automated reasoning among elements. This paper presents an approach to integrate visual models of an organization with a general or specific domain ontology and proposes semantic annotation suggestions. A software tool is presented to implement the integration process, and an illustrative example validates the effectiveness of our approach.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1460"]}
{"title": "A tool-supported development process for adaptive systems\n", "abstract": " Adaptive systems are envisaged as a candidate solution to address today\u2019s software complexity. They are able to cope with the dynamism of their environment and with changes in their users\u2019 needs and preferences. In this work we focus on the development of such systems and present a tool-supported process that covers the whole software lifecycle from requirements time to implementation, complemented by a continuous testing paradigm. The proposed process combines goal-oriented software engineering with an automated mapping to goal-driven agents and an automated continuous testing framework. Goal models are preserved along the development process from design to run-time, providing an effective traceability for design revisions; and once an executable of the system under development is available, automated testing will exercise it and give feedback to the developer, not only about bugs to be fixed, but also about needed extensions of requirements, design and code artifacts to accommodate improvement of the system adaptivity properties. Along the realization of an example case study, preliminary evidence about the improvement of adaptive systems and the effectiveness of the process is studied.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1460"]}
