{"title": "Pinpointing ambiguity and incompleteness in requirements engineering via information visualization and NLP\n", "abstract": " [Context and motivation] Identifying requirements defects such as ambiguity and incompleteness is an important and challenging task in requirements engineering (RE). [Question/Problem] We investigate whether combining humans\u2019 cognitive and analytical capabilities with automated reasoning is a viable method to support the identification of requirements quality defects. [Principal ideas/results] We propose a tool-supported approach for pinpointing terminological ambiguities between viewpoints as well as missing requirements. To do so, we blend natural language processing (conceptual model extraction and semantic similarity) with information visualization techniques that help interpret the type of defect. [Contribution] Our approach is a step forward toward the identification of ambiguity and incompleteness in a set of requirements, still an open issue in RE.

{"title": "On the software ecosystem health of open source content management systems\n", "abstract": " Choosing a content management system on which you rely your business is challenging because they need a healthy software ecosystem in order to function efficaciously. Unawareness of this will result in content managers having uncertainty about the future suitability of their chosen content management system. This study describes an empirical, inductive approach by comparing the software ecosystem health of the three most popular open source Content Management System platforms (WordPress, Joomla and Drupal) according to a number of health characteristics. Taking the software ecosystem health of a desired content management system into account enables stakeholders to make a more grounded decision in choosing either of the Content Management Systems. This could lead to a more suitable, dynamic and/or sustainable solution.", "num_citations": "28\n", "authors": ["1538"]}
{"title": "Toward tool mashups: Comparing and combining NLP RE tools\n", "abstract": " Over 50 papers present natural language processing tools for improving the quality of requirements. However, few of these are adopted by industry. Even worse, most of them are no longer publicly available or supported by their creators. The few available and actively maintained tools exhibit some outstanding features, but also include sub-optimal functionalities. In this paper, we compare the performance of 3 existing tools on how well they automatically detect ambiguity and atomicity defects and deviations in 4 real-world natural language requirements sets. Next, we show how to design a superior tool by combining the best performing approaches of these three. Finally, we introduce a research roadmap toward automatically generating NLP RE tool mashups through the assembly of modular components taken from existing tools.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1538"]}
