Lack of infrastructure and trained, experienced staff are considered important barriers to scaling up treatment for these diseases. In this paper we explain why information systems are important in many healthcare projects in the developing world. We discuss pilot projects demonstrating that such systems are possible and can expand to manage hundreds of thousands of patients. We also pass on the most important practical lessons in design and implementation from our experience in doing this work. Finally, we discuss the importance of collaboration between projects in the development of electronic medical record systems rather than reinventing systems in isolation, and the use of open standards and open source software.", "num_citations": "395\n", "authors": ["851"]}

Early treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and ACE inhibition may prevent the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), but studies evaluating the epidemiology of proteinuria and early CKD in HIV-infected patients are lacking. METHODS: All consecutive patients at Wishard Memorial Hospital (Indiana University) whose initial HIV documentation occurred from 1990 to 1998, were retrospectively studied using a computerized medical record system. Clinical data were abstracted from time of first HIV documentation through 12/31/2000. The proportions of patients who developed CKD (doubling of serum creatinine from an initial level< or= 1.5 mg/dl) and who had proteinuria (> or= 1+ protein on the first urine dipstick after HIV documentation) were calculated. Case mix and laboratory variables at the time of HIV documentation were compared between those who did and did not develop CKD and between those who had and did not have initial proteinuria. RESULTS: Of 487 subjects with initially normal renal function, 10 (2%(95% CI, 1-4%)) developed CKD. In univariable analysis, black race, a diagnosis of diabetes or hypertension and proteinuria were all significantly associated with the development of CKD; 89 (29%(95% CI, 24-35%)) of 289 evaluable subjects had> or= 1+ proteinuria on urine analysis.

One aspect of this is the development and deployment of electronic medical record systems to support HIV and TB treatment. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of a new medical record architecture to support an HIV treatment program in rural Rwanda. The architecture is called OpenMRS and it has been developed to address the problem of configuring EMR systems to suit new sites, languages and diseases. OpenMRS uses a data dictionary called the concept dictionary to represent all the possible data items that can be collected. This allows new items to be added to the system by non-programmers. In addition, there are form creation tools that use drag and drop web technologies to simplify form construction.The OpenMRS system was first implemented in Kenya in February 2006 and then in Rwanda in August 2006. The system is now functioning well and we are developing extensions to improve the support for the clinic. These include improved, easy to use reporting tools, support for additional clinical problems including nutrition and child health, better database synchronization tools, and modules to collect laboratory data and support the pharmacy.

{"title": "Towards standardized patient data exchange: integrating a FHIR based API for the open medical record system\n", "abstract": " Interoperability is essential to address limitations caused by the ad hoc implementation of clinical information systems and the distributed nature of modern medical care. The HL7 V2 and V3 standards have played a significant role in ensuring interoperability for healthcare. FHIR is a next generation standard created to address fundamental limitations in HL7 V2 and V3. FHIR is particularly relevant to OpenMRS, an Open Source Medical Record System widely used across emerging economies. FHIR has the potential to allow OpenMRS to move away from a bespoke, application specific API to a standards based API. We describe efforts to design and implement a FHIR based API for the OpenMRS platform. Lessons learned from this effort were used to define long term plans to transition from the legacy OpenMRS API to a FHIR based API that greatly reduces the learning curve for developers and helps enhance adhernce to standards.", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["851"]}

{"title": "Experience in Implementing the OpenMRS Medical Record System to Support\n", "abstract": " The challenge of scaling up HIV treatment in Africa has led to a new emphasis on improving health systems in impoverished areas. One aspect of this is the development and deployment of electronic medical record systems to support HIV and TB treatment. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of a new medical record architecture to support an HIV treatment program in rural Rwanda. The architecture is called OpenMRS and it has been developed to address the problem of configuring EMR systems to suit new sites, languages and diseases. OpenMRS uses a data dictionary called the concept dictionary to represent all the possible data items that can be collected. This allows new items to be added to the system by non-programmers. In addition, there are form creation tools that use drag and drop web technologies to simplify form construction.The OpenMRS system was first implemented in Kenya in February 2006 and then in Rwanda in August 2006. The system is now functioning well and we are developing extensions to improve the support for the clinic. These include improved, easy to use reporting tools, support for additional clinical problems including nutrition and child health, better database synchronization tools, and modules to collect laboratory data and support the pharmacy. The system is also in use in South Africa and Lesotho and is being deployed in Tanzania and Uganda.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["851"]}
