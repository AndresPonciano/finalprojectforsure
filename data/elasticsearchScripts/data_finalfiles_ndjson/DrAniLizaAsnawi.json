We investigate factors that can bring about the adoption or rejection of agile methods in Malaysia. As part of this research our initial work involved the identification of the current levels of usage and perception of the methodology in the country. A pilot study using a questionnaire was conducted in two languages, English and Malay. Our initial results indicate that of the 79 respondents more than 50% do not have an awareness of agile methods. Despite their unawareness, most of the respondents believe in agile values. The awareness of agile methods is also found to have a significant association with the language respondents used and two aspects of organisational structure asked from the questionnaire. This finding provides a promising environment for the application of agile methods in the country. It was also identified that respondents perceived both aspects (social and technical) to be equally important in delivering the benefits of agile methods.

{"title": "Web based Water Turbidity Monitoring and Automated Filtration System: IoT Application in Water Management.\n", "abstract": " Water supplied to residential areas is prone to contaminants due to pipe residues and silt, and therefore resulted in cloudiness, unfavorable taste, and odor in water. Turbidity, a measure of water cloudiness, is one of the important factors for assessing water quality. This paper proposes a low-cost turbidity system based on a light detection unit to measure the cloudiness in water. The automated system uses Intel Galileo 2 as the microprocessor and a server for a web-based monitoring system. The turbidity detection unit consists of a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) and a Light Emitting Diode (LED) inside a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe. Turbidity readings were recorded for two different positionings; 90 and 180 between the detector (LDR) and the incident light (LED). Once the turbidity level reached a threshold level, the system will trigger the filtration process to clean the water. The voltage output captured from the designed system versus total suspended solid (TSS) in sample water is graphed and analyzed in two different conditions; in total darkness and in the present of ambient light. This paper also discusses and compares the results from the above-mentioned conditions when the system is submerged in still and flowing water. It was found that the trends of the plotted graph decline when the total suspended solid increased for both 90 and 180 detector turbidimeter in all conditions which imitate the trends of a commercial turbidimeter. By taking the consideration of the above findings, the design can be recommended for a low-cost real-time web-based monitoring system of the water quality in an IOT environment.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["393"]}

The mm-Wave MIMO technology for wireless communication system is the base potential technology for its high data transfer rate followed by data instruction and low power consumption compared to Long-Term Evolution (LTE). The mm-Wave system is already available in indoor hotspot and Wi-Fi backhaul for its high bandwidth availability and potential lead to rate of numerous Gbps/user. But, in mobile wireless communication system this technique is lagging because the channel faces relative orthogonal coordination and multiple node detection problems while rapid movement of nodes (transmitter and receiver) occur. To improve the conventional mm-wave MIMO nodal detection and coordination performance, the system processes data using symbolized error vector technique for linearization. Then the MMSE precoding detection technique improves the link strength by constantly fitting the channel coefficients based on number of independent service antennas (M), Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), Channel Matrix (CM) and mean square errors (MSE). To maintain sequentially encoded user data connectivity and to overcome data loss, SIC method is used in combination with MMSE.
