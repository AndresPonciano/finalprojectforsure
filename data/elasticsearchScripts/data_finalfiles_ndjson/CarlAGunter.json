{"title": "Semantics of programming languages: structures and techniques\n", "abstract": " Semantics of Programming Languages exposes the basic motivations and philosophy underlying the applications of semantic techniques in computer science. It introduces the mathematical theory of programming languages with an emphasis on higher-order functions and type systems. Designed as a text for upper-level and graduate-level students, the mathematically sophisticated approach will also prove useful to professionals who want an easily referenced description of fundamental results and calculi. Basic connections between computational behavior, denotational semantics, and the equational logic of functional programs are thoroughly and rigorously developed. Topics covered include models of types, operational semantics, category theory, domain theory, fixed point (denotational). semantics, full abstraction and other semantic correspondence criteria, types and evaluation, type checking and inference, parametric polymorphism, and subtyping. All topics are treated clearly and in depth, with complete proofs for the major results and numerous exercises.", "num_citations": "1023\n", "authors": ["1593"]}
{"title": "The SwitchWare active network architecture\n", "abstract": " Active networks must balance the flexibility of a programmable network infrastructure against the safety and security requirements inherent in sharing that infrastructure. Furthermore, this balance must be achieved while maintaining the usability of the network. The SwitchWare active network architecture is a novel approach to achieving this balance using three layers: active packets, which contain mobile programs that replace traditional packets; active extensions, which provide services on the network elements and can be dynamically loaded; and a secure active router infrastructure, which forms a high-integrity base on which the security of the other layers depends. In addition to integrity checking and cryptography-based authentication, security in our architecture depends heavily on verification techniques from programming languages, such as strong type checking.", "num_citations": "520\n", "authors": ["1593"]}
{"title": "PLAN: A packet language for active networks\n", "abstract": " PLAN (Packet Language for Active Networks) is a new language for programs that form the packets of a programmable network. These programs replace the packet headers (which can be viewed as very rudimentary programs) used in current networks. As such, PLAN programs are lightweight and of restricted functionality. These limitations are mitigated by allowing PLAN code to call node-resident service routines written in other, more powerful languages. This two-level architecture, in which PLAN serves as a scripting or 'glue' language for more general services, is the primary contribution of this paper. We have successfully applied the PLAN programming environment to implement an IP-free internetwork.PLAN is based on the simply typed lambda calculus and provides a restricted set of primitives and datatypes. PLAN defines a special construct called a chunk used to describe the remote execution of PLAN\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "459\n", "authors": ["1593"]}

It describes a simple class of ordered structures and discusses the idea of fixed points of continuous functions as meanings for recursive programs. The chapter discusses spaces having certain kinds of limits in which a useful fixed point existence theorem holds and describes how the theory of domains can be used in semantic specification. It also describes some of the operators and functions that are used in semantic definitions. The chapter describes a special collection of such operators, which are called power domains. It also discusses the issue of obtaining fixed points for certain operators on domains.", "num_citations": "426\n", "authors": ["1593"]}

{"title": "Dynamic Searchable Encryption via Blind Storage.\n", "abstract": " Dynamic Searchable Symmetric Encryption allows a client to store a dynamic collection of encrypted documents with a server, and later quickly carry out keyword searches on these encrypted documents, while revealing minimal information to the server. In this paper we present a new dynamic SSE scheme that is simpler and more efficient than existing schemes while revealing less information to the server than prior schemes, achieving fully adaptive security against honest-but-curious servers. We implemented a prototype of our scheme and demonstrated its efficiency on datasets from prior work. Apart from its concrete efficiency, our scheme is also simpler: in particular, it does not require the server to support any operation other than upload and download of data. Thus the server in our scheme can be based solely on a cloud storage service, rather than a cloud computation service as well, as in prior work.

{"title": "Leaky cauldron on the dark land: Understanding memory side-channel hazards in SGX\n", "abstract": " Side-channel risks of Intel SGX have recently attracted great attention. Under the spotlight is the newly discovered page-fault attack, in which an OS-level adversary induces page faults to observe the page-level access patterns of a protected process running in an SGX enclave. With almost all proposed defense focusing on this attack, little is known about whether such efforts indeed raise the bar for the adversary, whether a simple variation of the attack renders all protection ineffective, not to mention an in-depth understanding of other attack surfaces in the SGX system. In the paper, we report the first step toward systematic analyses of side-channel threats that SGX faces, focusing on the risks associated with its memory management. Our research identifies 8 potential attack vectors, ranging from TLB to DRAM modules. More importantly, we highlight the common misunderstandings about SGX memory side\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "268\n", "authors": ["1593"]}
{"title": "What's in Your Dongle and Bank Account? Mandatory and Discretionary Protection of Android External Resources.\n", "abstract": " The pervasiveness of security-critical external resources (eg accessories, online services) poses new challenges to Android security. In prior research we revealed that given the BLUETOOTH and BLUETOOTH_ADMIN permissions, a malicious app on an authorized phone gains unfettered access to any Bluetooth device (eg, Blood Glucose meter, etc.). Here we further show that sensitive text messages from online banking services and social networks (account balance, password reset links, etc.) are completely exposed to any app with either the RECEIVE_SMS or the READ_SMS permission. Similar security risks are present in other channels (Internet, Audio and NFC) extensively used to connect the phone to assorted external devices or services. Fundamentally, the current permission-based Discretionary Access Control (DAC) and SEAndroid-based Mandatory Access Control (MAC) are too coarse-grained to protect those resources: whoever gets the permission to use a channel is automatically allowed to access all resources attached to it.To address this challenge, we present in this paper SEACAT, a new security system for fine-grained, flexible protection on external resources. SEACAT supports both MAC and DAC, and integrates their enforcement mechanisms across the Android middleware and the Linux kernel. It extends SEAndroid for specifying policies on external resources, and also hosts a DAC policy base. Both sets of policies are managed under the same policy engine and Access Vector Cache that support policy checks within the security hooks distributed across the framework and the Linux kernel layers, over different\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "239\n", "authors": ["1593"]}

The collection and analysis of such data has the potential to support various applications, including personalized medical services. While the benefits of the genomics revolution are trumpeted by the biomedical community, the increased availability of such data has major implications for personal privacy; notably because the genome has certain essential features, which include (but are not limited to) (i) an association with traits and certain diseases, (ii) identification capability (e.g., forensics), and (iii) revelation of family relationships. Moreover, direct-to-consumer DNA testing increases the likelihood that genome data will be made available in less regulated environments, such as the Internet and for-profit companies.

{"title": "Identity, location, disease and more: Inferring your secrets from Android public resources\n", "abstract": " The design of Android is based on a set of unprotected shared resources, including those inherited from Linux (eg, Linux public directories). However, the dramatic development in Android applications (app for short) makes available a large amount of public background information (eg, social networks, public online services), which can potentially turn such originally harmless resource sharing into serious privacy breaches. In this paper, we report our work on this important yet understudied problem. We discovered three unexpected channels of information leaks on Android: per-app data-usage statistics, ARP information, and speaker status (on or off). By monitoring these channels, an app without any permission may acquire sensitive information such as smartphone user's identity, the disease condition she is interested in, her geo-locations and her driving route, from top-of-the-line Android apps.

Currently, PLANet routers run as byte-code-interpreted Linux user-space applications, and support Ethernet and IP as link layers.

{"title": "Property inference attacks on fully connected neural networks using permutation invariant representations\n", "abstract": " With the growing adoption of machine learning, sharing of learned models is becoming popular. However, in addition to the prediction properties the model producer aims to share, there is also a risk that the model consumer can infer other properties of the training data the model producer did not intend to share. In this paper, we focus on the inference of global properties of the training data, such as the environment in which the data was produced, or the fraction of the data that comes from a certain class, as applied to white-box Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNNs). Because of their complexity and inscrutability, FCNNs have a particularly high risk of leaking unexpected information about their training sets; at the same time, this complexity makes extracting this information challenging.

{"title": "Fear and logging in the internet of things\n", "abstract": " As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to proliferate, diagnosing incorrect behavior within increasinglyautomated homes becomes considerably more difficult. Devices and apps may be chained together in long sequences of triggeraction rules to the point that from an observable symptom (eg, an unlocked door) it may be impossible to identify the distantly removed root cause (eg, a malicious app). This is because, at present, IoT audit logs are siloed on individual devices, and hence cannot be used to reconstruct the causal relationships of complex workflows. In this work, we present ProvThings, a platform-centric approach to centralized auditing in the Internet of Things. ProvThings performs efficient automated instrumentation of IoT apps and device APIs in order to generate data provenance that provides a holistic explanation of system activities, including malicious behaviors. We prototype ProvThings for the Samsung SmartThings platform, and benchmark the efficacy of our approach against a corpus of 26 IoT attacks. Through the introduction of a selective code instrumentation optimization, we demonstrate in evaluation that ProvThings imposes just 5% overhead on physical IoT devices while enabling real time querying of system behaviors, and further consider how ProvThings can be leveraged to meet the needs of a variety of stakeholders in the IoT ecosystem.", "num_citations": "144\n", "authors": ["1593"]}
