Another way to assess it is by investigating the role played by legitimate users of systems in impairing the level of protection. In order to address this issue, we wish to adopt a multidisciplinary standpoint and investigate some of the human aspects involved in computer security. From research in psychology, it is known that people make biased decisions. They sometimes overlook rules in order to gain maximum benefits for the cost of a given action. This situation leads to insidious security lapses whereby the level of protection is traded-off against usability. In this paper, we highlight the cognitive processes underlying such security impairments.

{"title": "A UML tool for an automatic generation of simulation programs\n", "abstract": " For sometime now, Unified Modelling Language (UML) has been accepted as a standard for designing new systems. Its array of notations helps system designers to capture their ideas in a way that is expressive yet easy to understand. One thing that UML lacks though, is a means for predicting the system\u2019s performance directly from its design. Performance prediction is a desirable feature that enables us to evaluate whether a particular design is worth implementing or not. This prediction can frequently be obtained by constructing a simulation program that mimics the characteristics of the new system. The information gathered from running the simulation will then allow us to estimate the performance.

{"title": "Automatic generation of distributed system simulations from UML\n", "abstract": " Nowadays, an object-oriented approach is commonly used for building computer systems. The benefits of the object-oriented method, such as scalability, stability and reusability, make this method suitable for building complex systems, including those in the distributed system area. A distributed system application usually needs to satisfy quite stringent requirements such as reliability, availability, security, etc. and the cost of building such an application will be quite high. It is therefore desirable to be able to predict the performance of the proposed system before the construction begins. In order to do this, it is important to evaluate the requirements of the new system and translate them into a specification (design). The design process helps the system developers to understand the requirements better as well as to avoid misconceptions about the system. From the specification, a simulation program can be built to mimic the execution of the proposed system. The simulation run provides some data about the states of the system and from these data, the performance of the system can be predicted and analysed. UML (Unified Modeling Language) is one example of the object-oriented design methods that has been widely used for specifying system requirements. There are also some object-oriented simulation languages/packages available, for example, SIMULA or C++SIM package, but it is often difficult to transform the system\u2019 s requirements into a simulation program without sound knowledge of some simulation techniques.

{"title": "Detecting Insider Threats Using Ben-ware: Beneficial Intelligent Software for Identifying Anomalous Human Behaviour\n", "abstract": " The insider threat problem is a significant and ever present issue faced by any organisation. While security mechanisms can be put in place to reduce the chances of external agents gaining access to a system, either to steal assets or alter records, the issue is more complex in tackling insider threat. If an employee already has legitimate access rights to a system, it is much more difficult to prevent them from carrying out inappropriate acts, as it is hard to determine whether the acts are part of their official work or indeed malicious. We present in this paper the concept of \u201cBen-ware\u201d: a beneficial software system that uses low-level data collection from employees\u2019 computers, along with Artifi- cial Intelligence, to identify anomalous behaviour of an employee. By comparing each employee\u2019s activities against their own \u2018normal\u2019 profile, as well as against the organisational\u2019s norm, we can detect those that are significantly divergent, which might indicate malicious activities. Dealing with false positives is one of the main challenges here. Anomalous behaviour could indicate malicious activities (such as an employee trying to steal confidential information), but they could also be be- nign (for example, an employee is carrying out a workaround or taking a shortcut to complete their job). Therefore it is important to minimise the risk of false positives, and we do this by combining techniques from human factors, artificial intelligence, and risk analysis in our approach. Developed as a distributed system, Ben-ware has a three-tier architecture composed of (i) probes for data col- lection, (ii) intermediate nodes for data routing, and (iii) high level nodes for data analysis\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "27\n", "authors": ["868"]}

By using a universally accepted design notation such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML), ambiguities in the system specification can be eliminated or minimised. The aspect that frequently needs to be investigated before the implementation stage can be commenced concerns the proposed system\u2019s performance. It is necessary to predict whether a particular design will meet the performance requirement - i.e. is it worth implementing the system - or not. One way to obtain this performance prediction is by using simulation programs to mimic the execution of the system. Unfortunately, it is often difficult to transform the design into a simulation program without some sound knowledge of simulation techniques. In addition, new simulation programs need to be built each time for different systems - which can be tedious, time consuming and error prone. The currently available UML tools do not provide any facilities for generating simulation programs automatically from UML specifications. This shortcoming is the main motivation for this research. The work involved here includes an investigation of which UML design notations can be used; the available simulation languages or environments for running the simulation; and more importantly, a framework that can capture the simulation information from UML design notation.

Based on careful examination of the Europay, MasterCard and Visa (EMV) protocol and experiments with the Visa fast Dynamic Data Authentication transaction protocol, we provide a set of building blocks for possible attacks. These building blocks are data skimming, Verify PIN and transaction relay, which we implement and experiment with. Based on these building blocks, we propose a number of realistic attacks, including a denial-of-service attack and a newly developed realistic PIN guessing attack.

We targeted home security devices because their security is critical as people may rely on them to protect their homes. In particular, we exploited a feature called \u201cheartbeat\u201d, which is exchanged between the devices and the cloud in order to check that the devices are still connected. Even though network traffic was encrypted, we successfully identified the heartbeats due to their fixed size and periodic nature. Thereafter, we established a man-in-the-middle attack between the device and the cloud and selectively forwarded heartbeats while filtering out other traffic. As a result, the device appears to be still connected (because the heartbeat traffic is being allowed through), while in reality the device\u2019s functionality is disabled (because non-heartbeat traffic is being filtered out). We applied this exploit on a set of six devices, and five were found to be vulnerable. Consequently, an intruder can use this exploit to disable a home security device and break into a house without the awareness of the owner. We carried out a responsible disclosure exercise with the manufacturers of the affected devices, but the response has been limited.

{"title": "Digital Strategy for the Social Inclusion of Survivors of Domestic Violence\n", "abstract": " For most of us advances in digital technology have made our lives easier, by providing access to information and services whenever and wherever we want. In a perfect world this should be true for Survivors of domestic violence, with technology providing access to domestic violence support services at a time and place that is convenient to the Survivor, thereby arousing less suspicion from their partner. Unfortunately the technologies Survivors are using to access help and support (i.e. mobile phones and Internet browsers) are recording a trail of \u201celectronic footprints\u201d which can be followed; consequently Survivors are being prevented from accessing the services that have been provided to help them. Related research shows that intimate partner cyber stalking represents a genuine threat to Survivors, with a proven link between the stalking behaviour and the controlling / abusive behaviours common to cases of domestic violence. The aim of this research was to improve the ability of Survivors to access domestic violence support services. This has been divided into two objectives, the first objective is to make the services more accessible (easier to find and more targeted in the information they provide), the second objective was to give Survivors the tools they require to erase their electronic footprints so that they can access support services safely (and thereby be more willing to use the services provided). To achieve these objectives the project looked at existing support services, carried out a survey of Survivors to find out what they needed from the services, identified the issues with existing Internet and mobile phone technologies and proposes\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["868"]}
{"title": "Persistence in Linux-Based IoT Malware\n", "abstract": " The Internet of Things (IoT) is a rapidly growing collection of \u201csmart\u201d devices capable of communicating over the Internet. Being connected to the Internet brings new features and convenience, but it also poses new security threats, such as IoT malware. IoT malware has shown similar growth, making IoT devices highly vulnerable to remote compromise. However, most IoT malware variants do not exhibit the ability to gain persistence, as they typically lose control over the compromised device when the device is restarted. This paper investigates how persistence for various IoT devices can be implemented by attackers, such that they retain control even after the device has been rebooted. Having persistence would make it harder to remove IoT malware. We investigated methods that could be used by an attacker to gain persistence on a variety of IoT devices, and compiled the requirements and potential\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["868"]}
{"title": "Position paper: A systematic framework for categorising IoT device fingerprinting mechanisms\n", "abstract": " The popularity of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices makes it increasingly important to be able to fingerprint them, for example in order to detect if there are misbehaving or even malicious IoT devices in one's network. However, there are many challenges faced in the task of fingerprinting IoT devices, mainly due to the huge variety of the devices involved. At the same time, the task can potentially be improved by applying machine learning techniques for better accuracy and efficiency. The aim of this paper is to provide a systematic categorisation of machine learning augmented techniques that can be used for fingerprinting IoT devices. This can serve as a baseline for comparing various IoT fingerprinting mechanisms, so that network administrators can choose one or more mechanisms that are appropriate for monitoring and maintaining their network.

{"title": "Using Eyetracker to Find Ways to Mitigate Ransomware\n", "abstract": " Ransomware is a form of malware designed to prevent access to data by either locking out the victims from their system or encrypting some or all of their files until a ransom has been paid to the attacker. Victims would know that they had been hit by ransomware because a ransom demand (splash screen) would be displayed on their compromised device. This study aims to identify key user interface features of ransomware splash screens and see how these features affect victims\u2019 likelihood to pay, and how this information may be used to create more effective countermeasures to mitigate the threat of ransomware. We devised an experiment that contained three broad types of splash screens (Text, Time-Sensitive Counter, and Other). A total of nine splash screens were shown to each participant, from which data on the participants\u2019 eye behaviour were collected. After each splash screen, participants were also asked a set of questions that would help describe their experience and be cross-referenced with the eye tracking data to aid analysis. Our experiment collected quantitative eye tracker data and qualitative data regarding willingness to pay from 25 participants. Several key components of the splash screens such as the text, logo, images, and technical information were analysed. Comments from the participants on whether they would pay the ransom or not, and the reasons behind their decision were also recorded. We found that there is no clear indication that one type of splash screen would have a higher chance of success with regard to ransom payment. Our study revealed that there are some characteristics in splash screens that would\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["868"]}
{"title": "How paranoid are you?: Issues in location information of ambient systems\n", "abstract": " The prevalence of location-informing devices such as smart phones brings a lot of benefits, such as the ability to find the right services nearby. Nonetheless, there are also concerns that such devices might infringe our privacy and breach security. This paper discusses both viewpoints by outlining how location information might be obtained, what the location information can be used for, as well as the issues and problems that might be faced when location information becomes available too readily or in too much detail. We illustrate these with a case study using an iPhone application that we developed, which allows users to track the last known location of their \u201ccontacts\u201d(such as friends or family), and to specify the granularity level of the information they are willing to share with each of their contacts in return.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["868"]}
{"title": "Security implications of structure\n", "abstract": " 5 Conclusion             Human involvement in any system is unavoidable, and will critically influence the structure and security of the system, making it unpredictable and therefore hard to study. To understand how these socio-technical systems behave, we need to better understand the behaviour of people. This will lead to a better design of security measures in term of usability and effectiveness. As a result, the risk of human components bypassing or rendering the security measures useless through their careless actions could be reduced.             Another way to improve the security of computer-based systems is by making the human components aware of the importance of sound security practices and the havoc that security breaches could bring. It is very common \u2014 if not mandatory \u2014 for new employees to undergo safety training or induction. This could be extended to include security induction, where new\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["868"]}
{"title": "Earworms make bad passwords: An analysis of the Nok\u0113 smart lock manual override\n", "abstract": " This paper presents a security analysis of the manual override feature of the Noke\u0305 smart lock. The Noke\u0305 allows its user to operate, monitor and even share his smart lock with others through a smartphone. To counter the risk of being unable to open the lock when the smartphone is unavailable, it provides an override mechanism. Noke\u0305 implements this override feature using a quick-click scheme, whereby its user can choose a sequence of eight to sixteen short and long shackle presses (similar to a Morse code). To explore the security implications of this feature, we conducted a study collecting human-generated quick-click codes from 100 participants, and analysed and modelled the resulting dataset. Our analysis shows that the override mechanism, at least in its current implementation, presents a significant opportunity for successful guessing attacks. We demonstrate this by building a mechanical brute force\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["868"]}
{"title": "Using Smart Dust in Transport Domain\n", "abstract": " The smart dust concept has been around for almost a decade now, but its application in transport domain has only been recently investigated. This is a very valuable area of research, as smart dust\u2013being generally perceived as the lowcost, ubiquitous sensor of the future\u2013can play an important role in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Our involvement in several transport-related UK and EU funded projects (such as ASTRA [1], EMMA [5], and TRACKSS [7]) gave us the opportunity to carry out feasibility experiments and to develop demonstrations of smart dust applications in transport domain. We have also investigated how smart dust can be used in collaboration with other (more traditional) transport sensors for developing better Co-operative Transport Systems (CTS).

{"title": "Structuring dependable on-line services: A case study using internet grocery shopping\n", "abstract": " Whilst we are entering the era of the silver surfer, there are still many older people who do not have access to internet-based services. Grocery shopping via the internet, for example, is potentially very useful to older people with mobility problems. The standard model of internet shopping involves a do-it-yourself (DIY) approach; an alternative approach is to get someone else to do it for you (GSETDIFY). The GSETDIFY model has been implemented by the Net Neighbours scheme with the aim of providing social support and human contact with a volunteer. The DIY model and Net Neighbours implementation are compared and contrasted here in terms of how their structure affects the dependability of the service offered. Whilst the Net Neighbours structure is necessarily more complex, as it involves more stakeholders, it has been possible to achieve a high level of dependability by drawing on these stakeholders as additional resources.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["868"]}
