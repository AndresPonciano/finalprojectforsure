A quantitative histologic study.\n", "abstract": " The vascularity of 20 primary skin melanomas was assessed histologically. These cases were selected from patients with intermediate thickness melanomas (0.76-4.0 mm thick) treated surgically to provide two groups of ten patients. One group had no evidence of recurrence with a minimum follow-up of 9 years. The second group of ten patients developed locoregional or systemic metastasis under follow-up, and seven of these patients died of disseminated melanoma. Age, sex, Breslow's tumor thickness, and Clark's level of invasion were similar in the two groups. Vascular quantitation was carried out by image analysis after vascular definition by Ulex europaeus-I agglutinin staining. The percentage vascular area at the tumor base in the recurrence group was more than twice that in the recurrence-free group.

The country is still struggling with this problem. Malnutrition, the condition resulting from faulty nutrition, weakens the immune system and causes significant growth and cognitive delay. Growth assessment is the measurement that best defines the health and nutritional status of children, while also providing an indirect measurement of well-being for the entire population. A cross-sectional study, in which we explored nutritional status in school-age slum children and analyze factors associated with malnutrition with the help of a pre-designed and pre-tested questionnaire, anthropometric measurements and clinical examination from December 2010 to April 2011 in urban slums of Bareilly, Uttar-Pradesh (UP), India. The mean height and weight of boys and girls in the study group was lower than the CDC 2000 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) standards in all age groups. Regarding nutritional status, prevalence of stunting and underweight was highest in age group 11 yrs to 13 yrs whereas prevalence of wasting was highest in age group 5 yrs to 7 yrs. Except refractive errors all illnesses are more common among girls, but this gender difference is statistically significant only for anemia and rickets. The risk of malnutrition was significantly higher among children living in joint families, children whose mother's education was [less than or equal to] 6th standard and children with working mothers.

Methods Expressions of E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin were analyzed in the same cohort of 105 OSCCs, 76 oral lesions and 30 normal oral tissues by immunohistochemistry and correlated with clinicopathological parameters and prognosis. The effect of siRNA mediated ALCAM knockdown on E-cadherin and \u03b2 -catenin was determined using western blot, confocal microscopy and RT-PCR analysis in oral cancer cells.  Results Significant loss of membranous E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin expression was observed from normal, hyperplasia, dysplasia to OSCCs (ptrend <0.001); and correlated with cytoplasmic ALCAM accumulation in OSCCs (p = 0.006). Multivariate analysis revealed \u03b2-catenin membrane loss and ALCAM/\u03b2-cateninnuclear/cytoplasmic accumulation to be significant predictors for late clinical stage (p<0.001, OR = 8.7; p = 0.006, OR = 9.9, respectively) and nodal metastasis (p = 0.003, OR = 3.8; p = 0.025, OR = 3.4 respectively).

However, the psychiatric profile in Indian patients remains a mystery. It remains to be seen if surgery can alleviate the psychiatric morbidity and improve the quality of life of patients. Although, the pathophysiology remains largely unknown, we attempted to see if psychiatric morbidity correlated with serum calcium values. OBJECTIVE: a) To study the nature and severity of neuropsychiatric manifestations in patients of hyperparathyroidism before surgery and their outcome after surgery b) To study their correlation with levels of serum calcium. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective study documented the occurrence of psychiatric symptoms among 14 patients of primary hyperparathyroidism (group I). 13 patients of gall stone disease (group II) and 12 patients of thyromegaly, undergoing total thyroidectomy (Group III) constituted the control groups. The relationship between such symptoms and degree of hypercalcemia was also studied. Assessment of psychologic symptoms, using the CPRS scale (validated in Hindi) and the scale for Memory and Intelligence for use in Hindi speaking population was carried out preoperatively and at 1 wk, 6 wk, 3, and 6 months postoperatively.

A 10 or 8 MHz directional Doppler probe was used and the signals were analysed on an Angioscan II spectrum analyser. No blood flow was detected in 7 primary melanomas each of thickness less than 0.75 mm and one recurrent subcutaneous nodule. Abnormal blood flow signals were detected in 8 primary melanomas--each of thickness greater than 1.2 mm--and in 7 skin nodules of secondary melanoma. Three tumours did not conform to the general pattern--one primary tumour 0.7 mm thick had abnormal blood flow signals whereas one primary lesion of 2 mm thickness and one secondary deposit were flow negative. Thus neovascularization corresponds in general to the cut-off point for good prognostic tumours, suggesting that it is a development of biological significance. This vascular pattern can be detected non-invasively by means of a Doppler probe and may have a prognostic importance, particularly with melanomas of the intermediate thickness range of 0.75-3.0 mm, where precise outcome cannot at present be predicted.

The method includes the steps of: generating an attribute list for each attribute of the records, sorting the attribute lists for numeric attributes, and generating a decision tree by repeatedly partitioning the records using the attribute lists. For each node, split points are evaluated to determine the best split test for partitioning the records at the node. Preferably, a gini index and class histograms are used in determining the best splits. The gini index indicates how well a split point separates the records while the class histograms reflect the class distribution of the records at the node. Also, a hash table is built as the attribute list of the split attribute is divided among the child nodes, which is then used for splitting the remaining attribute lists of the node.

Identification of different forest communities within the region was also accomplished. Cluster analysis and PCA revealed five forest communities (ie, sal miscellaneous forest, sal dominant forest, lowland miscellaneous forest, teak plantation and Indopiptadenia population) on the basis of their species composition. Out of these 5 communities, Indopiptadenia population attracted more attention due to its small and declining population. The unique habitat of this small population found chiefly on gravely-sandy soil along the water streams edges places it before the natural threats of floods and cutting of river banks. The lowest tree density (440.00 stem haG1) and basal cover (19.35 m2 haG1) values were exhibited by this plant community. This suggests that the population of Indopiptadenia is more exposed forest community in comparison to others and faces higher degree of anthropogenic pressures for their fodder and timber values.", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["314"]}

{"title": "Efficacy of complementary therapies in the quality of life of breast cancer survivors\n", "abstract": " Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women and the second most common cancer overall, ranking as the fifth cause of death from cancer. The chronicity of the disease produces long-term physiological and psychological manifestations, which adversely affect the quality of life of the individual. The primary treatment while managing cancer presents with various debilitating side effects. With the recent advances in treatment techniques that have improved the survival rate, patients suffer from continuing post-treatment complications. Patients seem to cope well with the stress of treatment of breast cancer and sustain a normal life; however, the deterioration in physical well-being makes the patient functionally inefficient. Exercise has been proven to be an effective, safe and feasible tool in combating the adverse effects of treatment, prevent complications and decrease the risk of BC-specific mortality. This review briefly presents an overview of the burden of the disease and its management strategies. Owing to the heterogeneity of the population and the multitude of therapies they receive, the response of each patient to treatment is different and so is the magnitude of adverse effects. The review discusses the late sequelae following treatment and evidence supporting the role of physical activity in their management. In conclusion, there is a need for personalized physical activity plans to be developed to suit the individual and their circumstances.", "num_citations": "23\n", "authors": ["314"]}

The various methods described in the literature identify the sentinel lymph nodes in approximately 96\u00a0% of cases and associated with a false negativity rate of 5 to 10\u00a0%. A false negative sentinel node is defined as the proportion of cases in whom sentinel node biopsy is reported as negative, but the rest of axillary lymph node(s) harbours cancer cells. The possible causes of a false negative sentinel lymph node may be because of blocked lymphatics either by cancer cells or following fibrosis of previous surgery/radiotherapy, and an alternative pathway opens draining the blue dye or isotope to another uninvolved node.

We report a case of a 67-year-old woman who presented with gallstone ileus following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and sphincterotomy for choledocholithiasis. She had a history of terminal ileum resection with ileocolic anastomosis for Crohn's disease. A 3 cm gallstone was found to be impacted just proximal to the previous ileocolic anastomosis. A second gallstone was found on digital examination of the proximal small bowel. A gallstone may enter the gastrointestinal tract following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and sphincterotomy and impact proximal to an anastomotic stricture as demonstrated here.

A chiral (4,1) carbon nanotube was found to become less metallic as the number of hydrogen cyanide molecules nearby increased. When there were a sufficient number of hydrogen cyanide molecules close to the nanotube, it became semiconducting. This metallic to semiconducting transformation of the nanotube was verified by analyzing its conductance and current as a function of the number of molecules of hydrogen cyanide present. The conductivity of the carbon nanotube was very high when no hydrogen cyanide molecules were present, but decreased considerably when even just a single hydrogen cyanide molecule approached the surface of the nanotube\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["314"]}

Two times repetition of Hummers oxidation and hydrazine hydrate reduction method produce reduced graphene oxide (term as rGO2) with more uniform distribution in size and thickness. In addition, this uniquely synthesized rGO2 induces favorable shift in balance of electron and hole recombination zone toward the center of emissive layer owing to increase in in-plane crystallite size and high localize aromatic confinement. Five times increase in maximum device efficiency (Cd/A) and three times increase in maximum brightness (Cd/m2) are achieved with the LED device using nanocomposite as emissive layer compared to neat polymer.

Recently, there has been significant interest in classification using training datasets that are large enough that they do not fit in main memory and need to be disk-resident. Although training data can be reduced by sampling, it has been shown that it can be advantageous to use the entire training dataset since that can increase accuracy. Most current algorithms are unsui:table for large disk-resident datasets because their space and time complexities (including I/0) are prohibitive. A recent algorithm called SPRINT promises to alleviate some of the data size restrictions.

{"title": "Teaching and assessment of surgical skills through simulation in surgical training\n", "abstract": " Background: Teaching motor skills to medical students is one of the most crucial tasks of medical teachers. Teaching and assessment of technical skills in operation theatres is difficult due to pressure on theatre time, ethical issues and medico-legal concerns. Some of these tasks are complex and difficult to be taught in real-life situations. Simulation provides a useful alternative.Objective: Teaching and assessment of basic surgical skills to the trainees in a simulated environment outside the operating room.Material and Methods: Two one-day suturing and knot-tying workshops were held, where the students were invited to acquire the necessary knowledge and learn skills of suturing. Fifty-two undergraduate and 25 junior residents participated in the workshops. The suturing skills of the trainees were assessed before and after the training by Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS), using a checklist. In the first workshop, a pre-training and post-training questionnaire was used to assess their knowledge about sutures and their perceptions about the workshop.Results: All trainees believed that such workshops were useful. Significant improvement was seen in the post-training checklist scores of trainees. The improvement was more marked for undergraduate medical students.Conclusions: Teaching of basic surgical skills is both feasible and advantageous using simulation. Basic surgical skills should be taught to all medical students regardless of their career aims, at all the medical colleges.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["314"]}

This paper addresses the water management strategies of rice crops under sodic environment, as under sodic environment during monsoon season rice is the sole option. Sodic soils are characterized by a relatively low electrical conductivity (EC), high exchangeable sodium (Na) on exchange sites, soil pH> 8.0, low rate of infiltration, and dispersed soil, restricting capacity of these soils to absorb desired water and poor infiltration characteristics.

{"title": "Forest hydrology of mountainous and snow-dominated watersheds\n", "abstract": " This chapter addresses snow and hydrological processes of steep forested watersheds. Many of the hydrological principles described in other chapters are applicable to steep, high elevations, but the relationships among surface runoff, shallow lateral flow and baseflow warrant a special discussion in the context of snow processes and steep watersheds. The principles presented in this chapter are generally applicable to forested ecosystems overlapping with chaparral or agriculture at lower elevations, and subalpine ecosystems at higher elevations. High-elevation forests are often considered the \u2018water towers\u2019 for much of the world. From the Americas, throughout Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia, large urban areas and irrigation projects look to runoff from higher-elevation forests to meet their water supply needs (Viviroli and Weingartner, 2004). These areas not only provide surface water to keep streams flowing and lakes and reservoirs filled, but also are often important areas for recharging groundwater reservoirs that are later tapped by wells or bore holes for their precious water. Worldwide, it is estimated that more than a billion people rely on snow-covered areas and glaciers for their water supply (Bales et al., 2006).", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["314"]}

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been used to study the adsorption of CO and CO2 gas molecules on the surface of MoS2 monolayer with Mo atom embedded at S-vacancy site (MoS). The strong interaction between Mo metal with pristine MoS2 sheet suggests its strong binding nature. Doping Mo into MoS2 sheet enhances CO and CO2 adsorption strength. The sensing response of MoS-doped MoS2 system to CO and CO2 gas molecules is obtained in the single electron transistor (SET) environment by varying bias voltage.

{"title": "Stabilized explicit time integration for parallel air quality models\n", "abstract": " Air Quality Models are defined for prediction and simulation of air pollutant concentrations over a certain period of time. The  predictions can be used in setting limits for the emission levels of industrial facilities. The input data for the air quality models are very large and encompass various environmental conditions like wind speed, turbulence, temperature and cloud density.  Most air quality models are based on advection-diffusion equations. These differential equations are moderately stiff and require appropriate techniques for fast integration over large intervals of time. Implicit time stepping techniques for solving differential equations being unconditionally stable are considered suitable for the solution. However, implicit time stepping techniques impose certain data dependencies that can cause the parallelization of air quality models to be inefficient.  The current approach uses Runge Kutta Chebyshev explicit method for solution of advection diffusion equations. It is found that even if the explicit method used is computationally more expensive in the serial execution, it takes lesser execution time when parallelized because of less complicated data dependencies presented by the explicit time-stepping. The implicit time-stepping on the other hand cannot be parallelized efficiently because of the inherent complicated data dependencies.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["314"]}

{"title": "Laparoscopic hernia repair--what are the results?\n", "abstract": " The two widely practised laparoscopic groin hernia repairs are: a) trans-abdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) and b) trans-extraperitoneal preperitoneal (TEPP) approaches. Early results are encouraging with both the techniques being associated with low recurrence rates (0% to 2%) comparable to the best, reported for standard open repair (Shouldice and Lichtenstein's). Other complications are higher in the beginning following laparoscopic hernia repair compared to the conventional method. These complications are related to the learning curve and expected to come down significantly with increasing experience of surgeons. Laparoscopic repair of recurrent groin hernia appears to be considerably superior to the conventional technique. The recurrence rates following conventional repair of recurrent groin hernias are between 1.5% and 35%(Table I) compared to none for laparoscopic repair of recurrent inguinal hernias. The disadvantages of laparoscopic repair include greater technical difficulty, higher incidence of serious complications and increased cost. Sutured open repair is associated with high postoperative discomfort, greater difficulty of repairing recurrent hernia with higher societal cost (due to prolonged time-off from work for 12% to 57% of patients operated for various open technique-Table II). The techniques of laparoscopic hernia repairs are nearly standardised today. Laparoscopic surgeons have an obligation to offer the new alternative and to ensure that it is safely used.

In this article, sisal and bagasse fibres have been reinforced into epoxy resin in different fibre ratios keeping the composite resin and fibre ratio constant ie 60: 40. In order to achieve the objectives, five different composites were prepared by reinforcing sisal and bagasse fibres in varying weight compositions in the composite. After preparation of samples different test were performed for testing of their mechanical performance (ie Tensile test, Impact test, Rockwell Hardness, Flexural test test) and water absorbing capacity of the fibres. The influence of alkali treatment (with 5 wt.% NaOH solution for 10 Hrs.) on mechanical properties of sisal and bagasse reinforced hybrid composites was also investigated.After detailed analysis of results obtained it was concluded that as the amount of sisal fibre increased in the sisal/bagasse hybrid composite increased its tensile strength, tensile modulus and hardness increased and upon introduction of bagasse fibre its flexural strength, flexural modulus and water absorbing capacity increased. Impact Strength is maximum for alkali treated composite having composition in the ratio of 60: 20: 20 and it increases by 73.17% compared to neat epoxy. Tensile and Flexural Modulus of composite (Untreated) with weight ratio as 60: 20: 20 increased by 18.79% and 54.89% respectively compared to neat epoxy. Tensile and Flexural Strength is maximum for neat epoxy composite and it also shows least water absorbing capacity due to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["314"]}

Initially, a five-gap single cavity was designed for fundamental 2\u03c0-mode operation at 94 GHz using eigen-mode analysis. Thereafter transient analysis has been performed to find out whether there is any problem with respect to mode competition since sheet beam EIK device is prone for mode-competition and oscillation. It was found that the return-loss of five gap single cavity with input and output couplers was-28 dB. Later, 3-D PIC simulations were carried-out for a three-cavity EIK structure at 19.5 kV and 3 A.

Most of the livestock in India is owned by small farmers, marginal farmers, and landless labourers. Livestock owners of such animals with poor resource are more vulnerable to climate change. There is a requirement for adaptation pathways to withstand the effects of climate change (short and long term) as well as effective implementation of policies that promote sustainable development. Genetic, management and environmental modifications may be helpful to maintain sustainable development of livestock. Vulnerable livestock population may require genetic modification to meet the challenges of future climate change. Faster genetic gains can be achieved with new technologies, including genomic selection and advanced reproductive technologies.

Entropically necessary defects are inevitably present in 2D materials in the form of vacancies and grain boundaries. Additional defects, such as dopants, may be intentionally introduced to tune the electronic structure of 2D materials. While defects are often perceived as performance limiters, the presence of defects and dopants in 2D materials results in new electronic states to endow unique functionalities that are otherwise not possible in the bulk. In this chapter, we review defect-induced phenomena in 2D materials with some examples demonstrating the relevance of defects in electronic and energy applications. In particular, we present how the (i) N-dopant configuration in graphene changes the electron-phonon interactions,(ii) zigzag defects and edges in graphene increase the quantum capacitance to improve energy density of graphene-based supercapacitors, and (iii) charged grain boundaries in exfoliated Bi2Te3 preferentially scatter low-energy electrons and holes to enhance the thermoelectric performance.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["314"]}

{"title": "Defect-engineered graphene for bulk supercapacitors with high energy and power densities\n", "abstract": " The development of high-energy and high-power density supercapacitors (SCs) is critical for enabling next-generation energy storage applications. Nanocarbons are excellent SC electrode materials due to their economic viability, high-surface area, and high stability. Although nanocarbons have high theoretical surface area and hence high double layer capacitance, the net amount of energy stored in nanocarbon-SCs is much below theoretical limits due to two inherent bottlenecks: i) their low quantum capacitance and ii) limited ion-accessible surface area. Here, we demonstrate that defects in graphene could be effectively used to mitigate these bottlenecks by drastically increasing the quantum capacitance and opening new channels to facilitate ion diffusion in otherwise closed interlayer spaces. Our results support the emergence of a new energy paradigm in SCs with 250% enhancement in double layer capacitance beyond the theoretical limit. Furthermore, we demonstrate prototype defect engineered bulk SC devices with energy densities 500% higher than state-of-the-art commercial SCs without compromising the power density.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["314"]}

{"title": "Traffic aware scheme for optimum hierarchical level in wireless sensor network\n", "abstract": " Topology plays a vital role to increase the lifetime and scalability of wireless sensor network (WSN). Topology of the WSN can be controlled by the dynamic clustering technique. In this paper, we have proposed a dynamic clustering approach that determines the optimum number of hierarchical level based on the traffic pattern to improve the network lifetime. During the period of data transmission, the nodes which are nearer to the base station, have to do dual work of collecting the data from its own cluster and forward the data coming from the previous cluster head. Due to this, load on the proximity cluster head is more in compare with the farther cluster head. Hence proximity cluster head dies out early than the farther cluster head which will result in the failure of whole network.

{"title": "Improving retinal ganglion cell transduction by using scAAV type 8 or type 9 vectors containing capsid mutations\n", "abstract": " Purpose:: The transduction efficiency of AAV vectors varies greatly in different cells and tissues in vitro and in vivo. Administration of an AAV serotype 2 vector (AAV2) results in the transduction of diverse cell types in the murine retina whereas other serotypes have more restricted retinal cell tropisms. However, no other serotype tested so far is as effective at transducing retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) as AAV2 injected in the vitreous. Surface exposed capsid amino acid residues are key elements in AAV-mediated transduction since they define not only cell tropism, perhaps also the onset and intensity of passenger gene expression. One reason is that modification of the AAV capsid surface upon viral entry appears to mediate cytoplasmic degradation of AAV vectors. In an attempt to modulate AAV tropism, tyrosine (Y) residues mapping to the capsid surface were modified to phenylalanine (F) to alter vector transduction\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["314"]}

In this short paper, we present parallel formulations of classification decision tree learning algorithm based on induction. We describe two basic parallel formulations, Synchronous Tree Construction Approach and Partitioned Tree Construction Approach.
