{"title": "Investigating the Adoption of Agile Practices in Mobile Application Development.\n", "abstract": " The mobile application development market has been dramatically growing in the last few years as the complexity of its applications and speed of software development process. These changes in the mobile development market require a rethinking on the way the software development should be performed by teams. In order to better understand how agile practices support mobile application development, we applied a questionnaire to 20 undergraduate students. These students have been training in an iOS development course combined with agile practices. Our study aims to identify challenges and to report the students experience on the adoption of agile practices to develop mobile applications. Our findings reveal that agile practices help mobile software development mainly in terms of project management and control and development speed. However, aspects of user interface and user experience, different development platforms, and users expectations still point challenges in developing mobile applications.", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["392"]}
{"title": "Poster: Challenge-based learning: A Brazilian case study\n", "abstract": " Mobile application development (MAD) has became, or is considering to be a part of the academic curricula in Computer Science courses. However, training students on mobile application development inherits the challenges of teaching software engineering where the target computer is a device that has a large number of features accessible by software. Furthermore, the most related experience in teaching students reveals di culties in developing software engineering competencies. In this paper we present results from a case study conducted in four universities in Brazil. We have investigated the adoption of Challenge-Based Learning (CBL) framework and agile practices for training students in software engineering applied in mobile application development environments.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["392"]}
{"title": "Challenges and practices for effective knowledge transfer in globally distributed teams\n", "abstract": " In the context of Global Software Development (GSD), team members face a number of challenges that needs to be solved. One of them relates to the transfer of knowledge needed to fulfil the required tasks. The knowledge transfer (KT) process may be organized and implemented in various ways, as companies use varying strategies to transfer knowledge from onsite to offshore sites. However, without effective knowledge management practices, success in GSD will be difficult. In this paper, we aims to identify the process activities of KT in globally distributed teams, challenges and suitable solutions for effective KT. In order to achieve this objective, a systematic literature review (SLR) of the existing KT literature is conducted. Our findings describing the process of KT in GDT, a set of challenges and recommended practices for effective KT. Finally, we conclude this study with a discussion of the directions for further and future research.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["392"]}

{"title": "The CDF time of flight detector\n", "abstract": " A new Time of Flight (TOF) detector based on scintillator bars with fine-mesh photomultipliers at both ends has been in operation since 2001 in the CDF experiment. With a design resolution of 100 ps, the TOF can provide separation between K/sup /spl plusmn// and /spl pi//sup /spl plusmn// in pp~ collisions at the 2/spl sigma/ level for low momentum, which enhances b flavor tagging capabilities. Because of its very fast response, the TOF is an excellent triggering device, and it is used to trigger on highly ionizing particles, multiple minimum ionizing particles and cosmic rays. Particle identification is achieved by comparing the time-of-flight of the particle measured by the TOF to the time expected for a given mass hypothesis. In order to obtain the resolution necessary for particle ID, optimal calibrations are critical. This paper describes the TOF detector, its calibration procedure, the achieved resolution, the long term\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["392"]}
{"title": "Adopting agile methods for follow-the-sun software development\n", "abstract": " Follow-the-sun (FTS) is a special case of Global Software Development (GSD) in which development is distributed around twenty-four hours of work per day in order to reduce the overall project completion time. However, FTS is barely used by software development companies as they find it difficult to put FTS into practice. Recent studies have suggested agile methods as a promising approach to implement FTS. Thus, in this study we examine how agile methods can collaborate with FTS. We present an experience report describing the challenges and lessons learned by applying the Scrum method to a software development project. Moreover, we discuss how agile methods can be used effectively for FTS software development aiming to target the project managers who want to better reap the benefits of FTS.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["392"]}
