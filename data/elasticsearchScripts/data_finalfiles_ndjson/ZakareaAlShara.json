{"title": "Teachcloud: a cloud computing educational toolkit\n", "abstract": " Cloud computing is an evolving and fast-growing computing paradigm that has gained great interest from both industry and academia. Consequently, universities are actively integrating cloud computing into their IT curricula. One major challenge facing cloud computing instructors is the lack of a teaching tool to experiment with. This paper introduces TeachCloud, a modelling and simulation environment for cloud computing. TeachCloud can be used to experiment with different cloud components such as: processing elements, data centres, storage, networking, service level agreement (SLA) constraints, web-based applications, service oriented architecture (SOA), virtualisation, management and automation, and business process management (BPM). Also, TeachCloud introduces MapReduce processing model in order to handle embarrassingly parallel data processing problems.

Consequently, many researchers are actively involved in cloud computing research projects. One major challenge facing cloud computing researchers is the lack of a comprehensive cloud computing experimental tool to use in their studies. This paper introduces CloudExp, a modeling and simulation environment for cloud computing. CloudExp can be used to evaluate a wide spectrum of cloud components such as processing elements, data centers, storage, networking, Service Level Agreement (SLA) constraints, web-based applications, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), virtualization, management and automation, and Business Process Management (BPM).

{"title": "Come4acloud: An end-to-end framework for autonomic cloud systems\n", "abstract": " Autonomic Computing has largely contributed to the development of self-manageable Cloud services. It notably allows freeing Cloud administrators of the burden of manually managing varying-demand services, while still enforcing Service-Level Agreements (SLAs). All Cloud artifacts, regardless of the layer carrying them, share many common characteristics. Thus, it should be possible to specify, (re)configure and monitor any XaaS (Anything-as-a-Service) layer in an homogeneous way. To this end, the CoMe4ACloud approach proposes a generic model-based architecture for autonomic management of Cloud systems. We derive a generic unique Autonomic Manager (AM) capable of managing any Cloud service, regardless of the layer. This AM is based on a constraint solver which aims at finding the optimal configuration for the modeled XaaS, i.e. the best balance between costs and revenues while meeting the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["2203"]}
{"title": "A model-based architecture for autonomic and heterogeneous cloud systems\n", "abstract": " Over the last few years, Autonomic Computing has been a key enabler for Cloud system's dynamic adaptation. However, autonomously managing complex systems (such as in the Cloud context) is not trivial and may quickly become fastidious and error-prone. We advocate that Cloud artifacts, regardless of the layer carrying them, share many common characteristics. Thus, this makes it possible to specify, (re)configure and monitor them in an homogeneous way. To this end, we propose a generic model-based architecture for allowing the autonomic management of any Cloud system. From a \" XaaS \" model describing a given Cloud system, possibly over multiple layers of the Cloud stack, Cloud administrators can derive an autonomic manager for this system. This paper introduces the designed model-based architecture, and notably its core generic XaaS modeling language. It also describes the integration with a constraint solver to be used by the autonomic manager , as well as the interoperability with a Cloud standard (TOSCA). It presents an implementation (with its application on a multi-layer Cloud system) and compares the proposed approach with other existing solutions.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["2203"]}
{"title": "Symptoms-Based Fuzzy-Logic Approach for COVID-19 Diagnosis\n", "abstract": " The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has caused severe adverse effects on the human life and the global economy affecting all communities and individuals due to its rapid spreading, increase in the number of affected cases and creating severe health issues and death cases worldwide. Since no particular treatment has been acknowledged so far for this disease, prompt detection of COVID-19 is essential to control and halt its chain. In this paper, we introduce an intelligent fuzzy inference system for the primary diagnosis of COVID-19. The system infers the likelihood level of COVID-19 infection based on the symptoms that appear on the patient. This proposed inference system can assist physicians in identifying the disease and help individuals to perform self-diagnosis on their own cases.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2203"]}
