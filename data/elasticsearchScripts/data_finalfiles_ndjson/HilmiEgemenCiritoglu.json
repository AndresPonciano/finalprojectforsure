{"title": "Towards a Better Replica Management for Hadoop Distributed File System\n", "abstract": " The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is the storage of choice when it comes to large-scale distributed systems. In addition to being efficient and scalable, HDFS provides high throughput and reliability through the replication of data. Recent work exploits this replication feature by dynamically varying the replication factor of in-demand data as a means of increasing data locality and achieving a performance improvement. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has been performed on the consequences of varying the replication factor. In particular, our work is the first to show that although HDFS deals well with increasing the replication factor, it experiences problems with decreasing it. This leads to unbalanced data, hot spots, and performance degradation. In order to address this problem, we propose a new workload-aware balanced replica deletion algorithm. We also show that our algorithm\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["736"]}
{"title": "Investigation of replication factor for performance enhancement in the hadoop distributed file system\n", "abstract": " The massive growth in the volume of data and the demand for big data utilisation has led to an increasing prevalence of Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) solutions. However, the performance of Hadoop and indeed HDFS has some limitations and remains an open problem in the research community. The ultimate goal of our research is to develop an adaptive replication system; this paper presents the first phase of the work-an investigation into the replication factor used in HDFS to determine whether increasing the replication factor for in-demand data can improve the performance of the system. We constructed a physical Hadoop cluster for our experimental environment, using TestDFSIO and both the real world and the synthetic data sets, NOAA and TPC-H, with Hive to validate our proposal. Results show that increasing the replication factor of the\u00bb hot\u00bb data increases the availability and locality of the data\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["736"]}
{"title": "Hard: a heterogeneity-aware replica deletion for hdfs\n", "abstract": " The Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) is responsible for storing very large data-sets reliably on clusters of commodity machines. The HDFS takes advantage of replication to serve data requested by clients with high throughput. Data replication is a trade-off between better data availability and higher disk usage. Recent studies propose different data replication management frameworks that alter the replication factor of files dynamically in response to the popularity of the data, keeping more replicas for in-demand data to enhance the overall performance of the system. When data gets less popular, these schemes reduce the replication factor, which changes the data distribution and leads to unbalanced data distribution. Such an unbalanced data distribution causes hot spots, low data locality and excessive network usage in the cluster. In this work, we first confirm that reducing the replication factor causes\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["736"]}
