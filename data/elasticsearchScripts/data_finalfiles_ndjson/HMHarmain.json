{"title": "Cm-builder: A natural language-based case tool for object-oriented analysis\n", "abstract": " Graphical CASE (Computer Aided Software Engineering) tools provide considerable help in documenting the output of the Analysis and Design stages of software development and can assist in detecting incompleteness and inconsistency in an analysis. However, these tools do not contribute to the initial, difficult stage of the analysis process, that of identifying the object classes, attributes and relationships used to model the problem domain. This paper describes an NL-Based CASE tool called Class Model Builder (CM-Builder) which aims at supporting this aspect of the Analysis stage of software development in an Object-Oriented framework. CM-Builder uses robust Natural Language Processing techniques to analyse software requirements texts written in English and constructs, either automatically or interactively with an analyst, an initial UML Class Model representing the object classes mentioned in\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "174\n", "authors": ["1916"]}

This semantic network is then used to automatically construct an initial UML class model representing the object classes mentioned in the text and the relationships among them. The initial model can be directly input to a graphical CASE tool for further refinement by a human analyst. CM-Builder has been quantitatively evaluated in blind trials against a collection of unseen software requirements texts and we present the results of this evaluation, together with the evaluation methodology.

{"title": "Analysis of primary school Arabic language textbooks\n", "abstract": " This paper reports on a preliminary analysis of a corpus consisting of Arabic language textbooks used in primary schools. The input to our process is a raw text extracted from Arabic textbooks used by the Emirates curriculum of grades 1 through 6. Various aspects, including word and root frequencies, parts-of-speech distribution, phonology, and themes, are investigated. A comparison among parts of speech, UAE grade 1 and Libya grade 1 is performed. Our analysis raises several issues on the criteria for selecting a word list that is appropriate for enriching the vocabulary of school children.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["1916"]}
{"title": "Survey of works that transform requirements into UML diagrams\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we aim to cover works that are related to the process of transforming requirements into UML diagrams, from the first works which were manual techniques in 1976, to automatic tools in 2015. In this context, we try to exhibit different approaches and to indicate their strength as well as their shortcomings. This work will help us to evaluate existing approaches and propose other alternatives for Requirement Engineering. The objective of this paper is to present an overview of various works dedicated to requirement analysis and a comparative study of these works. Also, we tried to discuss the combination of Artificial Intelligence with Requirement Engineering.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1916"]}
{"title": "Arabic text mining\n", "abstract": " This paper describes an on-going Arabic Text Mining system. It presents the architecture of the system and provides an overview of some issues involved in Arabic Text Mining. This system uses techniques from the research areas of Data Mining and Natural Language Processing. The text analysis starts by a preprocessing stage to convert HTML Arabic documents to XML documents. This stage significantly simplifies the analysis process. The processed text is then linguistically analyzed from the word level to the text level. The result of this analysis is a semantic network of the entities mentioned in the text and the relationships among them. This semantic network is then used for some specific mining tasks.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1916"]}
{"title": "Web Services-Based Hajj Information System\n", "abstract": " The past decade witnessed an increased interest in Web-Based Information Systems. Numerous techniques have been used to produce information systems in many areas. This paper describes a Web Services-Based information system dedicated to Muslims pilgrimage, known as Hajj in Arabic. More than two million Muslims gather in the holy city of Makkah every year. People come from different cultures with various levels of background knowledge. However, the main problem facing the organizers of this event is two-fold. First, is the lack of enough background knowledge most of pilgrims have about Hajj and its environment. Second, is guiding people during the Hajj period and keeping them up-to-date with the latest Hajj information. Our proposed system aims to tackle these two problems.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1916"]}

{"title": "What is a modern arabic dictionary?\n", "abstract": " A major concern our research addresses is how to enhance the children's use of the Arabic dictionary to encourage them to independently learn more vocabulary. Even though the first Arabic dictionary was developed almost 1500 years ago, the state of the art in Arabic dictionaries has not made much progress and falls far behind dictionaries for other languages. We propose a framework for building dictionaries that are game-like in their level of interactivity, and thus provide an immersive environment for children to enthusiastically explore more concepts, images, and vocabulary.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1916"]}
{"title": "Natural Language Processing and Object-Oriented Analysis\n", "abstract": " Computer systems are economically critical in all industrialised countries, and increasingly so in developing countries. The software in these systems represents a large proportion of the total system development cost. The development of software systems is considered one of the most time and resource consuming activities in modern societies. When computer systems were first introduced, ad hoc approaches were used to develop software systems. However, Computer software developed using ad hoc approaches was very difficult to maintain or extend. The search for more appropriate approaches led to the view that the development of software systems should not be different from the development of any other engineering systems. Therefore, a model of the system should be developed and tested before the development of the real system. Also, it was generally accepted that the development process is divided into several stages such as: analysis, design, implementation, and testing. Many researchers have realized and stated that errors made early in the software life-cycle are more expensive to correct if not detected early. A wide variety of methods and techniques have been suggested and used to analyse user requirements and create models of the software to be developed. These methods range from traditional, structured methods, to formal methods and object-oriented techniques.Object-Oriented Technology (OOT) is becoming a popular approach for building software systems. This technology has recently been extended from the programming phase to cover the earlier phases of the software life-cycle-Analysis and Design.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1916"]}
{"title": "ALKHALEEL: A Corpus-Based Learning Tool for Arabic\n", "abstract": " Language learning has been greatly facilitated by the availability of electronic resources. In particular, electronic dictionaries, corpora, concordances, and word frequency lists have been very helpful for language teachers and learners at the same time. In this paper we introduce an innovative tool that combines several Arabic language resources and analysis tools in one environment and discuss how these tools are used in the context of Arabic language learning. The tool accepts texts in different formats including HTML, XML, plain text, and MS Word documents. It can be used to perform simple text analysis such as calculating word frequencies and concordances, or to perform more sophisticated analysis using Natural Language Processing techniques for morphological analysis. The tool also includes an Arabic electronic dictionary to allow learners search for word meanings by selecting any word in their text.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1916"]}
