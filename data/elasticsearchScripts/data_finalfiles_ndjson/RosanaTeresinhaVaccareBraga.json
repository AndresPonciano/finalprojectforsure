It covers a great number of applications in business systems, including patterns for resource rental, trading and maintenance, and was designed based on practical experience in information systems development. Existing recurring patterns were applied to form patterns in our language, which were instantiated to this specific domain. The idea has been to make the language as complete as possible in order to be useful for the analysis of a wide variety of applications in this domain. Fifteen patterns are presented together with a diagram showing the precedence for checking the convenience of their utilization. Object models using UML notation are used both to present each pattern structure and a sample instantiation. The pattern language application to practical cases has shown that analysis is easily conducted, as it is a guideline for the work to be done.", "num_citations": "87\n", "authors": ["2191"]}

ISSN 0717-5000.Abstract This paper presents ProLiCES, an approach for the development of safety-critical embedded applications and its usage to develop a product line for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). The motivation of ProLiCES emerged after the development of Tiriba, a family of small, electric-powered unmanned aircraft. Most software artifacts produced for Tiriba required modifications to be reused in a more complex project, the SARVANT, which has to accommodate several new features that increase the variability of the end products. In the Tiriba project, a methodological approach, named SAFE-CRITES, was defined and used. Special care was taken about software reuse, based on Model Driven Development and automatic code generation. The certification process, based on the DO-178B standard, was also taken into account. ProLiCEs extends SAFE-CRITES to integrate Product Line Engineering into the development process, aiming better software reuse. This extension was done by creating a second parallel path to the process, dealing with the Product Line Domain Engineering. ProLiCES is being currently used in the SARVANT project, which will deliver a much more complex UAV and is estimated to be deployed in two years.", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["2191"]}

White-box frameworks are reusable designs composed of a set of concrete and abstract classes so that the collaboration among these classes provides support for large-scale reuse of design and source code. However, instantiating applications by using this sort of framework is quite complex and demands detailed architectural knowledge. In order to lessen the amount of source code, effort, and expertise required to instantiate applications by using GRENJ framework, we have developed a domain specific language that manages all application instantiation issues systematically. This domain specific language facilitates the application instantiation process by acting as a facade over GRENJ framework as well as providing the user with a more concise, human-readable syntax than Java. In this paper, we contrast the major differences and benefits resulting from instantiating applications solely using GRENJ framework and indirectly reusing its source code by applying our domain specific language.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["2191"]}

The spatial components of allele surfing have been studied by geneticists, but have never been investigate on dynamic and shifting habitats. Here we used an individual-based-model (IBM) to study how interactions between different habitat restoration scenarios and biological characteristics (dispersal capacity) affect the spatial patterns of the genetic structure of a population during demographic expansion. We found that both habitat dynamics and dispersal capacity, as well as their interaction, were the drivers of emergent pattern of genetic diversity and allele surfing. Specifically, allele surfing is more common when a species with low dispersal capacity colonizes a large geographic area with slow restoration (low carrying capacity). Despite this, we showed that allele surfing can be reduced, or even avoided, by dispersal management through suitable habitat restoration. Thus, investigating how colonization generates a spatial variation in genetic diversity, and which parameters control the emergent genetic pattern, are essential steps to planning assisted gene flow, which is fundamental for an effective planning of habitat restoration.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["2191"]}

In addition, it avoids the introduction of coding errors by human programmers, since the critical code will be built automatically through models transformation. From another perspective, Embedded Systems Development can benefit from Software Engineering techniques like Product Lines to reduce costs and time-to-market.

From this optimization the relationships between the stored energy of the system and the volume of the reservoir of each plant are extracted. These relationships are represented in the consequent parameters of the fuzzy linguistic rules. Thus, PBFIS is used to estimate the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["2191"]}

{"title": "An energetic operation policy using Fuzzy Controllers for maximization of benefits in the brazilian hydrothermal power system\n", "abstract": " This paper aims to determine an energetic operation policy (EOP) for hydrothermal power systems. In order to determine the EOP, the optimal solution of a deterministic hydrothermal scheduling model was utilized. The EOP was calculated to follow the trajectories obtained by the optimization model. The resulting trajectories were parameterized in terms of the system total energy storage. Using the system energy storage, it is possible to obtain, for each reservoir, the set of points from which a curve can be adjusted using the Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Controller. The EOP proposed through the Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Controller is used in simulation models to allow comparisons with the adopted EOP in practice in Brazil (parallel policy). As it will be shown in this paper, the proposed EOP using fuzzy controllers maximizes the hydroelectric generation and, as consequence, minimizes the thermoelectric generation cost in the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["2191"]}

{"title": "An approach for reusing software process elements based on reusable asset specification: a software product line case study\n", "abstract": " Software reuse is becoming an important focus of both academic and industrial research since the rising demand for new software products and technologies is constantly growing. The short time to market, limited resources and lack of specialists are the main reasons for this investment on software reuse. As long as customers demand speed to deliver, there is a increasing special concern about software quality. In this context, we propose an approach to support both better time to market and software quality from reusing software process elements using the Reusable Asset Specification (RAS). This approach presents a mapping structure to represent process elements as reusable assets. The sharing of process elements among several projects aims to decrease time spent on defining the process model, as well as reducing the space used to store processes and their elements. Documenting these processes will also be facilitated, since it is possible to reuse a whole process or process\u2019s sub-trees that have already been documented or even certified.

Also, for each pattern, Peony suggests test requirements for assisting the validation of applications under development.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2191"]}

{"title": "The Role of Pattern Languages in the Instantiation of White-Box Object-oriented Frameworks\n", "abstract": " In this paper we propose the use of pattern languages to guide a framework instantiation. Both the framework and the pattern language refer to the same domain, and the framework must have been constructed based on the pattern language. The framework instantiation here proposed is done in several steps: analysis of the specific application, mapping between the application and the framework, implementation of the application classes, and test of the final application. All these activities are supported by the pattern language. This makes it easier for the developer to instantiate applications, as the knowledge about the pattern language is used during the instantiation process. The proposed approach is illustrated with the example of a framework we have built based on a pattern language.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2191"]}
{"title": "A Framework based on a Pattern Language for Business Resource Management\n", "abstract": " A framework based on a pattern language for Business Resource Management is under construction to be used for developing systems in the information systems domain. Business resources include assets and services, as products and repairs. By management we mean their trade, rental and maintenance. A pattern language has been developed for aiding in the analysis of systems for business resource management. It includes fourteen patterns for identifying the resource, quantifying it, renting, trading and maintaining it, reserve it, quote the trade, quote the maintenance, check its delivery, allowing several items to be dealt with in the same transaction, paying for the transaction, identifying the transaction executor, and identifying maintenance tasks and parts. One of the patterns is included, corresponding to trading the resource. A class model shows its structure (classes and relationships), and an application example shows the roles played by each participant class. An example of the pattern language usage for a car repair shop system is presented, together with an object model that shows the patterns used and the roles played by their participant classes. The present development stage of the framework is mentioned.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2191"]}
{"title": "Legacy Systems Reengineering Using Software Patterns\n", "abstract": " In this work we present a case study for legacy systems reengineering using software patterns aiming at both easing the reengineering process and improving future maintenance. The approach used consists basically of three steps: apply reverse engineering, if necessary, to obtain an object model of the system; recognize software patterns present in the object model obtained; and reimplement the system in a more productive way, using toolkits or specific frameworks that implement the patterns found. Results of some experiments show that reengineering has been facilitated as well as system maintenance, because components became clearly delimited and larger chunks of design may now be understood as a whole and reused.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2191"]}
{"title": "A pattern language-based approach for framework construction and instantiation\n", "abstract": " Software patterns and pattern languages emerged aiming at reuse, but in higher abstraction levels than object-oriented software frameworks. Software patterns try to capture the experience acquired during software development and synthesize it in a problem/solution form [1, 4]. A pattern language is a structured collection of patterns that build on each other to transform needs and constraints into an architecture. It represents the temporal sequence of decisions that lead to the complete design of an application, so it becomes a method to guide the development process [3]. There are a few methods for framework development, of which we can mention the hot-spot driven framework development [5] and the framework design by systematic generalization [6, 7]. Framework hot spots are the parts that have to be kept flexible, as they are specific of individual systems. They are designed to be generic and need to be adapted according to the requirements of each application that can be instantiated using the framework. Generally they are discovered first by domain analysis and then by successive framework refinements. However, each new discovery may imply in the need to redesign part of the framework, which makes development more complex. The best approach is to know beforehand which are the framework hot spots, in order to minimize the number of iterations needed for its construction.Pattern languages reflect experience in specific domains, covering all their main aspects. Consequently, they have built-in information about the points that differ from one application to another.
