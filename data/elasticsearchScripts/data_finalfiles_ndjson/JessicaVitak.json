While prior research has shown that these extensions suffer from several usability issues, we know little about real world blocking extension use, why users choose to adopt these extensions, and how effectively these extensions protect users against online tracking. To study these questions, we conducted two online surveys examining both users and non-users of blocking extensions. We have three main findings. First, we show both users and non-users of these extensions only possess a basic understanding of online tracking, and that participants' mental models only weakly relate with their behavior to adopt these extensions. Second, we find that each type of blocking extension has a specific primary use associated with it. Finally, we find that users report that extensions only rarely break websites. However when websites break, users only disable their extensions if they trust and are familiar with the website. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for designing better protections against online tracking and outline directions for future work.", "num_citations": "38\n", "authors": ["1199"]}

But do \"old-fashioned\" ways of developing and maintaining relationships suffer from the evolution of computer-mediated communication? Have we become too reliant on the instantaneous, answer-producing quality of the internet that can reveal others' most intimate personal details before we even introduce ourselves? This thesis examines social relationships online to see how they differ from traditional offline relationships, focusing on how people create an online identity and how that identity affects the formation and maintenance of \"friendships\" in the digital world. The thesis will then consider how the social networking site Facebook impacts relationships in the real world.

First, through exploratory factor analysis, it establishes a set of Facebook relationship maintenance strategies that reflect existing theory and measures while accounting for the affordances of social media. Next, through nested OLS regressions, it tests whether engagement in these strategies with a randomly selected Facebook Friend predicts three relational outcomes: relational closeness, relational satisfaction, and access to social provisions. Third, it tests whether engagement in these strategies is associated with perceptions that using Facebook positively impacts their perceived relational closeness and relational stability with that Friend, while controlling for existing levels of relational closeness. Findings indicate main effects for all four relationship maintenance strategies on perceptions of Facebook\u2019s impact on relational closeness and relational stability, as well as interaction effects between existing relational closeness and multiple strategies in predicting these two outcomes, such that\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "32\n", "authors": ["1199"]}

{"title": "Personal Relationships and Technology in the Digital Age\n", "abstract": " \u201cThere is never going to be a substitute for face-to-face communication, but we have seen since the alphabet, to the telephone and now the internet, that whenever people find a new way to communicate they will flock to it.\u201d\u2013Howard Rheingold, 2006The twenty-first century has seen an acceleration in the speed, reach, and persistence of new communication technologies, highlighted by three parallel developments: the increasing availability of broadband and wireless Internet connectivity, the emergence of social media as a new platform to enact relational communication practices, and the increasing ubiquity of mobile technologies. These technologies have dramatically shifted how\u2013and when\u2013we think about work and play, but perhaps more importantly, they have changed how we think about and manage our relationships with friends, family, coworkers, romantic partners, and acquaintances.

{"title": "Qualitative approaches to cybersecurity research\n", "abstract": " Although billions of dollars are spent each year securing network infrastructure, devices, and resources against threats, the impact of cybersecurity arrangements on individuals remains largely unexamined. Unless cybersecurity technologies, policies, and processes are built with people, and their diversity, in mind, the needs of wide swaths of society\u2014including children and teens, the elderly, women, low-income families, and people with disabilities\u2014are unlikely to be addressed. Though many methods are important for investigating motivations, practices, and affect, qualitative methods are particularly necessary for nuanced ways of knowing about these phenomena. But qualitative research constitutes just a fraction of cybersecurity research. This fishbowl session will focus on research to enable usable, livable, and inclusive cybersecurity by exploring qualitative ways of knowing in cybersecurity research.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1199"]}
{"title": "Strengthening children\u2019s privacy literacy through contextual integrity\n", "abstract": " Researchers and policymakers advocate teaching children about digital privacy, but privacy literacy has not been theorized for children. Drawing on interviews with 30 families, including 40 children, we analyze children\u2019s perspectives on password management in three contexts\u2014family life, friendship, and education\u2014and develop a new approach to privacy literacy grounded in Nissenbaum\u2019s contextual integrity framework. Contextual integrity equates privacy with appropriate flows of information, and we show how children\u2019s perceptions of the appropriateness of disclosing a password varied across contexts. We explain why privacy literacy should focus on norms rather than rules and discuss how adults can use learning moments to strengthen children\u2019s privacy literacy. We argue that equipping children to make privacy-related decisions serves them better than instructing them to follow privacy-related rules.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1199"]}
{"title": "Conceptualizing socially mediated visibility\n", "abstract": " Communication researchers are increasingly turning to work on affordances to help predict and explain a variety of interactions on social media platforms. An affordance framework is especially useful for research unpacking the relationship between actors (the users), objects (features), and outcomes of use. In this paper, we extend research on visibility\u2014a root affordance\u2014to account for the unique aspects of social media and masspersonal communication, as well as research being conducted in disciplines outside communication. We synthesize the conceptual trajectory of visibility, then introduce a more focused conceptualization to describe socially mediated visibility (SMV), which we define according to the exposure content receives, the lack of spatiotemporal constraints, and facilitation via masspersonal ties. We conclude by applying three dimensions of visibility (relational, strategic, outcome-based) to SMV\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1199"]}
{"title": "Measuring Americans\u2019 comfort with research uses of their social media data\n", "abstract": " Research using online datasets from social media platforms continues to grow in prominence, but recent research suggests that platform users are sometimes uncomfortable with the ways their posts and content are used in research studies. While previous research has suggested that a variety of contextual variables may influence this discomfort, such factors have yet to be isolated and compared. In this article, we present results from a factorial vignette survey of American Facebook users. Findings reveal that researcher domain, content type, purpose of data use, and awareness of data collection all impact respondents\u2019 comfort\u2014measured via judgments of acceptability and concern\u2014with diverse data uses. We provide guidance to researchers and ethics review boards about the ways that user reactions to research uses of their data can serve as a cue for identifying sensitive data types and uses.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1199"]}
{"title": "Academic Caregivers on Organizational and Community Resilience in Academia (Fuck Individual Resilience)\n", "abstract": " Crises, whether society-wide or personal, are endemic to the human condition. Yet academia and its associated institutions persist in having insufficient scaffolding to support its members during periods of crisis. No one knows this more acutely than academic caregivers of children, elders, disabled adults, and other loved ones with special needs. Academic caregivers are disproportionately women, and the COVID-19 pandemic brought to light our precarious position and the lack of structural and institutional responses to cope with crises. Academia is decades behind other sectors in family leave and accommodation policies, and caregivers are suffering the consequences. In this article, we outline recommendations for shifting away from individual approaches to resilience, instead building organizational and community resilience in academia. Our focus is on caregivers in academic teaching and research roles\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1199"]}
{"title": "\"Our Hearts Go Out\": Social Support and Gratitude after Disaster\n", "abstract": " Disasters have devastating effects on communities, which struggle to recover without sufficient social support. This exploratory study uses Twitter as a lens for examining gratitude for support provisions in the aftermath of disasters. Gratitude for support is examined in the context of two major disasters in the United States, the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School and a May 2011 tornado that devastated Alabama. Analyzing tweets from these communities after each disaster, we identified and described six categories of support exchanged through Twitter. We found distinct difference in expressions of gratitude for different types of social support in these two communities. While some of these differences could be expected based on the nature of the disaster, others were less predictable. These findings suggest that social media has value as a window into real-time community behaviors relating to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1199"]}
{"title": "Feature creep or just plain creepy? How advances in \u201csmart\u201d technologies affect attitudes toward data privacy\n", "abstract": " Smart home technologies on our phones and in our homes are collecting more (quantity) and more (types of) data about us. These tools are intended to simplify everyday tasks, but to do so effectively, they collect significant data about users and their environment. One popular example includes intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) like Apple\u2019s Siri, Amazon\u2019s Alexa, and Google\u2019s Assistant. As these services have transitioned from being embedded in consumers\u2019 smartphones to standalone devices in the home, they have evolved to collect and share more data in more potentially invasive ways. In this paper, we consider American adults\u2019 attitudes toward IPAs. Through an analysis of focus groups with IPA users and non-users, we describe attitudes and concerns toward IPAs broadly, as well as how these attitudes vary based on the devices\u2019 features. We suggest new frameworks for evaluating privacy-based decisions and offer policy suggestions for regulating data flows from smart technologies.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1199"]}
