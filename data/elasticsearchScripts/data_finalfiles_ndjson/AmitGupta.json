{"title": "Ferromagnetism above room temperature in bulk and transparent thin films of Mn-doped ZnO\n", "abstract": " The search for ferromagnetism above room temperature in dilute magnetic semiconductors has been intense in recent years. We report the first observations of ferromagnetism above room temperature for dilute (< 4 at.%) Mn-doped ZnO. The Mn is found to carry an average magnetic moment of 0.16 \u03bc B per ion. Our ab initio calculations find a valance state of Mn 2+ and that the magnetic moments are ordered ferromagnetically, consistent with the experimental findings. We have obtained room-temperature ferromagnetic ordering in bulk pellets, in transparent films 2\u20133 \u03bcm thick, and in the powder form of the same material. The unique feature of our sample preparation was the low-temperature processing. When standard high-temperature (T> 700 C) methods were used, samples were found to exhibit clustering and were not ferromagnetic at room temperature.

Because the signaling pathways activated by several tyrosine kinase receptors have been shown to be involved in lung fibrosis, it has been suggested that the inhibition of these receptors may slow the progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.   Methods In a 12-month, phase 2 trial, we assessed the efficacy and safety of four different oral doses of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor BIBF 1120 as compared with placebo in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The primary end point was the annual rate of decline in forced vital capacity (FVC).

Our proposed method is based on a combination of deep generative models (VAE) with sequence-to-sequence models (LSTM) to generate paraphrases, given an input sentence. Traditional VAEs when combined with recurrent neural networks can generate free text but they are not suitable for paraphrase generation for a given sentence. We address this problem by conditioning the both, encoder and decoder sides of VAE, on the original sentence, so that it can generate the given sentence's paraphrases. Unlike most existing models, our model is simple, modular and can generate multiple paraphrases, for a given sentence. Quantitative evaluation of the proposed method on a benchmark paraphrase dataset demonstrates its efficacy, and its performance improvement over the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin, whereas qualitative human evaluation indicate that the generated paraphrases are well-formed, grammatically correct, and are relevant to the input sentence. Furthermore, we evaluate our method on a newly released question paraphrase dataset, and establish a new baseline for future research.", "num_citations": "169\n", "authors": ["444"]}

Using a large sample of criminal cases in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, we analyze the consequences of the money bail system by exploiting the variation in bail-setting tendencies among randomly assigned bail judges. Our estimates suggest that the assignment of money bail leads to a 12 percent increase in the likelihood of conviction and a 6\u20139 percent increase in recidivism.

The reactive approach allows controller applications to make dynamic decisions about incoming traffic, but performs worse than the proactive one due to the controller involvement. To support dynamic applications with better performance, we propose FAST (Flow-level State Transitions) as a new switch primitive for software-defined networks. With FAST, the controller simply preinstalls a state machine and switches can automatically record flow state transitions by matching incoming packets to installed filters. FAST can support a variety of dynamic applications, and can be readily implemented with today's commodity switch components and software switches.", "num_citations": "152\n", "authors": ["444"]}

One tin atom is six coordinate, and the other is seven coordinate by virtue of weak but significant intramolecular interactions. The two tin atom environments are best described as being based on distorted octahedral and pentagonal bipyramidal geometries, respectively.

Over the last decade considerable progress has been made in white biotechnology research, and further major scientific and technological breakthroughs are expected in the future. Fungi are ubiquitous in nature and have been sorted out from different habitats, including extreme environments (high temperature, low temperature, salinity and pH), and may be associated with plants (epiphytic, endophytic and rhizospheric). The fungal strains are beneficial as well as harmful for human beings. The beneficial fungal strains may play important roles in the agricultural, industrial, and medical sectors. The fungal strains and their products (enzymes, bioactive compounds, and secondary metabolites) are very useful for industry (eg, the discovery of penicillin from Penicillium chrysogenum). This discovery was a milestone in the development of white biotechnology as the industrial production of penicillin and antibiotics using fungi moved industrial biotechnology into the modern era, transforming it into a global industrial technology. Since then, white biotechnology has steadily developed and now plays a key role in several industrial sectors, providing both high value nutraceutical and pharmaceutical products.

It plays a very important role in establishing human computer interface. We as humans are able to understand the emotions of other person but it is literally impossible for the computer to do so. The present work is to achieve the same as accurately as possible. Emotion detection can be done either through text, speech, facial expression or gesture. In the present work the emotions are detected using Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. EEG records the electrical activity within the neurons of the brain. The main advantage of using EEG signals is that it detects real emotions arising straight from our mind and ignores external features like facial expressions or gesture. Hence EEG can act as real indicator of the emotion depicted by the subject.

Selective IgM deficiency is defined as serum IgM levels below two standard deviation of mean with normal serum IgG and IgA. It appears to be more common than originally realized. Selective IgM deficiency is observed in both children and adults. Patients with SIGMD may be asymptomatic; however, approximately 80% of patients with SIGMD present with infections with bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoan. There is an increased frequency of allergic and autoimmune diseases in SIGMD. A number of B cell subset abnormalities have been reported, and impaired specific antibody responses to Streptococcus pneumoniae responses are observed in more than 65% of cases. Innate immunity, T cells, T cell subsets, and T cell functions are essentially normal. The pathogenesis of SIGMD remains unclear. Mice selectively deficient in secreted IgM are also unable to control infections from bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens, and develop autoimmunity.

Computational approach, especially reverse vaccinology (RV) method has enormous potential for identification of protein vaccine candidates (PVCs) from a proteome. The existing protective antigen prediction software and web servers have low prediction accuracy leading to limited applications for vaccine development. Besides machine learning techniques, those software and web servers have considered only protein\u2019s adhesin-likeliness as criterion for identification of PVCs. Several non-adhesin functional classes of proteins involved in host-pathogen interactions and pathogenesis are known to provide protection against bacterial infections. Therefore, knowledge of bacterial pathogenesis has potential to identify PVCs. A web server, Jenner-Predict, has been developed for prediction of PVCs from proteomes of bacterial pathogens. The web server targets host-pathogen interactions and pathogenesis by considering known functional domains from protein classes such as adhesin, virulence, invasin, porin, flagellin, colonization, toxin, choline-binding, penicillin-binding, transferring-binding, fibronectin-binding and solute-binding. It predicts non-cytosolic proteins containing above domains as PVCs. It also provides vaccine potential of PVCs in terms of their possible immunogenicity by comparing with experimentally known IEDB epitopes, absence of autoimmunity and conservation in different strains.

Lett. 102, 104101 (2009)]: namely, when a bistable system is driven by two inputs it consistently yields a response mirroring a logic function of the two inputs in an optimal window of moderate noise. Here we examine the intriguing possibility of obtaining dynamical behavior equivalent to LSR in a noise-free bistable system, subjected only to periodic forcing, such as sinusoidal driving or rectangular pulse trains. We find that such a system, despite having no stochastic influence, also yields phenomena analogous to LSR, in an appropriate window of frequency and amplitude of the periodic forcing.

{"title": "Oestrogen-dependent regulation of miRNA biogenesis: many ways to skin the cat\n", "abstract": " The steroid hormone oestrogen is central to normal female physiology, reproduction and behaviour, through its effects on cellular processes including cell proliferation and cell survival. The effects of oestrogen are mediated by nuclear ERs (oestrogen receptors). ER status is important for the development, progression and treatment of breast cancer. miRNAs (microRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that bind the 3\u2032-UTR (untranslated region) of target mRNAs to reduce their stability and/or translation. miRNAs participate in oestrogen signalling by regulating oestrogen-responsive genes and pathways. Interestingly expression and maturation of miRNAs can also be regulated by ER signalling at multiple levels. In addition to regulating the expression of miRNAs at the transcriptional level, ER appears to be able to regulate the biogenesis of miRNAs.

{"title": "Combinatorial attacks on binarized neural networks\n", "abstract": " Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) have recently attracted significant interest due to their computational efficiency. Concurrently, it has been shown that neural networks may be overly sensitive to \"attacks\" - tiny adversarial changes in the input - which may be detrimental to their use in safety-critical domains. Designing attack algorithms that effectively fool trained models is a key step towards learning robust neural networks. The discrete, non-differentiable nature of BNNs, which distinguishes them from their full-precision counterparts, poses a challenge to gradient-based attacks. In this work, we study the problem of attacking a BNN through the lens of combinatorial and integer optimization. We propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation of the problem. While exact and flexible, the MILP quickly becomes intractable as the network and perturbation space grow. To address this issue, we propose IProp, a decomposition-based algorithm that solves a sequence of much smaller MILP problems. Experimentally, we evaluate both proposed methods against the standard gradient-based attack (FGSM) on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, and show that IProp performs favorably compared to FGSM, while scaling beyond the limits of the MILP.", "num_citations": "30\n", "authors": ["444"]}

{"title": "Seed priming: the aftermath\n", "abstract": " Priming of seeds is a well-established technology to improve speed and uniformity of germination, however at the cost of a reduction in longevity of seeds. Furthermore, priming alone is not able to drastically improve the number of usable plants from a batch of seeds. Pregermination, in combination with selection of seeds showing the earliest germination, can improve the number of usable plants considerably. However, it is not easy to find a suitable separation method for every species. Two major obstacles for practical use of pregerminated seeds are storage of the seeds and finding a way of drilling them. The fluid drilling technique finds some solution to this problem. A breakthrough in the practical application of pregerminated seeds was the development of a method to re-induce desiccation tolerance in seeds after they had germinated. The effects of PEG incubation and Heat Shock are quite promising for both pregerminated seeds as well as primed ones. The role of LEAs, HSPs, sugars, BiP, compatible solutes etc. are important in the re-acquisition of desiccation tolerance. Most biophysical investigations concerning anhydrobiosis in plants have been focused on phenomena in the dried state. Considering that desiccation-sensitive organisms usually die when the water content is still relatively high [eg 0.5\u20132.0 (gH2O)(g dry weight)", "num_citations": "30\n", "authors": ["444"]}

{"title": "Semantic matchmaking algorithms\n", "abstract": " The advantages of loose coupling offered by service oriented architectures (SOA) have made it a popular choice for today\u2019s enterprise systems. The popularity has driven standardization efforts in the areas of service advertisement and invocation and services specified using these standards are termed as Web services. A Web service is self containing, self describing application that can be deployed, published and invoked over the Internet. The publish-find-bind approach is the fundamental idea behind Service Oriented Architectures that web services aim to implement. The ultimate vision of SOA is to enable a client to automatically select an appropriate service from a pool of dynamically discovered services and invoke it without having any apriori knowledge about the service provider and the specifics of the service itself. This vision has thrown up various challenges such as-service discovery based on an abstract query, selection of service from the discovered pool, service composition, dynamic service binding and invocation, quality of service, negotiation of service contracts and trust.Enhancing what has traditionally been sytanctic descriptions of services with semantics is necessary to resolve most of these issues. Once semantic descriptions are available, one needs to deal with matchmaking of these descriptions to a query. In the rest of this chapter we present concepts involved in semantic matchmaking as it applied to web services and a set of algorithms that solve the semantic matchmaking problem.", "num_citations": "28\n", "authors": ["444"]}

In that context, the molecular evolution of myocilin was investigated.Methods: The human myocilin protein was used as query in sequence alignment program and the similar protein sequences were searched in the protein databases for different species. The secondary structure analysis of human myocilin and the prediction of disulfide bonded cysteine residues in the protein were done using PSIPRED and CYSPRED software, respectively. Presence of putative motifs in the protein sequences was determined using the ScanProsite tool with the option of including patterns with the high probability of occurrence.

Distribution of workload across multiple computing resources is known as Load balancing, its main purpose is to achieve high resource utilization and user satisfaction. Therefore, different load balancing algorithms are used in cloud in order to serve the requests from user in efficient manner. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed to balance load on cloud based on arrangement of resources, according to processing speed for virtual machines and then allocating cloudlets to the resources\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["444"]}

This paper proposes a scheme for fingerprint super-resolution using ridge orientation-based clustered coupled sparse dictionaries. The training image patches are clustered into groups based on dominant orientation and corresponding coupled subdictionaries are learned for each low- and high-resolution patch groups. While reconstructing the image, the minimum residue error criterion is used for choosing a subdictionary for a particular patch. In the final step, back projection is applied to eliminate the discrepancy in the estimate due to noise or inaccuracy in sparse representation. The performance evaluation of the proposed method is accomplished in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index.

{"title": "A decision tool for assembly line breakdown action\n", "abstract": " Assembly lines with closed loop parallel lanes have the potential to continue to be productive when individual stations breakdown. A requirement in such parallel lane systems is that the products must exit the parallel lanes in the same sequence as they entered. Such lines offer the opportunity to run the line partially either by shutting down an affected lane or by bypassing the failed station to continue to run on all lanes. Bypassing a station, however, requires a backup station that can pick up the incomplete work at a later stage in the process. However, when a station breakdown occurs, it is not readily obvious as to whether to bypass the affected lane or just the affected station. This decision will vary depending on which station failed and the length of the repair. This paper presents a discrete-event modeling approach to provide a decision-making tool during breakdowns.", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["444"]}

In Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANET), each mobile node acts as a host as well as a router. These nodes communicate to each other by hop-to-hop communication. The dynamic topology of MANET allows nodes to join and leave the network at any point of time. Wireless MANET is particularly vulnerable due to its fundamental characteristics such as open medium, dynamic topology, distributed cooperation and constrained capability. So security in MANET is a complex issue. There are a lot of routing protocol for Ad-hoc network like Ad-hoc On Demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV), Dynamic Source Routing (DSR), Destination Sequence Distance Vector Routing (DSDV) and Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm. AODV is an on-demand reactive routing protocol for mobile ad hoc networks. But in existing AODV, there is no security provision against a well-known \u201cBlack Hole\u201d attack.

{"title": "Teacher-student interactions in a technology-supported science classroom environment in relation to selected learner outcomes: An Indian study\n", "abstract": " The ultimate goal of teaching is to assist students to become independent and self-regulated learners capable of taking their own decisions. During this process the teacher has to perform many roles with main focus on communication with students. Thus teaching and learning can be considered a communication process. This communication process depends on the effectiveness of interpersonal behaviour of the students and teachers. In the modern educational scenario, technology is playing an important role not only in helping to establish this communication but also to enrich it. This study reports the use of Questionnaire on Teacher Interaction (QTI) for assessing the students\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 perceptions of their teachers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 interpersonal behaviour in a technology-supported science classroom environment in an Indian school.

A Bitmap Index (BI) allows fast access to individual attribute values that are needed to answer a query by representing the values of an attribute for all tuples separately, as bit strings. A Property Map (PMap) is a multidimensional indexing technique that pre-computes attribute expressions, called properties, for each tuple and stores the results as bit strings [DD97, LD02]. This paper compares the performance of the PMap and the Range-Encoded Bit-Sliced Index (REBSI)[CI98] using cost models to simulate their storage and query processing costs for different kinds of queries over a benchmark schema.

These phase diagrams are also predicted using binary interaction parameters obtained from the regression of binarydata alone using the UNIQUAC model and regular solution theory. It is observed that, byusing binary parameters and UNIQUAC equations for multicomponent mixtures, one can predict the saturation curve for naphthalene within 7% and the saturation curve for biphenyl within 4% for the cis-decalin-naphthalene-biphenyl system. For the tetralin-biphenyl-dibenzofuran system, the saturation curve could be predicted within 4% for biphenyl and within 6% for dibenzofuran.

Recently we reported on the synthesis and magnetic properties of Gd-substituted Mn-Zn ferrite nanoparticles as potentially suitable for magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH). In MFH the specific power absorption rate is related to the lossy magnetocrystalline anisotropic properties of the magnetic fluids. In this paper we report the role of Ho substitution in magnetite nanoparticles, which is found to enhance the KV product arising from the large anisotropy of Ho3+ moments. The zero-field-cooled magnetization data is then simulated by assuming noninteracting magnetic particles with uniaxial anisotropy and lognormal particle size distribution.

{"title": "A pole-radius-varying IIR notch filter with enhanced post-transient performance\n", "abstract": " In many applications of notch filters, high quality factor and short transient duration are simultaneously desired. Being contradictory in nature these two requirements pose design challenges. This paper presents an innovative application of a hyperbolic tangent sigmoid (HTS) function to vary the time-varying pole-radius (TVPR) of the pole-zero-constrained (PZC) IIR notch filter to optimally attain these two requirements together. Application of HTS function has allowed the pole-radius to maintain its desired minimum value during the initial phase of filtering, leading to faster transient suppression. This is followed by a steep rise in the pole-radius which allowed the notch filter to attain its desired quality factor soon after the transient suppression was achieved. Therefore, prime emphasis of the proposed notch filter design approach is on the significant reduction of the duration during which pole-radius makes a transition\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["444"]}

The N-point discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a real sequence can be implemented via the real (cos DFT) and imaginary (sin DFT) components. The N-point cos DFT in turn can be developed from N/2-point cos DFT and N/4-point discrete sine transform (DST). Similarly, the N-point sin DFT can be developed from N2-point sin DFT and N/4-point DST.

Images obtained from atomic force microscopy are examined using dimensional fractal analysis, and surface diffusion lengths of growth precursors are estimated from the measured correlation lengths. The addition of small amounts of hydrogen (H2/SiH4 ratios <10/1) during deposition leads to a decrease in the diffusion length, but larger hydrogen dilutions result in increased diffusion length. Moreover, the measured surface diffusion activation barrier is reduced from 0.20 eV for deposition from pure SiH4 to 0.13 eV with high hydrogen dilution. Results are consistent with recent models for precursor surface transport during low-temperature deposition, and give insight into critical processes for low-temperature silicon crystallization.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["444"]}

{"title": "Identification of health risk factors among undergraduate university students\n", "abstract": " Health Hazard Appraisal (HHA), also described as Health Risk Appraisal (HRA), is a method of estimating an individual's chance of becoming ill or dying from selected deseases within a defined period of time, usually 10 years, based on the individual's given set of characteristics. The individual's health behaviours and characteristics are compared to mortality statistis and epidemiological data. The primary purpose of HHA is to help the individual become aware of his or her own identifiable health risk factors that may lead to illness or premature death. Neff and Landrum (1983) have found that the act of administering part of a questionnaire on alcohol use significantly reduced recidivism in a sample of drinking drivers. These two researchers suggest that simply completing the questionnaire may force people to make negative conclusions about their own actions, and may promote a private, voluntary decision to change (p. 4). Thus, HHA may also be considered to be an assessment and health education tool, designed to motivate individuals to change personal lifestyle and habits that are considered risky to their life and health.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["444"]}

No information on the mutation in the ATP7B gene and haplotypes using linked markers is available for WD patients in India. Hence, the present study was undertaken to identify, by a PCR-based molecular diagnostic test, presymptomatic siblings of WD affected individuals in families with multiple offspring. Methods: Genomic DNA was prepared from the peripheral blood of the patients, siblings and his/her first degree relatives. The repeat-markers flanking WD locus were amplified by PCR using fluorescent labeled primers. Amplified DNA fragments were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in ABI 377 DNA sequencing system. Genotypes of the samples were determined using Genescan software. Haplotypes were determined based on segregation of the alleles in the families under study. Results: Among 15 WD affected families with multiple children, 4 cases were identified where younger siblings shared same genotype as the patient at all three markers analyzed. Further, eight different haplotypes were detected in the four patients. Interpretation & Conclusion: The siblings of the WD patients carrying the same genotype at the markers linked to WD locus were presymptomatically diagnosed individuals.

The influence of SH on electrical parameter degradation due to hot-carriers is shown as an important metric for accurate device reliability analysis. The relative contribution of bulk and interface traps is determined to identify the dominant mechanism responsible for HCD for different device geometries.

For such applications, identifying the arrival times of the extensional and flexural wave modes from acquired signals is a crucial step, and must be performed reliably and potentially on large sets of signals. This article proposes using the wavelet decomposition of a signal to develop a fast, algorithmic and automated approach to estimate the arrival times of the extensional and flexural wave modes. Algorithms are developed that estimate the two arrival times using wavelet decomposition data, and which can be employed to consistently and reliably identify the arrival times from large sets of signals iteratively.

They are widely used as fillers in plastics and coatings to improve material properties such as hardness, tensile strength, abrasion resistance, and thermal stability. In particular, applications with a demand for high transparency require silica particles with a specific size, morphology, and surface coating [1, 2]. Therefore, the synthesis of particles with highly defined particle size, distribution, and morphology is desired. Most of the silica powder is produced by gas-phase processes, most frequently using flame reactors and spray pyrolysis. However, these methods require exact knowledge of the kinetics of precursor decomposition [3, 4], particle formation and particle growth. Tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) as a halide free and inexpensive precursor material is subject to growing interest for particle formation from the gas phase. Various studies have been conducted on the synthesis of silica nanoparticles from the gas phase using different methods. Ahn et al. and Jang have investigated the synthesis of silica nanoparticles from tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) in diffusion flames [5, 6], while Goortani et al. have worked on the synthesis of SiO2 nanoparticles from quartz in a RF plasma reactor [7].

The model categorizes the consumers into two categories viz. innovators and imitators. The model is based on simple assumptions and excludes some real life consumer behavior and market aspects. Further extension of the model results in complex mathematical form or is sometimes not possible to solve. This difficulty can be resolved using an alternative formulation of the model maintaining its flexible structure. In this paper we propose some extensions of the Bass model using the alternative formulation.

UPR is initiated by three transmembrane sensors that activate three signaling pathways which lead to the activation of transcription factors and production of chaperones. The coordinated action of these three pathways attempt to restore homeostasis. However, if the ER homeostasis cannot be restored, it initiates apoptosis.

The characterization of a variety is essential for a plant breeder, seed inspectors, researcher and other clientele to meet their specific needs. In present context, identification of plant varieties of common knowledge is essential for the protection of new plant varieties under the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Right Act (PPV&FRA), 2001. Article 15.3 (b) of the PPV&FR Act states that the new variety must be clearly distinguishable by one or more essential characters from any variety whose existence is a matter of common knowledge at the time of seeking protection. The uniqueness of a variety is to be established by test called DUS (Distinctness, Uniformity and Stability). Therefore, candidate variety is to be compared with all the varieties, whose existence is matter of common knowledge, which is a huge task. This task can be minimized by comparing candidate variety with the most similar variety. Therefore, it is prerequisite to study the essential characters of all the varieties of common knowledge because these characters are explicit and repeatable.

At pH= 7-8, the ligand reacts with the above metal ions and forms the monomeric coordination compounds of the types [ML (MeOH)](8-10)(where M= Zn ll, Cd II, MoO 2 II and UO 2 II),[Zr (OH) 2 L (MeOH) 2](11) and [ML (MeOH) 3](12)(M= Mn II, Co II and Ni II). However, at pH= 7-8, the ligand reacts with Cull ions and forms the dimetallic coordination compound of the type [CuL] 2 (7). At pH= 10-11, LH 2 reacts with the above metal ions and forms the dimetallic coordination compounds of the types [ML (MeOH)] 2 (13-16)[where M= Mu II, Co II, Ni II, Cu II, Zn II, Cu II, Zr (OH) 2 II, MoO 2 II and UO 2 II]. The coordination compounds have been characterized on the basis of elemental analyses, molecular weight, spectral (IR, reflectance, ESR and NMR) studies and the magnetic susceptibility measurements. LH 2 behaves as a monobasic bidentate ON donor, a dibasic tridentate OON donor and a dibasic tetradentate OONO donor ligand in the coordination compounds formed at pH 2-3, 7-8 and 10-11 respectively. In general, the basicity and denticity of LH 2 increase with the increase in pH.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["444"]}

Observed counts (manual or mechanical) of total boardings and total alightings, however, often do not match. This paper proposes a method that adjusts boarding and alighting counts so that their totals match and the cumulative boardings at each stop is greater than the cumulative alightings at that stop. The method considers observed values as approximate numbers, represents them with a range, and seeks the adjusted value within this range. In this fuzzy optimization search process, the range is represented by a fuzzy set of values, and the membership grades of the fuzzy set guide the direction of the search. The process is capable of incorporating knowledge about ridership patterns along the route and the accuracy of individual observed values.

This disease was largely ignored because primary IgM deficiency was considered very rare and often thought to be secondary to other associated disorders [2]. As a result, selective IgM deficiency was not included in the IUIS Classification of Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases until 2017 [3]. Selective IgG deficiency has since been reviewed [4]. It is defined as serum IgM levels 2 standard deviations below the mean for healthy controls and the presence of normal serum IgG and IgA. However, recently, the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) registry has arbitrarily defined selective IgM deficiency as serum IgM level repeatedly below 2 standard deviations of normal with normal levels of serum IgA and IgG and IgG\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["444"]}

Therefore, to extend our understanding of the drivers of breast cancer metastasis, we undertook a line of investigation in this study in which we demonstrate that the transcriptional regulation of CXCL13 is mediated by the reciprocal activity of RelA and Nrf2, while CXCR5 is transcriptionally silenced by CpG island methylation within its promoter. Critically, we show that intra-tumoral CXCL13 and CXCR5 mRNA expression is positively correlated with intra-tumoral RelA expression within the primary tumor of breast cancer (BCa) patients (n\u202f=\u202f98).

Considering the situation in prisons, smoking and tobacco chewing are burning issues related to health deterioration and economic loss that seem to be overlooked by the public health sectors. Aim: To assess prisoners' perception of tobacco use and cessation in Chhatisgarh, India. Materials and Methods: A pre-tested, close ended questionnaire was administered in the form of extensive face to face interviews, to assess perceptions regarding tobacco use and cessation in the central jail of Durg District of Chhattisgarh state, India. Results: Prevalence of tobacco usage amongst the prisoners was found to be 61%. Some 27% reported smoking, 44% used tobacco in the chewable form and 29% indulged in consuming tobacco in both forms ie smoked as well as chewed. Results suggest several recommendations for policy relevance such as provision of a prison dentist, a tobacco cessation counseling program and targeted eradication of oral cancer by educating the prisoners. Conclusions: Health is a fundamental human\" right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental well-being\". This applies to prisoners just as it does to every other human being. The alarming findings in the study suggest the need for dental treatment facilities and tobacco cessation counseling in prisons.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["444"]}

If the network configuration could instead encode different forwarding behavior for different network states a priori, a network controller could automatically alter forwarding behavior when conditions change. To enable this capability, we introduce state-based network policies, which describe how a network\u2019s forwarding behavior should change in response to arbitrary network events. A state-based network policy comprises many tasks, each of which encodes the forwarding behavior for a single network management operation (e.g., intrusion detection) or part of the network (e.g., a sub-organization), and how that behavior should change when network conditions change. Composing these policies produces a network-wide control program that adapts to different operating conditions. We implement state-based network policies in a system called PyResonance and demonstrate with real-world examples and use cases that PyResonance is expressive enough to specify a wide range of network policies and simple enough for many operators to use. Our evaluation based on event traces from the Georgia Tech campus network shows that PyResonance can achieve good performance in operational settings.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["444"]}

The calcium cells in acini contain calcium bound to acid mucopolysaccharides in the form of spherites, whereas the calcium in the calcium distributing cells is unbound, granular and labile. It appears that the latter kind of cell extrudes calcium directly into the blood vessels.

It shows the electrical activity of the heart during polarization and depolarization activity. It is acquired by standard lead arrangement through electrodes pasted on specified locations on the body during ECG test. It is plotted on chart paper and stored in computer for analyzing in the future. Any change in the standard ECG signal leads to heart disease (abnormal). During the acquisition of the ECG datasets different noises involve. These noises hide the important characteristic of the ECG signal that misleads the signal analysis. Therefore, morphological technique is not sufficient for analyzing such types of ECG datasets. Moreover, cost of ECG test is very high. It requires automated ECG signal analysis technique using computerized classification that gives accurate, fast and reliable detection of the disease. Time domain techniques work well in the cleaned signal analysis and Frequency domain techniques are prone to spectral leakage problems. For analyzing ECG signals, Timefrequency analysis (TFA) methods offer simultaneous interpretation of the signal in both time and frequency domain. Among existing TFA techniques, Auto-regressive Time Frequency Analysis (ARTFA) offers good timefrequency resolution. ARTFA were used for finding the coefficients in first step and time-frequency, description in the second step. Coefficients clearly states about the status of the patient heart.

{"title": "Influence of etching and surface functionalization on the optical property of luminescing phosphorus doped silicon nanoparticles\n", "abstract": " The continuous trend in electronics and optoelectronics to reduce device sizes down to nanometer scales has led to wide ranging scientific interest in nanoparticles of all kinds of materials during the last few years. Especially, the discovery of visible photoluminescence (PL) from silicon nanoparticles (Si-NPs) by Canham [1] has attracted a great deal of attention as it renews the hope to integrate light-emitting devices based on silicon with the well-established microelectronics technology. As a prerequisite, the combination of microelectronics and nanoparticles requires functional structures that are based on p-and n-doped materials. The promise of nanomaterials as a technological material, for applications including wavelength tunable lasers [2], bioimaging [3], and solar cells [4], may ultimately depend on tailoring their behavior through doping. For this reason, researchers have begun dope films containing Si-NPs as well as freestanding nanoparticles and explored how dopants can influence semiconducting nanomaterials. For example, doping of phosphorus (P) atoms into Si-NPs has been achieved by co-sputtering of silicon and phosphosilicate glasses [5], by pulse injection of PH3 during the formation of Si-NPs from SiH4 on thermally grown SiO2 [6], and by non-thermal plasma synthesis by use of diborane and phosphine [7]. Doping of boron (B) into Si-NPs is reported to deteriorate their PL properties. The quenching of PL intensity was observed with increasing doping level of B atoms into Si-NPs due to Auger recombination of excitons [5]. Whereas the P doping into Si-NPs enhances their PL intensity by quenching the defect related\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["444"]}

{"title": "Hybrid hierarchical clustering: Forming a tree from multiple views\n", "abstract": " We propose an algorithm for forming a hierarchical clustering when multiple views of the data are available. Different views of the data may have different underlying distance measures which suggest different clusterings. In such cases, combining the views to get a good clustering of the data becomes a challenging task. We allow these different underlying distance measures to be arbitrary Bregman divergences (which includes squared-Euclidean and KL distance). We start by extending the average-linkage method of agglomerative hierarchical clustering (Ward\u2019s method) to accommodate arbitrary Bregman distances. We then propose a method to combine multiple views, represented by different distance measures, into a single hierarchical clustering. For each binary split in this tree, we consider the various views (each of which suggests a clustering), and choose the one which gives the most significant reduction in cost. This method of interleaving the different views seems to work better than simply taking a linear combination of the distance measures, or concatenating the feature vectors of different views.

To estimate the signal coverage and to achieve a high data rates, it is very important to illustrate the radio channel through important parameters and with the help of a mathematical model. In this paper we have evaluated the cell coverage area for Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology at 1800 MHz (FDD-LTE) theoretically for different transmitting antenna heights and at different transmitting power levels. This coverage area is then compared with the practical measured coverage area ie practical measured path loss.

To screen the entire gene one has to undertake amplification and sequencing strategy encompassing 24-26 exonic regions including intron-exon boundaries 4, 5.

To compare the diagnostic performance of urine microscopy, leucocyte esterase and nitrite dipstick tests and various combinations of these as screening tests for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy.Methods. Pregnant women (N= 800) attending an antenatal clinic were recruited at their first visit. Urine microscopy, culture and dipstick testing were performed on a random clean-catch midstream urine sample. A count of> 105 colony-forming units of a single organism per millilitre of urine was taken as significant. Dipstick results were read as positive according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.Results. A total of 800 eligible women were screened. The prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria as diagnosed by urine culture was 5.0%(n= 40). Escherichia coli was the most prevalent uropathogen isolated by culture (60.0%). Neither urine microscopy nor the leucocyte test was found to be sufficiently sensitive to be used as a single screening test for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant patients. The nitrite test alone had a sensitivity of 82.5% and a specificity of 99.9%. Combined dipstick testing had an improved sensitivity of 87.3% and a specificity of 96.2%. Addition of urine microscopy to combined dipstick testing increased the sensitivity to 95.0%, and the specificity became 92.4%.Conclusion. Combined dipstick testing is a useful screening test for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy.

In this paper best location of UPFC (Unified Power Flow Controller) is obtained both for static and transient voltage stability enhancement of an IEEE 14 bus power system. The simulation is done on PSAT (Power System Analysis Tool-box) in MATLAB and optimal location is found out by Continuation Power Flow (CPF), VCPI (Voltage Collapse Proximity Index) and Fast voltage Stability Index (FVSI). The bus having lowest voltage is the critical bus and the line having largest value of index for maximum permissible load with respect to a bus is the most critical line referred to that bus. It is found that by properly placing UPFC loadability margin of the system has been increased considerably leading to improvement of voltage stability and stability index value decreases at each reactive load with the insertion of the device at right place. Transient stability analysis is also done for an IEEE 14 bus system with a three phase fault created at a bus. It is found from the time domain simulation that proper placement of UPFC increases the transient performance of the system by damping out the power oscillation under large disturbance conditions with less settling time.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["444"]}

This was thought to be a scrotal abscess and was drained. Initially it drained pus but subsequently scrotal sinuses were formed which drained clear urine intermittently. The child was dysmorphic and had features of Downs\u2019 syndrome. He was well hydrated and the bladder was not palpable at the time of examination. The parents felt that the child had normal urinary stream. There was no history of antenatal oligohydramnios. Biochemical renal functions were normal. Ultrasound examination of the urinary tract did not reveal any abnormality. Micturating cystourethrogram showed a dilated posterior urethra suggestive of posterior urethral valves.

{"title": "Trip attraction rates of shopping centers in Northern New Castle County, Delaware.\n", "abstract": " This report presents the trip attraction rates of the shopping centers in Northern New Castle County in Delaware. The study aims to provide an alternative to ITE Trip Generation Manual (1997) for computing the trip attraction of shopping centers in Delaware. As part of this study, a total of eighteen shopping centers were surveyed, for which the number of vehicles entering and leaving the shopping center in every fifteen minutes interval and the number of people visiting each store in the shopping center along with their movement patterns were measured. Based on the surveyed data and the aerial photographs, two approaches, microscopic and macroscopic, are developed to compute the trip attraction rate. The microscopic approach deals with the relationship between the trip attraction rates of individual stores and the shopping center as a whole. The macroscopic approach relates the trip attraction of the shopping center as a function of the physical features of the shopping center, eg total parking spaces, total floor area, and the number of stores in the shopping center. The study shows that microscopic approach gives a better estimate of trip attraction compared with the macroscopic approach. The proposed models incorporate the factors that have been neglected in ITE Trip Generation Manual. These models should be useful for estimating the traffic volume to/from a new shopping center which, is being planned and to assess the traffic impact of the shopping center on the geometric design of roadways in the surrounding area.

{"title": "High levels of GM1-ganglioside beta-galactosidase in the salivary glands and GM1-like-ganglioside storage in parotids of deficient mice.\n", "abstract": " We have previously demonstrated high levels of GM1-ganglioside beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) in the salivary glands of Swiss-Webster mice (Nowroozi et al., J Craniofac Genet Dev Biol 18: 51, 1998), and suggested that this activity reflects an important role for the lysosome in catabolism of salivary glycoconjugates. Here, we characterized and compared activities of lysosomal glycosidases among the salivary glands, spleen, and muscle of C57BL/6 mice, beta-gal hexosaminidase, and beta-glucuronidase activities are high in all three glands relative to muscle. Enzyme activities in the sublingual gland were substantially higher than in the submandibular and parotid glands. Spleen displays levels of activity that are comparable or higher (for beta-glucuronidase) than those in the salivary glands, whereas muscle displays substantially lower levels of these lysosomal glycosidases. In order to investigate the role of beta-gal in the salivary glands, we further characterized the salivary phenotype of knock-out mice deficient in this enzyme, mimicking human GM1-gangliosidosis. In contrast with the relative levels of beta-gal specific-activity among the salivary glands, only the parotid developed severe, generalized, degenerative histopathological changes in beta-gal-deficient knock-out mice. GM1-like-ganglioside, typically found at high levels only in the nerve tissue, where its exact function is still not clear, was demonstrated in storage vacuoles of the parotid glands of the deficient mice by binding of cholera toxin subunit B. Thus, beta-gal activity observed in the parotid gland most likely reflects its role in GM1-ganglioside catabolism, and this ganglioside\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["444"]}

{"title": "Cancer diagnoses and household debt overhang\n", "abstract": " This paper explores the effects of unanticipated health shocks on financial outcomes. We draw on data linking individual cancer records to administrative data on personal mortgages, bankruptcies, foreclosures, and credit reports. We present three findings: First, cancer diagnoses are financially destabilizing\u2014as measured by defaults, foreclosure, and bankruptcy filing rates\u2014even among households with public or private health insurance. The instability is caused by out of pocket costs arising from work loss, transportation, and incomplete coverage of medical expenditures. Second, cancer diagnoses are destabilizing only for households that have high levels of debt, preventing them from using their assets to smooth consumption. By contrast, individuals with positive equity extract this equity, and appear to use the funds consistent in a manner which leads to additional treatments and longer longevity.

Oxido-reductases are capable of meeting this challenge by utilizing redox active sites, often containing transition metal ions, which facilitate movement and relocation of electrons/protons to create a potential gradient that is used to energize redox reactions. There has been a consistent struggle by researchers to estimate the electron transfer rate constants in physiologically relevant processes. This review provides a brief background on the measurements of electron transfer rates in biological molecules, in particular Cu-containing enzymes, and highlights the recent advances in monitoring these electron transfer events at the single molecule level or better to say, at the individual event level.

{"title": "Economic emission load dispatch using interval differential evolution algorithm\n", "abstract": " Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is a heuristic approach for minimizing nonlinear and non-differentiable continuous space functions (storn, 1997). However, the implementation of DE requires some estimate of the global minimum to be provided, which is difficult for any arbitrary function. Also, the termination with maximum number of iterations does not assure the global minima. Moreover, as the region of global minimum approaches, the convergence of the algorithm is very slow. In order to overcome these drawbacks, we propose here a Modified Differential Evolution algorithm (MDEI) which uses interval analysis (Moore, 1966) in three phases. In the first phase of MDEI, global minimum is roughly estimated with the application of interval arithmetic, which provides the upper and lower bounds of the objective function. In the second phase of MDEI, an interval branch and bound algorithm is used to initialize a potential population. In the third phase, MDEI constructs a mechanism using interval arithmetic (Vrahatis, 1997), which updates the bounds in each generation, and is able to define an efficient termination criterion. When the criterion is fulfilled, the algorithm converges to the global minimum with certainty with a lesser computational effort.The proposed algorithm is applied to economic emission load dispatch (EELD) problem. The purpose of EELD is to obtain the optimal amount of generated power for the fossil based generating unit in the system by simultaneously minimizing the fuel and emission costs (Dhillon, 1993).

The variations of the horizontal displacements and stresses with distance from the fault due to various slipprofiles at the surface have been studied to examine the effect of anisotropy on the deformation.

{"title": "Screening of wheat germplasm against brown and yellow rusts.\n", "abstract": " Brown rust (Puccinia recondita Rob. ex Desm) is prevalent and occurs in varying intensities, practically in all parts of the country wherever wheat is grown. It can cause epidemic in the north as well as the south because the primary source of its infection is located in both the regions. Yellow rust (Puccinia striiformis West), on the other hand, is essentially a problem of the northern hills, north western plain zone and the foot hills of north India. Viewing the seriousness of the problem, wheat germplasm was screened under artificial epiphytotic conditions and the resistant lines were identified.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["444"]}

{"title": "Molecular weight distribution in batch hydrolytic polymerization of caprolactam\n", "abstract": " Nylou-8 is generally manufactured by the hydrolytic polymerization of e-caprolactam. While the kinetics of the polymerization processes have been widely investigated, only one report has been devoted to a study of the molecular weight distribution (MWD) of the resulting polymer. Gupta et al. modeled batch polymerization of caprolactam by integrating balance equations for all polymer molecules having a dp of up to 300 and reported MWD. The equations used were similar to (1)-(9) listed in the next section except that they considered the presence of catalyzing acid and cyclic oligomer formation also. A maximum value for dp has to be assumed to integrate the equations due to their coupled nature, and it was assumed to be 800. However, the procedure employed by these workers is time consuming as it involves integration of 300 coupled nonlinear differential equations. Thus Gupta et al. reported that the calculation took 4 h on a DEC-1090 Computer system to reach a batch time of 16 h. Clearly an alternate less time-consuming procedure is required for simulation of and dynamic studies on the reactor. Such a procedure would be useful in simulating continuous reactors as well. In the present work a less time-consuming method based on the work of Min has been developed to model the batch hydrolytic polymerization of caprolactam.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["444"]}
{"title": "Solving fuzzy bi-criteria fixed charge transportation problem using a new fuzzy algorithm\n", "abstract": " The bi-criteria fixed charge transportation problem is an extension of the classical transportation problem. The bi-criteria fixed charge transportation problem in a crisp environment is, often, not effective in dealing with imprecision or vagueness in the values of the problem parameters. To deal with such situations, it has been proposed that the parameters should be represented as fuzzy numbers. Hence, bi-criteria fixed charge transportation problem in fuzzy environment is considered here. In existing approaches, the programming problems in fuzzy environment are solved by converting them into crisp environment by choosing appropriate membership functions and thus, the solutions are also crisp numbers. However, in this paper, a new algorithm is proposed to solve the above said problem using a linear ranking function, without converting it into crisp environment and the solutions derived are fuzzy numbers. The algorithm is suitably illustrated with a numerical example.\u00a0 Numerical results are compared for both fuzzy and crisp versions of the problem.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["444"]}

{"title": "Labor and welfare impacts of a large-scale livelihoods program: Quasi-experimental evidence from india\n", "abstract": " Improving the livelihoods of poor households and transitioning more women back to the labor force is a major challenge in South Asia. Self-employment promoted through women's groups has often been cited as a promising intervention towards this end. However, the evidence on the impact of such programs on household income and labor outcomes is limited, especially for government programs like the National Rural Livelihoods Mission in India. This study aims to provide empirical evidence on the welfare impacts of an\" intensive approach\" adopted under this program. The data for the study come from 4,316 household surveys in 727 villages. The study uses matching methods with the population and socioeconomic census, as well as an instrumental variable approach to construct a retrospective control group. The analysis finds that the program has been able to achieve its primary objective of improving livelihoods by transitioning more women into work. The program has also expanded access to credit, increased the proportion of savings, and reduced interest rates on credit for rural households. This is the first study to estimate the annual income effects of a government-run rural livelihoods program in India, and it shows significant increases in median income across the sample. The results for 30th, 40th, and 75th percentiles are also large and significant. However, the study did not find significant average treatment effects for income. Contrary to previous studies, this study finds weaker impacts on assets, except for livestock.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["444"]}

Their main and most looked after property is the strength of the material that they are made of. Concrete, as we all know, is an integral material used for construction purposes. The concept of nondestructive testing (NDT) is to obtain material properties of in place specimens without the destruction of neither the specimen nor the structure from which it is taken. However, one problem that has been prevalent within the concrete industry for years is that the true properties of an in-place specimen have never been tested without leaving a certain degree of damage on the structure.. The investigation reported here is to present study of Calibration Graphs for Non Destructive Testing Equipment, the Rebound Hammer and to study the quality of the concrete in existing structures. These Rebound Hammer Test were then used to test the quality of the concrete of the various structural elements (columns & beams) of single storied newly under constructed building of TPO office of MBM Engineering College Jodhpur. The use of this method produces results that lie close to the true values when compared with other methods A correlation between rebound number and strength of concrete structure is established, which can be used as well for strength estimation of concrete structures.

The salient limit of LEACH is energy. Due to this limitation, it seems important to design a confidentiality scheme for WSN so that sensing data can be transmitted to the receiver securely and efficiently and at the same time energy consumed must be minimum. Hence we proposed LEACH_HE in which confidentiality scheme ie homomorphic encryption is added to LEACH protocol. In homomorphic encryption data can be aggregated algebraically without decryption and hence less energy consumption. Simulation results are obtained in terms of three metrics-total energy consumed, amount of data transmitted and number of nodes alive.

Business dynamics and technological innovations have felt organizations to comply with a disparate mix of operating systems, applications and databases. This makes it difficult, time-consuming and costly for IT departments to deliver new applications that integrate heterogeneous technologies. It demands high inter-operability and more flexible and adaptive E governance process management. The inclination is to have systems assembled, from a loosely coupled collection of Web services, which are universal and integrated. This technical area appears to have scope where the Agent Technology can be exploited with significant advantages. With Service Oriented Architecture a decomposable architecture, and associated set of development and IT management disciplines, composed of loosely coupled services communicating via pre-established protocols, these services can be assembled ad-hoc to form customized applications that address a wide variety of business requirements. A conceptual framework is being proposed in the course of agent-based Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) for e-governance.

{"title": "Variable Capacity Absorption Cooling System Performance for Building Application\n", "abstract": " The increasing energy costs and environmental awareness call for a shift towards some interesting energy alternatives preferably the use of renewable energy. The present study investigates the impact of varying cooling capacity and other operating parameters in a single-effect absorption refrigeration system, using the concept of energy and exergy as a building heating/cooling alternative. The solar heat is used as an input to the generator of absorption refrigeration system. The results obtained from investigation revealed that variation in cooling capacity influences coefficient of performance (COP), exergy loss in different components as well as exergy efficiency. The values of COPcooling and COPheating lies in the range of 0.71-0.89 and 1.71-1.89 respectively for variations in cooling capacities ranging from 1 TR to 20 TR at maximum generator temperature of 80oC. However, exergy efficiency of the system lies in the range of 0.32-0.41 for same variation in cooling capacities. It has also been established that an increase in evaporator temperature and at maximum cooling capacity both COPcooling and COPheating shows an increasing trend. The exergy efficiency also shows maximum value at the highest cooling capacity at a particular evaporator temperature which further with an increase in evaporator temperature shows a decreasing trend. The irreversibility behavior in all the components i.e., solution heat exchanger, absorber, generator, evaporator and condenser shows an expected trend with the variation in cooling capacity. Hence, use of the above mentioned system as a heating and/or cooling alternative for buildings is suggested.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["444"]}

Fine sand is found in abundance in Western Rajasthan (India) in which hundreds of kilometers of new roads and highways are being constructed and maintained every year. As per Indian Standard Classification System of soils, the fine sand has nil cohesion. Due to very low compressive strength and high permeability, fine sand is not readily suitable for supporting flexible pavements as sub grade. This study discusses the possibility of stabilization of fine sand using Sanitary Ware Waste as admixture. Present work has been taken up by addition of 4.75 mm sieve passed and 2.36 mm sieve retained Sanitary Ware Waste as admixture. The varying percentage 0%, 2%, 4%, 8% and 12% of sanitary ware waste were mixed with fine sand of different densities 1.50 gm/cc, 1.55 gm/cc and 1.58 gm/cc (MDD). All the California Bearing Ratio Tests were conducted at different mix compositions of sanitary ware waste and fine sand of different dry densities as arrived from Standard Proctor Test. Falling-Head Permeability Tests were also performed on different mix compositions. On the basis of the experiments performed, it is determined that the stabilization of fine sand using sanitary ware waste as admixture improves the strength characteristics of the fine sand so that it becomes usable as a base material for flexible pavement in construction of roads.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["444"]}

The major challenges in such networks are disconnections, high mobility and resource poor environment. For providing data delivery under such constraints we adopt the method of carry and forward in which a vehicle transfers its data to another vehicle if it is moving towards the destination. For optimizing performance in such situations, we can make a probabilistic estimation as to which path the packet should follow when there are multiple options available. One such estimation can be based on road density and the average packet delay on the selected road. The paper focuses on the development of such a model that can act as a solution to reduce the packet delivery delay and improve the data delivery ratio.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["444"]}

Stroke is the clinical designation for a rapidly developing loss of brain function due to an interruption in the blood supply to all or part of the brain. This phenomenon can be caused by thrombosis, embolism, or haemorrhage. Stroke is represented predominantly by ischaemic stroke (80%) in which there is a loss of cerebral blood flow owing to vascular occlusion. The remaining 20% of strokes result from cerebral haemorrhage (1, 2). The incidence of stroke is expected to rise dramatically with the increasing ageing population. The risk of stroke doubles for each decade after age of 55. Stroke is a major factor for late-life dementia that affects more than 40% of population over the age of 80. One in four men will have a disabling stroke by the age of 80 and one in five women by the age of 85. Approximately, 85% of strokes are caused by cerebral infraction and among these patients, 4% have a recurrent stroke and 10% die within first month (3). In the past few years, a large number of compounds that interfere with the biochemical mechanism that, mediate ischaemic brain injury have been demonstrated to be neuroprotective in preclinical models of stroke. However, all those drugs that survived safety profile trials and were studied in phase III clinical trails have so far failed to prove efficacy (4).

In general, finite element (FE) modeling and simulation of a large class of engineering applications require heavy computations that are often repetitive in nature. Any deeper insight into the dependence of the FE solution or its characterization may allow significant reduction of computational efforts. This paper illustrates the possibility of characterization of the time-varying FE solutions for transient field-circuit coupled problems. The characterization leads to a significantly smaller FE model and an improved modeling and simulation scheme for such problems.

The aims of this study were to confirm the bone-imaging properties of 99Tcm-citrate, to identify the variabilities influencing its skeletal uptake, to compare its uptake in bone with that of 99Tcm-MDP and to assess its possible role in bone scintigraphy. Appropriate animal and human studies (n= 45) were conducted. The 3 h lesion-to-bone ratio of 99Tcm-citrate was compared with that of 99Tcm-MDP in more than 150 lesions, including osteoblastic sites (Group A), lesions undergoing treatment or healing (Group B), and degenerative or old healed lesions (Group C). The uptake ratio was classified as concordant (< 20% variation), mildly discordant (20-50% variation) or significantly discordant (> 50% variation). Animal experiments showed most bone uptake of 99Tcm-citrate when prepared at a pH of 6.0-6.5. The two radiopharmaceuticals appeared to compete for bone uptake, suggesting related but different sites of bone accumulation. The 99Tcm-citrate/99Tcm-MDP uptake ratio in Group A was concordant (mean+/-SD= 0.92+/-0.15), while Group C lesions had a significantly lower 99Tcm-citrate/99Tcm-MDP uptake ratio (0.34+/-0.24, P< 0.01). A comparison of Group B lesions showed wide variation in intensity and area of involvement in many lesions (uptake ratio< 0.5 or> 1.5 in 13 of 30 sites). We conclude that 99Tcm-citrate has a different site of bone localization than phosphonates, possibly in the organic matrix.

{"title": "Predicting mortality with the international classification of disease injury severity score using survival risk ratios derived from an Indian trauma population: A cohort study\n", "abstract": " Background Trauma is predicted to become the third leading cause of death in India by 2020, which indicate the need for urgent action. Trauma scores such as the international classification of diseases injury severity score (ICISS) have been used with great success in trauma research and in quality programmes to improve trauma care. To this date no valid trauma score has been developed for the Indian population.   Study design This retrospective cohort study used a dataset of 16047 trauma-patients from four public university hospitals in urban India, which was divided into derivation and validation subsets. All injuries in the dataset were assigned an international classification of disease (ICD) code. Survival Risk Ratios (SRRs), for mortality within 24 hours and 30 days were then calculated for each ICD-code and used to calculate the corresponding ICISS. Score performance was measured using discrimination by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROCC) and calibration by calculating the calibration slope and intercept to plot a calibration curve.   Results Predictions of 30-day mortality showed an AUROCC of 0.618, calibration slope of 0.269 and calibration intercept of 0.071. Estimates of 24-hour mortality consistently showed low AUROCCs and negative calibration slopes.   Conclusions We attempted to derive and validate a version of the ICISS using SRRs calculated from an Indian population. However, the developed ICISS-scores overestimate mortality and implementing these scores in clinical or policy contexts is not recommended. This study, as well as previous reports, suggest that other scoring\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["444"]}

{"title": "Real time video encryption for secure multimedia transfer: a novel approach\n", "abstract": " Advances in digital content transmission have increased in the past few years. Security of multimedia data is an imperative issue because of fast evolution digital data exchanges over an unsecure network. Image and video processing applications are becoming widely used in many domains including industrials, medical imaging, manufacturing, and security systems. Real time image and video processing is a very demanding task as it needs to perform high computations for a big amount of data represented by the video, and the complex operations, which may need to be performed on the video. Currently, video encryption is important to ensure its confidentiality during its transmission on insecure networks or its storage. Many algorithms have been suggested for the purpose of video encryption but, almost all of them have some or the other security flaw. In this paper we propose a novel approach for real time video encryption by using pixel encryption. Pixel encryption is performed by shuffling and manipulating pixel values. The positions of the pixel values are changed according to a random sequence generated. At the receiver end decryption is performed by first de shuffling the pixel values and then performing reverse manipulation of individual pixel values to get the original video file.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["444"]}

{"title": "Secure session key sharing using public key cryptography\n", "abstract": " In distributed systems, entities perform the predefined tasks distributively and have to communicate quite frequently. Confidentiality is the primary security requirement in such systems. There should be some secure mechanism whereby a pair of entities can securely communicate with each other. In most of the applications of distributed systems, computational and communication resources are limited and any such mechanism that ensures security of data under transmission should consider these computational and communicational constraints. Symmetric key cryptography emerges as one of the effective mechanisms to secure the data in distributed systems. The security of a symmetric key mechanism purely depends on the secrecy of the session key. In this paper, we have proposed a protocol for the sharing of session key between communicating entities securely.

The power transmission lines passing through transverse areas within the country as well as worldwide are facing various problems related to environment and pollution. Such an exponential increase in the pollution levels lead to frequent faults in transmission lines which finally lands to permanent breakdown of transmission lines. These breakdowns sometimes may leads to collapse of grid and are also inconvenient to everyone besides interrupting the growth of nation as well as society breakdown. Over the years engineers and scientists have made efforts to meet such threats and to overcome situations rising form the failure of transmission lines the environmental challenges and an increase in pollution levels.

{"title": "Assessment of genetic potential for economically important characters in an inter-varietal cross of tomato: P-4-5-2\u00d7 UC 82-8\n", "abstract": " Processing industry requires fruits that are firm, having thick pericarp, optimum acidity and high total soluble solids (TSS). To combine all these traits into a single genotype, it is imperative to first study gene effects governing the inheritance of such traits. The material for the present investigation comprised of two parents, F1, B1, B2 and F2generations derived from the cross P4-5-2 x UC-82-B. The line P4-5-2 is a locally developed high yielding genotype while UC-82-B is a processing variety introduced from USA. Each of three replications comprised of 17 rows representing one row each of P 1, P2 and F1; four rows of each back cross (B 1 and B2) and six rows of F2. Data on single plant basis were recorded on TSS%(using hand refractometer), pH (using pH indicator papers), number of locules, pericarp thickness (cm), fruit shape index (ratio of polar/equatorial diameter), fruit weight (g) and yield planC1 (kg). Data were analyzed following the procedure of Mather and Jinks [1].

{"title": "Early generation evaluation for yield and yield-related traits in lentil\n", "abstract": " Fifteen F3 bulks along with one check were evaluated in a complete randomized block design with three replications. Harvest index coupled with pods/plant and primary branches were found to be reliable selection criteria in segregating generationsfor increasing yield. In the present study correlations alone were not good criterion of assessing the potentiality of crosses in early generations. However, promising crosses could be identify in early segregating generations only on the basis of combination of characters. Crosses involving Precoz sel. as one of the parents were promising. Study also reveals that the harvest index and pods/plant in conjuction with the secondary branches are helpful in selection for yield. It also appears that the random bulk procedure of generation advancement in F2 was unable to identify the plants with increased yield in F3 and yield per se could not be used as a reliable criterion for rejection/selection of the crosses in f3.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["444"]}

{"title": "A Map Reduce Hadoop implementation of Random Tree algorithm based on correlation feature selection\n", "abstract": " Random Tree is a popular data classification classifier for machine learning. Feature reduction is one of the important research issues in big data. Most existing feature reduction algorithms are now faced with two challenging problems. On one hand, they have infrequently taken granular computing into thinking. On the other hand, they still cannot deal with massive data. Massive data processing is a difficult problem in the age of big data. Traditional feature reduction algorithms are generally time-consuming when facing big data. For speedily processing, we introduce a scalable fast approximate attribute reduction algorithm with Map Reduce. We divide the original data into many tiny chunks, and use reduction algorithm for each chunk. The reduction algorithm is based on correlation feature selection and generates decision rules by using Random Tree Classifier. Finally, feature reduction algorithm is proposed in data and task parallel using Hadoop Map Reduce framework with WEKA environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed classifier can scale well and efficiently process big data.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["444"]}

In view of this, a scheme based on centrality and message parameters named as Centrality based Congestion Controlled Routing Protocol (CCCRP) has been proposed in this paper. It allows a receiver node to accept the message of a sender node whose centrality is high and to-be-sent message carries an \"importance\" as compared to others from a set of neighbouring sender nodes.

{"title": "Security Requirements Engineering: Analysis and Prioritization\n", "abstract": " with the increase in the use of software system, security requirement engineering becomes an emergent area of study. Security requirements are constraints to a system which must be satisfied for consistent system. Most of the software engineering processes deals with security constraints during the design or implementation phases which may result into unnecessary constrained system. So the need for a new process arises which deals with security issues in requirement engineering phase and then take appropriate design decisions so that security mechanism used are optimal to some extent resulting in efficient secure system. Therefore the requirement engineers must discover security requirement along with functional and non functional requirement, so that security requirement can be dealt effectively. In this paper, we present a method for security requirement analysis and prioritization along with the other activities of security requirement engineering. Analysis is based on the technique of ontology that will automate the process and prioritization is based on risk analysis. The resultant system will be a cost effective in nature as well as it lay a foundation for further activities so that designer will adopt the most efficient technique for the implementation of security requirements.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["444"]}

The predicted travel time from point A to point B is given prior to the trip in the form of range of time, and each traveler chooses hi/her departure time. How one chooses a specific departure time, however, depends on one\u2019s attitude towards meeting the desired arrival time. The less precise the predicted travel time is the travelers will have a greater band of time to choose the departure time from. On the other hand, the more precise the perceived travel time is (a narrow range), the narrower the band of possible departure times becomes. The latter case allows the departure times to concentrate, which in turn may make the average travel time of all travelers long due to congestion. This paper is motivated by the question of how precise the predicted travel time (PTT) needs to be in order for it to be meaningful. Based on a simple setting, in which a group of people travel from one origin to one destination on a one-lane roadway, and wish to arrive at the same desired time, the paper has examined the relationship between the precision of PTT and the satisfaction of travelers, measured by the travel time, time-missed, and the match between the desired and actual arrival times.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["444"]}

It has been shown that microwave characteristics of MESFETs can be controlled by incident optical radiation with photon energy greater than or equal to the bandgap energy in the same way as varying the gate bias in conventional electrically controlled MESFETs [1-6]. Optically biased FETs have many potential applications, such as high-speed optical detectors and converters for interaction of optical and microwave signals. The optimum noise figure of optically controlled GaAs MESFETs is lower than conventional MESFETs [5].

In a flowing dusty plasma medium, vortices of different sizes appear when the flow does not remain laminar. The vortices also merge to transfer energy between different scales. In the present work, we study the effect of viscoelasticity and compressibility over a localized vortex structure and multiple rotational vortices in a strongly coupled viscoelastic dusty plasma medium. In case of single rotating vortex flow, a transverse wave is generated from the localized vortex source and the evolution time of generated waves is found to be reduced due to finite viscoelasticity and compressibility of the medium. It is found that the viscoelasticity suppresses the dispersion of vorticity. In the presence of multiple vortices, we find, the vortex mergers get highly affected in the presence of memory effect of the fluid, and thus the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["444"]}

Conventionally, this filter is used to suppress the Gaussian noise from the images. A bilateral filter is better at edge preserving, noise suppression and for better smoothening of gray as well as colored images. Bilateral filter tends to improve image quality as it replaces the intensity of each pixel with a weighted average of intensity values from nearby pixels.

The overall design of scribe line features can be drastically different from the die layout. In the chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process, regions of low pattern density have higher polishing rates compared to those of high pattern density, leading to overpolishing or \"dishing\".

{"title": "Hawkes processes for invasive species modeling and management\n", "abstract": " The spread of invasive species to new areas threatens the stability of ecosystems and causes major economic losses in agriculture and forestry. We propose a novel approach to minimizing the spread of an invasive species given a limited intervention budget. We first model invasive species propagation using Hawkes processes, and then derive closed-form expressions for characterizing the effect of an intervention action on the invasion process. We use this to obtain an optimal intervention plan based on an integer programming formulation, and compare the optimal plan against several ecologically-motivated heuristic strategies used in practice. We present an empirical study of two variants of the invasive control problem: minimizing the final rate of invasions, and minimizing the number of invasions at the end of a given time horizon. Our results show that the optimized intervention achieves nearly the same level of control that would be attained by completely eradicating the species, with a 20% cost saving. Additionally, we design a heuristic intervention strategy based on a combination of the density and life stage of the invasive individuals, and find that it comes surprisingly close to the optimized strategy, suggesting that this could serve as a good rule of thumb in invasive species management.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["444"]}

This paper presents a new approach for detecting and quantifying corrosion of steel bars via a piezoelectric ceramic (PZT) patch surface-bonded on the rebars using equivalent structural parameters extracted from PZT sensors via the electro-mechanical impedance (EMI) technique. The EMI technique utilizes the electro-mechanical coupling property of piezoelectric materials for damage diagnosis. Through tests on three steel rebars, empherical relations are derived to relate the corrosion induced mass and stiffness loss to the loss in the equivalent mass and stiffness identified by the PZT patch. The equivalent mass loss and stiffness loss correlates well with the actual mass loss and stiffness loss and provides an alternative corrosion assessment paradigm suitable for diagnosing corrosion in steel rebars.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["444"]}

Improper prescribing of ophthalmic drug formulations can result in adverse effects, noncompliance and decrease in quality of life of the patient. The aim of the study is to describe the drug utilization pattern in an ophthalmology out-patient department of a university teaching hospital in Southern India primarily by using the drug prescribing indicators. Method: A retrospective, descriptive study of case records of ophthalmology outpatients was carried out over a one month period. Besides the demographic data and the diagnosis, the drugs prescribed, dose, route and frequency of administration, duration of treatment was recorded. Results: Of the 84 outpatient prescriptions studied, the number of drugs per prescription ranged from one to four. Fluoroquinolones were the commonest drugs prescribed while their combination with dexamethasone was the commonest fixed dose combination prescribed. All the prescriptions contained the dose, frequency of administration and the duration of treatment.

Platelet count/spleen diameter ratio was collected and compared with the presence/absence of esophageal varices.Results: It was observed that 71.4% cases of chronic liver disease caused by Hepatitis B and 87.5% cases of Hepatitis C were having Platelet count/spleen diameter ratio of more than/equal to 909. Sensitivity and specificity of platelet count/spleen diameter ratio for detecting esophageal varices was 98.6% and 96%. Negative predictive value of platelet count/spleen diameter ratio to rule out esophageal varices in chronic liver disease patients was 96% positive predictive value was 98.6%. As the child Pugh class advances from A to C (more decompensation) percentage of patients developing esophageal varices increases with p-value< 0.001 which is highly significant.Conclusion: Platelet count/spleen diameter ratio is a strong parameter which is independently associated with the presence of esophageal varices\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["444"]}
{"title": "Regulation of ER stress responses by microRNAs\n", "abstract": " MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to be critically involved in control of cell survival and cell death decisions. The main function of miRNAs is to direct posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression, typically by binding to 3\u2019 UTR of cognate mRNAs and inhibiting their translation and/or stability. Hundreds of miRNAs, many of them evolutionarily conserved, have been identified in mammals, but their physiological functions are just beginning to be elucidated. Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress has been associated with a wide range of diseases, including neurodegeneration, stroke, bipolar disorder, cardiac disease, cancer and diabetes. Although the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) is primarily pro-survival, in the event of prolonged or severe ER stress that is not resolved, the UPR switches to initiation of apoptosis.

This promotional mix consists of a blend of advertising, personal selling, sales promotion and public relations tools. An advertising decision is primarily influenced by the choice of media, media budget etc. especially if the advertising is required to be done in a segmented market. Therefore an optimal advertising media selection is a strategic factor for the advertising of products in different market segments as each segment is consumer specific covering homogenous group of potential consumers with similar needs and wants. In this paper media selection model is developed to facilitate the advertising media selection process for multiple products that need to accommodate different market segments.

{"title": "New framework for cross-domain document classification\n", "abstract": " Automatic text document classification is a fundamental problem in machine learning. Given the dynamic nature and the exponential growth of the World Wide Web, one needs the ability to classify not only a massive number of documents, but also documents that belong to wide variety of domains. Some examples of the domains are e-mails, blogs, Wikipedia articles, news articles, newsgroups, online chats, etc. It is the difference in the writing style that differentiates these domains. Text documents are usually classified using supervised learning algorithms that require large set of pre-labeled data. This requirement, of labeled data, poses a challenge in classifying documents that belong to different domains. Our goal is to classify text documents in the testing domain without requiring any labeled documents from the same domain. Our research develops specialized cross-domain learning algorithms based the distributions over words obtained from a collection of text documents by topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation LDA. Our major contributions include 1 empirically showing that conventional supervised learning algorithms fail to generalize their learned models across different domains and 2 development of novel and specialized cross-domain classification algorithms that show an appreciable improvement over conventional methods used for cross-domain classification that is consistent for different datasets. Our research addresses many real-world needs. Since massive number of new types of text documents is generated daily, it is crucial to have the ability to transfer learned information from one domain to another domain.

Biological treatment such as Laccase enzyme treatment was used to treat kenaf fibre for the enhancement of interfacial property between fibre and matrix by removal of lignin which holds and binds the cellulose fibre together. Both enzyme activity and soaking time duration were considered as treatment variables. Maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MAPP) was used with a ratio of 1: 10 as coupling agent to fibre. A twin screw extruder was used to mix the blends and after that test specimens for mechanical testing were prepared by an injection molding machine. Fibre loading was considered as 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50% by weight. Various tests of the composites such as tensile, melt flow index (MFI) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were done to evaluate the properties of the composites and compared with the untreated fibre reinforced composites. Experiment showed that, the best tensile strength (TS) achieved at 40% loading of fibre and enzymatic treatment of fibre enhanced the TS by 40%. Activation energies were calculated through Broido\u2019s equation and found using fibres, enhanced the activation energies of the composites by 5 kJ/mol at the first stage of degradation. It was also found that, RPP degrades at one stage whereas composites degrade at two stages.

In general, in all vegetable crops, highly significant differences were found among hybrids and NaCl concentration with respect to emergence (%), emergence index, shoot length and root length. Emergence was highly correlated with shoot length, and root length showing the contribution of shoot length to salinity tolerance in different vegetable crops. With increasing salinity, there was an increase in root length in salinity tolerant lines but there was a corresponding decrease in root length in susceptible ones. A comparative study on salinity levels revealed that two hybrids of okra genotypes can tolerate up to 0.15 M NaCl. Among these two hybrids, cv. Sleek is the best. Onion hybrids can tolerate up to 0.10 M NaCl and water melon can tolerate up to 0.15 M NaCl. Among the three water melon hybrids, cv. Slice is the best followed by cv. Candy. Bitter gourd can tolerate up to 0.15 M NaCl. Bottle gourd can tolerate up to 0.1 M NaCl. Cucumber hybrids showed an increase in root length under saline conditions which could be related to osmotic adjustment. Among the three cucumber hybrids, Salad is the best followed by cv. Harmony.

In this study, we investigated the microstructure of Co/Cu/Co/NiMn spin valve structures during the annealing treatment. The transformation to the ordered state is directly observed by the splitting of (022) and (220) rings in the electron diffraction pattern of NiMn, which accompanies the transformation of NiMn from disordered face centered cubic (FCC) to ordered face centered tetragonal (FCT).

Given a standard-cell based circuit as input, our approach iteratively extracts critical paths from this circuit, which are then implemented using a PLA circuit. PLAs are a good candidate for such an approach, since they exhibit a gradual increase in delay as additional vectors are added. In subsequent iterations, these critical paths are treated as don't cares, allowing the standard cell based design to be simplified after each iteration. The final design consists of a portion which is implemented using a PLA, and another portion which is implemented using standard cells. We demonstrate that on average, our approach can achieve about 22.5% improvement in the SPICE based delay of a design, along with a placed-and-routed area improvement of 11%.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["444"]}

Query processing performance can be enhanced using indexes to speed up retrieval of data items. Bitmap Indexes (BIs) are popular for indexing warehouse data. A BI allows fast access to individual attribute values that are needed to answer a query by representing the values of an attribute for all data items separately, as bit strings. The Property Map (PMap) is a multidimensional indexing technique that precomputes attribute expressions for each data item and stores the results as bit strings. In order to determine whether the PMap is competitive with BIs, we conduct a performance study of the PMap with the Range Encoded Bit Sliced Index (REBSI) using cost models to simulate their storage and query processing costs for different kinds of query loads. We identify parameters that have significant effect on index performance and determine situations in which either index is more suitable. In general, REBSIs perform better for queries with low cardinality attributes and low selectivity, and PMaps perform better for multi-attribute queries. We also explore ways to improve PMap design to enhance performance. The most significant finding is that property ordering is the most important criteria affecting PMap performance, which is not significantly affected by selectivity of queries or cardinality of the attributes. These results could be useful for improving the working of an analytical decision making system.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["444"]}

Six partial pair potentials of this ternary glass have been computed using pseudopotential\u2010based interatomic forces. In particular, the model employed here for the calculation of the potential is in analogy with the three\u2010partial\u2010structure\u2010factor approach of Sietsma and Thijsse with the assumptions that Fe and Ni atoms have identical distributions with respect to like neighbours and hence the partial pair potentials of Fe\u2010B and Ni\u2010B are identical. The calculated effective pair potential using the partial pair potentials is then employed to investigate the longitudinal and transverse phonon eigenfrequencies. Further, from the elastic part of the frequency spectrum, elastic and thermal properties have been computed.

They are solitary in nearly two-thirds of cases and over half of them are located within 10 cm of the anal verge. The recommended method of treatment is excision under general anesthesia after suture ligation or endoscopic diathermy snaring (l, 2). Children presenting with rectal bleeding must always undergo a rectal examination to exclude a juvenile polyp. While performing this examination we found that, on occasions, the polyp broke off with no subsequent problem. We were also aware that auto-amputation of the polyp may occur spontaneously. We were, therefore, convinced that digital fracture and extraction of these polyps should be safe and avoid the unnecessary risk of anesthesia, or the discomfort of sigmoidoscopy.Sixty consecutive cases (age 2-9 years) with juvenile rectal polyps identified by rectal examination had the pedicle of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["444"]}

Relative estimates of gene effects showed the importance of additive and non-additive gene effects in the expression of flowering and maturity. Narrow-sense heritability estimates ranged from medium to high, indicating scope for improvement in these traits by selection. All 4 crosses showed inbreeding depression for maturity which reduces the possibility of selecting early types in advanced generations. Intermating of short-duration genotypes in the F2 and later generations or reciprocal recurrent selection is advocated for the development of short-duration pigeonpea lines.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["444"]}
{"title": "Effect of Ca (2+)-channel blockers, Ca (2+)-ionophore and increased pyrene excimer formation on the microsomal glucose-6-phosphatase.\n", "abstract": " The dependence of microsomal glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase) activity on Ca2+ as well as the membrane lipid microviscosity was studied by the effect of Ca (2+)-channel blockers (namely verapamil and nifedipine), Ca (2+)-ionophore, A23187 and pyrene excimer formation. Channel blockers depressed the G-6-Pase and Ca (2+)-ATPase while the ionophore increased these activities. Dimethyl sulfoxide, a known membrane surface active agent showed no change. Ca (2+)-uptake into the membrane has expectedly been lowered by the channel blockers while the ionophores facilitated the ion flux. Excimer formation of the fluorescent probe, pyrene as an indicator of increased membrane fluidity, and microviscosity calculated from there on, showed that Ca (2+)-and lipid microenvironment in the membrane significantly influenced the activity of G-6-Pase. Membrane lipid composition such as phospholipid/cholesterol molar ratio which also indicates an increased membrane fluidity is markedly increased with the ionophore but decreased with the channel blockers, while protein/phospholipid ratio remained unchanged. Microsomal G-6-Pase is a multicomponent multifunctional protein. It is argued that Ca2+ may play the role of an obligatory cofactor not only for the hydrolysis of G-6-P (catalytic part of the enzyme) but also involved in the regulation of substrate and product transport in or out of the endoplasmic reticulum lumen.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["444"]}

However it has its own limitation such as foreign body sensation, wound infection, cord fibrosis, chronic pain, etc. Desarda technique for hernia repair is emerging technique for inguinal hernia repair known for its low cost procedure, less recurrence rate and feasibility of the procedure. The objective of the study was to compare treatment of primary inguinal hernia repair with these methods in terms of various operative and post-operative parameters.Methods: 64 patients included in the study and operated after randomization. Intra-operative time, local complication, return to everyday activity, post-operative pain, foreign body sensation and early recurrence were analysed.Results: 51 patients were analysed with a minimum follow up period of 3 months and rest were lost on follow up. Operative time was less in Desarda\u2019s repair (28.24 vs. 30.88 min). Desarda repair was cost effective, return to everyday activity was early in Desarda group, there was significantly (p< 0.001) less post-operative pain measured on VAS on 2nd POD, 7th POD and 1 month. No recurrence observed.Conclusions: Desarda repair is easy to perform and takes less time to perform, it is also cost effective. Desarda repair when compared with Lichtenstein was superior in terms of postoperative pain, return to everyday activity and no foreign body sensation.

{"title": "Cricket stroke extraction: Towards creation of a large-scale cricket actions dataset\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we deal with the problem of temporal action localization for a large-scale untrimmed cricket videos dataset. Our action of interest for cricket videos is a cricket stroke played by a batsman, which is, usually, covered by cameras placed at the stands of the cricket ground at both ends of the cricket pitch. After applying a sequence of preprocessing steps, we have ~73 million frames for 1110 videos in the dataset at constant frame rate and resolution. The method of localization is a generalized one which applies a trained random forest model for CUTs detection(using summed up grayscale histogram difference features) and two linear SVM camera models(CAM1 and CAM2) for first frame detection, trained on HOG features of CAM1 and CAM2 video shots. CAM1 and CAM2 are assumed to be part of the cricket stroke. At the predicted boundary positions, the HOG features of the first frames are computed and a simple algorithm was used to combine the positively predicted camera shots. In order to make the process as generic as possible, we did not consider any domain specific knowledge, such as tracking or specific shape and motion features. The detailed analysis of our methodology is provided along with the metrics used for evaluation of individual models, and the final predicted segments.

The presence of speckle noise degrades the visuals of the ultrasound image and making it difficult for the doctors to diagnose properly. Hence, denoising and restoration of these images came up as a challenge to enhance the quality of the image. In this paper, an improved non-local mean filter is proposed for suppression of speckle noise in ultrasound image. This improved filter is the combination of two conventional filters, i.e., non-local mean filter and bilateral filter. The newly modified method which is emerged by combining the functions of both the conventional filters results in the improvement of quality of image.

Accumulating evidences indicate the oncogenic role of the miR-17-92 cluster in human cancers. Amplification of 13q31-q32, which is the locus of the miR-17-92 cluster, have been reported in haematopoietic malignancies, such as B cell lymphoma. In contrast, MIR17HG was deleted in 21.9% of breast cancers and loss of heterozygosity at 13q12-q13 was associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer. This oncogenic miRNA cluster is deferentially expressed in various cancer. Since, miR-17-92 cluster shows differential expression among the cancers types, it is hypothesized that biological function may also vary depending on the context.

The genotype for a trait is the result of the type of gene action, which may be additive and non-additive. Heritability acts as an indicator of the type of gene action. Traits with high heritability are governed by the additive gene action whereas those with low heritability by the non-additive gene action. Selection alone is not effective for the improvement of traits with low heritability, but for the improvement of these traits requires the effective breeding methods along with selection. These include the crossbreeding, recurrent selection and reciprocal recurrent selection.

The hot biogas coming from the biogas furnace having a temperature range of 50-75 o C is used as an energy input to the generator of absorption system. A computational model has been developed for the parametric investigation of this system and the thermodynamic properties of the fluids have been used from the computer code. The analysis involves the determination of effects of generator temperature on various performance parameters. The performance parameters studied are exergy losses in the different components, COP cooling, COP heating and the exergy efficiency. The results indicate that COP cooling as well as COP heating lies in the range of 0.20-0.93 and 1.20-1.93 respectively for same variation in generator temperature ranging from 50-75 o C. The exergetic efficiency of the system lies in the range of 0.092-0.1275. The maximum exergy loss is found to be in case of generator and the lowest in case of condenser.

Medical imaging systems, for example, take input signals which arise from various properties of the body of a patient, such as its attenuation of x-rays or reflection of ultrasound. The resulting images can be continuous, ie analog, or discrete, ie digital; the former can be converted into the latter by digitization. The challenge is to obtain an output image that is an accurate representation of the input signal, and then to analyze it and extract as much diagnostic information from the image as possible.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["444"]}

However, only a few researchers have addressed both the issues for data streams. Further, association rule mining is now considered as multiobjective problem where multiple measures like correlation coefficient, recall, comprehensibility, lift etc can be used for evaluating a rule. Discovery of multiobjective association rules in data streams has not been paid much attention.               In this paper, we have proposed a 3-step algorithm for generation of multiobjective non-redundant association rules in data streams.

While a globally distributed team with engineers in different time-zones has been leveraged successfully in maintenance for reducing response time, not much work has been done on reducing the time in a development project, and globally distributed teams are mostly used to provide capacity benefit. We propose the use of global-pairs as a simple method of organizing global resources for leveraging time zone differences for reducing the cycle time. Instead of assigning tasks to individual resources, a project can assign tasks to global-pairs, each having one resource working in one time zone and the other in opposite time zone.

Dyes industries contribute major part of water pollution, since they are generally, Present in effluents from textile, leather, food processing, cosmetics and paper industries. Among this textile industry is the largest consumer of dyestuff, consuming more than 80% of the total Production and they are carcinogenic also. The disposal of colored wastes into water affects the environment as they are highly toxic to human and aquatic life (1-4). Therefore, decolorizations of dyes are important aspects of wastewater treatment before discharge. It is difficult to remove the dyes from the effluent, because dyes are not easily degradable and are generally not removed from wastewater by conventional wastewater systems. Generally biological aerobic wastewater systems are not successful for decolorization of majority of dyes. Therefore, color removal was extensively studied with physco-chemical methods as coagulation, ultra-filtration, electro-chemical adsorption and photooxidation (5-7).Among these methods, adsorption is a widely used for dye removal from wastewaters [8]. Granulated activated carbon (GAC) or powdered activated carbon (PAC) is commonly used for dye removal [9, 10]. However, they are expensive and the regeneration or disposal of it has several problems. Thus, the use of several low cost adsorbents has been studied by many researches.

One hundred 8-to 18-year-olds, working as beggars, vendors, or ragpickers, or who were self-employed, comprised the sample. Observation and interviews were used to identify stressful situations related to the workplace, earnings, home, school, peers, and siblings. A Q-sort technique was used to collect social support preference information. The results indicated that a majority of the children preferred to be alone in most stressful situations, especially those related to the workplace, peers, and parental punishment. They commonly sought their parents' support when they needed money, faced sibling problems, or did household chores. Mothers' support was preferred to fathers', grandparents', and other relatives' support. More boys than girls preferred to be alone in stressful situations, and a larger percentage of girls sought their mothers' support in comparison to the boys. Children's preference for social support provides information on self-reliance, effective survival and coping strategies, the nature of family relationships, the quality of social interactions, and the stressors that street children and adolescents face in difficult circumstances.(KDFB)", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["444"]}

However, there is no consensus over the number of drains to be placed. Is there any advantage of multiple drains over a single drain? This question formed the premise of this study.Methods: All consecutive patients operated between 2014 and 2015 were included. Those with pleural drains were excluded. Patients had either a single drain in the pericardial cavity or had two drains, one in the pericardial and the other in retrostenal area. A total of 244 patients were included in the study group.Results: Out of 244 patients, 122 had single drain and 122 had 2 mediastinal drains. The mean age was 24.38\u00b117.08 (Age range 6 months to 66 years) and male: female ratio was 1.5: 1. There was no statistically significant difference in single drain vs double drain group in terms of the number of days of drainage (1.65 vs 1.55, p 0.325), time to mobilize (36.57 vs 35.23 hours, p= 0.684), ICU stay (2.62 vs 2.63 days, p= 0.96) and re-exploration (5.7%, vs 9.8%, p= 0.34). However, patients with two mediastinal drains had higher requirement of analgesia (p= 0.004).Conclusions: The use of two mediastinal drains does not confer any advantage over a single mediastinal drain after cardiac surgery in assessing or controlling bleed or recovery.

One prospective application is in sustainable machining method with minimum quantity lubrication (MQL). The use of a nanocutting fluid in machining under MQL conditions substantially reduces the amount of cutting fluid being used as compared to conventional methods. The overall performance of machining process also gets enhanced resulting in increased surface finish and reduced cutting temperature, tool wear, and cutting forces. Moreover, by replacing a nanocutting fluid with a hybrid nanocutting fluid, the performance of MQL is found to be further enhanced.

{"title": "Lake bank filtration for water supply in Nainital\n", "abstract": " As mentioned in the previous chapters, surface water bodies such as lakes and rivers have been and continue to be major sources of water supply. Alluvial aquifers hydraulically connected to a water course offer a relatively easy option for abstracting surface water with improvement in water quality in terms of turbidity, pathogens, and dissolved organics. This technology called bank filtration makes an important difference in implementations at lake banks and river banks. At lake banks, the colmation layer\u2013the most important purification zone at the soil/water interface\u2013is not disrupted by seasonal changes in water flows as in the case of river banks. This lake bank feature offers the advantage of a consistently higher attenuation of contaminants throughout the year than river banks. On the other hand, there are also potential problems at lake banks that may occur due to clogging.Lake bank filtration (LBF) is used in many countries around the world for municipal water supply such as Germany, Finland, and the Netherlands. LBF wells at Lake Tegel in Berlin have been used for the city\u2019s drinking water supply for more than 100 years (Fritz et al., 2002). In Finland, LBF schemes have been implemented on the island of Hietasalo in Lake Kallavesi and at the banks of lakes Vihnusj\u00e4rvi and Vesij\u00e4rvi (Miettinen et al., 1994; Kivim\u00e4ki et al., 1998). In the Netherlands, an LBF scheme has been implemented along the deep gravel extraction reservoir De Lange Vlieter (Juh\u00e1sz-Holterman et al., 1998), which is recharged with water from River Mass (also known as River Meuse).

In addition to replenishing groundwater aquifers and depending on the quality of the water source used for recharge (river or lake water, storm water, wastewater treatment plant effluents) and local hydrogeological conditions, these MAR systems can serve at least as a pre-treatment or sometimes even as a total treatment system (Sharma & Amy, 2010; Sharma et al., 2012). Very often the treated water from these natural treatment systems (NTSs) may not meet the required local water quality guidelines or standards for intended use and thus require additional post-treatment. Furthermore, some contaminants present in the source water may pollute the aquifer or influence the performance of NTSs and therefore pre-treatment of source water is often carried out before the application of natural systems. Pre-treatment and post-treatment thus form an integral part of the NTSs. Depending upon the raw water quality, local hydrogeological conditions, process conditions applied and intended use of the treated water a NTS can have pre-treatment or post-treatment or both.

By learning gross anatomy, medical students get a first \u201cimpression\u201d about the structure of human body which is the basis for understanding pathologic and clinical problems. Anatomy teaching methodology has been revolutionized in the 2Ist century, due to time constraints, less availability of cadavers, stress on computer aided learning, scarcity of qualified teachers, changes in the demands of medical profession and neglect of vertical integration of anatomy teaching. Until recently, dissection and didactic lectures were its sole pedagogy, worldwide. But over the last few decades, traditional anatomy teaching based on topographical structural anatomy taught in lectures and gross dissection classes has been replaced by a vivid range of study modules like problem based learning (PBL) and computer assisted learning (CAL), and curricula integration. Though the anatomy curriculum is undergoing international reformation but it lacks uniformity among institutions. The available modern international literature, describing various methodologies for teaching/learning anatomy conclude that Anatomists are constantly debating over the following questions-How much to teach, when to teach and how to teach gross anatomy. We endeavor to answer these questions and contribute to the debate on the ideal methodology for teaching/learning anatomy.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) and chronic periodontitis are common chronic diseases in adults. It is usually necessary to provide a sample of capillary blood to measure blood glucose level in diabetics. However, it is possible to obtain blood during periodontal probing without any discomfort. The aim of the study was to evaluate accessibility of chair side noninvasive screening method for blood glucose level in DM during routine periodontal examination. Material and Methods. 15 non diabetics and 15 newly onset type 2 diabetic patients with moderate to severe periodontitis were selected for the study after meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria. Periodontal pocket probing was performed using Williams Graduated periodontal probe. Blood oozing from gingival sulcus of anterior teeth following periodontal pocket probing was collected with a stick of glucose self monitoring device. As control, finger stick capillary blood was taken. Results. Statistically significant correlation was observed between the blood glucose level in gingival crevicular blood (GCB) and peripheral fasting blood (PFB) in diabetic subjects. The mean GCB glucose level in diabetic subjects was 172.27\u00b15.02 mg/dL while mean PFB glucose level was 167.80\u00b18.87 mg/dL. The correlation coefficients for diabetic and non diabetic subjects were r=0.715 and r=0.619, respectively.

The monitored structure is also analyzed using finite element method (FEM), considering the prestress level in struts as reference. The experimental and numerical results are compared and reasonable agreement is found. The influence of height of structure, rigidity ratio and support conditions on maximum deflection is also investigated in detail.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["444"]}
{"title": "Hepatopulmonary syndrome: a clinical view\n", "abstract": " In 1884 Fl\u00fcckiger first described a woman with liver cirrhosis, cyanosis, and digital clubbing. 1 The term \u2018hepatopulmonary syndrome\u2019, the triad of liver disease, an increased alveolar-arterial gradient while breathing room air, and evidence of intrapulmonary vascular dilatations, was coined in 1977 by Kennedy and Knudson. 2 These vascular abnormalities predominate in the lower lung fields. As gravity induces increased blood flow to the lower lung fields hypoxemia is increased when changing from supine to upright position. Mild hypoxemia occurs in approximately one third of all patients with chronic liver disease and often is multifactorial, 3, 4 because other cardiopulmonary abnormalities (eg, pleural effusion, ascites) are common in these patients and may coexist with HPS. The special qualities of HPS are platypnea, 5 defined as dyspnea induced by the upright position and relieved by recumbency and orthodeoxia, 6 defined as arterial deoxygenation induced by the upright position and relieved by recumbency. Although these phenomena are not pathognomonic for HPS, they strongly suggest this diagnosis in the setting of liver dysfunction. 7", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["444"]}
{"title": "A Software reliability Growth model for distributed development Environment with learning Function and Errors of Different Severity\n", "abstract": " With the dramatic advances in Internet/Intranet technologies, the number of distributed software development projects has been increasing. And Internet and Intranet groupworking tools are becoming more widespread and can often provide a low-cost, easy to implement solution to many problems. Large scale distributed system developments are now common in telecommunications, air traffic control, defense and space. They are recognizable because of their sheer scale. In these systems a release will often be developed over 2\u20134 years and cost in excess of 200-300 person years of development effort. Features define the content of a release. The features are realized by mapping the full set of system feature requirements across the various sub-systems. Normally this involves building on a large existing software base made up of the existing sub-systems that are then modified and extended to engineer the new release. Requirement changes are common in these developments because of the long lead times involved. This adds to the complexity of planning and controlling the inprogress development both at the individual sub-system level and the release. A further complexity factor is the integration and validation of the release once the individual subsystems are delivered. These large-scale systems must achieve high reliability because of their nature. In the final release validation software defects arise not only from the new software but also due to latent defects in the existing code. Substantial regression tests must be run to checkout the existing software base that may amount to millions of lines of code.In summary these distributed\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["444"]}

It was first isolated by Carswell et al in 1975 in an attempt to identify tumour necrosis factors responsible for necrosis of the sarcoma Meth A. The cytokine possesses both growth stimulating properties and growth inhibitory processes, and it appears to have self regulatory properties as well. The cytokine is produced by several types of cells, but especially by macrophages. Tracey and Cerami in 1990 suggested two beneficial functions of TNF-? which have led to its continued expression. First, the low levels of the cytokine may aid in maintaining homoeostasis by regulating the body\u2019s circadian rhythm. Furthermore, low levels of TNF-? promote the remodelling or replacement of injured and senescent tissue by stimulating fibroblast growth. Studies demonstrated the powerful proinflammatory effects of TNF-? and revealed its role as a central endogenous mediator of endotoxic shock. Without TNF-?, mice infected with Gram-negative bacteria experience septic shock (Janeway et al, 1999). Hence, TNF has a broad spectrum of biologic activities.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["444"]}

Very few algorithms solve the problem by integrating the two subtasks and construct the lattice while generating newer concepts. Amongst such algorithms, algorithms proposed by Bordat and Nourine have the least worst case complexity of O (| G|| M| 2) per lattice element. The proposed algorithm computes concepts and lattice structure together in one step avoiding repeated computation of same concepts. The time complexity is O ((| G|+| M|)| M|) per lattice element.

The microstructural investigation of the fabricated composite has been examined and found that the ceramic particles of B4C are uniformly distributed throughout the matrix at higher rotational speed. The role of different rotational speed on the mechanical properties of the fabricated specimens was carried out by microhardness and universal tensile tests. It was observed that at higher rotational speed the tensile strength of the composite was higher due to homogenous mixing of the reinforcement with the aluminum alloy. The microhardness value of the specimen fabricated at higher rotational speed was less due to the hard reinforcement particles broke down and distributed in the nugget zone uniformly. It was also analyzed that the wear resistance of the composite fabricated at higher rotational speed is greater in comparison with the composite fabricated at lower rotational speed. In addition to this the coefficient of friction was also found to be efficient on the same parameters. The examined tribological and mechanical properties have been corelated with the microstructures of the fabricate composite.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["444"]}
{"title": "Trigeminal neuralgia-A review\n", "abstract": " Trigeminal neuralgia is a very peculiar disease. The pain of trigeminal neuralgia, also known as \u201ctic douloureux\u201d, is characterized by episodic, paroxysmal, triggered pain in a distribution of 1 or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve.TN pain attacks may result from physiologic changes induced by a chronic partial injury to the brainstem trigeminal nerve root from a variety of causes. An early and accurate diagnosis of TN is important, because therapeutic interventions can reduce or eliminate pain attacks in the large majority of TN patients.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["444"]}
