{"title": "Unsupervised concept drift detection with a discriminative classifier\n", "abstract": " In data stream mining, one of the biggest challenges is to develop algorithms that deal with the changing data. As data evolve over time, static models become outdated. This phenomenon is called concept drift, and it is investigated extensively in the literature. Detecting and subsequently adapting to concept drifts yield more robust and better performing models. In this study, we present an unsupervised method called D3 which uses a discriminative classifier with a sliding window to detect concept drift by monitoring changes in the feature space. It is a simple method that can be used along with any existing classifier that does not intrinsically have a drift adaptation mechanism. We experiment on the most prevalent concept drift detectors using 8 datasets. The results demonstrate that D3 outperforms the baselines, yielding models with higher performances on both real-world and synthetic datasets.", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["1109"]}
{"title": "Concept learning using one-class classifiers for implicit drift detection in evolving data streams\n", "abstract": " Data stream mining has become an important research area over the past decade due to the increasing amount of data available today. Sources from various domains generate a near-limitless volume of data in temporal order. Such data are referred to as data streams, and are generally nonstationary as the characteristics of data evolves over time. This phenomenon is called concept drift, and is an issue of great importance in the literature, since it makes models obsolete by decreasing their predictive performance. In the presence of concept drift, it is necessary to adapt to change in data to build more robust and effective classifiers. Drift detectors are designed to run jointly with classification models, updating them when a significant change in data distribution is observed. In this paper, we present an implicit (unsupervised) algorithm called One-Class Drift Detector (OCDD), which uses a one-class learner\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1109"]}
{"title": "IoT based smart office application for advanced indoor working environment and energy efficiency\n", "abstract": " Internet of Things is a complex network, consisting of many elements that communicate with each other constantly. The network includes various modules, sensors, and computers etc. which constantly share data with each other, and carry out independent actions. The system may include interfaces connecting the users to the system, such as mobile apps and websites. In our vision, a `Smart Office' is an office which knows or can determine office users' needs, and acts according to this knowledge. Our main goal is to design an office which will make independent decisions to maintain optimal office environment. These decisions will be made according to manually set user preferences and sensor readings. With our smart office system, we are aiming to provide flexible and energy efficient working environment to the users.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1109"]}
