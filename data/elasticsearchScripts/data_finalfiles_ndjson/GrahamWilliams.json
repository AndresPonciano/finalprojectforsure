{"title": "On-line unsupervised outlier detection using finite mixtures with discounting learning algorithms\n", "abstract": " Outlier detection is a fundamental issue in data mining, specifically in fraud detection, network intrusion detection, network monitoring, etc. SmartSifter is an outlier detection engine addressing this problem from the viewpoint of statistical learning theory. This paper provides a theoretical basis for SmartSifter and empirically demonstrates its effectiveness. SmartSifter detects outliers in an on-line process through the on-line unsupervised learning of a probabilistic model (using a finite mixture model) of the information source. Each time a datum is input SmartSifter employs an on-line discounting learning algorithm to learn the probabilistic model. A score is given to the datum based on the learned model with a high score indicating a high possibility of being a statistical outlier. The novel features of SmartSifter are: (1) it is adaptive to non-stationary sources of data; (2) a score has a clear statistical/information\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "832\n", "authors": ["834"]}

They were followed up over seven months. Measurement of dysfunctional attitudes did not predict outcome at seven months. Overgeneral recall on the AM test at initial assessment, especially for emotionally positive memories, was highly correlated with failure to recover from depression and accounted for 33% of the variance in HRSD score at follow-up. Overgeneral recall of emotional memories did not change during follow-up.

By building knowledge from information, data mining adds considerable value to the ever increasing stores of electronic data that abound today. In performing data mining many decisions need to be made regarding the choice of methodology, the choice of data, the choice of tools, and the choice of algorithms. Throughout this book the reader is introduced to the basic concepts and some of the more popular algorithms of data mining. With a focus on the hands-on end-to-end process for data mining, Williams guides the reader through various capabilities of the easy to use, free, and open source Rattle Data Mining Software built on the sophisticated R Statistical Software. The focus on doing data mining rather than just reading about data mining is refreshing. The book covers data understanding, data preparation, data refinement, model building, model evaluation, and practical deployment. The reader will learn to rapidly deliver a data mining project using software easily installed for free from the Internet. Coupling Rattle with R delivers a very sophisticated data mining environment with all the power, and more, of the many commercial offerings.", "num_citations": "531\n", "authors": ["834"]}

Rl* is a rule-based system that has much in common with other domain-specific systems that have been developed over the past several years [l, 81. It differs from these systeins primarily in its use of Match rather than Generate-and-Test as its central problem solving method [2]; rather than exploring several hypotheses until an acceptable one is found, it exploits its knowledge of its task domain to generate a single acceptable solution. Rl\u2019s domain of expertise is configuring Digital Equipment Corporation\u2019s VAX-l l/780 systems. Its input is a customer\u2019s order and its output is a set of diagrams displaying the spatial relationships among the components on the order; these diagrams are used by the technician who physically assembles the system. Since an order frequently lacks one or more components required for system functionality, a major part of Rl\u2019s task is to notice what components are missing and add them to the order. Rl is currently being used on a regular basis by DEC\u2019s manufacturing organization. 3THE DOMAIN. The VAX-11/780 is the first implementation of DEC\u2019s VAX-1 1 architecture. The VAX-1 l/780 uses a high speed synchronous bus, the sbi, as its primary interconnect; the central processor, one or two memory control units, up to four massbus interfaces, and up to four unibus interfaces can be connected to the sbi. The massbuses and particularly the unibuses can support a wide variety of peripheral devices.

{"title": "Categoric and extended autobiographical memories\n", "abstract": " When people recall specific events in response to word cues, they often give overgeneral memories. These are either \u201ccategoric\u201d (e.g., \u201cTimes I have fallen downstairs\u201d) or \u201cextended\u201d memories (e.g., \u201cThe years I spent in Oxford\u201d). Three studies showed that these two types of overgenerality were functionally independent of each other. Categoric memories were more likely to arise from deficient operation of the Supervisory Attentional System which normally formulates intermediate descriptions for searching memory. Extended memories were more likely to be given in response to emotional cues, and to be older and more unique, suggesting that they arise from a search for distinctiveness. Consistent with these distinctions, a study of depressed suicidal people showed that their greater overgenerality was wholely due to an excess of categoric memories.", "num_citations": "195\n", "authors": ["834"]}

Most existing methods detect communities through analyzing the linkage of the network. The drawback is that each community identified by those methods can only reflect the strength of connections, but it cannot reflect the semantics such as the interesting topics shared by people.

We first use a subspace clustering algorithm to group all the social objects into topics.

That is really the meaning of renaissance and it was the explicit symbolism behind the naming of Detroit's Ford-inspired Renaissance Center; the spiritual renewal after the fall. The popularity of the renaissance/revival theme lies in its inherent optimism and the belief that squalor is being expunged and the city is being reclaimed for the respectable classes. As such it is a sharply partisan view of contemporary urban change and one which negates the real history of urban development and change.

{"title": "Temporal sequence associations for rare events\n", "abstract": " In many real world applications, systematic analysis of rare events, such as credit card frauds and adverse drug reactions, is very important. Their low occurrence rate in large databases often makes it difficult to identify the risk factors from straightforward application of associations and sequential pattern discovery. In this paper we introduce a heuristic to guide the search for interesting patterns associated with rare events from large temporal event sequences. Our approach combines association and sequential pattern discovery with a measure of risk borrowed from epidemiology to assess the interestingness of the discovered patterns. In the experiments, we successfully identify a known drug and several new drug combinations with high risk of adverse reactions. The approach is also applicable to other applications where rare events are of primary interest.", "num_citations": "39\n", "authors": ["834"]}

{"title": "Differentiating between monozygotic twins through DNA methylation-specific high-resolution melt curve analysis\n", "abstract": " Although short tandem repeat profiling is extremely powerful in identifying individuals from crime scene stains, it is unable to differentiate between monozygotic (MZ) twins. Efforts to address this include mutation analysis through whole genome sequencing and through DNA methylation studies. Methylation of DNA is affected by environmental factors; thus, as MZ twins age, their DNA methylation patterns change. This can be characterized by bisulfite treatment followed by pyrosequencing. However, this can be time-consuming and expensive; thus, it is unlikely to be widely used by investigators. If the sequences are different, then in theory the melting temperature should be different. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess whether high-resolution melt curve analysis can be used to differentiate between MZ twins. Five sets of MZ twins provided buccal swabs that underwent extraction, quantification, bisulfite treatment\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "34\n", "authors": ["834"]}

This method identifies the high density neighborhoods from the data first and then selects the central points of the neighborhoods as initial centers. The recently published Neighborhood-Based Clustering (NBC) algorithm is used to search for high density neighborhoods. The new clustering algorithm NK-means integrates NBC into the k-means clustering process to improve the performance of the k-means algorithm while preserving the k-means efficiency. NBC is enhanced with a new cell-based neighborhood search method to accelerate the search for initial cluster centers. A merging method is employed to filter out insignificant initial centers to avoid too many clusters being generated.

{"title": "Association rule discovery with unbalanced class distributions\n", "abstract": " There are many methods for finding association rules in very large data. However it is well known that most general association rule discovery methods find too many rules, many of which are uninteresting rules. Furthermore, the performances of many such algorithms deteriorate when the minimum support is low. They fail to find many interesting rules even when support is low, particularly in the case of significantly unbalanced classes. In this paper we present an algorithm which finds association rules based on a set of new interestingness criteria. The algorithm is applied to a real-world health data set and successfully identifies groups of patients with high risk of adverse reaction to certain drugs. A statistically guided method of selecting appropriate features has also been developed.

Rules discovered can be used to alert medical practitioners when prescribing drugs, to certain categories of patients, to potential adverse effects. We assess the rules using survival charts and propose two kinds of probability trees to present them. Both of them represent the risk of given adverse drug reaction for certain categories of patients in terms of risk ratios, which are familiar to medical practitioners. The first approach shows risk ratios when all rule conditions apply. The second presents the risk associated with a single risk factor with other parts of the rule identifying the cohort of the patient subpopulation.

{"title": "Inducing and combining decision structures for expert systems\n", "abstract": " Decisions are central to our daily existence. Every activity requires us to make decisions, many subconsciously. Knowledge, de ned as an acquaintance with facts, truths, or principles (Delbridge, 1982), is the key to correct decision making. Its representation and use by machine has been a major goal throughout the history of computing machinery. Research in the discipline of Arti cial Intelligence (AI) explicitly investigates ways in which knowledge can be e ectively represented and employed by computers in order to make intelligent and human-appreciable decisions. Knowledge-based expert systems (KBESs) are a family of successful, practical systems arising from AI research. These systems structure knowledge (as decision structures) in such a way that it can be e ciently employed to make decisions, and yet is easily understandable by humans.Signi cant research problems relating to KBESs remain. One such problem area falls under the general categories of machine learning and knowledge acquisition. It is generally agreed that learning is one of the most important components of intelligence. The research reported here focuses upon the acquisition of decision structures for use by KBESs. This thesis takes a well-established, practical tool for knowledge acquisition as its basis. Experiments are described, pinpointing some of the limitations of the tool. A new approach is then developed which builds upon this tool, introducing the idea of combining decision structures.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["834"]}

Such environments stretch the capabilities of traditional GIS. A responsive GIS must play a more active role in the support of the decision-maker. This paper introduces the concept of a responsive GIS and demonstrates the integration of artificial intelligence techniques to provide such active support. Expert knowledge, represented as Templates, can have both spatial and temporal components, and remains within the GIS framework rather than providing separate, and often disjoint, GIS and Expert System modules.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["834"]}

Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) of the 16S rDNA was used to identify bacterial taxa. It succeeded in detecting two out of three key contributors involved in decomposition and represents the first study to reveal Vibrionaceae as abundant on decomposing pork.

In the literature, there are many different types of decision tree algorithms, including C4. 5, CART, and CHAID. Each type of decision tree algorithm may capture different information and structure. This paper proposes a hybrid weighted random forest algorithm, simultaneously using a feature weighting method and a hybrid forest method to classify very high dimensional data. The hybrid weighted random forest algorithm can effectively reduce subspace size and improve classification performance without increasing the error bound. We conduct a series of experiments on eight high dimensional datasets to compare our method with traditional random forest methods and other classification methods.

{"title": "Stratified over-sampling bagging method for random forests on imbalanced data\n", "abstract": " Imbalanced data presents a big challenge to random forests (RF). Over-sampling is a commonly used sampling method for imbalanced data, which increases the number of instances of minority class to balance the class distribution. However, such method often produces sample data sets that are highly correlated if we only sample more minority class instances, thus reducing the generalizability of RF. To solve this problem, we propose a stratified over-sampling (SOB) method to generate both balanced and diverse training data sets for RF. We first cluster the training data set multiple times to produce multiple clustering results. The small individual clusters are grouped according to their entropies. Then we sample a set of training data sets from the groups of clusters using stratified sampling method. Finally, these training data sets are used to train RF.

{"title": "Evaluation of low trace DNA recovery techniques from ridged surfaces\n", "abstract": " The first step in the DNA profiling process is the recovery of DNA from the crime scene or item. Such surfaces can be varying with absorbent and non-absorbent surfaces. Ridged surfaces, such as those encountered on bottle-tops or firearms, are also common. Although low trace DNA or \u201ctouch DNA\u201d is problematic in forensic casework, ridged surfaces should be a more effective surface for the recovery of such DNA due their abrasive nature. The aim of this study was to evaluate six recovery techniques; single wet swab, dry-wet double swab, wet-dry double swab, flocked swab, PCR square, and tape lifts. 36 falcon tubes with screw top lids were sterilised before DNA was deposited on the screw-top lids. Each of the recovery techniques were then utilised on 6 screw-top lids. All recovery media then underwent standard DNA extraction prior to DNA quantification by UV/Vis spectroscopy and quantitative PCR. The data indicated that the tape lifts recovered significantly more DNA from the ridged surface than the other techniques. There was no significant difference between the remaining 5 techniques, although on average, flocked swabs recovered the least amount. This suggested that the success in recovery of DNA is not down to the particular technique used, but down to the competence of the individual examiner and the amount of DNA deposited onto the surface.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["834"]}

The more water soluble salts (such as thallium sulphate, acetate, or carbonate) have higher toxicity, and although the toxic dose is variable most deaths occur after the ingestion of 10-15 mg/kg of soluble salt.

In the very first paragraph of his work, Solomon rejects common understanding. There\u2019s no such thing as reproduction, he writes, only acts of production. Genetics notwithstanding, parents of exceptional children, meaning those very unlike themselves, can find they sooner or later face the same crucial question: to what extent should they accept their children for who they are and how far should they go to help them become their best selves possible?Far From The Tree (Scribner, 2012) is a book of stories about parents and their progeny, children who are either born or grow to become different in profound and challenging ways. In 10 chapters, Solomon tells of families coping with deafness, autism, dwarfism, Down syndrome, schizophrenia, multiple severe disabilities, with children who are prodigies or transgender, those who are conceived through rape and those who become criminals. While each of these situations sets a family apart, Solomon sees the differences within families as a universal link. We are all united in our diversity, he believes. In preparation for this tour de force of a work, Solomon interviewed some 300 families, accumulating over 40,000 pages of transcription.

Utilising this framework, local government modernisation is examined within the broader modernisation agenda and its historical context. This, and an examination of Best Value, the Beacon Council Scheme and the Comprehensive Performance and Area Assessments, exposes the links between modernisation and organisation learning that underpin a central contention of this research; that the success of local government modernisation relied on local authorities being better able to learn from each other. Analysis of the data unique to this research, obtained largely through interviews with local authority Chief Executives, illuminates the way in which they construct their views of learning, modernisation and central-local relations. The major conclusions concern the significance of networks, differences and trust and how views of each are constructed. Also important is trust within central-local relations. Modernisation consolidated the acceptance of other local authorities as sources of learning and enhanced particular characteristics conducive to learning. However, through the mechanisms utilised, modernisation also inhibited instances of learning and was\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["834"]}
{"title": "Differentiating between monozygotic twins through methylation specific high resolution melt curve analysis\n", "abstract": " Whilst DNA profiling is an extremely powerful human identification tool, it is limited when it  comes to monozygotic (MZ) or identical twins, where in such cases they would exhibit the same DNA profile. This creates issues where the suspect is one of the twins. Currently, efforts are being made to resolve this through whole genome or next generation sequencing, which can be very expensive. This study explores the feasibility of using high resolution melt curve analysis to characterize  the DNA methylation status. DNA methylation can be altered by environmental factors, consequently  over the life of monozygotic twins; they can end up with differing DNA methylation patterns,  typically characterized by sequencing. Buccal swabs were collected from five sets of MZ twins of differing ages, as well as from a full  sibling (non-MZ). All samples underwent DNA extraction, bi-sulfite treatment, amplification and then underwent high resolution melt curve analysis using a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR machine,  targeting a section of the Alu-SP region and the promoter region of the E2F3 gene. Significantly different melting temperatures (Tm) were obtained in four of the five MZ twins of the  alu- SP samples, as well as in the non-MZ full sibling samples, and all 5 twin sets of samples  analysing the E2F3 fragment; thus indicating that a relatively cheaper faster test could be used to  differentiate between MZ twins in a forensic context.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["834"]}

An attempt to make a reliable and cost effective BFI test utilising the alternative SYBR Green fluorescent dye was carried out. RNA was extracted from blood and saliva stains from both male and female donors, this was then reverse transcribed using M-MLV and random hexamers. Using real-time PCR, relative quantitation of blood and saliva specific markers was carried out on the cDNA from the blood and saliva samples using the SYBR\u00ae Green fluorescent dye. Melting curve analysis was also performed immediately following PCR amplification. The relative quantitation values were calculated using the formula 2-\u0394\u0394CT and all samples were normalised to reference gene 18s rRNA. The results revealed good specificity for a number of markers using this chemistry, however some markers were undetected. Blood markers NCF2, SPTB, PBDG and saliva specific markers HTN3, SPRR1A, KRT4 and KRT13 were investigated. In the SYBR green studies, the most specific markers were NCF2, KRT4, KRT13 and SPRR1A, showing reproducible results in a number of studies. Blood marker SPTB also appeared to be specific to blood however the melt curve data for this marker in each study was questionable given the low melting temperature for the amplified products. Blood specific marker PBGD, and saliva specific marker HTN3 were not detected using SYBR Green and saliva marker STATH was detected however in each case appeared to be non-specific in\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["834"]}
{"title": "Forensic microRNA (miRNA) analysis of skin specific markers\n", "abstract": " Conventional body fluid identification methods are typically presumptive tests. These tests have a large number of false positives and because of this they are not confirmatory. Messenger RNA (mRNA) profiling was developed as a body fluid identification method as it was determined that mRNAs are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Unfortunately, given mRNA\u2019s size (~200-300 nucleotides), using this technique may not be ideal for compromised or degraded samples often encountered in forensic casework1. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small, non-protein coding RNA molecules approximately 22 nucleotides in length. The first miRNA was discovered by Rosalind Lee et al. in 1993, whilst studying the lin-14 gene in C. elegans development2. miRNAs are believed to control gene expression involved in metastasis, proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation3. A large number of cellular pathways are affected by the regulatory function of miRNAs; the most notable of these pathways control oncogenic and developmental processes. It has also been found that miRNA processing defects can enhance tumorigenesis4. Many people argue that there is no need to test for the presence of a specific body fluid as the analysis of any DNA present can confirm a body fluid is present. This is true, DNA won\u2019t be present if a biological material isn\u2019t present, but the confirmation of the body fluid could prove crucial in the investigation of a case. There is a need to identify skin alongside other body fluids within forensic investigations, especially sexual offences.

{"title": "Identification and resolution of capability gaps in forensic science\n", "abstract": " Although forensic biology is a powerful tool in criminal investigations, there are a number of capability gaps; namely, the interpretation of low-level DNA mixtures, associating the DNA profile with a body fluid, and the issue of consent in sexual offences. A research strategy was developed that utilises whole genome amplification (WGA), messenger RNA and microRNA analysis, DNA profiling, and clothing damage analysis. An evaluation of a WGA technique \u2013 multiple displacement amplification - with and without a macromolecular crowding agent, indicated that this may be of use for DNA samples containing certain mixing ratios; however, for this to be truly of use, knowledge of the nature of the sample preanalysis is required, which is not feasible in a forensic environment. A SYBR Greenbased mRNA gene expression test was developed that was capable of distinguishing between saliva and blood by using relative quantitation on real-time PCR. However, the low specificity of the SYBR Green meant that a higher number of controls were required for this to work at forensic standard. A single channel simultaneous analytical test for DNA and microRNA was also developed, which meant that it could be possible to definitively identify the body fluid origin of a DNA profile. This represented a significant step forward in improving forensic biology capability. Reconstruction studies were carried out in response to a sexual assault case where consent was an issue. This study demonstrated that it was possible to cause significant damage to a bra without causing damage to the hook and eye fastening; thus, negating a hypothesis offered by the defence.

{"title": "EVALUATING THE EFFECT OF MULTIPLE DISPLACEMENT AMPLFICATION UPON LOW-LEVEL MULTIPLE SOURCE DNA PROFILES\n", "abstract": " The interpretation of low-level DNA mixtures, where there is DNA present from more than one individual in a sample, is of great difficulty. This can be due to the low-level nature of the result and the complexity inherent in DNA results with multiple sources. These two elements in one sample only further compound the difficulty. Multiple displacement amplification (MDA) techniques, with or without a macromolecular crowding (MDAMC) agent, have been suggested as potential tools for improving these results. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the proposed techniques could be of use to forensic genetics casework. Buccal swabs underwent extraction, and then mixtures of samples were prepared with a range of known mixing ratios, from 1: 1 through to 50: 1. These samples were split into three prior to undergoing standard DNA analysis, MDA or MDA-MC. DNA quantification was carried out using real-time PCR and the Human DNA Quantifiler kit, and STR analysis was carried out using the AMPfSTR NGMSElect kit. For each set of results, the mean mixing ratio was calculated and compared with the actual mixing ratio. The incorporation of MDA and MDA-MC did not sufficiently improve the mixed DNA results for all mixing ratios. Although there were significant improvements at mixing ratios of 10: 1 and 50: 1, this is insufficient, as knowledge of the actual mixing ratio prior to analysis is required. Consequently, as it stands, MDA and MDA-MC is not suitable for forensic casework. However, despite a range of actual mixing ratios from 1: 1 through to 50: 1, no mixing ratios above~ 10: 1 could be obtained, suggesting that this is the threshold at\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["834"]}
{"title": "The Use of Forensic Messenger RNA (mRNA) Analysis to Determine Stain Age\n", "abstract": " After attending this presentation, attendees will understand the principles of forensic mRNA analysis and learn how it may be used as a method to determine the age of biological stains found at crime scenes.  This presentation will impact the forensic science community by proposing a novel method for determining the age of biological stains. The proposed method could prove crucial for forensic casework and could run parallel to the predominant DNA analysis method. Where DNA analysis is used to identify a suspect, mRNA analysis could be used to determine the age of biological stains, that in turn could place the suspect at the scene of a crime at a specific time. RNA has been presumed to be very unstable, as one of its features is that it degrades rapidly as it is broken down by ribonucleases. In previous literature however; it has been shown that RNA may be extracted from biological stains up to 16-years-old. For stain age determination, it has been suggested that using a decay rate ratio, derived from two endogenous controls differentially expressed within the body fluid stain, should eliminate the effect of any external decomposition factors. This should then be expressed as a linear change in mRNA expression over time.  The majority of previous research concentrates on determining the age of bloodstains. In this study, blood and saliva stains were used. The goal of the study was to try to determine the age of these biological stains by isolating mRNA and quantifying the expression of housekeeping genes 18s, GAPDH, and ACTB also known as \u03b2-Actin.

{"title": "Frequency-based Rare Events Mining in Administrative Health Data\n", "abstract": " The low occurrence rate of adverse drug reactions makes it difficult to identify risk factors from a straightforward application of association pattern discovery in large databases. In this paper, we are interested in developing a data mining approach that can use the information about rare events in sequence data in order to measure the multiple occurrences of patterns in the whole period of target and non-target data. To address this, we define an interestingness measure which exploits the difference between the frequency of patterns in target and non-target sequence data. The proposed approach guarantees the easy generation of candidate patterns from the target sequence data by applying existing association mining algorithms. These patterns can then be evaluated by comparing their frequency in the target and non-target data. We also propose a ranking algorithm that takes into account both the rank of the patterns as determined by the interestingness measure and their supports in the target population. This algorithm can prune the patterns greatly and highlight more interesting results. Experimental results of a case study on Angioedema show the usefulness of the proposed approach.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["834"]}
{"title": "Structural pattern discovery in time series databases\n", "abstract": " This study proposes a temporal data mining method to discover qualitative and quantitative patterns in time series databases. The method performs discrete-valued time series (DIS) analysis on time series databases to search for any similarity and periodicity of patterns that are used for knowledge discovery. In our method there are three levels for mining patterns. At the first level, a structural search based on distance measure models is employed to find pattern structures; the second level performs a value-based search on the discovered patterns using a local polynomial analysis; the third level, based on hidden Markov models (HMMs), finds global patterns from a DTS set. As a result, similar and periodic patterns are successfully extracted.

But the black disc jockey has been more than an announcer. He has transcended his job as a radio station employee and becomes in many cases, a cultural hero, an individual admired and respected for his work in the black community, his concern for his fellow man, and his ability to effectuate changes in society. This study compares early black disc jockeys (1940-50) with those of a later period (1960-80) to illustrate the various roles each group has played in the community. The earlier group was characterized by the music its members played (mostly jazz, blues, and later rhythm and blues), their language patterns, and their personalities. Their styles developed from the clash of urban and rural cultures that helped define their lives. These early black disc jockeys appealed to the lower class southern migrants by speaking their language and reminding them of \u201cdown home.\u201d Today's black disc jockeys generally do not enjoy the prestige and status that the early jockeys did.
