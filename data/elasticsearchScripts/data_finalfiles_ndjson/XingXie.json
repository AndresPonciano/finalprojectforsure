In this paper, we propose GraphGAN, an innovative graph representation learning framework unifying above two classes of methods, in which the generative model and discriminative model play a game-theoretical minimax game. Specifically, for a given vertex, the generative model tries to fit its underlying true connectivity distribution over all other vertices and produces\" fake\" samples to fool the discriminative model, while the discriminative model tries to detect whether the sampled vertex is from ground truth or generated by the generative model. With the competition between these two models, both of them can alternately and iteratively boost their performance.

Collapse-to-zoom addresses this issue by offering an alternative exploration strategy. In addition to allowing users to zoom into relevant areas, collapse-to-zoom allows users to collapse areas deemed irrelevant, such as columns containing menus, archive material, or advertising. Collapsing content causes all remaining content to expand in size causing it to reveal more detail, which increases the user's chance of identifying relevant content.

With a large amount of user activity data accumulated, it is crucial to exploit user sequential behavior for sequential recommendations. Conventionally, user general taste and recent demand are combined to promote recommendation performances. However, existing methods often neglect that user long-term preference keep evolving over time, and building a static representation for user general taste may not adequately reflect the dynamic characters. Moreover, they integrate user-item or itemitem interactions through a linear way which limits the capability of model. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel two-layer hierarchical attention network, which takes the above properties into account, to recommend the next item user might be interested. Specifically, the first attention layer learns user long-term preferences based on the historical purchased item representation, while the second one outputs final user representation through coupling user long-term and short-term preferences.

This approach, however, requires that we (i) impose a limit h on the recursion depth in the splitting of Omega and (ii) set the noise in each count to be proportional to h. The choice of h is a serious dilemma: a small h makes the resulting histogram too coarse-grained, while a large h leads to excessive noise in the tuple counts used in deciding whether sub-domains should be split.

The classification system attempts to classify the object of a target image based on similarity of the target image to the classified images. To classify a target image, the classification system identifies the classified images of the collection that are most similar to the target image based on similarity between salient points of the target image and the classified images.

Most previous works employ matrix factorization techniques to learn the latent factors of users and items. And many subsequent works consider external information, e.g., social relationships of users and items\u2019 attributions, to improve the recommendation performance under the matrix factorization framework. However, matrix factorization methods may not make full use of the limited information from rating or check-in matrices, and achieve unsatisfying results. Recently, deep learning has proven able to learn good representation in natural language processing, image classification, and so on.

{"title": "Reconstructing individual mobility from smart card transactions: A space alignment approach\n", "abstract": " Smart card transactions capture rich information of human mobility and urban dynamics, therefore are of particular interest to urban planners and location-based service providers. However, since most transaction systems are only designated for billing purpose, typically, fine-grained location information, such as the exact boarding and alighting stops of a bus trip, is only partially or not available at all, which blocks deep exploitation of this rich and valuable data at individual level. This paper presents a \"space alignment\" framework to reconstruct individual mobility history from a large-scale smart card transaction dataset pertaining to a metropolitan city.

Accuracy and explainability are two core aspects when we evaluate a recommendation model and have become one of the fundamental trade-offs in machine learning. In this paper, we propose to alleviate the trade-off between accuracy and explainability by developing an explainable deep model that combines the advantages of deep learning-based models and existing explainable methods. The basic idea is to build an initial network based on an explainable deep hierarchy (eg, Microsoft Concept Graph) and improve the model accuracy by optimizing key variables in the hierarchy (eg, node importance and relevance). To ensure accurate rating prediction, we propose an attentive multi-view learning framework. The framework enables us to handle sparse and noisy data by co-regularizing among different feature levels and combining predictions attentively. To mine readable explanations from the hierarchy, we formulate personalized explanation generation as a constrained tree node selection problem and propose a dynamic programming algorithm to solve it.

{"title": "Little Is Much: Bridging Cross-Platform Behaviors through Overlapped Crowds\n", "abstract": " People often use multiple platforms to fulfill their different information needs. With the ultimate goal of serving people intelligently, a fundamental way is to get comprehensive understanding about user needs. How to organically integrate and bridge cross-platform information in a human-centric way is important. Existing transfer learning assumes either fully-overlapped or non-overlapped among the users. However, the real case is the users of different platforms are partially overlapped. The number of overlapped users is often small and the explicitly known overlapped users is even less due to the lacking of unified ID for a user across different platforms. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised transfer learning method to address the problem of cross-platform behavior prediction, called XPTrans. To alleviate the sparsity issue, it fully exploits the small number of overlapped crowds to optimally bridge a user's behaviors in different platforms. Extensive experiments across two real social networks show that XPTrans significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art. We demonstrate that by fully exploiting 26% overlapped users, XPTrans can predict the behaviors of non-overlapped users with the same accuracy as overlapped users, which means the small overlapped crowds can successfully bridge the information across different platforms.", "num_citations": "55\n", "authors": ["1166"]}

Therefore, mobile IR is a subset of traditional IR. As mobile IR moves to the fore, two main themes characterize research in this growing area: context awareness and content adaptation. In a broad sense, content adaptation fits the input into the mobile device, and context awareness analyzes the output from the mobile device to the user, which can also be fed back to the device. Figure 1 gives an overview of mobile IR. Traditional IR focuses on processing content such as text, graphics, animation, sound, speech, image, video, and their different combinations. Mobile IR analyzes both the content and the context to extract useful information and relationships that traditional IR can\u2019t perform.

This problem considerably limits the amount of query trajectories whose predicted destinations can be inferred.

Furthermore, the learned representations are disentangled with latent preference factors by a neighborhood routing algorithm, which can enhance expressiveness and interpretability. A preference regularizer is also designed to force each disentangled subspace to independently reflect an isolated preference, improving the quality of the disentangled representations.

Our method can leverage the useful information in the behaviors of massive number users to train accurate news recommendation models and meanwhile remove the need of centralized storage of them. More specifically, on each user device we keep a local copy of the news recommendation model, and compute gradients of the local model based on the user behaviors in this device. The local gradients from a group of randomly selected users are uploaded to server, which are further aggregated to update the global model in the server. Since the model gradients may contain some implicit private information, we apply local differential privacy (LDP) to them before uploading for better privacy protection. The updated global model is then distributed to each user device for local model update. We repeat this process for multiple rounds.

Compared against baseline algorithms, the proposed approach enhances precision by 22% and pooled recall by 17%. The use of size-based granularity to compute similarity makes the approach more robust against changes in the context model in comparison to graph-based methods, facilitating import of existing knowledge repositories and end-user defined vocabularies (folksonomies).

Updating is incrementally performed and only triggered when the new image data is large enough or diverse enough relative to the image data currently in use for image retrieval. Incremental updating updates the leaf nodes of a vocabulary tree based upon the new image data. Each leaf node's feature frequency is evaluated against upper and/or lower threshold values, to modify the nodes of the tree based on the feature frequency. Upon completion of the incremental updating, a server that performed the incremental updating is switched to an active state with respect to handling client queries for image retrieval, and another server that was actively handling client queries is switched to an inactive state, awaiting a subsequent incremental updating before switching back to active state.", "num_citations": "30\n", "authors": ["1166"]}

Since the entities (users and so on) and edges (links among entities) are of multiple types, the released social network is a heterogeneous information network. Prior work has shown how privacy can be compromised in homogeneous information networks by the use of specific types of graph patterns. We show how the extra information derived from heterogeneity can be used to relax these assumptions. To characterize and demonstrate this added threat, we formally define privacy risk in an anonymized heterogeneous information network to identify the vulnerability in the possible way such data are released, and further present a new de-anonymization attack that exploits the vulnerability.

The performance of individual models showed high variability across time, geospatial units, and forecast horizons. Half of the models evaluated showed better accuracy than a na\u00efve baseline model.

The key idea is to extract imperfect path demonstrations with minimum labeling efforts and effectively leverage these demonstrations to guide path finding.

Existing GNN-based recommendation methods rely on centralized storage of user-item graphs and centralized model learning. However, user data is privacy-sensitive, and the centralized storage of user-item graphs may arouse privacy concerns and risk. In this paper, we propose a federated framework for privacy-preserving GNN-based recommendation, which can collectively train GNN models from decentralized user data and meanwhile exploit high-order user-item interaction information with privacy well protected. In our method, we locally train GNN model in each user client based on the user-item graph inferred from the local user-item interaction data. Each client uploads the local gradients of GNN to a server for aggregation, which are further sent to user clients for updating local GNN models. Since local gradients may contain private information, we apply local differential privacy techniques to the local gradients to protect user privacy. In addition, in order to protect the items that users have interactions with, we propose to incorporate randomly sampled items as pseudo interacted items for anonymity. To incorporate high-order user-item interactions, we propose a user-item graph expansion method that can find neighboring users with co-interacted items and exchange their embeddings for expanding the local user-item graphs in a privacy-preserving way.

In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving medical NER method based on federated learning, which can leverage the labeled data in different platforms to boost the training of medical NER model and remove the need of exchanging raw data among different platforms. Since the labeled data in different platforms usually has some differences in entity type and annotation criteria, instead of constraining different platforms to share the same model, we decompose the medical NER model in each platform into a shared module and a private module. The private module is used to capture the characteristics of the local data in each platform, and is updated using local labeled data. The shared module is learned across different medical platform to capture the shared NER knowledge. Its local gradients from different platforms are aggregated to update the global shared module, which is further delivered to each platform to update their local shared modules.

Among all matching methods, attention mechanism plays an important role in capturing the semantic relations and properly aligning the elements of two sentences. Previous methods utilized attention mechanism to select important parts of sentences at one time. However, the important parts of the sentence during semantic matching are dynamically changing with the degree of sentence understanding. Selecting the important parts at one time may be insufficient for semantic understanding. To this end, we propose a Dynamic Re-read Network (DRr-Net) approach for sentence semantic matching, which is able to pay close attention to a small region of sentences at each step and re-read the important words for better sentence semantic understanding. To be specific, we first employ Attention Stack-GRU (ASG) unit to model the original sentence repeatedly and preserve all the information from bottom-most word embedding input to up-most recurrent output. Second, we utilize Dynamic Re-read (DRr) unit to pay close attention to one important word at one time with the consideration of learned information and re-read the important words for better sentence semantic understanding.

{"title": "Reviews Meet Graphs: Enhancing User and Item Representations for Recommendation with Hierarchical Attentive Graph Neural Network\n", "abstract": " User and item representation learning is critical for recommendation. Many of existing recommendation methods learn representations of users and items based on their ratings and reviews. However, the user-user and item-item relatedness are usually not considered in these methods, which may be insufficient. In this paper, we propose a neural recommendation approach which can utilize useful information from both review content and user-item graphs. Since reviews and graphs have different characteristics, we propose to use a multi-view learning framework to incorporate them as different views. In the review content-view, we propose to use a hierarchical model to first learn sentence representations from words, then learn review representations from sentences, and finally learn user/item representations from reviews. In addition, we propose to incorporate a three-level attention network into this view to select important words, sentences and reviews for learning informative user and item representations. In the graph-view, we propose a hierarchical graph neural network to jointly model the user-item, user-user and item-item relatedness by capturing the first-and second-order interactions between users and items in the user-item graph. In addition, we apply attention mechanism to model the importance of these interactions to learn informative user and item representations.

A critical demand along this line is to predict the future product adoption state of each user, which enables a wide range of applications such as targeted marketing. Nevertheless, previous works only aimed at predicting if a user would adopt a particular product or not with a binary buy-or-not representation. The problem of tracking and predicting users' adoption rates, i.e., the frequency and regularity of using each product over time, is still under-explored. To this end, we present a comprehensive study of product adoption rate prediction in a competitive market. This task is nontrivial as there are three major challenges in modeling users' complex adoption states: the heterogeneous data sources around users, the unique user\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1166"]}
{"title": "Lifting the Predictability of Human Mobility on Activity Trajectories\n", "abstract": " Mobility prediction has recently attracted plenty of attention since it plays an important part in many applications ranging from urban planning and traffic forecasting to location-based services, including mobile recommendation and mobile advertisement. However, there is little study on exploiting the activity information, being often associated with the trajectories on which prediction is based, for assisting location prediction. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Time-stamped Activity INference Enhanced Predictor (TAINEP) for forecasting next location on activity trajectories. In TAINEP, we propose to leverage topic models for dimension reduction so as to capture co-occurrences of different time-stamped activities. It is then extended to incorporate temporal dependence between topics of consecutive time-stamped activities to infer the activity which may be conducted at the next location and the time when it will\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1166"]}

It may lead to some biases related to sensitive user attributes in the recommendation results, eg, always recommending sports news to male users, which is unfair since users may not receive diverse news information. In this paper, we propose a fairness-aware news recommendation approach with decomposed adversarial learning and orthogonality regularization, which can alleviate unfairness in news recommendation brought by the biases of sensitive user attributes. In our approach, we propose to decompose the user interest model into two components. One component aims to learn a bias-aware user embedding that captures the bias information on sensitive user attributes, and the other aims to learn a bias-free user embedding that only encodes attribute-independent user interest information for fairnessaware news recommendation. In addition, we propose to apply an attribute prediction task to the bias-aware user embedding to enhance its ability on bias modeling, and we apply adversarial learning to the bias-free user embedding to remove the bias information from it. Moreover, we propose an orthogonality regularization method to encourage the bias-free user embeddings to be orthogonal to the bias-aware one to better distinguish the bias-free user embedding from the bias-aware one.

We propose \\textit{Graph Convolution Machine} (GCM), an end-to-end framework that consists of three components: an encoder, graph convolution (GC) layers, and a decoder. The encoder projects users, items, and contexts into embedding vectors, which are passed to the GC layers that refine user and item embeddings with context-aware graph convolutions on user-item graph. The decoder digests the refined embeddings to output the prediction score by considering the interactions among user, item, and context embeddings.

A straightforward solution is eliminating the annoying horizontal scrolling requirement, i.e. present all the contents into a single narrow column, usually named one-column view. It is implemented by deleting the layout that will cause horizontal scrolling. However, after deleting the layout structure, some structural information becomes unreadable, like data tables. In this paper, we propose an approach to improve web browsing on small devices by classifying HTML tables into data tables and layout tables. For data tables, we try to preserve the original structural information in the final presentation. Therefore, the browsing experience can be improved for the one-column view.

Many existing methods model users based on their behaviors and the labeled data of target tasks. However, these methods cannot exploit useful information in unlabeled user behavior data, and their performance may be not optimal when labeled data is scarce. Motivated by pre-trained language models which are pre-trained on large-scale unlabeled corpus to empower many downstream tasks, in this paper we propose to pre-train user models from large-scale unlabeled user behaviors data. We propose two self-supervision tasks for user model pre-training. The first one is masked behavior prediction, which can model the relatedness between historical behaviors. The second one is next  behavior prediction, which can model the relatedness between past and future behaviors. The pre-trained user models are finetuned in downstream tasks to learn task-specific user representations.

Precise user interest modeling is critical for personalized news recommendation. Existing news recommendation methods usually rely on the implicit feedback of users like news clicks to model user interest. However, news click may not necessarily reflect user interests because users may click a news due to the attraction of its title but feel disappointed at its content. The dwell time of news reading is an important clue for user interest modeling, since short reading dwell time usually indicates low and even negative interest. Thus, incorporating the negative feedback inferred from the dwell time of news reading can improve the quality of user modeling.

{"title": "Sampling-Decomposable Generative Adversarial Recommender\n", "abstract": " Recommendation techniques are important approaches for alleviating information overload. Being often trained on implicit user feedback, many recommenders suffer from the sparsity challenge due to the lack of explicitly negative samples. The GAN-style recommenders (i.e., IRGAN) addresses the challenge by learning a generator and a discriminator adversarially, such that the generator produces increasingly difficult samples for the discriminator to accelerate optimizing the discrimination objective. However, producing samples from the generator is very time-consuming, and our empirical study shows that the discriminator performs poor in top-k item recommendation. To this end, a theoretical analysis is made for the GAN-style algorithms, showing that the generator of limit capacity is diverged from the optimal generator. This may interpret the limitation of discriminator's performance. Based on these findings, we propose a Sampling-Decomposable Generative Adversarial Recommender (SD-GAR). In the framework, the divergence between some generator and the optimum is compensated by self-normalized importance sampling; the efficiency of sample generation is improved with a sampling-decomposable generator, such that each sample can be generated in O(1) with the Vose-Alias method. Interestingly, due to decomposability of sampling, the generator can be optimized with the closed-form solutions in an alternating manner, being different from policy gradient in the GAN-style algorithms. We extensively evaluate the proposed algorithm with five real-world recommendation datasets.

Instead of a single user embedding, in our method each user is represented in a hierarchical interest tree to better capture their diverse and multi-grained interest in news. We use a three-level hierarchy to represent 1) overall user interest; 2) user interest in coarse-grained topics like sports; and 3) user interest in fine-grained topics like football.

In recent years, they have become one of the most lucrative channels for marketing. As the fundamental basis of search ads, relevance modeling has attracted increasing attention due to the significant research challenges and tremendous practical value. Most existing approaches solely rely on the semantic information in the input query-ad pair, while the pure semantic information in the short ads data is not sufficient to fully identify user's search intents. Our motivation lies in incorporating the tremendous amount of unsupervised user behavior data from the historical search logs as the complementary graph to facilitate relevance modeling. In this paper, we extensively investigate how to naturally fuse the semantic textual information with the user behavior graph, and further propose three novel AdsGNN models to aggregate topological neighborhood from the perspectives of nodes, edges and tokens. Furthermore, two critical but rarely investigated problems, domain-specific pre-training and long-tail ads matching, are studied thoroughly.

On the one hand, recommendation system requires the comprehensive inclusion of user's interested candidates, yet typical deep user modeling approaches would represent each user as an onefold vector, which is hard to capture user's diverse interests. On the other hand, for the sake of practicability, the candidate generation process needs to be both accurate and efficient. Although existing\" multi-channel structures'', like memory networks, are more capable of representing user's diverse interests, they may bring in substantial irrelevant candidates and lead to rapid growth of temporal cost.

{"title": "Neural News Recommendation with Heterogeneous User Behavior\n", "abstract": " News recommendation is important for online news platforms to help users find interested news and alleviate information overload. Existing news recommendation methods usually rely on the news click history to model user interest. However, these methods may suffer from the data sparsity problem, since the news click behaviors of many users in online news platforms are usually very limited. Fortunately, some other kinds of user behaviors such as webpage browsing and search queries can also provide useful clues of users\u2019 news reading interest. In this paper, we propose a neural news recommendation approach which can exploit heterogeneous user behaviors. Our approach contains two major modules, ie, news representation and user representation. In the news representation module, we learn representations of news from their titles via CNN networks, and apply attention networks to select important words. In the user representation module, we propose an attentive multi-view learning framework to learn unified representations of users from their heterogeneous behaviors such as search queries, clicked news and browsed webpages. In addition, we use word-and record-level attentions to select informative words and behavior records. Experiments on a real-world dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1166"]}

Existing methods usually rely on single kind of user behavior for user modeling and ignore the textual information in ads and user behaviors. In this paper, we propose a neural approach for native ad CTR prediction which can incorporate different kinds of user behaviors to model user interests, and can fully exploit the textual information in ads and user behaviors to learn accurate ad and user representations.

Conventionally, user representations are generated purely in the offline stage. Without referencing to the specific candidate item for recommendation, it is difficult to fully capture user preference from the perspective of interest. More recent algorithms tend to generate user representation at runtime, where user\u2019s historical behaviors are attentively summarized wrt the presented candidate item. In spite of the improved efficacy, it is too expensive for many real-world scenarios because of the repetitive access to user\u2019s entire history. In this work, a novel user representation framework, Hi-Fi Ark, is proposed. With Hi-Fi Ark, user history is summarized into highly compact and complementary vectors in the offline stage, known as archives. Meanwhile, user preference towards a specific candidate item can be precisely captured via the attentive aggregation of such archives. As a result, both deployment feasibility and superior recommendation efficacy are achieved by Hi-Fi Ark. The effectiveness of Hi-Fi Ark is empirically validated on three real-world datasets, where remarkable and consistent improvements are made over a variety of well-recognized baseline methods.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1166"]}
{"title": "Personalized Multimedia Item and Key Frame Recommendation\n", "abstract": " When recommending or advertising items to users, an emerging trend is to present each multimedia item with a key frame image (e.g., the poster of a movie). As each multimedia item can be represented as multiple fine-grained visual images (e.g., related images of the movie), personalized key frame recommendation is necessary in these applications to attract users' unique visual preferences. However, previous personalized key frame recommendation models relied on users' fine-grained image behavior of multimedia items (e.g., user-image interaction behavior), which is often not available in real scenarios. In this paper, we study the general problem of joint multimedia item and key frame recommendation in the absence of the fine-grained user-image behavior. We argue that the key challenge of this problem lies in discovering users' visual profiles for key frame recommendation, as most recommendation models would fail without any users' fine-grained image behavior. To tackle this challenge, we leverage users' item behavior by projecting users (items) in two latent spaces: a collaborative latent space and a visual latent space. We further design a model to discern both the collaborative and visual dimensions of users, and model how users make decisive item preferences from these two spaces. As a result, the learned user visual profiles could be directly applied for key frame recommendation. Finally, experimental results on a real-world dataset clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed model on the two recommendation tasks.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1166"]}

Normally, matrix completion considers a single matrix, which can be a noisy image or a rating matrix in recommendation. In practice however, data is often obtained from multiple domains rather than a single domain. For example, in recommendation, multiple matrices may exist as user x movie and user x book, while correlations among the multiple domains can be reasonably exploited to improve the quality of matrix completion. In this paper, we consider the problem of aligned matrix completion, where multiple matrices are recovered that correspond to different representations of the same group of objects.

A core assumption behind these methods is that news click behaviors can indicate user interest.

Native ad CTR prediction is useful for improving user experience and platform revenue. However, it is challenging due to the lack of explicit user intent, and users' behaviors on the platform with native ads may not be sufficient to infer their interest in ads. Fortunately, user behaviors exist on many online platforms and they can provide complementary information for user interest mining. Thus, leveraging multi-platform user behaviors is useful for native ad CTR prediction. However, user behaviors are highly privacy-sensitive and the behavior data on different platforms cannot be directly aggregated due to user privacy concerns and data protection regulations like GDPR. Existing CTR prediction methods usually require centralized storage of user behavior data for user modeling and cannot be directly applied to the CTR prediction task with multi-platform user behaviors. In this paper, we propose a federated native ad CTR prediction method named FedCTR, which can learn user interest representations from their behaviors on multiple platforms in a privacy-preserving way. On each platform a local user model is used to learn user embeddings from the local user behaviors on that platform.

{"title": "Enhancing Graph Neural Networks via auxiliary training for semi-supervised node classification\n", "abstract": " Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successfully applied to graph analysis tasks. As a canonical task in graph analysis, node classification has achieved promising results with GNNs. However, training GNNs remains challenging when training samples are limited. For the node classification task, only the known node labels are used as supervision information to train GNNs, while the implicit information of pairwise relationships between nodes is neglected. The label-to-label relationship of node pairs is explicit in labeled nodes and not utilized. Moreover, it is found that the link relationship in a graph is correlated with the labels between nodes in some graphs, like information network. Based on that, we can extract and establish labels for pairwise nodes. With the supervision of labeled pairwise nodes, it can force the predicted labels to conform to the observed pairwise relationships and provide some useful\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1166"]}
{"title": "GraphFormers: GNN-nested Transformers for Representation Learning on Textual Graph\n", "abstract": " The representation learning on textual graph is to generate low-dimensional embeddings for the nodes based on the individual textual features and the neighbourhood information. Recent breakthroughs on pretrained language models and graph neural networks push forward the development of corresponding techniques. The existing works mainly rely on the cascaded model architecture: the textual features of nodes are independently encoded by language models at first; the textual embeddings are aggregated by graph neural networks afterwards. However, the above architecture is limited due to the independent modeling of textual features. In this work, we propose GraphFormers, where layerwise GNN components are nested alongside the transformer blocks of language models. With the proposed architecture, the text encoding and the graph aggregation are fused into an iterative workflow, making each node's semantic accurately comprehended from the global perspective. In addition, a progressive learning strategy is introduced, where the model is successively trained on manipulated data and original data to reinforce its capability of integrating information on graph. Extensive evaluations are conducted on three large-scale benchmark datasets, where GraphFormers outperform the SOTA baselines with comparable running efficiency.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1166"]}
{"title": "Training Large-Scale News Recommenders with Pretrained Language Models in the Loop\n", "abstract": " News recommendation calls for deep insights of news articles' underlying semantics. Therefore, pretrained language models (PLMs), like BERT and RoBERTa, may substantially contribute to the recommendation quality. However, it's extremely challenging to have news recommenders trained together with such big models: the learning of news recommenders requires intensive news encoding operations, whose cost is prohibitive if PLMs are used as the news encoder. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, {SpeedyFeed}, which efficiently trains PLMs-based news recommenders of superior quality. SpeedyFeed is highlighted for its light-weighted encoding pipeline, which gives rise to three major advantages. Firstly, it makes the intermedia results fully reusable for the training workflow, which removes most of the repetitive but redundant encoding operations. Secondly, it improves the data efficiency of the training workflow, where non-informative data can be eliminated from encoding. Thirdly, it further saves the cost by leveraging simplified news encoding and compact news representation. Extensive experiments show that SpeedyFeed leads to more than 100 acceleration of the training process, which enables big models to be trained efficiently and effectively over massive user data. The well-trained PLMs-based model from SpeedyFeed demonstrates highly competitive performance, where it outperforms the state-of-the-art news recommenders with significant margins. SpeedyFeed is also a model-agnostic framework, which is potentially applicable to a wide spectrum of content-based recommender systems; therefore, the whole\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1166"]}
{"title": "Multi-Interest-Aware User Modeling for Large-Scale Sequential Recommendations\n", "abstract": " Precise user modeling is critical for online personalized recommendation services. Generally, users' interests are diverse and are not limited to a single aspect, which is particularly evident when their behaviors are observed for a longer time. For example, a user may demonstrate interests in cats/dogs, dancing and food \\& delights when browsing short videos on Tik Tok; the same user may show interests in real estate and women's wear in her web browsing behaviors. Traditional models tend to encode a user's behaviors into a single embedding vector, which do not have enough capacity to effectively capture her diverse interests. This paper proposes a Sequential User Matrix (SUM) to accurately and efficiently capture users' diverse interests. SUM models user behavior with a multi-channel network, with each channel representing a different aspect of the user's interests. User states in different channels are updated by an \\emph{erase-and-add} paradigm with interest- and instance-level attention. We further propose a local proximity debuff component and a highway connection component to make the model more robust and accurate. SUM can be maintained and updated incrementally, making it feasible to be deployed for large-scale online serving. We conduct extensive experiments on two datasets. Results demonstrate that SUM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1166"]}

{"title": "REKER: Relation Extraction with Knowledge of Entity and Relation\n", "abstract": " Relation Extraction (RE) is an important task to mine knowledge from massive text corpus. Existing relation extraction methods usually purely rely on the textual information of sentences to predict the relations between entities. The useful knowledge of entity and relation is not fully exploited. In fact, off-the-shelf knowledge bases can provide rich information of entities and relations, such as the concepts of entities and the semantic descriptions of relations, which have the potential to enhance the performance of relation extraction. In this paper, we propose a neural relation extraction approach with the knowledge of entity and relation (REKER) which can incorporate the useful knowledge of entity and relation into relation extraction. Specifically, we propose to learn the concept embeddings of entities and use them to enhance the representation of sentences.

{"title": "A Novel User Representation Paradigm for Making Personalized Candidate Retrieval\n", "abstract": " Candidate retrieval is a fundamental issue in recommendation system. Given user's recommendation request, relevant candidates need to be retrieved in realtime for subsequent ranking operations. Considering that the retrieval operation is conducted over considerable items, it has to be both precise and scalable so that high-quality candidates can be acquired within tolerable latency. Unfortunately, conventional methods would trade off precision for high running efficiency, which leads to inferior retrieval quality. In contrast, those deep learning-based approaches can be highly accurate in identifying relevant items; yet, they are unsuitable for candidate retrieval due to their inherent limitation on scalability. In this work, a novel framework is proposed to address the above challenges. The underlying intuition is to rely on a well-trained ranking model for the supervision of an efficient retrieval model, such that it will unify the scalability and precision as a whole. We have implemented our conceptual framework and made comprehensive evaluation for it, where promising results are achieved against representative baselines.

{"title": "Predicting Social Status via Social Networks: A Case Study on University, Occupation, and Region\n", "abstract": " Social status refers to the relative position within the society. It is an important notion in sociology and related research. The problem of measuring social status has been studied for many years. Various indicators are proposed to assess social status of individuals, including educational attainment, occupation, and income/wealth. However, these indicators are sometimes difficult to collect or measure. We investigate social networks for alternative measures of social status. Online activities expose certain traits of users in the real world. We are interested in how these activities are related to social status, and how social status can be predicted with social network data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on connecting online activities with social status in reality. In particular, we focus on the network structure of microblogs in this study. A user following another implies some kind of status. We cast the predicted social status of users to the \"status\" of real-world entities, e.g., universities, occupations, and regions, so that we can compare and validate predicted results with facts in the real world. We propose an efficient algorithm for this task and evaluate it on a dataset consisting of 3.4 million users from Sina Weibo. The result shows that it is possible to predict social status with reasonable accuracy using social network data. We also point out challenges and limitations of this approach, e.g., inconsistence between online popularity and real-world status for certain users. Our findings provide insights on analyzing online social status and future designs of ranking schemes for social networks.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1166"]}
