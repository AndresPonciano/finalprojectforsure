It is primarily evaluated using events containing a pair of muons from the decay of  bosons. The efficiency of the single-muon trigger is measured for muons with transverse momentum 25 <  < 100 GeV, with a statistical uncertainty of less than 0.01% and a systematic uncertainty of 0.6%. The  range for efficiency determination is extended by using muons from decays of  mesons,  bosons, and top quarks. The muon trigger shows highly uniform and stable performance. The performance is compared to the prediction of a detailed simulation.", "num_citations": "1995\n", "authors": ["298"]}
{"title": "Combining lexicon-based and learning-based methods for Twitter sentiment analysis\n", "abstract": " With the booming of microblogs on the Web, people have begun to express their opinions on a wide variety of topics on Twitter and other similar services. Sentiment analysis on entities (eg, products, organizations, people, etc.) in tweets (posts on Twitter) thus becomes a rapid and effective way of gauging public opinion for business marketing or social studies. However, Twitter's unique characteristics give rise to new problems for current sentiment analysis methods, which originally focused on large opinionated corpora such as product reviews. In this paper, we propose a new entity-level sentiment analysis method for Twitter. The method first adopts a lexiconbased approach to perform entity-level sentiment analysis. This method can give high precision, but low recall. To improve recall, additional tweets that are likely to be opinionated are identified automatically by exploiting the information in the result of the lexicon-based method. A classifier is then trained to assign polarities to the entities in the newly identified tweets. Instead of being labeled manually, the training examples are given by the lexicon-based approach. Experimental results show that the proposed method dramatically improves the recall and the F-score, and outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.", "num_citations": "522\n", "authors": ["298"]}

It is revealed that reactive hydrogen species, inevitable in hydrocarbon-based growth, are damaging to the formation of sp2-like SWNTs in a diameter-dependent manner. The addition of oxygen scavenges H species and provides a powerful control over the C/H ratio to favor SWNT growth. The revelation of the roles played by hydrogen and oxygen leads to a unified and universal optimum-growth condition for SWNTs. Further, a versatile method is developed to form V-SWNT films on any substrate, lifting a major substrate-type limitation for aligned SWNTs.", "num_citations": "513\n", "authors": ["298"]}

{"title": "Targeted gene knockout in mammalian cells by using engineered zinc-finger nucleases\n", "abstract": " Gene knockout is the most powerful tool for determining gene function or permanently modifying the phenotypic characteristics of a cell. Existing methods for gene disruption are limited by their efficiency, time to completion, and/or the potential for confounding off-target effects. Here, we demonstrate a rapid single-step approach to targeted gene knockout in mammalian cells, using engineered zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs). ZFNs can be designed to target a chosen locus with high specificity. Upon transient expression of these nucleases the target gene is first cleaved by the ZFNs and then repaired by a natural\u2014but imperfect\u2014DNA repair process, nonhomologous end joining. This often results in the generation of mutant (null) alleles. As proof of concept for this approach we designed ZFNs to target the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line.

The observations are interpreted with a global 3-D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). OMI NO2 satellite observations constrain Asian anthropogenic NOx emissions and indicate a factor of 2 increase from 2000 to 2006 in China. Satellite observations of CO from AIRS and TES indicate two major events of Asian transpacific pollution during INTEX-B. Correlation between TES CO and ozone observations shows evidence for transpacific ozone pollution. The semi-permanent Pacific High and Aleutian Low cause splitting of transpacific pollution plumes over the Northeast Pacific. The northern branch circulates around the Aleutian Low and has little impact on North America. The southern branch circulates around the Pacific High and some of that air impacts western North America. Both aircraft measurements and model results show sustained ozone production driven by peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN) decomposition in the southern branch, roughly doubling the transpacific influence from ozone produced in the Asian boundary layer. Model simulation of ozone observations at Mt. Bachelor Observatory in Oregon (2.7 km altitude) indicates a mean Asian ozone pollution contribution of 9\u00b13 ppbv to the mean observed concentration of 54 ppbv, reflecting mostly an enhancement in background ozone rather than episodic Asian plumes.

The inversion uses the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model (CTM) and its adjoint applied to MOPITT, AIRS, and SCIAMACHY. Observations from TES, surface sites (NOAA/GMD), and aircraft (MOZAIC) are used for evaluation of the a posteriori solution. Using GEOS-Chem as a common intercomparison platform shows global consistency between the different satellite datasets and with the in situ data. Differences can be largely explained by different averaging kernels and a priori information. The global CO emission from combustion as constrained in the inversion is 1350 Tg a\u22121. This is much higher than current bottom-up emission inventories. A large fraction of the correction results from a seasonal underestimate of CO sources at northern mid-latitudes in winter and suggests a larger-than-expected CO source from vehicle cold starts and residential heating. Implementing this seasonal variation of emissions solves the long-standing problem of models underestimating CO in the northern extratropics in winter-spring. A posteriori emissions also indicate a general underestimation of biomass burning in the GFED2 inventory.

{"title": "Impact of mineral dust on nitrate, sulfate, and ozone in transpacific Asian pollution plumes\n", "abstract": " We use a 3-D global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) to interpret aircraft observations of nitrate and sulfate partitioning in transpacific dust plumes during the INTEX-B campaign of April\u2013May 2006. The model includes explicit transport of size-resolved mineral dust and its alkalinity, nitrate, and sulfate content. The observations show that particulate nitrate is primarily associated with dust, sulfate is primarily associated with ammonium, and Asian dust remains alkaline across the Pacific. This can be reproduced in the model by using a reactive uptake coefficient for HNO3 on dust (\u03b3(HNO3) ~10\u22123) much lower than commonly assumed in models and possibly reflecting limitation of uptake by dust dissolution. The model overestimates gas-phase HNO3 by a factor of 2\u20133, typical of previous model studies; we show that this cannot be corrected by uptake on dust. We find that the fraction of aerosol nitrate on dust in the model increases from ~30% in fresh Asian outflow to 80\u201390% over the Northeast Pacific, reflecting in part the volatilization of ammonium nitrate and the resulting transfer of nitrate to the dust. Consumption of dust alkalinity by uptake of acid gases in the model is slow relative to the lifetime of dust against deposition, so that dust does not acidify (at least not in the bulk). This limits the potential for dust iron released by acidification to become bio-available upon dust deposition. Observations in INTEX-B show no detectable ozone depletion in Asian dust plumes, consistent with the model. Uptake of HNO3 by dust, suppressing its recycling to NOx, reduces Asian pollution influence on US surface ozone in the model by 10\u201315% or up to 1 ppb.", "num_citations": "176\n", "authors": ["298"]}

The reactivities of anthracite chars during steam gasification were found to have a good correlation to the coal volatile matter contents. The higher the coal volatile matter content, the higher the reactivity. The difference in reactivities of anthracite chars during CO2 gasification seems to be more dependent on the catalytic effect of inherent minerals in anthracite. The results show that the greater the alkali index, the higher the reactivity. The reactivities of demineralized anthracite chars vary very little compared with those the undemineralized chars at higher temperatures, whereas the reactivities of demineralized chars from Jincheng and Rujigou are lower than those of undemineralized ones and the reactivities of demineralized chars\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "168\n", "authors": ["298"]}
{"title": "Hyperspectral image denoising via noise-adjusted iterative low-rank matrix approximation\n", "abstract": " Due to the low-dimensional property of clean hyperspectral images (HSIs), many low-rank-based methods have been proposed to denoise HSIs. However, in an HSI, the noise intensity in different bands is often different, and most of the existing methods do not take this fact into consideration. In this paper, a noise-adjusted iterative low-rank matrix approximation (NAILRMA) method is proposed for HSI denoising. Based on the low-rank property of HSIs, the patchwise low-rank matrix approximation (LRMA) is established. To further separate the noise from the signal subspaces, an iterative regularization framework is proposed. Considering that the noise intensity in different bands is different, an adaptive iteration factor selection based on the noise variance of each HSI band is adopted. This noise-adjusted iteration strategy can effectively preserve the high-SNR bands and denoise the low-SNR bands. The\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "167\n", "authors": ["298"]}

We used 2004\u20132008 PM2.5 observations from ~1000 sites (~200 sites for PM2.5 components) and compared to results from the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model (CTM). All data were deseasonalized to focus on synoptic-scale correlations. We find strong positive correlations of PM2.5 components with temperature in most of the US, except for nitrate in the Southeast where the correlation is negative. Relative humidity (RH) is generally positively correlated with sulfate and nitrate but negatively correlated with organic carbon. GEOS-Chem results indicate that most of the correlations of PM2.5 with temperature and RH do not arise from direct dependence but from covariation with synoptic transport. We applied principal component analysis and regression to identify the dominant meteorological modes controlling PM2.5 variability, and show that 20\u201340% of the observed PM2.5 day-to-day variability can be explained by a single dominant meteorological mode: cold frontal passages in the eastern US and maritime inflow in the West. These and other synoptic transport modes drive most of the overall correlations of PM2.5 with temperature and RH except in the Southeast.

International representation is emphasized, with chapters from almost every major leader in the field of styles.

The book's central premise is that cognitive, learning, and thinking styles are not abilities but rather preferences in the use of abilities. Traditionally, many psychologists and educators have believed that people's successes and failures are attributable mainly to individual differences in abilities. However, for the past few decades research on the roles of thinking, learning, and cognitive styles in performance within both academic and nonacademic settings has indicated that they account for individual differences in performance that go well beyond abilities. New theories better differentiate styles from abilities and make more contact with other psychological literatures; recent research, in many cases, is more careful and conclusive than are some of the older studies. Cognitive, learning, and thinking styles are of interest to educators because they predict academic performance in ways that go beyond abilities, and because taking styles into account can help teachers to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "140\n", "authors": ["298"]}

To identify genes involved in hypoxia adaptation, we generated complete genome sequences of nine Chinese wolves from high and low altitude populations at an average coverage of 25\u00d7 coverage. We found that, beginning about 55,000 years ago, the highland Tibetan grey wolf suffered a more substantial population decline than lowland wolves. Positively selected hypoxia-related genes in highland wolves are enriched in the HIF signaling pathway (P = 1.57E-6), ATP binding (P = 5.62E-5), and response to an oxygen-containing compound (P\u22645.30E-4). Of these positively selected hypoxia-related genes, three genes (EPAS1, ANGPT1, and RYR2) had at least one specific fixed non-synonymous SNP in highland wolves based on the nine genome data. Our re-sequencing studies on a large panel of individuals showed a frequency difference greater than 58% between highland and lowland wolves for these specific fixed non-synonymous SNPs and a high degree of LD surrounding the three genes, which imply strong selection. Past studies have shown that EPAS1 and ANGPT1 are important in the response to hypoxic stress, and RYR2 is involved in heart function. These three genes also exhibited significant signals of natural selection in high altitude human populations, which suggest similar evolutionary constraints on natural selection in wolves and humans of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.", "num_citations": "133\n", "authors": ["298"]}

Traditional regimens to prevent CINV generally involved a combination of a corticosteroid plus a 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT 3) receptor antagonist (RA). In the past 10 years, antiemetic treatment has greatly advanced with the availability of the neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist (NK 1 RA) aprepitant and its prodrug fosaprepitant. NK 1 RAs have a different mechanism of action in CINV than corticosteroids and 5HT 3 RAs, thus their use can complement traditional antiemetic drugs and can enhance control of CINV.

{"title": "An effective thin cloud removal procedure for visible remote sensing images\n", "abstract": " Clouds are obstructions for land-surface observation, which result in the regional information being blurred or even lost. Thin clouds are transparent, and images of regions covered by thin clouds contain information about both the atmosphere and the ground. Therefore, thin cloud removal is a challenging task as the ground information is easily affected when the thin cloud removal is performed. An efficient and effective thin cloud removal method is proposed for visible remote sensing images in this paper, with the aim being to remove the thin clouds and also restore the ground information. Since thin cloud is considered as low-frequency information, the proposed method is based on the classic homomorphic filter and is executed in the frequency domain. The optimal cut-off frequency for each channel is determined semi-automatically.

These rules relate the base specified by a single TALE repeat to the identity of two key residues (the repeat variable diresidue, or RVD) and enable design for new sequence targets via modular shuffling of these units. A key limitation of these rules is that their simplicity precludes options for improving designs that are insufficiently active or specific. Here we address this limitation by developing an expanded set of RVDs and applying them to improve the performance of previously described TALEs. As an extreme example, total conversion of a TALE nuclease to new RVDs substantially reduced off-target cleavage in cellular studies.

The first method (in situ method) uses in situ vertical profiles for absolute instrument validation; it is limited by the sparseness of in situ data. The second method (CTM method) uses a chemical transport model (CTM) as an intercomparison platform; it provides a globally complete intercomparison with relatively small noise from model error. The third method (averaging kernel smoothing method) involves smoothing the retrieved profile from one instrument with the averaging kernel matrix of the other; it also provides a global intercomparison but dampens the actual difference between instruments and adds noise from the a priori. We apply the three methods to a full year (2006) of TES and OMI data. Comparison with in situ data from ozonesondes shows mean positive biases of 5.3 parts per billion volume (ppbv) (10%) for TES and 2.8 ppbv (5%) for OMI at 500 hPa. We show that the CTM method (using the GEOS-Chem CTM) closely approximates results from the in situ method while providing global coverage. It reveals that differences between TES and OMI are generally less than 10 ppbv (18%), except at northern mid-latitudes in summer and over tropical continents.

We isolate contributions from lightning, wildfires, the stratosphere, and California pollution. Lightning emissions are constrained by observations and wildfire emissions are estimated from daily fire reports. We find that lightning increases mean surface ozone in summer by 10 ppbv in the Intermountain West, with moderate variability. Wildfire plumes generate high-ozone events in excess of 80 ppbv in GEOS-Chem, but CASTNet ozone observations in the Intermountain West show no enhancements during these events nor do they show evidence of regional fire influence. Models may overestimate ozone production in fresh fire plumes because of inadequate chemistry and grid-scale resolution. The highest ozone concentrations observed in the Intermountain West (> 75 ppbv) in spring are associated with stratospheric intrusions. The model captures the timing of these intrusions but not their magnitude, reflecting numerical diffusion intrinsic to Eulerian models. This can be corrected statistically through a relationship between model bias and the model-diagnosed magnitude of stratospheric influence; with this correction, models may still be useful to forecast and interpret high-ozone events from stratospheric intrusions.

The MEC consisted of anodic and cathodic electrodes, on which nitrifying and denitrifying biofilms, respectively, were attached. Nitrogen removal can be enhanced at an applied voltage in the MEC. Besides, the nitrogen removal efficiency gradually increased from 70.3% to 92.6% with the increase of applied voltage from 0.2 to 0.4\u00a0V, as well as the maximum current was varied from 4.4 to 14\u00a0mA. The corresponding coulombic efficiency also increased from 82% to 94.4%, indicating that the increasing applied voltage could enhance electron extraction from ammonium during its oxidative removal.

In this study, we found that miR-30d has a critical role in modulating sensitivity of ATC cells to cisplatin, a commonly used chemotherapeutic drug for treatment of this neoplasm. Using a mimic of miR-30d, we demonstrated that miR-30d could negatively regulate the expression of beclin 1, a key autophagy gene, leading to suppression of the cisplatin-activated autophagic response that protects ATC cells from apoptosis. A reporter gene assay demonstrated that the binding sequences of miR-30d in the beclin 1-3\u2032 UTR was the region required for the inhibition of beclin 1 expression by this miRNA.

Specially, four segment-level features are designed to elevate discriminative ability for proteins from the \u03b1/\u03b2 and \u03b1+ \u03b2 classes. After the features are extracted, a multi-class non-linear support vector machine classifier is used to implement protein structural classes prediction.

Because BDNF plays a critical role in the regulation of high-frequency synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation in the hippocampus, the up-regulation of BDNF may rescue cognitive impairments and learning deficits in AD. In the present study, we investigated the effects of hippocampal BDNF in a rat model of AD produced by a ventricle injection of amyloid-\u03b21-42 (A\u03b21-42). We found that a ventricle injection of A\u03b21-42 caused learning deficits in rats subjected to the Morris water maze and decreased BDNF expression in the hippocampus. Chronic intra-hippocampal BDNF administration rescued learning deficits in the water maze, whereas infusions of NGF and NT-3 did not influence the behavioral performance of rats injected with A\u03b21-42. Furthermore, the BDNF-related improvement in learning was ERK-dependent because the inhibition of ERK, but not JNK or p38, blocked the effects of BDNF on cognitive improvement in rats injected with A\u03b21-42. Together, our data suggest that the up-regulation of BDNF in the hippocampus via activation of the ERK signaling pathway can ameliorate A\u03b21-42-induced learning deficits, thus identifying a novel pathway through which BDNF protects against AD-related cognitive impairments. The results of this research may shed light on a feasible therapeutic approach to control the progression of AD.", "num_citations": "84\n", "authors": ["298"]}

There are currently no effective treatments for infection-induced cognitive impairment. Previous studies have shown that the iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO) can increase the resistance of neurons to injury and disease by stimulating adaptive cellular stress responses. However, the impact of DFO on the cognitive sequelae of neuroinflammation is unknown. A mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cognitive impairment was established to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of DFO against LPS-induced memory deficits and neuroinflammation. Adult C57BL/6 mice were treated with 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg of DFO 3\u00a0days prior to intracerebroventricular microinjection of 2\u00a0\u03bcg of LPS. Cognitive function was assessed using a Morris water maze from post-injection days 1 to 3. Animal behavioral tests, as well as pathological and biochemical assays were performed to evaluate the LPS-induced hippocampal damage and the neuroprotective effect of DFO. Treatment of mice with LPS resulted in deficits in cognitive performance in the Morris water maze without changing locomotor activity, which were ameliorated by pretreatment with DFO. DFO prevented LPS-induced microglial activation and elevations of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 levels in the hippocampus. Moreover, DFO attenuated elevated expression of caspase-3, modulated GSK3\u03b2 activity, and prevented LPS-induced increases of MDA and SOD levels in the hippocampus.

Image fusion is an effective way to acquire the HR MS images that are widely used in various applications. In this paper, we propose an online coupled dictionary learning (OCDL) approach for image fusion, in which a superposition strategy is applied to construct the coupled dictionaries. The constructed coupled dictionaries are further developed via an iterative update to ensure that the HR MS image patch can be almost identically reconstructed by multiplying the HR dictionary and the sparse coefficient vector, which is solved by sparsely representing its counterpart LR MS image patch over the LR dictionary.

The CO emission factors for major economic sectors declined to varying degrees from 2005 to 2009, attributed to improved energy efficiency and/or emission control regulations. Total national CO emissions are estimated at 173\u00a0Tg for 2005 and have been relatively stable for subsequent years, despite fast growth of energy consumption and industrial production. While industry and transportation sources dominated CO emissions in developed eastern and north-central China, residential combustion played a much greater role in the less developed western provinces.

PaP1 has an icosahedral head with an apex diameter of 68\u201370 nm and a contractile tail with a length of 138\u2013140 nm. The PaP1 genome is a linear dsDNA molecule containing 91,715 base pairs (bp) with a G+C content of 49.36% and 12 tRNA genes. A strategy to identify the genome ends of PaP1 was designed. The genome has a 1190 bp terminal redundancy. PaP1 has 157 open reading frames (ORFs). Of these, 143 proteins are homologs of known proteins, but only 38 could be functionally identified. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry allowed identification of 12 ORFs as structural protein coding genes within the PaP1 genome. Comparative genomic analysis indicated that the Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage PaP1, JG004, PAK_P1 and vB_PaeM_C2-10_Ab1 share great similarity. Besides their similar biological characteristics, the phages contain 123 core genes and have very close phylogenetic relationships, which distinguish them from other known phage genera.

{"title": "Coverage-enhancing algorithm based on overlap-sense ratio in wireless multimedia sensor networks\n", "abstract": " Coverage area and network lifetime are major problems in wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs). In order to optimize the network coverage, we propose a coverage-enhancing algorithm based on overlap-sense ratio. By adjusting the sensing direction of the nodes, the coverage area is increased with the reduction of computational complexity. In addition, a modified strategy is presented to shut off the redundant sensors so that network lifetime is prolonged. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves more effective enhancement on network coverage compared to the existing algorithm.", "num_citations": "63\n", "authors": ["298"]}

This study was designed to estimate the prevalence of MCI and explore the possible risk factors including gender disparities among community-dwelling older individuals. The study was conducted in Xi\u2019an, China. This is a cross-sectional study. A total of 815 individuals, 60 years and older were selected by stratified random cluster sampling. Cognitive function was measured using the mini-mental status examination (MMSE), the Chinese version of the Dementia Rating Scales (CDRS) was used to apply the diagnostic of non-dementia, and activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) systems were used to functional status. The association between sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle, history of chronic diseases and MCI were evaluated separately for men and women using the Pearson \u03c72- test and binary logistic regression. Of the 815 community-dwelling individuals, 145 were found to have MCI. Overall, the prevalence of MCI was 18.5%, with a prevalence of 19.6% in women (105/535), and 15.3% (40/261) in men. The results of the binary logistical regression analysis indicated that age and history of stroke were associated with MCI in men. For women, the risk factors were lower level of educational and lack of religious attendance. Results suggested that the factors capable of influencing MCI differed profoundly between older men and older women.

FoxO transcription factors are involved in apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Therefore, the present study was designed to elucidate the potential role of FoxO3a on the CMECs injury induced by high glucose.  Materials and Methods CMECs were isolated from hearts of adult rats and cultured in normal or high glucose medium for 6 h, 12 h and 24 h respectively. To down-regulate FoxO3a expression, CMECs were transfected with FoxO3a siRNA. ROS accumulation and apoptosis in CMECs were assessed by dihydroethidine (DHE) staining and TUNEL assay respectively. Moreover, the expressions of Akt, FoxO3a, Bim and BclxL in CMECs were assessed by Western blotting assay.  Results ROS accumulation in CMECs was significantly increased after high glucose incubation for 6 to 24 h. Meanwhile, high glucose also increased apoptosis in CMECs, correlated with decreased the phosphorylation expressions of Akt and FoxO3a. Moreover, high glucose incubation increased the expression of Bim, whereas increased anti-apoptotic protein BclxL. Furthermore, siRNA target FoxO3a silencing enhanced the ROS accumulation, whereas suppressed apoptosis in CMECs. FoxO3a silencing also abolished the disturbance of Bcl-2 proteins induced by high glucose in CMECs.  Conclusion Our data provide evidence that high glucose induced FoxO3a activation which suppressed ROS accumulation, and in parallel, resulted in apoptosis of CMECs.", "num_citations": "62\n", "authors": ["298"]}

The pLEGFP-N1-hFIX vector was generated by cloning a 3.0 kb Bgl II-BamH I fragment from the pIRES2-EGFP-hFIX plasmid containing the hFIX cDNA and part of intron 1 of hFIX in pLEGFP-N1 vector. The retroviral supernatants were produced from the Phoenix packaging cell line and then infected the hUCT-MSCs. After selection with G418 for 10 day, the expression of FIX was detected by ELISA and Western blot. The biological activity of FIX was determined by the clotting assay employing human Factor IX-deficient plasma. The results showed that compared with the activity of pooled human normal plasma (100%), transduced cells produced biologically active hFIX with 100-130% activity in two-day culture supernatant and expressed hFIX at levels of 2.68+/-0.36 microg/10 (6) cells/24 hours after G418 selection for 10 days. The secretion of hFIX into culture supernatant was also confirmed by Western blot analysis.

The classical finite element polynomial approximation of the displacement field is enriched by the superposition of discontinuous pressure and shear wave functions. The continuity of the solution across the element interfaces is weakly enforced by suitable Lagrange multipliers. Higher-order rectangular DEM elements are constructed and benchmarked against the standard higher-order polynomial Galerkin elements for two-dimensional problems in the medium frequency regime. In general, it is found that for such applications, DEM can achieve the same accuracy as the p finite element method using a similar computational complexity but with about 10 times fewer degrees of freedom.

{"title": "Genetic study of families affected with aggressive periodontitis\n", "abstract": " Periodontitis is a multifactorial disease associated with several risk and susceptibility factors (66). Risk factors are part of the causal chain, or expose the host to the causal chain. The presence of a risk factor directly increases the probability of a disease occurring, and the absence of a risk factor reduces this possibility. Risk factors are modifiable. Contrary to modifiable risk factors, susceptibility factors often refer to nonmodifiable determinants or background factors, such as age, gender and genetic make-up. It is now evident that genetics form an important aspect in most diseases, including periodontitis. Elucidation of the genetic basis of periodontitis should permit a better understanding of disease etiology, allowing improved classification, diagnosis and treatment of periodontal diseases. Aggressive periodontitis (formerly termed earlyonset periodontitis, subdivided into prepubertal periodontitis, juvenile periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis) is a group of infrequent types of periodontitis, characterized by early age of onset and rapid destruction of the tooth-supporting tissues in otherwise healthy individuals (5, 51). In patients with aggressive periodontitis, exposure to local irritants usually cannot account for the marked alveolar destruction, suggesting that host factors are involved in determining susceptibility to the disease. Although a variety of factors, such as microbial, environmental and behavioral factors, and systemic disease, are suggested to influence the risk of aggressive periodontitis, an individual\u00d5s genetic make-up is a crucial factor influencing their systemic or host responserelated risk (42, 55).", "num_citations": "52\n", "authors": ["298"]}

The ATP response included an increase in inward K+ conductance and a depolarizing shift in reversal potential as determined using a voltage ramp waveform applied from \u2212120 to \u221250\u00a0mV. Fura-2 microspectrofluorescence measurements showed intracellular calcium to be increased following the application of ATP. This response was characterized by an initial transient phase, which persisted in Ca2+-free media and was due to release of Ca2+ from intracellular storage\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "52\n", "authors": ["298"]}

Graphene oxide (GO) was transformed to RGO with the appropriate pH, temperature and reducing agent/GO ratio. The RGO was characterized by ultraviolet\u2013visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, thermo-gravimetric analysis, x-ray diffraction, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and transmission electron microscopy. The RGO aqueous suspension showed extraordinary stability in the absence of any external stabilizing reagents. The XPS analysis showed that this excellent stability is due to modifications of the RGO nanosheets by the gly-gly molecules. The modified RGO complex with copper shows good catalytic performance for reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol.", "num_citations": "46\n", "authors": ["298"]}

However, the prognostic relevance of brachyury expression in chordoma is still unknown. The improvement of tissue microarray technology has provided the opportunity to perform analyses of tumor tissues on a large scale in a uniform and consistent manner. This study was designed with the use of tissue microarray to determine the expression of brachyury. Brachyury expression in chordoma tissues from 78 chordoma patients was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarray. The clinicopathologic parameters, including gender, age, location of tumor and metastatic status were evaluated. Fifty-nine of 78 (75.64%) tumors showed nuclear staining for brachyury, and among them, 29 tumors (49.15%) showed 1+ (<30% positive cells) staining, 15 tumors (25.42%) had 2+ (31% to 60% positive cells) staining, and 15 tumors (25.42%) demonstrated 3+ (61% to 100% positive cells) staining. Brachyury nuclear staining was detected more frequently in sacral chordomas than in chordomas of the mobile spine. However, there was no significant relationship between brachyury expression and other clinical variables. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, brachyury expression failed to produce any significant relationship with the overall survival rate.

Multiple air quality monitoring networks were integrated by performing intercomparison of individual calibration standards and measurement techniques to ensure comparability of ambient measurements, along with providing consistently high time-resolution measurements of O3 and CO at the surface sites in East Asia. Ambient data collected from eight surface stations were compared with simulation results obtained by a regional chemistry transport model to infer recent changes in CO emissions from East Asia. Our inverse estimates of the CO emissions from China up to 2005 suggested an increase of 16% since 2001, in good agreement with the recent MOPITT satellite observations and the bottom-up estimates up to 2006. The O3 enhancement relative to CO in continental pollution plumes traversed in the boundary layer were examined as a function of transport time from the Asian continent to the western Pacific Ocean.

{"title": "Multivariate nonlinear modelling of fluorescence data by neural network with hidden node pruning algorithm\n", "abstract": " A hidden node pruning algorithm (HNPA) has been proposed as a method of configuration optimization and training in multilayer feedforward network. By this approach, a network initially bearing excessive hidden nodes is trained to sufficient precision and is pruned to the optimal size. Upon pruning, significant hidden nodes are determined by singular value decomposition (SVD) of output matrix of hidden layer and are retained. Weights and biases are preset intentionally in the pruned system, then training continues. The method has been tested with simulated nonlinear data and then applied to the modelling of a nonlinear fluorescence data of a real multicomponent analytical system, and satisfactory quantitative results have been achieved.", "num_citations": "42\n", "authors": ["298"]}

{"title": "Fatty acid synthase inhibition engages a novel caspase-2 regulatory mechanism to induce ovarian cancer cell death\n", "abstract": " Blockade of fatty acid synthase (FASN), a key enzyme involved in de novo lipogenesis, results in robust death of ovarian cancer cells. However, known FASN inhibitors have proven to be poor therapeutic agents due to their ability to induce cachexia. Therefore, we sought to identify additional targets in the pathway linking FASN inhibition and cell death whose modulation might kill ovarian cancer cells without the attendant side effects. Here, we show that the initiator caspase-2 is required for robust death of ovarian cancer cells induced by FASN inhibitors. REDD1 (also known as Rtp801 or DDIT4), a known mTOR inhibitor previously implicated in the response to FASN inhibition, is a novel caspase-2 regulator in this pathway. REDD1 induction is compromised in ovarian cancer cells that do not respond to FASN inhibition.

This study was aimed to detect the localization and compare the expression of beta-catenin and DKK1 in normal and preeclamptic placenta. Sixty pregnant women who underwent cesarean section were enrolled in this study, including 30 healthy pregnant women in the control group and 30 preeclamptic women in the severe PE group. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time-PCR) and western blot were employed to detect the beta-catenin and DKK1 mRNA and protein expression levels, respectively, and their locations were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Our results indicated that beta-catenin and DKK1 were expressed predominantly in the syncytiotrophoblast and the extravillous trophoblast (EVT). The beta-catenin mRNA and protein expressions were significantly decreased, whereas the DKK1 significantly increased in preeclamptic placental tissues compared to normal placental controls.

The reports have demonstrated that EMT was implicated in metastasis of oral squamous cell carcinomas. Therefore, here we further postulate that ILK might participate in EMT of tongue cancer. We showed that ILK siRNA inhibited EMT with low N-cadherin, Vimentin, Snail, Slug and Twist as well as high E-cadherin expression in vivo and in vitro. We found that knockdown of ILK inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion as well as changed cell morphology. We also demonstrated that ILK siRNA inhibited phosphorylation of downstream\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "39\n", "authors": ["298"]}
{"title": "Javelus: A low disruptive approach to dynamic software updates\n", "abstract": " Practical software systems are subject to frequent updates for fixing their bugs or addressing new requirements. Updating a software system without stopping and restarting it is desired, as this helps reduce the redeployment cost as well as achieving the high availability. Existing techniques for dynamically updating Java programs may introduce noticeable pauses during which these programs are unable to function. We in this paper present Javelus, a dynamic Java update system with greatly reduced pausing time but without sacrificing update flexibility and system efficiency. Different from previous approaches, Javelus uses a lazy update mechanism with which an object-to-update will not be updated until it is really used. We implemented Javelus on top of an industry-strength OpenJDK HotSpot VM. We evaluated Javelus with real updates to Tomcat 7 and the same micro array benchmark used in evaluating Jvolve\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "39\n", "authors": ["298"]}

{"title": "Hybrid support vector machines for robust object tracking\n", "abstract": " Tracking-by-detection techniques always formulate tracking as a binary classification problem. However, in this formulation, there exists a potential issue that the boundary of the positive targets and the negative background samples is fuzzy, which may be an important factor causing drift. To address this problem, we propose a novel hybrid formulation for tracking based on binary classification, regression and one-class classification, which comprehensively represents the appearance from different perspectives. In particular, the proposed regression model is a novel formulation for tracking and plays an important role in solving the fuzzy boundary problem. Moreover, we present a new tracking approach with different support vector machines (SVMs) and a novel distribution-based collaboration strategy as a specific implementation.

In AML, the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway is aberrantly activated, suggesting that the increased pathway activity may be correlated with the development and prognosis of MDS. SOX7 protein, encoded by the sex-determining region Y-box 7 (SOX7) gene, inhibits the activity of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway. Because the DNA methylation can regulate the transcription of SOX7 gene, we used the methylation-specific PCR to investigate the methylation status of the CpG island in MDS patients to determine the potential correlation of the SOX7 methylation with the development and prognosis of MDS. We found that the CpG island of the SOX7 gene was methylated in 58.1%(97/167) of MDS patients, but not in any healthy control. Furthermore, the percentage of patients with the methylated CpG island of the SOX7 gene was significantly higher in patients at advanced stages of MDS than in the patients at early stages. The increased percentages of this SOX7 methylation were also correlated with age, marrow blast levels, and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk. After prognostic analysis, we found that patients with the methylated CpG island of the SOX7 gene had shorter overall survival and cumulative survival than patients with unmethylated CpG island. Our findings suggest that the methylation of the CpG island of the SOX7 gene can be used as a predictive factor for the development and prognosis of MDS patients.", "num_citations": "35\n", "authors": ["298"]}

However, how active versus passive tasks modulate the activation and the functional connectivity of the critical brain areas is not clearly understood. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify intelligibility and task-related effects in speech comprehension. Participants performed a semantic judgment task on normal and time-reversed sentences, or passively listened to the sentences without making an overt response. The subtraction analysis demonstrated that passive sentence comprehension mainly engaged brain areas in the left anterior and posterior superior temporal sulcus and middle temporal gyrus (aSTS/MTG and pSTS/MTG), whereas active sentence comprehension recruited bilateral frontal regions in addition to the aSTS/MTG\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "33\n", "authors": ["298"]}

Recently, polymorphisms in the TP53 gene were shown to be associated with inflammation and inflammatory disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the interactions of miR-34b/c and TP53 Arg72-Pro polymorphisms on the risk of IA in a Chinese population. A total of 590 individuals (including 164 patients with IA and 426 controls) were involved in this study. The polymorphisms (i.e., miR-34b/c rs4938723 and TP53 Arg72-Pro) were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay and DNA sequencing. We found that the CC genotype of miR-34b/c  rs4938723 was significantly associated with a decreased risk of IA compared with the TT genotype. Moreover, a significant gene interaction of the carriers with the combined genotypes of miR-34b/c rs4938723CC and TP53 Arg72Pro CG/CC/GG had a decreased risk of IA, compared with those carrying miR-34b/c rs4938723CT/TT+TP53 Arg72Pro GG/CG/CC combined genotypes.

Analysis of modeled BC concentrations compared to in situ observations indicates levels are underestimated over most of Southeast Asia when using any of four different emission inventories. We thus attempt to reduce uncertainties in BC emissions and improve BC model simulations by developing top-down, spatially resolved, estimates of BC emissions through assimilation of OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) observations of aerosol absorption optical depth (AAOD) with the GEOS-Chem (Goddard Earth Observing System \u2013 chemistry) model and its adjoint for April and October 2006. Overwhelming enhancements, up to 500 %, in anthropogenic BC emissions are shown after optimization over broad areas of Southeast Asia in April. In October, the optimization of anthropogenic emissions yields a slight reduction (1\u20135 %) over India and parts of southern China, while emissions increase by 10\u201350 % over eastern China. Observational data from in situ measurements and AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) observations are used to evaluate the BC inversions and assess the bias between OMI and AERONET AAOD. Low biases in BC concentrations are improved or corrected in most eastern and central sites over China after optimization, while the constrained model still underestimates concentrations in Indian sites in both April and October, possibly as a consequence of low prior emissions.

A modified micrometeorological gradient method (MGM) is proposed in this study for estimating O3 dry deposition fluxes over a forest canopy using concentration gradients between a level above and a level below the canopy top, taking advantage of relatively large gradients between these levels due to significant pollutant uptake in the top layers of the canopy. The new method is compared with the AGM and MBR methods and is also evaluated using eddy-covariance (EC) flux measurements collected at the Harvard Forest Environmental Measurement Site, Massachusetts, during 1993\u20132000. All three gradient methods (AGM, MBR, and MGM) produced similar diurnal cycles of O3 dry deposition velocity (Vd(O3)) to the EC measurements, with the MGM method being the closest in magnitude to the EC measurements. The multi-year average Vd(O3) differed significantly between these methods, with the AGM, MBR, and MGM method being 2.28, 1.45, and 1.18 times that of the EC, respectively. Sensitivity experiments identified several input parameters for the MGM method as first-order parameters that affect the estimated Vd(O3).

The data used in this study include gaseous elemental mercury (GEM), mercury bound to fine airborne particles (<2.5 \u03bcm) (PHg), reactive gaseous mercury (RGM), major inorganic ions, sulphur dioxide, nitric acid gas, ozone, and meteorological variables, all of which were measured between May 2005 and December 2006. The source origins identified were related to transport of industrial and combustion emissions (associated with elevated GEM), photochemical production of RGM (associated with elevated RGM), road-salt particles with absorption of gaseous Hg (associated with elevated PHg and RGM), crustal/soil emissions, and background pollution. Back trajectory modelling illustrated that a remote site, like ELA, is affected by distant Hg point sources in Canada and the United States. The sources identified from correlation analysis, principal components analysis and K-means cluster analysis were generally consistent. The discrepancies between the K-means and Hierarchical cluster analysis were the clusters related to transport of industrial/combustion emissions, photochemical production of RGM, and crustal/soil emissions. Although it was possible to assign the clusters to these source origins, the trajectory plots for the Hierarchical clusters were similar to some of the trajectories belonging to several K-means clusters.

It is found that the curve of contact angle vs. the surface fraction of components passes through a minimum, behaviour that cannot be interpreted by existing models describing wetting of heterogeneous surfaces and/or reactive wetting. It is shown that the observed enhanced wetting can be explained by the dissolution contrast of Cu and Fe phases, leading to interfacial microroughness, thus providing an additional driving force for wetting. In order to take into account this new effect of interfacial reactions on wettability, an equation similar to Wenzel\u2019s equation is established.

The secreted proteins have a conserved carboxy-terminal domain essential for type IX secretion that is cleaved upon export. In P. gingivalis the T9SS substrates undergo glycosylation with anionic lipopolysaccharide (A-LPS) and are attached to the OM. In this study, comparative analyses of 24 Bacteroidetes genomes identified ten putative novel components of the T9SS in P. gingivalis, one of which was PG1058. Computer modelling of the PG1058 structure predicted a novel N- to C-terminal architecture comprising a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, a \u03b2-propeller domain, a carboxypeptidase regulatory domain-like fold (CRD) and an OmpA_C-like putative peptidoglycan binding domain. Inactivation of pg1058 in P. gingivalis resulted in loss of both colonial pigmentation and surface-associated proteolytic activity; a phenotype common to T9SS mutants.

These kinds of stripes result in great difficulties for conventional statistical destriping methods. To deal with these problems effectively, we propose a piece-wise destriping method. This approach divides the recognized defective rows into different portions by the local statistical and mean curve information. The destriping is then performed in each portion, based on the different correction coefficients, with a neighbouring normal row as a reference. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively destripe MODIS data.", "num_citations": "25\n", "authors": ["298"]}

Recent studies suggested parathyroid hormone (PTH) could accelerate EMT and subsequent organ fibrosis. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying PTH-induced EMT remain unknown. The present study was to investigate whether Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway is involved in PTH-induced EMT in human renal proximal tubular cells (HK-2 cells) and to determine the profile of gene expression associated with PTH-induced EMT. PTH could induce morphological changes and gene expression characteristic of EMT in cultured HK-2 cells. Suppressing \u03b2-catenin expression or DKK1 limited gene expression characteristic of PTH-induced EMT.

The model test system mainly consists of a steel structural frame and a hydraulic loading control system, which adopts active loading on six surfaces of the model block with a true triaxial stress considering trapezoidal loading steps in two horizontal directions. Newly-developed combinational ball-type sliding walls are installed on each side of the major loading surfaces, which can significantly reduce friction. Based on the system, a large-scale geomechanical model test for an underground cavern group is carried out. Major innovations and improvements have been made in terms of experimental techniques and advanced measurement methods/techniques. Precast blocks of analog materials are piled up and bonded to enhance the consistent mechanical properties of the whole model system. Digital photogrammetric technique, fiber Bragg grating (FBG) technology-based displacement sensing bars, and a newly developed mini-extensometers are employed to measure the deformation of surrounding rock mass. A new unique technique of grouted anchor and prestressed cables are conducted.

The x-ray refraction contrast of the sample is an important contrast in DEI, and it vastly exceeds the absorption contrast for weakly absorbing samples imaging, which makes it hold great promise for medical, biological and material applications. In order to effectively utilize the refraction contrast, the key procedure is first to obtain the refraction information expressed as the refraction image. By comparing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the refraction image, x-ray radiation dose of the sample and the range of obtained refraction angles, the different refraction information extraction methods are investigated in this paper, and the experimental results confirm the conclusion.", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["298"]}

For the twisted ribbons, the rotation rate depends on the spontaneous torsion, which is determined by the elastic properties of the polymers.

As an imported foreign technology, video games are often identified by various social forces as either a solution to or a cause of the contradictions and crises generated by reform, which produces a recurring dialectical representation of the medium as both productive and pathological. The contrasting fates of arcade and console games in the 1980s and the interplay between promotion and regulation of PC games in the 1990s led to the contemporary battle over Internet addiction and new definitions of pathology and productivity.

Vertical turbulence is not accounted for in the theoretical formulations of \u039b(d) but does contribute to the field-derived estimates of \u039b(d) due to its influence on the overall concentration changes of aerosol particles in the layers undergoing impaction scavenging. A detailed one-dimensional cloud microphysics model has been used to simulate rain production and below-cloud particle scavenging, and to quantify the contribution of turbulent diffusion to the overall \u039b(d) values calculated from particle concentration changes. The relative contribution of vertical diffusion to below-cloud scavenging is found to be largest for submicron particles under weak precipitation conditions. The discrepancies between theoretical and field-derived \u039b(d) values can largely be explained by the contribution of vertical diffusion to below-cloud particle scavenging for all particles larger than 0.01 \u03bcm in diameter for which field data are available. The results presented here suggest that the current theoretical framework for \u039b(d) can provide a reasonable approximation of below-cloud aerosol particle scavenging by rain in size-resolved aerosol transport models if vertical diffusion is also considered by the models.", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["298"]}

Here we report a newly detected strain of CHIK, Zhejiang/chik-sy/2012, in China, a nonindigenous region for CHIK, using a modified approach based on the classic cDNA-AFLP. We then performed etiological and phylogenetic analyses to better understand its molecular characterization and phylogenetic pattern, and also to aid in further evaluating its persistence in Southeast Asia.  Methods By using this modified procedure, we determined for the first time the complete genome sequence of the chikungunya virus strain, Zhejiang/chik-sy/2012, isolated in 2012 from a patient in Zhejiang, China. Sequence analyses revealed that this positive single strand of RNA is 12,017 bp long. We found no single amino acid mutation in A226V, D284E and A316V. Phylogenetic analysis showed that our strain shared the greatest homology with a strain isolated in Taiwan, which was derived from a strain from Indonesia. Chik-sy/2012 is in a different clade from other CHIK viruses found in China previously.  Conclusions A modified cDNA-AFLP in virus discovery was used to isolate the first CHIK and the first complete genome sequence of virus strain chik-sy/2012 in 2012 from a patient with CHIK fever in Zhejiang, China.

Using the inversion model, the OMIS image was calculated one pixel by one pixel, and the remote sensing mapping for LWC of wheat was accomplished.[Result] The accuracy of inversion model (logarithmic function) which built by index FD730-955 was higher than that by the hyperspectral indices commonly used, as indicated by a calibration determination coefficient (C-R2) of 0.749 and a validation determination coefficient (V-R2) of 0.742. The eatimation values of 32 samples in prediction set were close to the measured values, and R2 and RMSE of regression fitted model between two dataset were 0.763 and 0.024, respectivly. Furthere more, the prediction accuracy of FD730-955was least sensitive to the change of LWC and LAI among all of the hyperspectra indices and therefore least affected by the range of sample values and canopy density when used to estimate the LWC of wheat. The R2and RMSE of the fitting model for the inversion and measured values were 0.635 and 0.027, respectively\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["298"]}

ABSA was first covalently grafted on GCE surface via the direct electrochemical oxidation of ABSA on GCE, which was followed by the electrochemical polymerization of aniline on the ABSA functionalized GCE. Then PAN-ABSA composite film modified GCE (PAN-ABSA/GCE) was obtained. Scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and electrochemical techniques had been employed to characterize the obtained electrodes. Due to the effective doping of ABSA in PAN, the redox electro-activity of PAN had been extended to neutral and even the basic media, thus, the PAN-ABSA composite film modified GCE could be used for electro-catalytic oxidation of AA in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH 6.8). At PAN-ABSA/GCE the oxidation over-potential of AA shifted from 0.39 V at GCE to 0.17 V with a greatly enhanced current response. The electro-catalytic oxidation peak current of AA increased linearly with the increasing AA concentration over the range of 5.00 \u00d7 10-4-1.65 \u00d7 10-2 M with a correlation coefficient of 0.9973. The detection limit (S/N = 3) for AA was 1.16 \u00d7 10-6 M. Chronoamperometry had also been employed to investigate the electro-catalytic oxidation of AA at PAN-ABSA/GCE. The modified electrode had been used for detecting AA in real samples with satisfactory results.", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["298"]}

The proposed resonator is formed by attaching two pairs of circular impedance-stepped open stubs in shunt and a pair of short-circuited stubs to high impedance microstrip line. By simply adjusting the radius of circular impedance-stepped open stubs and the lengths of short-circuited stubs, the first five resonant modes of the resonator can be roughly allocated within the 3.1--10.6 GHz UWB band meanwhile the high resonant modes in the upper-stopband can be suppressed. The short stubs in pairs can generate two transmission zeros near the lower and upper cut-off frequencies, leading to sharper rejection skirt outside the desired passband.

Three kinds of quinones, i.e., tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone (TCBQ), benzoquinone (BQ), and tetramethyl-p-benzoquinone (TMBQ), are employed in this study in terms of their different structures and thereby different basicities and hydrogen-bonding interaction activities with water. The hydrogen-bonding interaction activities of the quinone species with water actually depend on the structures and the species of quinones, where the interaction activity between quinone dianion and water remains remarkably greater than that between quinone monoanion and water. The former interaction activity eventually leads to the positive shift of the half-wave potential of quinone monoanion\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["298"]}

{"title": "Credit rationing by loan size: A synthesized model\n", "abstract": " We construct a synthesized model to study credit rationing by loan size. In our model, the borrower faces a trade-off between raising debt and exerting costly effort to undertake an investment project. In the absence of agency costs, increasing the loan size at the equilibrium interest rate raises the default risk and hence reduces the average cost of the loan for the borrower, so the borrower always demands a larger loan than what the lender can offer. Furthermore, agency cost raises this excess demand for a given interest rate. If the agency cost is sufficiently high, the borrower is unable to obtain the loan she needs at any interest rate, requiring the use of non-price instruments in the loan contract. In sum, we generalize the two types of credit rationing in a unified framework that facilitates our understanding of credit rationing due to various ex-post agency issues.", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["298"]}

In this paper, we propose a robust registration method by rank minimization (RRRM) for multiangle hyper/multispectral remotely sensed imagery (MA-HSI-MSI). First, the low-rank structure of the MA-HSI-MSI is exploited and utilized as the registration constraint, thus recasting the image registration problem as searching for an optimal set of transformations, such that the matrix of the transformed images can reach its minimum rank. Second, a patch-based registration scheme is adopted to solve the problem of inconsistent geometric distortion over the entire image, taking the homography model as the local transformation. An iterative convex optimization algorithm is then used to solve the rank minimization-based image registration model for each image\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["298"]}

Previous studies have identified a couple of lysine residues in Tat that are essential for its functions. In order to analyze the functions of all the lysine residues in Tat, we mutated them individually to alanine, glutamine, and arginine. Through systematic analysis of the lysine mutants, we discovered several previously unidentified characteristics of Tat. We found that lysine acetylation could modulate the subcellular localization of Tat, in addition to the regulation of its transactivation activity. Our data also revealed that lysine mutations had distinct effects on microtubule assembly and Tat binding to bromodomain proteins. By correlation analysis, we further found that the effects of Tat on apoptosis and mitotic progression were not entirely attributed to its effect on microtubule assembly. Our findings suggest that Tat may regulate diverse cellular activities through binding to different proteins and that the acetylation of distinct lysine residues in Tat may modulate its interaction with various partners.", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["298"]}

Firstly, a structure component describing the granular characteristic is proposed to combine with the microstructure model of clay mineral proposed by M. Tuller, D. Or, and the combination components of microstructure for soft rocks are obtained. Then considering the basic types and features of soft rock microstructure, two typical microstructure units to represent the granular structure and dense stripy structure are established.

The effects of concentration, electrical potential and the distance between the spinning tip and the collector upon the morphology of electrospun fibers were also discussed. The results show that electrospinning occurs only when electrical potential exceed a critical value which is related with solution properties. When solution concentration in creases, the average diameter of electrospun fibers increases. And the increase of electrical potential may result in decline in average diameter. With the increase in distance between the tip and the collector, the diameter also experiences a slight growth. It is also found that electrospinning process promotes the crystallation of PHBV, which may be caused by the orientation of molecule chains due to electrical force stretching.", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["298"]}

The PCCV model, uniformly scaled at 1:4, is representative of the containment structure of an actual Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) plant (OHI-3) in Japan. The objectives of the pressurization tests were to obtain measurement of the structural response to pressure loading beyond design basis accident in order to validate analytical modeling, to find pressure capacity of the model, and to observe its failure mechanisms. This paper compares results of pretest analytical studies of the PCCV model to the PCCV high pressure test measurements and describes results of post-test analytical studies.

Data for sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio and positive predictive value (PPV) of RB were extracted by two researchers and analyzed applying Meta-Disc (version 1.4) and Stata (version 11.0). Methodological quality of studies was assessed according to QUADAS. A total of 38 studies containing 5,626 colorectal cancer patients and 73,174 participants with RB were included. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.47 (95% CI: 0.45-0.48) and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.96-0.96) respectively. The overall PPVs ranged from 0.01 to 0.21 with a pooled value of 0.06 (95% CI: 0.05-0.08). Being over the age of 60 years, change in bowel habit, weight loss, anaemia, colorectal cancer among first-degree relatives and feeling of incomplete evacuation of rectum appeared to increase the predictive value of RB. Although RB greatly increases the probability of diagnosing colorectal cancer, it alone may not be sufficient for proposing further sophisticated investigations. However, given the high specificity, subjects without RB may be ruled out of further investigations.

Observations have been performed using ship-based solar absorption Fourier Transform infrared spectrometry, flask sampling, balloon sounding, and in-situ Fourier Transform infrared analysis. The results obtained are compared to the GEOS-Chem global 3-D chemistry transport model for atmospheric composition. In general, a very good agreement is found between the GEOS-Chem model and all instruments. The CO and O 3 distributions show a comparable variability suggesting an impact from the same source regions. Tagged-CO simulations implemented in the GEOS-Chem model make it possible to differentiate between different source processes and source regions. The source regions are verified with HYSPLIT backward trajectory calculations. In the Northern Hemisphere fossil fuel combustion in Asia is the dominant source. European and North American fossil fuel combustion also contribute to Northern Hemispheric CO pollution. In the Southern Hemisphere contributions from biomass burning and fossil fuel combustion are dominant; African biomass burning has a significant impact on Western Pacific CO pollution. Furthermore, in the tropical Western Pacific enhanced upper tropospheric CO within the tropical tropopause layer mainly originates from Indonesian fossil fuel combustion and can be transported into the stratosphere.

Simulated surface layer concentrations and column burdens of OC indicate that OC levels are much higher in the weak SEASM year 1998 than in the strong SEASM year 2002. The sensitivity experiments with global OC emissions turned off except those over the South Asia show that OC aerosol emitted from South Asia contributes to 50\u201370% of OC mass over southern China and 20\u201350% of OC over the western North Pacific between 850 hPa and 400 hPa in 1998. The outflow of OC from the South Asia is larger in 1998 than in 2002. Three factors contribute to the larger buildup of summer time OC in the weak SEASM year of 1998. The first is the weakened summer monsoon rainfall over the Southeast Asia that leads to less wet deposition and higher OC concentrations. The second is the enhancement of deep convection in the western Indian continent and the weakened upward lifting over the western North Pacific. The last and the most important factor is the abnormal circulation in the lower and middle troposphere that contributes to the long-range transport of OC from South Asia to Southern China and the western North Pacific.", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["298"]}

Therefore, research in this area provides significant opportunities. The key limitation to effective drug delivery within the esophagus is sufficient retention at this site coupled with activity profiles to correspond with these retention times; therefore, a suitable formulation needs to provide the drug in a ready-to-work form at the site of action during the rapid transit through this organ.

In this study, soils of two tea gardens (Yellowish red soil and Red soil) were collected and incubated by adding acid and organic manure for studying the effects of acidification and organic matter accumulation on Pb bio-availability of tea garden soils. Water-soluble Pb, NH4OAc extractable Pb and chemical forms of Pb in the incubated soils were characterized. The results showed that soil acidification promoted transformation of other forms of Pb into exchangeable Pb, and thus increased water solubility and bio-availability of Pb in the soils. Accumulation of organic matter could activate Pb in soils with pH4, whereas accumulation of organic matter decreased Pb bio-availability in lower pH soils (pH4).

For this reason, CNTs are usually purified or treated with nitric acid or nitric and sulphuric acid prior to their versatile applications. However, the strong acidic and oxidative conditions are so aggressive that serious erosion of the tube structures has inevitably taken place, which creates defects on the sidewalls and gives rise to numerous molecular byproducts, commonly referred as carboxylated carbonaceous fragments (CCFs).

The annual average of NH3 (AAN) at all the sites across southwestern Ontario was over 1 \u03bcg m\u22123, a value that was recently proposed as the new critical level for protecting vegetation. High AAN values (3.6\u20136.1 \u03bcg m\u22123) were observed at eight sites located inside the intensive livestock production zones. AAN values at the sites across southeastern Ontario were generally lower than 1 \u03bcg m\u22123 and the values were less than 0.4 \u03bcg m\u22123 at non-agricultural sites. Agricultural sites generally showed the highest concentrations in spring to summer and the lowest in winter, but the occurrence time of the peak concentration varied among the sites, which could be due to their different land use and thus different fertilizer application intensities or periods. Seasonal trends of NH3 concentration at some non-agricultural sites were somewhat similar to those at the agricultural sites, but the peak concentration appeared a few weeks later than at the agricultural sites. Surprisingly, at several remote non-agricultural sites, NH3 concentrations were not decreasing in winter and were sometimes increasing to a level higher than those in summer, which could be caused by different transport mechanisms in different seasons.

Recently, machine learning algorithms were developed to predict potential miRNA targets. Most of these methods are robust but are not sensitive to redundant or irrelevant features. Despite their good performance, the relative importance of each feature is still unclear. With increasing experimental data becoming available, research interest has shifted from higher prediction performance to uncovering the mechanism of microRNA-mRNA interactions. Systematic analysis of sequence, structural and positional features was carried out for two different data sets. The dominant functional features were distinguished from uninformative features in single and hybrid feature sets. Models were developed using only statistically significant sequence, structural and positional features, resulting in area under the receiver operating curves (AUC) values of 0.919, 0.927 and 0.969 for one data set and of 0.926, 0.874 and 0.954 for another data set, respectively. Hybrid models were developed by combining various features and achieved AUC of 0.978 and 0.970 for two different data sets. Functional miRNA information is well reflected in these features, which are expected to be valuable in understanding the mechanism of microRNA-mRNA interactions and in designing experiments. Differing from previous approaches, this study focused on systematic analysis of all types of features.

{"title": "Surface energy exchanges above two grassland ecosystems on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau\n", "abstract": " This paper explores the seasonal and inter-annual variations in surface energy exchanges at an alpine shrub-meadow ecosystem (AM) and an alpine meadow-steppe (AS) on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau using the 4\u20135-year continuous flux measurements by the eddy covariance technique. Although ground solar radiation (Kd) was lower at AM than at AS, net radiation (Rn) was higher at AM than at AS due to the lower surface reflectivity for short-wave radiation (albedo) and the lower ratio of upward long-wave radiation to downward long-wave radiation (Lu/Ld) at AM. The ratio of Rn/Kd was lower (about 0.4) at AS than at AM (about 0.6). In the annual scale, annual precipitation was the most important factor controlling energy partitioning at AS, while temperature, especially during the spring, controlled the inter-annual variations in energy partitioning at AM characterized by low temperature. Vegetation growth played an important role in controlling energy partitioning at seasonal scale at both sites. However, soil water content was also one of major factors affecting Bowen ratio (\u03b2) due to the lower soil water-holding capacity at AS as compared with AM. Under non-drought conditions, the influence of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) on energy partitioning at half-hourly scale was stronger at AM than at AS due to higher vegetation cover thereof.", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["298"]}

In ten samples collected during or following fog events, at least one supermicron mode of particulate NH4+ was observed. The supermicron modes were likely associated with fog events since they were absent on non-fog days. The supermicron mode of NH4+ in the 5\u201310 \u03bcm size range probably reflected the direct contribution from fog droplets. Based on detailed analysis of the chemical compositions and the extent of neutralization, the supermicron mode of NH4+ in the 1\u20134 \u03bcm size range was believed to be caused by fog-processing of ammonium salt aerosols. These aerosol particles consisted of incompletely neutralized sulfuric acid aerosols in NH3-poor conditions or a mixture of ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate aerosols in NH3-rich conditions. Interstitial aerosols and fog droplets presented during fog events likely yielded a minor direct contribution to the measured NH4+.

{"title": "Multiple-level regulation of 2, 4-diacetylphloroglucinol production by the sigma regulator PsrA in Pseudomonas fluorescens 2P24\n", "abstract": " Background Pseudomonas fluorescens 2P24 is a rhizospheric bacterium that aggressively colonizes the plant roots. It produces the antibiotic 2,4-diacetylphoroglucinol (2,4-DAPG), which contributes to the protection of various crop plants against soil borne diseases caused by bacterial and fungal pathogens. The biosynthesis of 2,4-DAPG is regulated at the transcriptional level in the expression of the phlACBD operon as well as at the posttranscriptional level by the Gac/Rsm signal transduction pathway. However, the detailed mechanism of such regulation is not clear.   Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we identified a binding site for the sigma regulator PsrA in the promoter region of the phlA gene. Electrophoretic mobility shift experiments revealed direct and specific binding of PsrA to the phlA promoter region. Consistent with the fact that its binding site locates within the promoter region of phlA, PsrA negatively regulates phlA expression, and its inactivation led to significant increase in 2,4-DAPG production. Interestingly, PsrA also activates the expression of the sigma factor RpoS, which negatively regulates 2,4-DAPG production by inducing the expression of the RNA-binding protein RsmA.   Conclusions/Significance These results suggest that PsrA is an important regulator that modulates 2,4-DAPG biosynthesis at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["298"]}

{"title": "The behavior of pollination drop secretion in Ginkgo biloba L.\n", "abstract": " Pollination drop (PD) secretion plays a critical role in wind pollination in many gymnosperms. We conducted detailed investigations on PD secretion in Ginkgo biloba, and found that PDs could not form when the micropyle was removed, but were able to form after removal of the shoot, leaves, ovular stalk, or ovular collar. The duration and volume of the PD increased under high relative humidity, but addition of salt or sugar did not affect PD secretion, its size, or its duration. Morphological and anatomical observations showed that many secretion cells at the nucellus tip contributed to secreting the PD after the formation of pollen chamber. Under laboratory conditions, the PD persisted for approximately 10 d if not pollinated, and re-formed five times after it was removed, with the total volume of PDs reaching approximately 0.4 \u03bcL.

Chemokines and their receptors are potential therapeutic targets in RA. Among these, it has been suggested that CXC chemokine 4 (CXCR4) and its ligand CXC ligand 12 (CXCL12) are involved in RA pathogenesis. Low-level laser irradiation (LLLI) is currently being evaluated for the treatment of RA; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying its effectiveness remain unclear.Aim: To understand the anti-inflammatory effect of LLLI, we used the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat as RA model and analyzed the gene expression profile in synovial membrane in the hindpaw joints of control, CIA and CIA+ LLLI. Expression of CXCR4 and CXCL12 genes were also studied.Materials and Methods: Total RNA was isolated from the synovial membrane tissue of CIA rat joints or CIA joints treated with LLLI (830 nm Ga-Al-As diode), and gene expression profiles were analyzed by DNA microarray (41,000 rat genes). The mRNA levels were confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time PCR. Immunohistochemical examination to examine CXCR4 protein expression was also carried out.Results: DNA microarray analysis showed that CXCR4 gene expression was increased in CIA tissue and LLLI treatment significantly decreased CIA-induced CXCR4 mRNA levels.

For the monolithic BMG with different diameters, the measured plasticity decreased with the increase of sample size and was mainly due to the sliding of two undeveloped parts along main shear band. Excellent compression plastic strain (\u223c13.2%) was obtained for the marginal BMG containing in situ nanocrystals with sample size up to 3.5\u00a0mm in diameter where multiple shear bands formed. It is suggested that failure of BMG samples will occur when the temperature rise in shear layer reaches a critical value. The temperature rise is closely related to the sample size and stress drop, moreover, it can be controlled through adjusting final stress drop (via sample size) and increment rate of stress drop (via microstructure), resulting in enhanced plasticity.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["298"]}

The results showed that NaCl can accelerate the corrosion of A3 steel. Dry mass gain of A3 steel in the presence of NaCl deposition increases with the exposure time, which can be correlated by using exponential decay function. The relationship between dry mass gain and amount of NaCl deposition at a certain exposure time follows a quadratic function. More amount of NaCl deposition will slow down the corrosion rate to some extent after exposure for a certain time. SEM/EDAX was used to characterize the corrosion surface and products. The surfaces of the NaCl treated A3 steel were obviously uneven, and some tiny crevices appear in the corrosion products that could help O2 transmit to the inner layer.

A good representation usually exploits some inherent relationship and structures among the observed targets, the candidates, or both. In this work, we observe that the candidates are strongly correlated to each other and exhibit obvious clustering structure, when they are densely sampled around possible target locations. Thus, we propose a Self-Expressive Tracking (SET) algorithm based on an accurate representation with good discriminative performance. The interrelationship and the clustering structure among the observed targets and the candidates are exploited by using a self-expressive scheme with a low-rank constraint. Further, we design a discriminative criterion of the likelihood for target location, which simultaneously considers the target, background and representation errors.

By changing the gap length, gas pressure, and voltage type, the Ut characteristics of rod-plane and sphere-plane SF6 long gaps under negative VFTO and LI were investigated at different gas pressures. Experimental results show that, although the minimum breakdown voltage of the sphere-plane gap under VFTO is higher than that under LI, the Ut curve of the sphere-plane gap under VFTO is flatter than that under LI, resulting in the intersection of Ut curves. However, for the rod-plane gap, the Ut curve under VFTO is below that under LI at the pressure of 0.5 MPa. Based on the analysis of experimental results and physical background of Ut curves, the semi-empirical formula is derived to predict the Ut curves of the given SF6 gap. This formula can be expressed by a power exponent function with three parameters, which are related with gas pressure, gap length, and field nonuniformity factor. It is demonstrated that the predicted Ut curves can reflect breakdown characteristics of SF6 gaps accurately, which is useful for insulation design of GIS.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["298"]}

{"title": "Estimation of geothermal reserves in oil and gas reservoirs\n", "abstract": " The existing volumetric approach was honored by considering the effects of oil and gas saturations on the evaluation of geothermal resources in oil and gas reservoirs. The main reason to do so was that oil and gas phases may not be simply substituted by water because the values of the specific heat of oil and gas are smaller than that of water. We selected an oil reservoir, Hexaw, from Huabei oil field as an example to apply the method. The effects of oil and gas saturation on the geothermal reserve were investigated at different values of porosity and the results were compared to the existing approaches. It was found that the existing volumetric method tends to overestimate the geothermal reserves in oil and gas reservoirs. The greater the oil or gas saturation is, the more the overestimation of the geothermal reserve is.

We first use active fire counts from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to improve the spatiotemporal distributions of the biomass burning BC emissions from the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFEDv2). The adjustment primarily shifts emissions from late to middle and early summer (a 33% decrease in September\u2013October and a 56% increase in June\u2013August) and leads to appreciable increases in modeled surface BC concentrations in early and middle summer, especially at the 1\u20132 and 2\u20133 km altitude ranges. We then conduct analytical inversions at both 2\u00b0 \u00d7 2.5\u00b0 and 0.5\u00b0 \u00d7 0.667\u00b0 (nested over North America) horizontal resolutions. The a posteriori biomass burning BC emissions for July\u2013September are 31.7 Gg at 2\u00b0 \u00d7 2.5\u00b0 (an increase by a factor of 4.7) and 19.2 Gg at 0.5\u00b0 \u00d7 0.667\u00b0 (an increase by a factor of 2.8).

Recent studies suggested that two common polymorphisms, miR-146a G>C and miR-196a2 C>T, may be associated with individual susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the results remain conflicting rather than conclusive. Object. The aim of this study was to assess the association between miR-146a G>C and miR-196a2 C>T polymorphisms and the risk of HCC. Methods. A meta-analysis of 17 studies (10938 cases and 11967 controls) was performed. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were used to evaluate the strength of the association. Results. For miR-146a G>C, the variant genotypes were associated with a decreased risk of HCC (CC versus GG: OR = 0.780 and 95% CI 0.700\u20130.869; GC/CC versus GG: OR = 0.865 and 95% CI 0.787\u20130.952; CC versus GC/GG: OR = 0.835 and 95% CI 0.774\u20130.901). For miR-196a2 C>T, significant association was also observed (TT versus CC: OR = 0.783, 95% CI: 0.649\u20130.943, and                 ; CT versus CC: OR = 0.831, 95% CI 0.714\u20130.967, and                 ; CT/TT versus CC: OR = 0.817, 95% CI 0.703\u20130.949, and                 ).

Despite their perceived importance, omics-level studies have seldom been applied to this group of animals largely due to a paucity of genomic resources. Here, we report the first large-scale gene-associated marker development and evaluation for a bivalve mollusc, Chlamys farreri. More than 21,000 putative single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified from the C. farreri transcriptome. Primers and probes were designed and synthesized for 4500 SNPs, and 1492 polymorphic markers were successfully developed using a high-resolution melting genotyping platform. These markers are particularly suitable for population genomic analysis due to high polymorphism within and across populations, a low frequency of null alleles, and conformation to neutral expectations.

METHOD: Male SD rats were randomly divided into five groups: sham group (Sham), model group (Model), and Dauricine groups of low, middle and high doses. To make the transient focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury model, the middle cerebral artery on the right side of rat was occluded by inserting a nylon suture through the internal carotid artery for 1 h, followed by reperfusion for 24 h after withdrawing the suture. Dauricine groups, different doses of Dauricine (2.5, 5, 10 mg x kg (-1) as low, middle and high dose respectively) were administered intraperitoneally at the beginning of the cerebral ischemia, and at 11 h and 23 h after reperfusion. At the same time, Sham group and Model group was administered saline as controls. Brain samples of rats were treated with paraformaldehyde perfusion fixation 24 h after blood reperfusion and then collected for making pathological sections. Apoptotic changes of neuronal cells in the brain penumbra of rat were evaluated in situ by terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferasemediated dUTP-digoxigenin nick end-labelling (TUNEL). Cytochrome C (Cyt-C) release and the expression of caspase-3 and caspase-9 proteins of the ischemic-reperfusion brain tissue were determined by immunohistochemistry assay.

It is based on the idea that by storing identification numbers of several representative images for each positive image after a query session, it is possible to provide more precise and diverse retrieval results when this image is used later as a query in a new search session. To do so, a criterion for a \"good\" buddy image is proposed. Based on such criterion, an algorithm is designed to maximize the space spanned by the selected buddy images. Since the proposed approach requires only a constant storage space for each image, it has good scalability for a large size of image database.

In this work, cell-scale lignocellulose (mono-layer plant cells) is prepared to characterize their thermal properties from room temperature down to \u223c40 K. The thermal conductivities of cell-scale lignocellulose along different directions show a little anisotropy due to the cell structure anisotropy. It is found that with temperature going down, the volumetric specific heat of the lignocellulose shows a slower decreasing trend against temperature than microcrystalline cellulose, and its value is always higher than that of microcrystalline cellulose. The thermal conductivity of lignocellulose decreases with temperature from 243 K to 317 K due to increasing phonon-phonon scatterings. From 41 K to 243 K, the thermal conductivity rises with temperature and its change mainly depends on the heat capacity's change.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["298"]}

STILT-Chem v0.8 was then applied to simulate atmospheric ammonia concentrations at 53 measurement sites in the province of Ontario, Canada for a six-month period from 1 June to 30 November 2006. In addition to the bidirectional scheme, two unidirectional dry deposition schemes were tested. Comparisons of modeled ammonia concentrations against observations show that all three schemes can reasonably predict observations. For sites with low observed ammonia concentrations, the bidirectional scheme clearly overestimated ammonia concentrations during crop-growing season. Although all three schemes tended to underestimate ammonia concentrations after mid-October and for sites with elevated observed concentrations, mainly due to underestimated NH3 emission inventory after mid-October and/or underestimated emission potentials for those sites, the bidirectional scheme performed better because of its introduction of compensation points into the flux calculation parameterization. In addition to uncertainties in the emission inventory, the results of additional sensitivity tests suggest that uncertainties in the input values of emission potentials in the bidirectional scheme greatly affect the accuracy of modeled ammonia concentrations. The use of much larger emission potentials in the bidirectional scheme and larger anthropogenic NH3 emission after mid-October than provided in the model emissions files is needed for accurate prediction of elevated\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["298"]}

The LY2163, LY2186 and LYP9 hybrids yielded 1193, 1630 and 1046 differentially expressed genes (DGs), accounting for 3.2%, 4.4% and 2.8% of the total number of genes (36,926), respectively, after using the z-test (p< 0.01). Functional category analysis showed that the DGs in each hybrid combination were mainly classified into the carbohydrate metabolism and energy metabolism categories. Further analysis of the metabolic pathways showed that DGs were significantly enriched in the carbon fixation pathway (p< 0.01) for all three combinations. Over 80% of the DGs were located in rice quantitative trait loci (QTLs) of the Gramene database, of which more than 90% were located in the yield related QTLs in all three combinations, which suggested that there was a correlation between DGs and rice heterosis.

{"title": "\u03ba-opioid receptor activation prevents against arrhythmias by preserving Cx43 protein via alleviation of intracellular calcium\n", "abstract": " \u03ba-opioid receptor (\u03ba-OR) activation with U50, 488H, a selective \u03ba-OR agonist, has been previously demonstrated to prevent against cardiac arrhythmias via stabilizing the synthesis and degradation of an integral membrane protein, Cx43, in gap junctions. However, the exact prevention mechanism remains unclear. The present study tested the hypothesis that the kappa OR agonist U50, 488H mediates the prevention of arrhythmia through the regulation of intracellular calcium leading to the preservation of Cx43 protein. By performing electrocardiogram monitoring and immunoblotting in isolated Langendorff-perfused rat hearts, high concentrations of calcium-perfused rat hearts exhibited increased cardiac arrhythmias. Diminished expression of Cx43 protein was observed. The utilization of a whole-cell patch clamp technique revealed that U50, 488H inhibited L-type calcium current in single ventricular myocytes in a\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["298"]}

The level of play, or self\u2013report real exposure, is negatively correlated with gender\u2013based third\u2013person effect.

And also, as a comparison, the electrochemical homopolymerizations of DPA and OPD have been investigated by using the in situ spectroelectrochemical technique. The intermediate species generated during the electrochemical homopoly-merization of DPA and OPD, and the copolymerization of DPA with OPD have been identified by using the in situ spectroelectrochemical procedure. The results reveal the formation of an intermediate in the initial stage of copolymerization through the cross-reaction of the cation radicals of DPA and OPD, and the absorption peak located at 538 nm in the UV\u2013Vis spectra is assigned to this intermediate. To further investigate the copolymerization of DPA with OPD, cyclic voltammetry (CV) has been used to study the electrochemical homopolymerization of DPA and OPD and also the copolymerization of DPA and OPD with different concentration ratios in solution. The different voltammetric characteristics between the homopolymerization and copolymerization processes exhibit the occurrence of the copolymerization, and the difference between the copolymerization of DPA and OPD with different concentration ratios shows the dependence of the copoly-merization on the concentrations of DPA and OPD.

{"title": "Target infrared detection in target spray\n", "abstract": " Crops in agriculture and forestry are normally planted discretely. The chemical sprayed between crops would cause great waste and serious environment pollution. Therefore realization of the precision spray has great significance. This research discussed the method to realize automatic target detection using infrared detect technology. The infrared can avoid the interference of the visible light effectively and the response speed is very fast. Therefore it can be used to implement non-tough detection. Photoelectric detection systems based on infrared detect technology are normally stable, reliable, low cost, simple structure, and easy to be practically utilized. Therefore it is widely used in the on-line real time detection field. Its key point is to determinate the characteristic wavelength or wave band. The infrared lights emitted from the infrared light emitting diode were irradiated to the detected objects. The reflected infrared lights could be received by the photoelectric device. Then control signal was triggered and automatic target spray was realized. Code-division infrared detection circuit was used in the system. Modulated pulse infrared signals using different coding were used in different photodetector units in the built system so as to eliminate the light path interference between different detector units and other light signal interferences. Therefore the interference capacity of the system is high. The test results showed that the automatic target spray equipment set up in the study could detect crop targets automatically. The light wavelength used in the test is 850 nm. The detection range was tunable within 0.1-0.5 m. The least targets detectable distance\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["298"]}

In cell culture, tPA was released only from stromal cells and uPA only from glandular cells as determined by SDS-PAGE followed by fibrin overlay technique, but PA inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) was secreted by both stromal and glandular cells. Furthermore, secretion of PAs from endometrial cells was enhanced by adding estradiol and markedly inhibited by progesterone in a dose dependent manner, while the PAI reacted just in the opposite way. The effect of the peptide hormones, hCG, GnRH, PRL, as well as cAMP in cell culture on the secretion of PAs and PAI was similar to that of estradiol, while forskolin demonstrated definitely more stimulative effect on tPA than uPA. Taking into account of the finding of the present study, it appears that, under hormonal control, a balance between PAs and PAI in the endometrium exists.

A power flow calculation interface is developed to load data of the connection of modern large-scale AC grid. Then the random test method was used to summarize the rules of DC current distribution. The results are gained as follows: the larger the AC grid, the more the DC current distribution is caused; the DC current distribution is increased by towers and overhead ground wires; though the local DC current distribution is increased, the total DC current distribution is suppressed by mitigation methods. The simulation software is suitable for DC current distribution computation and evaluating the mitigation methods, and it provides reference for analysis, forecast, mitigation, and adverse effects of DC current distributions.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["298"]}

MLS and TES observations of tropospheric O3 during 2005 to 2009 reveal a distinct, persistent O3 maximum, both in mixing ratio and tropospheric column, in May over the Equatorial Southern Indian Ocean (ESIO). The maximum is most pronounced in 2006 and 2008 and less evident in the other three years. This feature is also consistent with the total column O3 observations from the Ozone Mapping Instrument (OMI) and the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). Model results reproduce the observed May O3 maximum and the associated interannual variability. The origin of the maximum reflects a complex interplay of chemical and dynamic factors. The O3 maximum is dominated by the O3 production driven by lightning nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions, which accounts for 62% of the tropospheric column O3 in May 2006. We find the contribution from biomass burning, soil, anthropogenic and biogenic sources to the O3 maximum are rather small. The O3 productions in the lightning outflow from Central Africa and South America both peak in May and are directly responsible for the O3 maximum over the western ESIO. The lightning outflow from Equatorial Asia dominates over the eastern ESIO. The interannual variability of the O3 maximum is driven largely by the anomalous anti-cyclones over the southern Indian Ocean in May 2006 and 2008.

Using a mathematical model of HIV transmission calibrated to available HIV epidemiology data from PNG, we evaluated the expected population-level impact of reductions in ART availability. If the number of people on ART falls to 10% of its current level, then there could be an approximately doubling in annual incidence and an additional 12,848 AIDS-related deaths (100.7% increase) over the next 5 years; if ART provision is halved, then annual incidence would increase by ~68%,  and there would be an additional ~10,936  AIDS-related deaths (85.7% increase).

Proposed algorithm has considered the effects by processing characteristics and has induced a statistical scheme, so that the edge recognition result can reach to the sub-pixel level by establishing the mathematics model of transitional region. The algorithm also can offer a wide single-pixel and continuous edge, which can meet the precision measurement requirements.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["298"]}

Recently, the carbon nanotube field emission display has drawn more and more concern. With its excellent image display quality and low fabrication expense, the printable CNT-FED will take the place of cathode ray tube as the major consumer-priced and mass-market display. A normal CNT-FED device is composed of the CNT cathode, the gate electrode, the anode and dielectric insulator layers. The gate electrode in CNT-FED is used to modulate and address the electron beam. Because some electrons may be collected by the gate electrode in a triode, the brightness of the image is decreased. This paper proposes a novel gate structure fabricated on a glass plate with diabolo funnels. Chemical corrosion was utilized to produce diabolo funnels in the glass dielectric layer and HF with the 40% concentration with sulfuric acid is used.

The database has very important effects on agriculture products quality analysis and agriculture breeding. What the NIR researchers and NIR users care about is how to utilize information of the foundation database fully. To share the NIR resource, unifying the scanning term to get high quality spectra is the first step. This article uses wheat powder as sample to study the influence of different resolution, different He-Ne frequency and sample granularity on the wheat powder protein model. The results show that scanning sample by 4, 8 or 16 cm (-1) resolution has little influence on the wheat powder protein math model. The change in He-Ne frequency has influence to wavenumber accuracy, but when the change is within 1 cm (-1), the influence is indistinctive. For FT-NIR instruments with He-Ne to have better stability, we needn't often adjust the He-Ne wavenumber.

The thermal stability is investigated through TGA and FTIR, respectively. When the temperature reaches up to 500\u00a0\u00b0C, all the organic absorption peaks disappear and only ZnO emerges. In summary, the attractive properties of the aerogel promote the potential applications of their nanostructures.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["298"]}
{"title": "A noise-adjusted iterative randomized singular value decomposition method for hyperspectral image denoising\n", "abstract": " In this paper, a new denoising algorithm is proposed for hyperspectral image data cubes. With the strong correlations of the image bands, the low-rank structure of the hyperspectral image is explored by lexicographically ordering the 3-D data cube into 2-D matrix. Based on this property, the traditional principal component analysis (PCA) denoising model is established. For hyperspectral images (HSIs), the noise intensity in different bands is different. Therefore, a noise-adjusted iterative randomized singular value decomposition (NAIRSVD) algorithm is proposed to solve this PCA model. Combined with adaptive noise estimation and upper bound rank estimation, the proposed NAIRSVD algorithm is free from manual parameter determination. Several experiments were conducted to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["298"]}

{"title": "Effect of cervus and cucumis peptides on osteoblast activity and fracture healing in osteoporotic bone\n", "abstract": " Osteoporosis is associated with delayed and/or reduced fracture healing. As cervus and cucumis are the traditional Chinese treatments for rheumatoid arthritis, we investigated the effect of supplementation of these peptides (CCP) on bone fracture healing in ovariectomized (OVX) osteoporotic rats in vitro and in vivo. CCP enhanced osteoblast proliferation and increased alkaline phosphatase activity, matrix mineralization, and expression of runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), and osteopontin. In vivo, female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent ovariectomy and the right femora were fractured and fixed by intramedullary nailing 3 months later. Rats received intraperitoneal injections of either CCP (1.67\u2009mg/kg) or physiological saline every day for 30 days. Fracture healing and callus formation were evaluated by radiography, micro-CT, biomechanical testing, and histology. At 12 weeks after fracture, calluses in CCP-treated bones showed significantly higher torsional strength and greater stiffness than control-treated bones. Bones in CCP-treated rats reunified and were thoroughly remodeled, while two saline-treated rats showed no bone union and incomplete remodeling. Taken together, these results indicate that use of CCP after fracture in osteoporotic rats accelerates mineralization and osteogenesis and improves fracture healing.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["298"]}

{"title": "Linear computation for independent social influence\n", "abstract": " Recent years have witnessed the increased interests in exploiting influence in social networks for many applications. To the best of our knowledge, from the computational aspect of social influence analysis, most of existing work focus on either describing the influence propagation process or identifying the set of most influential seed nodes. However, these work usually do not distinguish the \"independent influence\" of each single seed node after removing other seeds. Since it is important to quickly figure out the real contribution of each seed, in this paper we propose to measure the seed's independent influence by a linear social influence model. Specifically, we first describe the linear social influence model, and then define the independent influence under this model for eliminating the \"mutual enrichment\" between seed nodes.

In this study, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to NS3 helicase were characterized by epitope mapping and biological function test. A total of 29 monoclonal antibodies were produced to the truncated NS3 helicase of HCV-1b (T1b-rNS3, aa1192\u20131459). Six mAbs recognized 8/29 16mer peptides, which contributed to identify 5 linear and 1 discontinuous putative epitope sequences. Seven mAbs reacted with HCV-2a JFH-1 infected Huh-7.5.1 cells by immunofluorescent staining, of which 2E12 and 3E5 strongly bound to the exposed linear epitope 1231PTGSGKSTK1239 (EP05) or core motif 1373IPFYGKAI1380 (EP21), respectively. Five other mAbs recognized semi-conformational or conformational epitopes of HCV helicase. MAb 2E12 binds to epitope EP05 at the ATP binding site of motif I in domain 1, while mAb 3E5 reacts with epitope EP21 close to helicase nucleotide binding region of domain 2. Epitope EP05 is totally conserved and EP21 highly conserved across HCV genotypes. These two epitope peptides reacted strongly with 59\u201379% chronic and weakly with 30\u201358% resolved HCV infected blood donors, suggesting that these epitopes were dominant in HCV infection.

Desorption of Hg increases with the increase of extracting time, until the highest desorption amount at 6\u20138 h, and then declines. It indicates that timeliness is very important when organic acids are used for phytoremediation in contaminated soils. When the concentrations of organic acids increase from 1.0 mmol/L to 10.0 mmol/L, Hg desorption increases significantly regardless of oxalic or citric acid.

To overcome the shortcomings of traditional ant colony optimization, the premium-penalty strategy is introduced, and the pheromone diversity of the good paths and the ordinary ones is increased to polarize pheromone density of all paths. Thus, a new algorithm namely Premium-Penalty Ant Colony Optimization is proposed to discrete and simulate the problem of the critical slip surface searching, by which the critical slip surface of slope can be located. Through two typical examples, one with simple slope and the other with complicated slope, and an application example of a slope project of a dam, the efficiency and effectiveness of the new algorithm are verified.

The study was designed to describe information on the length of ICU stay from a single institution experience of old critically ill gastric cancer patients after surgery and the framework of incorporating data-mining techniques into the prediction. Methods: A retrospective design was adopted to collect the consecutive data about patients aged 60 or over with a gastric cancer diagnosis after surgery in an adult intensive care unit in a medical university hospital in Shenyang, China, from January 2010 to March 2011. Characteristics of patients and the length their ICU stay were gathered for analysis by univariate and multivariate Cox regression to examine the relationship with potential candidate factors. A regression tree was constructed to predict the length of ICU stay and explore the important indicators. Results: Multivariate Cox analysis found that shock and nutrition support need were statistically significant risk factors for prolonged length of ICU stay. Altogether, eight variables entered the regression model, including age, APACHE II score, SOFA score, shock, respiratory system dysfunction, circulation system dysfunction, diabetes and nutrition support need. The regression tree indicated comorbidity of two or more kinds of shock as the most important factor for prolonged length of ICU stay in the studied sample.

METHODS: The study was based upon a personal questionnaire and a determination of Hp antigen using the Hp stool antigen test (HpSA) method. A total of 938 subjects and 96 families were selected in Wuwei city. Eighty children and teenagers with a definite positive Hp stool antigen test were examined by serum Western blotting method. RESULTS: The prevalence of Hp was 72.3%(678/938) with no age difference. Prevalence of Hp infection was correlated with type of dwelling, occupation of parents, drinking water source, kindergarten attendance, consumption of raw vegetables, a poor oral hygiene and breast feeding etc. According to the multivariate analysis, drinking water source, kindergarten attendance and consumption of raw vegetables were most strongly associated with prevalence of Hp in children and adolescents. The infection rate of parents whose children were infected with Hp was higher than that of those whose children were not infected [82.3%(121/147) vs 47.4%(18/38), chi (2)= 19.736, P< 0.05].

The subjects underwent polysomnography and OSAHS was defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI)> or= 5. The systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were measured. IR was evaluated by fasting serum true insulin (TI) level and IR index based on the homeostasis model assessment method (HOMA-IR). In the OSAHS group, multiple linear regression was used with either TI or HOMA-IR as the dependent variable, and the corresponding set of independent variables included age, BMI, WHR, AHI and minimum oxygen saturation (MSpO2). RESULTS: After adjustment for age, BMI, and WHR, the OSAHS group was more insulin resistant, as indicated by the higher levels of TI and HOMA-IR. Multiple linear regression showed that the central obesity parameter (WHR) was the major determinant of IR of the OSAHS group, while sleep-disordered breathing parameters (AHI and MSpO2) were also independent determinants of IR of the group (TI: AHI P= 0.017, TI: MSpO2 P= 0.005; HOMA-IR: AHI P= 0.008, HOMA-IR: MSpO2 P= 0.003).

{"title": "Porphyromonas gingivalis Gingipains Display Transpeptidation Activity\n", "abstract": " Porphyromonas gingivalis is a keystone periodontal pathogen that has been associated with autoimmune disorders. The cell surface proteases Lys-gingipain (Kgp) and Arg-gingipains (RgpA and RgpB) are major virulence factors, and their proteolytic activity is enhanced by small peptides such as glycylglycine (GlyGly). The reaction kinetics suggested that GlyGly may function as an acceptor molecule for gingipain-catalyzed transpeptidation. Purified gingipains and P. gingivalis whole cells were used to digest selected substrates including human hemoglobin in the presence or absence of peptide acceptors. Mass spectrometric analysis of the substrates digested with gingipains in the presence of GlyGly showed that transpeptidation outcompeted hydrolysis, whereas the trypsin-digested controls exhibited predominantly hydrolysis activity. The transpeptidation levels increased with increasing concentration of GlyGly\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["298"]}

{"title": "Resynchronizing model-based self-adaptive systems with environments\n", "abstract": " Self-adaptive systems are attractive due to their ability of adapting to changeable environments automatically. However, such systems may be subject to runtime failures when all environmental dynamics cannot be adequately considered at design time. When such failures occur at runtime, a system's internal adaptation logic usually has become inconsistent with its environment, according to our observation. We call this inconsistency sync-loss error. From our project experiences, we empirically identified a strong correlation between sync-loss error and system failure. This motivated us to fix sync-loss error in order to reduce failure for self-adaptive systems. In this paper, we formulate the problem of detecting sync-loss error, and present a framework ReSync to automatically fix sync-loss errors by desynchronizing a system with its environment.

{"title": "The etiology of intellectual styles: Contributions from intelligence and personality\n", "abstract": " Intellectual style is a construct that is rooted in both the literatures on intelligence and personality and, at least partially, is intended to connect these two literatures. In individuals, the connection between intelligence and personality arises and unfolds as a person, possessing both, utilizes them in unique combinations in any given situation. Thus, styles are a type of psychological phenomenon, one that encapsulates the dynamics of the interactions between intelligence and personality in particular situations (for detailed reviews, see Sternberg, 1997; Sternberg & Zhang, 2001; Zhang & Sternberg, 2006).This general definition of styles suggests that this construct might have both stable and dynamic features. Specifically, because both intelligence and personality form the foundation of styles, they establish the stable features of an individual\u2019s styles. However, because styles are manifested in many different situations, dynamic features are necessary for flexible and adaptive reactions to these situations. Moreover, this general definition of styles also suggests that, etiologically, styles might arise through the recruitment of the etiological factors that contribute to intelligence and personality. In other words, a hypothesis can be formulated that, given that styles are constructs that are at least partially derived from intelligence and personality, some insight can be gained into the etiology of styles by looking into the etiologies of intelligence and personality.

With the development of power grid construction, corona problem of UHVDC transmission lines becomes a research focus. In the rainfall process, a lot of water drops will formed on the wire surface, which can change corona characteristics of transmission lines obviously. To study the influence of water drops on corona characteristics of DC transmission lines, the corona discharge process has investigated in a corona cage with one water drop attached to the surface of the high voltage conductor. The corona inception voltage and corona current characteristics of the saturated water drops or mist on the conductor surface were studied including the effect of the change of the water conductivity. The result shows that corona discharge with one water drop on the surface of the conductor is a complex process including the deformation and ejection of small water drops, the ionization of the air around the tip of the water drop. When the conductor is attached with saturated water drops or mist, the corona inception voltage decreases to about 25% or 40% compared with that of smooth conductor.

Observations from TES, surface sites (NOAA/GMD), and aircraft (MOZAIC) are used for evaluation of the a posteriori solution. Global intercomparison of the different satellite datasets using GEOS-Chem as a common intercomparison platform shows consistency between the satellite datasets and with the in situ data.

Proposed nonlinear dielectric waveguide is of great value because it can not only regulate the lateral shift but also implement control over the incident field intensity.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["298"]}
{"title": "Can we Detect an Influence over North America From Increasing Asian NOx Emissions?\n", "abstract": " Several studies have reported a rapid increase in Asian NOx emissions. This knowledge, combined with our observations of long-range transport and global chemical transport models, suggests that we may soon be able to identify an influence on atmospheric composition over the Eastern Pacific and North American regions. Using the GEOS-CHEM model, we find that the Asian contribution to PAN in the free troposphere over the Eastern Pacific is approximately 50%. To estimate the magnitude of change in the Eastern Pacific troposphere we might expect from the recent Asian emission changes, we have conducted two simulations, one with standard emissions inventory and one with doubled emissions of NOx and NMHC from East Asia. Based on published data, a doubling of NOx emissions would be approximately correct for the period of 1999-2007.

H101 is a recombinant oncolytic adenovirus that is cytolytic in cells lacking intact p53, but it is unable to eradicate caner stem cells. In this study, we tested a new strategy of tumor gene therapy by combining a Notch1-siRNA with H101 oncolytic adenovirus. In HeLa-S3 tumor cells, the combined therapy blocked the Notch pathway and induced apoptosis in tumors that are p53-inactive. In nude mice bearing xenograft tumors derived from HeLa-S3 cells, the combination of H101/Notch1-siRNA therapies inhibited tumor growth. Moreover, Notch1-siRNA increased Hexon gene expression at both the transcriptional and the translational levels, and promoted H101 replication in tumors, thereby enhancing the oncolytic activity of H101. These data demonstrate the feasibility to combine H101 p53-targted oncolysis and anti-Notch siRNA activities as a novel anti-cancer therapy.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["298"]}

The solubility of DMAP in organic phase and aqueous phase was examined and the mass fraction of DMAP to PEI was optimized to 8%. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy results showed that when catalyzed by DMAP, almost all the amino groups of PEI were cross-linked with TMC into amide groups, and thus a smooth and integrated layer was formed on the polysulfone support membrane. The rejection of PEI/TMC composite membrane against NaCl was improved to 85.4% as compared with 45.2%. Combined with the donating electron effects of 1-tertiary amine and 4-methylamino groups, the catalytic mechanism for DMAP in this PEI-based interfacial polymerization was proposed.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["298"]}
{"title": "ConsView: towards application-specific consistent context views\n", "abstract": " Detecting and resolving context inconsistency is critical to pervasive computing applications and infrastructures. Context inconsistency occurs when an application perceives contexts that breach predefined consistency constraints. This can drive an application to behave abnormally or even cause failure. Existing work commonly assumes the presence of a single application suffering from context inconsistency, such that specific repair actions can be taken to resolve the inconsistency for this application. However, when multiple applications run on the same infrastructure, they may impose conflicting requirements on resolving context inconsistency. In this paper, we propose a novel view-based approach ConsView to address such conflicting requirements. In ConsView, each application has a specific view to its own contexts that satisfy its own requirement on resolving context inconsistency.

METHODS: The lead concentrations of food sample from 3rd Chinese total diet study were determined, and then were combined with the food consumption by population of ten age-sex groups, The lead intakes, and its distribution and dietary sources were obtained. RESULTS: It was found that the mean and median concentrations of lead in all food samples were 0.118 and 0.052 mg/kg, respectively. The highest concentration of individual sample and mean concentrations of lead in preserved egg were 8.964 mg/kg and 2.577 mg/kg, respectively. The vegetable samples in Hubei Province were heavily contaminated. The lead intakes by different age-sex groups were estimated to be 54.9-112.7 microg/day. The average dietary lead intakes by 2-7 years old group could reach 86.1% of PTWI, and individual lead intakes by about 30% children in this group exceed PTWI. But the average dietary lead intakes of other age-sex population groups ranged from 42.8% to 86.1% of PTWI. The main sources of dietary lead were cereals and vegetables in ten age-sex population groups, and could reach 72%-80% of total lead intakes. CONCLUSION: Although the dietary lead intakes by different age-sex population groups are all lower than PTWI, it should be decreased to a lower level. Moreover, the dietary exposures to lead are higher enough for 2-7 years old children and population in some provinces to be considered seriously.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["298"]}

We illustrate the improvements in STEM field predictions before and after data assimilation. We also compare three popular optimization methods for data assimilation and conclude that L-BFGS method is the best for our model because it requires fewer model runs to recover optimal initial conditions.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["298"]}

And the results indicated that the feeding amount of ladybird increased sharply at the initial days after eclosion, and then decreased gradually. The feeding amount and the consumption index (CI) of the beetles fed on cotton aphid were three to four times higher than that of the beetles fed with artificial diets. The feeding amount of the beetles fed with diet containing sucrose was significantly higher than that of the beetles fed with diets without sucrose, which proved that the sucrose had the function of increasing food intake for Propylea japonica; As to the relative growth rate (RGR) and approximate digestibility (AD), there existed significant difference between the control and the beetles fed with artificial diets, due to the unbalance of the nutrition or existing some antinutritional facts in the artificial diets probably. While the Efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI) and the efficiency of conversion of digested food (ECD) in the control were significantly higher than that in beetles fed with artificial diets, which was probably the strategy of the insects whose food intake was low to survive. Furthermore, the results indicated that the dietary sucrose could improve AD, ECI and ECD of the artificial diets. As to the effects of the artificial diets on the body composition, the results showed that contents of moisture, crude protein and crude fat of female Propylea japonica were 58.77%, 15.93% and 11.30%, respectively.

Sponges, bryozoans, and ascidians are among the most promising groups. The compounds with antimicrobial and antitumor activity have been frequently found in marine mollusks. Ruditapes philippinarum, belonging to Ruditapes, Veneridae, Bivalvia, is frequently taken as tasty seafood and also a traditional medicine in the Far East for its nutrients and bioactivities for treating internal fever, infections and tumescence. So far no report is available on the antitumor effect of proteoglycan extract from R. philippinarum both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we studied the antitumor activities of purified extract from R. philippinarum flesh using tumor-bearing mice and cell lines. Two proteoglycans (PG1, PG2) were purified from hot water extract of R. philippinarum. PG1 was a single Mw 20000 proteoglycan, containing 70.09% of polysaccharide and 15.4% of protein. PG2 contained 82.53% of polysaccharide and 7.26% of protein. The inhibition ratio for SMMC-7721 cells of PG1 at concentration of 200\u03bcg/ml was 73.30%, and increasing concentration did not enhance the inhibitory effect obviously. PG2 inhibited SMMC-7721 cells proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, and it achieved the same inhibitory effect at concentration of over 500\u03bcg/ml as PG1 achieved at 200\u03bcg/ml. PG1 did not inhibit the growth of human hepatocyte cell HL-7702 when tested in the same concentrations shown to be cytotoxic towards tumor cells.

A configuration-units evaluation system consisting of economic profit, reliability, supply capability, security and derivative ability is then proposed. Fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is adopted to select the connection modes by taking into account the increase of load, thus realizing the configuration-unit evaluation with the experiential index and the calculative index.

METHODS: VEGF expression and MVD in 82 specimens of primary esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, resected from Jan 1981 through May 1994, were examined by immunohistochemistry staining (SP method), using anti-VEGF polyclonal antibody and anti-factor VIII monoclonal antibody. The relationship between VEGF expression and MVD and postoperative survival of patient was analyzed. RESULTS: Fifty-two out of the eighty-two specimens of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (63.4%) showed positive expression of VEGF. The median of MVD in tumor was 37/mm2 (9-150/mm2). There was a close correlation between MVD and VEGF expression (P= 0.001). The survival rate of patients with high MVD in the tumor was significantly lower than that of patients with low MVD (P= 0.017). The higher the level of expression of VEGF in tumor, the poorer prognosis for the patients (P= 0.000).

The microstructure was studied by using XRD, TEM and magnetic measurements. The results showed that the nanometer-sized Fe particles uniformly dispersed in the amorphousIn2O3. Appropriate annealing leads to the crystallization of In2O3 films and the growth of theFe particle size. As a result, the magnetic behavior of the films transits from superparamagneticto ferromagnetic. The variation of the lattice constant for In2O3 depends on the volume fractionof Fe particles.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["298"]}

HCl, GlcNH_2 and NAG on human hepatoma SMMC-7721 cells in vitro was investigated. The antitumor activity of GlcNH_2? HCl against Sarcoma_ (180) in KM mice was also investigated. Methods The cell viability in vitro was examined with MTT assay. DNA isolation and cell-cycle analyses were also performed. GlcNH_2? HCl was ig administered to Sarcoma_ (180) KM mice. The inhibition rates, spleen and thymus index were calculated. Results GlcNH_2? HCl and GlcNH_2 resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in hepatoma cell growth. The inhibition rates against SMMC-7721 cell of GlcNH_2? HCl and GlcNH_2 at concentration of 500? g? mL~(-1) were (50.24)% and 52.19%. As to the concentration of 1000? g? mL~(1), the rates were (82.21%) and 83.20%. This effect was accompanied by a marked increase in the proportion of S phase cells. Compared with the control, there was no significant difference among various concentrations of NAG, GlcNH_ (2)? HCl exhibited inhibitiory effect against Sarcoma_ (180) in mice at the dosage of 125~ 500 mg? kg~(-1), and the inhibition rate was about 27.84%~ 34.02%. The optimal inhibitory effect was 250 mg? kg~(-1). GlcNH_2? HCl could enhance the weights of thymus and spleen. In addition, it could promote lymphocyte transformation.

METHODS: Forty-eight healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into a control group (n= 8) and a model group (n= 40; intraperitoneal injection of 10% D-galactosamine). The model group was further divided into five subgroups according to the time lapse after model establishment (8, 16, 24, 48, and 72 hours). At the end of the experiments, homogenates of mesenteric lymph nodes, liver and spleen were cultured in agar for bacterial outgrowth. Hematoxylin-eosin stained sections of liver and terminal ileum were examined under an optical microscope to assess pathological changes. mRNA expression of RD-5, sPLA2 and lysozyme in the terminal ileum was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase reaction (RT-PCR), and protein expression of sPLA2 and lysozyme from the same anatomic location was determined by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Means between groups were compared with one-way analysis of variance. RESULTS: ALF was successfully induced in the D-galactosamine injected rats.

{"title": "Shared Subspace Learning for Latent Representation of Multi-View Data.\n", "abstract": " The pervasive existence of multi-view data has made conventional single view data analysis methods to confront with great challenge. To exploit new analysis technique for multi-view data has become one of active topics in the field of machine learning. From the point of shared subspace learning, this paper focuses on capturing the shared latent representation across multi-view by constructing the correlation in a shared subspace. Different from the classical canonical correlation analysis (CCA), a more general model for learning a shared subspace was proposed, which not only provides an explicit latent representation but also can leverage favorably the contributions from different views for capturing the complementary information across multi-view. In order to preserve well the local structure of data in the both shared subspace and original multiview feature spaces, a graph constraint is employed. Meanwhile, with the assist of prior class label, the boosted discriminative ability of the proposed multi-view analysis model can be achieved. The experimental results on the multi-view data retrieval and classification verify the effectiveness of the proposed model.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["298"]}

{"title": "Thinking styles in student learning and development\n", "abstract": " For the past seven decades, scholars have been investigating the roles of intellectual styles in human learning and development (Morgan, 1997). Intellectual styles, a general term for different constructs with or without the root word \u201cstyle\u201d, such as cognitive style, learning style, conceptual tempo, and thinking style, refer to people\u2019s preferred ways of processing information (Zhang and Sternberg, 2006). Although various intellectual styles are conceptually different (Sternberg and Zhang, 2001b), they are similar in a fundamental way: all of them are different from abilities. An ability refers to what one can do, whereas a style refers to how one prefers to use the abilities that one has. Major theorization and research on styles has been summarized in several recent publications (eg Jonassen and Grabowski, 1993; Riding and Cheema, 1991; Sternberg and Zhang, 2001a; Zhang and Sternberg, 2006, 2009a).This chapter\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["298"]}

METHODS: The single base change polymorphism in TNF-\u03b1 and CTLA-4 gene was analyzed in 140 Chinese Han patients with hemophilia A who have been treated with plasma-derived FVIII concentrates and 108 normal controls by using PCR-restrictive fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). All of the HA patients' plasma samples were measured by modified-Nijmegen assay simultaneously. RESULTS: In HA patients, G/G genotype, G/A genotype and A/A genotype were detected in 118 (84.3%), 18 (12.8%) and 4 cases (2.9%) respectively; C/C genotype, C/T genotype and T/T genotype were detected in 108 (77.2%), 30 (21.4%) and 2 cases (1.4%) respectively. The difference in the genotype frequencies between HA patients and controls was nonsignificant (P> 0.05). Patients who were carriers of homozygotes for A allele had a higher risk of inhibitor development compared with those who were not (OR= 7.519, 95% CI= 3.168-17.844). Severe HA patients who were carriers of homozygotes for A allele had a higher risk of inhibitor development compared with those who were not (OR= 8.163, 95% CI= 2.521-26.434).

The aim of this study was to investigate the presence and epidemiology of paragonimiasis in Jinhua which is next to Fujian, China. The differences of Paragonimus westmani isolates from Jinhua and other areas of the world were also analyzed. Freshwater crabs and snails from streams located in each of the villages were dissected for isolation of Paragonimus metacercariae. The epidemiology data were further analyzed by using geographic information systems (GIS). We found that the infestation rate for the Paragonimus cercariae in snails was as low as 2.3%, while that was as high as 76.67% in crabs. So, freshwater crabs were demonstrated as one of the main hosts for P. metacercariae in Jinhua. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis indicated that the sequences of the second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) and cytochrome coxidase subunit I (COI) were conserved among different isolates, especially for the ITS2 gene. Based on the phylogenetic trees generated from the comparison results of COI gene, it was interesting to find that Paragonimus strains from different areas were present in different cluster. We conclude that the COI gene of Paragonimus can be a molecular marker contributing to the typing and source tracking for Paragonimiasis.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["298"]}

The results showed with different rail sources, the yield of ferrate ranged from high to low were Fe (NO3) 3, FeCl3 and Fe2 (SO4) 3, and their production rates are 42.2%, 37% and 32.2% respectively. NaIO4 and NaSiO3 improved the yield of ferrate salts, and effectively inhibited the decomposition of ferrate salts at the same time. Adding 0.1% NaIO4, the decomposition rate of ferrate salts could reduce to 1/5 of what it was, and it extended the preservation time. But Na2SO4, CuSO4 reduced the yield of ferrate salts and accelerated the decomposition of ferrate salts. Therefore Fe (NO3) 3 is the best rail source of ferrate salts and NaIO4 is the best stabilizer for inhibiting the decomposition of ferrate salts.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["298"]}

{"title": "Learning a flexible question classifier\n", "abstract": " To generate high quality answers, many question taxonomies designed for modern question answering systems are getting more and more complex and fine-grained. Furthermore, without concrete context some questions are ambiguous and are difficult to be correctly labeled by question classifier, even by people manually. All above bring a big challenge to current question classifiers. However, previous research seldom pays attention to these situations above. In general, the labeled question dataset is usually small, so a feasible solution to these issues is to integrate new feedbacks and certain domain-specific knowledge into current model continuously. In this paper we explore the application of an online learning algorithm to question classification. The experimental results show that the performance of our approach is comparable to other popular learning algorithms: SVMs and SNoW.

Several examples show that extended method (EMC) has both the characteristics of random walking and random jumping, so that it is higher precious and more effective; and moreover EMC can work properly whether or not the initial slip surface is convergence solving safety factor.

But Kapton is susceptible to atomic oxygen(AO) erosion. Exposure experiment ground-based simulation facility indicate that it undergoes mass loss and surface degradation. XPS was used to characterize the chemical and physical change of the surface of Kapton after AO irradiation. Strong oxidative degradation of Kapton and substantial changes in surpermolecular organization and morphology of its surface. layer were observed after AO irradiation. The results suggest that AO not only reacts with Kapton surfaces, but also the transfer of the energy of particle collisions of chain macromolecules in surface layer aids in the development of physicochemical reaction processes. It is evident that siloxane coatings have excellent properties for anti-AO effects.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["298"]}

In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, RetS modulates the phosphorylation state of another kinase GacS via a direct interaction. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to study the effect of retS on the antibiotic 2, 4-diacetyl-phloroglucinol (2, 4-DAPG) production in P. fluorescens 2P24. METHODS: Production of 2, 4-DAPG in strain 2P24 and its mutants was quantified by HPLC. To determine the effect of RetS on the Gac/Rsm pathway, the promoters of the small RNA genes rsmX/rsmY/rsmZ and regulatory genes rsmA/rsmE in the Rsm pathway were fused with a promoterless lacZ, and the promoter activities were measured in 2P24 and the retS-deficient mutants. RESULTS: Genetic inactivation of the retS in strain 2P24 increased the production of an uncharacterized red pigment and the antibiotic 2, 4-DAPG. RetS negatively regulated the transcription of the small RNAs RsmX and RsmZ. In the retS and gacS double mutant or the retS and gacA double mutant, all the phenotypic changes caused by the retS deletion were reversed to the level of gacS or gacA single gene mutant.

It is found that at the same doping level, Ni doping introduces nearly twice the number of charge carriers as Co doping. However, x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy measurements reveal that the valence state of Fe in both systems is close to 2, indicating that there is no valence mismatch. We suggest that the charge carriers in CaFe 1\u2212 x M x AsF (M= transition metal elements) are not induced by valence mismatch but come from the difference in the number of outer-shell electrons.

In contrast to the difficulty in carrying out electrophilic substitutions at carbon atoms in the pyridine ring under highly acidic solvent conditions, reactions in the gas phase overcame the conjugate acidification of pyridine in the solvent phase, thus decreasing the hardness of this electrophilic coupling. Through product ion mass spectra of the ion at m/z 157, we have shown that this ion was protonated bipyridyl rather than the ion/molecule adduct. A computational study of the heat of formation surface also supported the formation of polypyridyls through the electrophilic substitution of pyridine.

Analysis of modeled BC concentrations compared to in situ observations indicates levels are underestimated over most of Southeast Asia when using 5 any of four different emission inventories. We thus attempt to reduce uncertainties in BC emissions and improve BC model simulations by developing top-down, spatially resolved, estimates of BC emissions through assimilation of OMI observations of aerosol absorption optical depth (AAOD) with the GEOS-Chem model and its adjoint for April and October of 2006. Overwhelming enhancements, up to 500%, in anthropogenic BC 10 emissions are shown after optimization over broad areas of Southeast Asia in April. In October, the optimization of anthropogenic emissions yields a slight reduction (1\u223c 5%) over India and parts of southern China, while emissions increase by 10\u223c 50% over eastern China. Observational data from in situ measurements and AERONET observations are used to evaluate the BC inversions and assess the bias between OMI and 15 AERONET AAOD. Low biases in BC concentrations are improved or corrected in most eastern and central sites over China after optimization, while the constrained model still underestimates concentrations in Indian sites in both April and October, possibly as a consequence of low prior emissions.

{"title": "IDEA: improving dependability for self-adaptive applications\n", "abstract": " Self-adaptive applications are becoming popular since they are able to adapt their behavior based on changes of environments. However, possible faults in these applications may result in runtime failures, which reduce their dependability. We propose a novel approach to improving the dependability of self-adaptive applications. The approach uses a rematching process to make self-adaptive applications consistent with their environments. In the rematching process, consistency failures are automatically detected and fixed at runtime to reduce application failures. The strategy for fixing consistency failures includes backward rematching and forward rematching. Proper strategies can be selected according to rematching ability analysis results for concerned applications. As a result, applications can thus achieve consistency with their environments and failures can be significantly avoided. We developed a tool\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["298"]}

{"title": "Autotransplantation of submandibular gland for severe keratoconjunctivitis sicca\n", "abstract": " Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), or dry eye syndrome, is a relatively common disease of the ocular surface. It is attributable to different disturbances of the natural function and protective mechanism of the external eye, leading to an unstable tear film. In extreme cases KCS can lead to blindness not only because the precorneal tear film is essential for corneal transparency but also because the dry eye develops keratitis with ulceration and opacification. Most cases develop gradually over many years with decreasing tear production and ocular surface damage as the final stage of the degenerative process. Severe cases can lead to vision-threatening complication.The current therapeutic options are largely to treat the symptoms, for instance by the use of artificial tear substitutes and retention of tears by occlusion of lacrimal drainage parts into the nose. Although effective in mild cases, these treatment modalities have proved unsatisfactory in the management of severe cases. Treatment of KCS is often frustrating for patients and ophthalmologists. Because of similarities in fluid composition, Filatov, in 1950, treated KCS by diverting the parotid duct into the conjunctival sac. Patients reported improvement in vision, but this procedure brought its own problems such as epiphora, gustatory secretion, and traumatic keratitis due to constant wiping of the eye to remove excessive secretions.

{"title": "Transport and magnetic properties of the CuIr2\u2212 xAlxS4 system\n", "abstract": " Transport and magnetic properties of the CuIr 2\u2212 x Al x S 4 system have been investigated. It is found that the Peierls-like phase transition is suppressed with the substitution of Al. In addition, the resistivity under strong magnetic field shows that the Peierls-like phase transition is very steady to the external field. The study of magnetization reveals that the density of states at the Fermi level [N (E F)] is not influenced by the doping of Al, while the localization length is decreased with the increase of Al. Theoretically, we find that the upturn of the magnetization at low temperatures is produced by paramagnetic clusters, which are formed by several moments captured by defects. Moreover, the increase of Al content just increases the number of capture centers, but does not affect the magnetic moment of a single paramagnetic cluster.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["298"]}

{"title": "Effect of low level laser irradiation on CXCR3 gene expression in rheumatoid arthritis joint\n", "abstract": " Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by the infiltration of leukocytes into the synovial tissue and synovial fluid of joints, ultimately leading to destruction of cartilage and bone. Low-level laser irradiation (LLLI) is evaluated for treating RA, however, the molecular basis mechanism underlying the effectiveness of LLLI is unclear. Chemokines and those receptors play a central role in the progression of RA inflammation. CXCR3 may be recruited directly from the circulation into the synovial sublining regions by its ligand, CXCL9, produced by synovial fibroblasts. The objectives of this study were to determine whether LLLI decreased production of CXCR3 and CXCL9 in RA joints of type II collagen induced RA (CIA) rats. Total RNA was isolated from rat knee joints with or without treatment of 830 nm LLLI irradiation, and gene expression profiles were analyzed by DNA microarray (Affymetrix, 41,000 genes). As results, LLLI significantly reduced CXCR3 mRNA level, but not significantly reduced CXCL9. The reduction of CXCR3 mRNA levels was confirmed by RT-PCR and real-time PCR. Since CXCR3 plays an important role of the progression of RA, the reduction of CXCR3 gene expression may be one of important mechanisms in reduction of inflammation in RA joints by LLLI.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["298"]}

When a triangle is recognized by a labeling method, the fourth star is introduced as a vertex to make up a tetrahedron with the triangle, and the accessorial angular distances among them can be used not only as the supplementary character to reduce redundancies, but also to verify whether the result is correct. The proposed algorithm takes the angular distance as the main identification character and relative magnitude information as the assistant character, so that the capacity of guide star database decreases to 0.4 Mb. During star-pair matching, the hashing search is used to construct the function for identification characters to reduce travelling times and time consumption for the guide star database and to speed up the identification process, and the average identification time is 0.43 ms.

For this reason, according to the operating characteristics of DC generator, the authors propose a wind power generation scheme in which DC generator is utilized. In the proposed, the genetic algorithm (GA) based optimal excitation control technology is applied to the excitation of DC generator, thus the stable output voltage of DC generator is implemented. The feasibility of utilizing DC wind power generation system as well as its features are analyzed theoretically, and the performance of stabilizing the output voltage of DC wind generator by GA based optimal excitation control is emphatically researched. By use of Matlab software the proposed wind power generation scheme is simulated; besides, taking DC motor as prime mover and by means of adjusting its rotation speed to analog the rotation speed variation of wind turbine caused by wind speed variation, a lot of experiments are performed in power system dynamic simulation laboratory. The correctness and feasibility of the proposed scheme are validated by the comparison of numerical simulation results with the obtained experimental data.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["298"]}

Methods The hepatocarcinoma animal models were established by the ultrasonography-guided implantation of VX2 tumor tissue suspension into the left-middle lobe of liver of rabbits. Two weeks later, the established hepotocarcinoma animal modal and the control group animal were subjected to 60 minutes clamp of the left-middle lobe artery branch followed by reperfusion at 0 min, 1 h, 1 d, 3 d and 7 d respectively. Apoptotic changes in the hepatocarcinoma and normal hepatic tissues were observed by means of HE staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL). Results The result of HE staining indicated that the number of apoptotic cells in hepatocarcinoma and normal liver tissues increased to the highest point 1 d following reperfusion (23%, 10%), but even though the positive cell count decreased to a certain extent until 7 d after reperfusion, it was still more obvious than that before the reperfusion. The positive apoptosis ratio of hepatocarcinoma tissue retained a higher level than that of normal liver tissues at all time points. The result of TUNEL showed that the number of the apoptotic cells in hepatocarcinoma tissues (5%) was larger than that of normal liver tissues before ischemia (1%). The apoptotic characteristics of hepatocarcinoma and normal liver tissues after reperfusion were similar to those of HE staining and their apoptotic ratio was 25%, 15% and 8%, 2% after reperfusion for 1 d and 7 d respectively.

The exfoliated cytology of pleural effusion was positive in 19 of 34 malignant cases (55.88%). By combining two methods, the diagnostic sensitivity was enhanced, from 55.88%(19/34) to 79.41%(27/34), whose positive rate was higher than only determination of p16 exon2 homozygous deletion or exfoliated cytology in malignant pleural effusions (p< 0.001, p< 0.05 respectively).Conclusion Our data suggested that combining the examination of exfoliated cytology and homozygous deletion of p16 gene exon2 in pleural effusion can recruit and enhance the diagnostic value of pleural effusion cytology. The detection of the homozygous deletion of the p16 gene in pleural effusion may be a useful adjunct to the cytological and histological examinations of pleural effusion.

{"title": "Echocardiographic features of patients with anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery\n", "abstract": " OBJECTIVE: To summarize the echocardiographic features of anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA). METHODS: A study was performed on 10 patients with ALCAPA retrospectively and the result was compared with coronary angiography to summarize its echocardiographic features. RESULTS: Of the 10 patients with ALCAPA, there were 3 cases of infantile type and 7 cases of adult type. Left ventricular cavity was enlarged and the anterior and lateral wall motion was reduced in all patients with the infantile type ALCAPA. The trunk and branch of the right coronary artery was enlarged in patients with the adult type, meanwhile the diastolic blood flow signal could be detected in inter-ventricular septum and in the area supplied by the left anterior descending coronary artery. The trunk of the left coronary artery originated from the pulmonary artery in 7 patients, the left circumflex artery originated from the pulmonary artery in another 3 patients. Diastolic blood flow signal could be detected by the Doppler echocardiogram in the pulmonary artery in all patients. One patient was misdiagnosed as coronary artery fistula, and correct diagnosis was made by the coronary angiography. In 1 patient, echocardiography examination suggested that the left coronary artery was originated from left coronary aortic sinus and angiography results showed that the left coronary artery was originated from the right posterior sinus of the pulmonary artery. Eight ALCAPA patients suffered from other cardiovascular abnormalities, including atrial septum defect, ventricular septal defect and non-compaction of ventricular myocardium\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["298"]}

{"title": "A method based on the computational fluid dynamics for solar radiation error correction of sounding temperature sensors\n", "abstract": " Air temperature of high altitude is considered as an important factor in both weather forecast and climate change research. Due to the increasing amount of attention that has been focused on disaster prevention as well as the need of dealing with climate change, it is expected that the accuracy of the measurement air temperature with high altitude can reach to 0.1\u2103. However, the errors caused by solar radiation may reach 3\u2103 or worse in upper air, which has become the bottleneck when improving the accuracy. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method is employed to study the errors induced by solar radiation, under the condition of various air pressures, lead angle, solar incident angle, from sea level to 32 km altitude. The results show that lead angle and solar incident angle are important factors that affect the errors. With the increasing of sea level elevation, the solar heating error appears a parabola correlation, which owns a growing slop.[Fund]: \u56fd\u5bb6\u516c\u76ca\u6027\u884c\u4e1a (\u6c14\u8c61) \u79d1\u7814\u4e13\u9879 (GYHY200906037, GYHY201106048);; \u56fd\u5bb6\u81ea\u7136\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u91d1\u9879\u76ee (41075026);; \u6c5f\u82cf\u9ad8\u6821\u4f18\u52bf\u5b66\u79d1\u5efa\u8bbe\u5de5\u7a0b (\u201c\u4f20\u611f\u7f51\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u6c14\u8c61\u88c5\u5907\u201d \u9879\u76ee);; \u6c5f\u82cf\u7701\u79d1\u6280\u652f\u6491\u8ba1\u5212\u91cd\u70b9\u9879\u76ee (BE2011006) \u5171\u540c\u8d44\u52a9", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["298"]}

{"title": "A review of the extent of HIV drug resistance in Vietnam\n", "abstract": " Background: In 2005, free antiretroviral therapy (ART) was rolled-out as a national program in Viet Nam. The estimated population of people living with HIV reached 254,000 in 2010 and this leads to increasing demand of ART in the near future. By 2009, ART coverage reached 53.7% for adults and adolescents, and 49.7% for children. This study aims to describe the prevalence of HIV acquired drug resistance (ADR) among people receiving ART and prevalence of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) among recently HIV-infected persons in Vietnam, and their associated ART coverage, antiretroviral treatment adherence and risk behaviors.Methods: We performed a comprehensive review of published English literature containing relevant epidemiological and behavioral indicators through internet searches.Results: Twenty-one relevant publications were included in this review. TDR prevalence among people recently infected with HIV increased from below 5% in 2006 to a higher level of 5-15% during 2007-2008 in urban Vietnam, whereas TDR prevalence among chronic antiretroviral-na\u00efve HIV-infected adults stabilized between 6-8% across the country. About half of all adults and children with clinical or immunological criteria of therapeutic failure had evidence of developing resistance to antiretroviral drugs. Non-adherence among adults on ART ranged between 25-32% and the level of viral suppression (< 1,000 copies/ml) fluctuated from 68% to more than 83% at 12 month after initiating ART. However, relevant data concerning children were mostly absent.Conclusion: Increasing trend of transmission of HIV drug resistance was observed in\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["298"]}

Specific surface area analyzer, XRD and TEM were employed to characterize the cobalt oxide product. It is revealed that the product consists of single Co3O4 phase with cubic spinel structure. The calculated specific surface area average size is 52.7 nm. The high-pressure hydrothermal synthesis mechanism of Co3O4 nanoparticles includes the following steps: partly oxidation of the hydrolysis product of cobalt ion which resulted in the hydroxo complex of Co2+ transformed into Co3+; the formation of the [Co (OH) 4] 2+ and [Co (OH) 6] 3+ coordination polyhedron growth units and finally the formation of the Co3O4 radical with short range order structure through the fasculation reaction. The surface adsorption of Ac-blocks effectively the anisotropic growth and the continuous grain growth of Co3O4 particles.[Fund]: \u56fd\u5bb6\u81ea\u7136\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u91d1\u8d44\u52a9\u9879\u76ee (50823006 50574104);; \u5de5\u4fe1\u90e8\u79d1\u6280\u91cd\u5927\u4e13\u9879\u57fa\u91d1\u8d44\u52a9\u9879\u76ee (2009ZX04012-032-02);; \u6e56\u5357\u6709\u8272\u96c6\u56e2\u2014\u4e2d\u5357\u5927\u5b66\u6709\u8272\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u91d1\u8d44\u52a9\u9879\u76ee (Y2008-01-008)", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["298"]}

The magnetic state for Fe doped samples transforms from ferromagnetic (FM) to paramagnetic (PM), and back to the FM state again with the increase of x.

Algorithms based on Taylor\u2019s expansion are developed for realizing NURBS curve interpolator that takes into account the feed rate adjustment to the curvature radius of NURBS curves. By means of the flexible acceleration/deceleration (ACC/DEC) planning, the velocity profile can be chosen dynamically to meet the requirements of the machining process. In addition, a new strategy based on the geometrical properties of NURBS curves is suggested to predict the deceleration point.

There are some oases in the Hexi Corridor, and the irrigation agriculture is developed by relying on the continental rivers rising in the Qilian Mountains. However, the growth of crops dominated by spring wheat in the regions of Gansu Province east from the Yellow River is completely relied on rainfall. In this paper, the statistical data of the total precipitation and the rainless days during growth period of spring wheat from March to July are derived based on the daily precipitation data observed by 42 meteorological stations in the regions of Gansu Province east from the Yellow River during the period of 1960--2001. Moreover, the rainless-day-precipitation drought indexes in these regions are defined based on the characteristics of their significant negative correlation, and the spatiotemporal change of the drought indexes is analyzed. The results show that there is an abnormity in the distribution of drought indexes in the regions of Gansu Province east from the Yellow River during growth period of spring wheat, and there is also a subregional distribution feature.

Methods: Expression of MMP-9 was detected in the culture fluid of mononuclear cells from 30 patients with MM and MMP-2 in the culture fluid of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) from 24 patients with MM by ELISA. Results: The level of MMP-9 in 19/30 and MMP-2 in 14/24 patients with active MM were significantly higher than both the patients with stable MM (11/30 and 10/24) and 12 normal donors (P0. 05), The levels of MMP-9 and MMP-2 in stable MM patients were not different from normal donors (P0. 05) Expression level of MMP-9 in 12 patients with the phenotype of secreting IgG was correlated to the level of M protein (r= 0.87, P= 00.05). rIL-6 and rIL-1\u03b2 did not play a role in stimulating MMP-2 secretion of BMSCs. When BMSCs from 9 patients with active MM were co-cultured with U266 cells (human MM cell lines), there was a significant increase of MMP-2 in BMSCs (P0. 05).

{"title": "Tradeoff between stretch factor and load balancing ratio in wireless network routing\n", "abstract": " A wireless multi-hop network consists of a set of nodes in the plane where two nodes can directly communicate to each other if their distance is at most 1. We consider two quality measures for routing in wireless networks. One is the stretch factor of the paths used by a routing algorithm, and the other is the load balancing ratio, which measures how evenly the traffic is distributed. In this paper, we show a trade-off between the two measures dependent on the density of the point set. When the maximum density of the point set is \u03c1, the optimal algorithm by using only paths with stretch factor no more than c generates the maximum load on the nodes at most O (min (\u221a \u03c1n/c, n/c)) times that of the optimal algorithm without path length restriction. In particular, when the density is bounded by a constant, the shortest path routing has an approximation ratio of O (\u221a n) compared to the optimal algorithm. This bound is tight in the worst case. The result can be extended to k-dimensional unit-ball graphs and graphs with \u201cgrowth rate\u201d k. We also present a tradeoff when considering the average density \u03c1. We show a bound of O (\u221a \u03c1nlog n) and \u2126 (\u221a \u03c1n/log c) for this case.

The oxidation kinetics of the three alloys follows parabolic law initially, then follows linear law. The oxide scale formed on all three alloys consists mainly of Co dissolved Fe3O4 and partly of FeO and Fe2O3 in which Fe3O4 acts as a protective layer. An yttrium addition into the Fe-Co-Ni based superalloys improves their oxidation resistance by reducing the micro-defects in the scales. Thus, the weight gains of the alloys during the oxidation are reduced, and the transition of parabolic law to linear law is postponed. Pegging was observed on the cross section of alloy with 0.08 wt pet yttrium addition after the oxidation.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["298"]}

METHODS: Eighty-five infertile women were evaluated by serial transvaginal B-ultrasound scans for follicular development and ovulation and by laparoscopic examinations 2 to 6 days after ovulation. RESULTS: The patterns of follicular development and ovulation detected by B-ultrasound were:(1) ovulation from normal follicle (ONF)(56.47%);(2) ovulation from two follicles at the same time (O2F)(5.88%);(3) ovulation from small follicle (OSF)(16.47%);(4) ovulation from polycystic ovaries (PCO)(3.53%);(5) luteinized unruptured follicle syndrome (LUFS)(7.06%);(6) anovulation (10.90%). Laparoscopic examinations showed that the incidence of partial and complete tubal obstruction was 32.94% and pelvic adhesions 35.29%. Pelvic tuberculosis was found in 20.00%, which was the main disease leading to pelvic adhesions (46.67%), and tubal obstruction (60.71%).

By enhancement, a clearer image with higher resolution is produced. So far, the enhancement technique is widely applied in various photogrammetric images. However, because of the restriction of the CCD sensor itself, the number of pixels on the sensor isn\u2019t much enough in some case. The image quality is affected and restricted. To solve this problem, the enhancement techniques are expended mainly in two categories: One is hardware solution; the other is software solution. In this paper, we propose a software algorithm for the enhancement of the image resolution considering inaccurate sub-pixel matching. In the proposed algorithm, the shifts, the gray values of the low-resolution images and the enhancement ratio are used to calculate the gray values of the higher-resolution image iteratively. Thus, the new image has higher resolution, so that it has higher definition. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm has more universal applications.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["298"]}

{"title": "The distribution of MAP kinase phosphatase-1 in the cerebrospinal fluid-contacting nucleus and its functional contribution to depressive behaviors\n", "abstract": " The purpose of this research is to explore the distribution and expression of MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-contacting nucleus in depression, and provide experimental evidence to reveal the biological function and regulatory mechanisms of CSF-contacting nucleus in depression. Depression model was produced by chronic forced swimming stress (CFSS) in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Intracerebroventricular injection of cholera toxin subunit B (CTb) labeled with horseradish peroxidase (CB-HRP) was used to specifically mark distal CSF-contacting nucleus. The rate of animal growth and behavioral tests including sucrose preference test (SPT) and open field test (OFT) were used to validate the model of depression. The expressions of MKP-1 and fos proteins in CSF-contacting nucleus were detected by immunofluorescence. Software Image-Pro Plus version 6.0 was used to count the positive neurons. The results showed that, the distributions of MKP-1 were found in the CSF-contacting nucleus. After 28 days of swimming, the rats in stress group had a lower growth rate, a less consumption of sucrose and lower scores of OFT compared to control group. The number of neurons double labeled with CB-HRP/fos or CB-HRP/MKP-1 in stress group was significantly higher than that in control group (P< 0.01). These results suggest that the CSF-contacting nucleus may be involved in the process of depression via the MKP-1.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["298"]}

The dependence of the adsorption efficiency on several parameters, including initial ions' concentration, temperature, contact time and pH, has been investigated with batch experiments. The adsorption kinetics data of nickel and phosphorus could be well depicted by a pseudo-second-order model. Adsorption isotherms studies showed that the uptake of nickel and phosphorus on CLDHs followed Langmuir and Freundlich models, respectively, and that the maximum removal of nickel or phosphorus was up to 22.87 or 761.5 mg g\u22121. Thermodynamic analyses implied that the adsorption process of nickel or phosphorus on CLDHs was spontaneous and endothermic.

METHODS: DSCT and conventional angiography of thorax were performed in 66 patients with hemoptysis. There were 46 males and 20 females with a mean age of 45 (22-72) years. Findings on DSCT, including CT scans, maximal intensity projections and three-dimensional volume-rendered images were used to evaluate the visibility and traceability of bronchial and/or nonbronchial systemic arteries. CT scans were evaluated by two radiologists in consensus. The CT findings were compared with those of conventional angiography. RESULTS: A total of 171 (87 right, 84 left) bronchial arteries and 18 nonbronchial systemic arteries were visible on DSCT. The right bronchial arteries arose from intercostal-bronchial trunk thoracic aorta (n= 46), common trunk of both bronchial arteries (CBT)(n= 32) and thoracic aorta (n= 9) whereas left bronchial arteries arose from thoracic aorta (n= 50), CBT (n= 32) and left subclavian artery (n= 2). Compared with angiography, the accuracy of DSCT in the diagnosis of hemoptysis responsible vessels (ie dilatation BA) was approximately 88.7%(133/150). DSCT correctly diagnosed 18 nonbronchial systemic arteries, but missed 7; DSCT correctly diagnosed 5 bronchial-pulmonary vascular fistulas, but missed 15. CONCLUSION: Excellent for evaluating hemoptysis, DSCT may identify the origin and ostial position of bronchial arteries, detect non-bronchial systemic arteries and act as a roadmap for\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["298"]}

METHODS: One hundred and twenty-eight adult patients, who received liver transplantation in our hospital between January 2009 and June 2012 and met the inclusive criteria, were enrolled in the study. The clinical data were retrospectively analyzed, including pre-LT spleen volume, main portal vein size, coronary vein size, platelet and white blood cell levels, total bilirubin level and model of end stage liver disease score. The risk factors associated with persistent thrombocytopenia after LT were evaluated by logistic regression analysis. The effect of simultaneous splenic artery coarctation for high risk patients was evaluated with \u03c72 test. RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis showed that per-LT spleen volume larger than 500 ml (P= 0.012, OR= 2.789, 95% CI: 1.249-6.227) and portal vein size beyond 15 mm (P= 0.017, OR= 3.124, 95% CI: 1.230-7.933) were independent risk factors for persistent thrombocytopenia after LT.

It is shown that: compared with no considering the pressure drop along the wellbore, the water breakthrough time brings forward, and the fluid flowing into the horizontal well wellbore from reservoir increases gradually from the tip end to the heeling end of the horizontal wellbore. The increase of oil well production makes bottom water breakthrough earlier. The significant error would be produced in the prediction of bottom water breakthrough time without considering the pressure drop in wellbore when the output of horizontal well exceeds 20 m 3/d, and the greater the output is, the greater the prediction error is. The water breakthrough time would delay with the increase of the horizontal wellbore length. When the horizontal wellbore length is less than 400 m, the influence of the pressure drop in wellbore on the water breakthrough time can be ignored. When the horizontal wellbore length is more than 400 m, the influence becomes obvious. The delaying rate of the water breakthrough time is reducing with the increase of wellbore length. The water breakthrough time will not change with the increase of the wellbore length when the wellbore length is over 2 000 m.

Due to their graph partition schemes, existing edge anonymization methods have several drawbacks, such as high utility loss and high computational overhead. In this paper, we present a new edge anonymization method, which partitions a graph using a new vertex equivalence relation called the neighbor-set equivalence. We show that whenever the resulting graph partition satisfies a graph confidence requirement, as the privacy measure, so does the graph partition based on automorphism. Our algorithm maintains the graph partition explicitly as a partition map and performs edge addition/removal in groups as merges of vertex classes on the partition map. To improve performance, our algorithm constructs a plan heuristically for a sequence of vertex class merges and executes the plan using a number of strategies. It checks for graph confidence only after the execution of the entire merge plan. We evaluate our method through extensive experiments using two real-world large social graphs and several graph utility measures. Our results show that the techniques used by our method effectively improve graph utility and reduce computational overhead.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["298"]}

After rough machining and semi-finish machining, the thin-walled titanium was heat treated with high temperature to eliminate the stress, that could make better condition for the next procedure. Repeating low temperature heat treatment after finishing could stabilize the dimensional tolerance. Moreover, using the vacuum heat treatment to deal with the titanium thin-walled tube after it's semi-finishing would avoid the surface scale. It had been found that using this processing skill could eliminate the transformation of workpieces, stabilize the size and improve the eligibility of yield tube to above 96%, which achieved the target of guaranteeing the accurate size of workpieces and the tolerance of its form and position.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["298"]}

The different electrochemical behaviors of the homopolymerization of AN and OMA and the coexistence of AN and OMA in 1.0 mol/L HCl at platinum electrode indicated the occurrence of copolymerization between AN and OMA. In situ UV-Vis spectroelectrochemical study on the copolymerization of AN and OMA with different concentration ratios was carried out using indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass electrode as working electrode at 0.9 V in 1.0 mol/L HCl. The results indicated that, during the copolymerization of AN and OMA, AN and OMA were firstly oxidized to generate the corresponding cation radicals, then a mixed dimer intermediate was formed through the cross-reaction between the cation radicals of AN and OMA and the monomers of AN and OMA. A new absorption peak at 440 nm in the UV-Vis spectra was assigned to that of the intermediate. Further studies showed that the copolymerization of AN and OMA was controlled by the concentration ratios of AN and OMA in solution, ie the increase of OMA concentration would suppressed the copolymerization of AN and OMA. The formation of OMA-AN copolymer was also proved by FT-IR spectroscopy. A prelimiary copolymerization mechanism was proposed. The results showed that the OMA units were doped into the AN backbone during the copolymerization of AN and OMA.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["298"]}

Low-level light therapy (LLLT) is being evaluated for treating RA. However, the molecular basis mechanism underlying the effectiveness of linear polarized near infrared light irradiation (LPIL) is unclear. It has been reported that interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) plays a key role in the progression of RA.Aim: The objective of this study was to determine whether LPIL (Super Lizer\u2122; SL) decrease gene expression and production IL-1\u03b2 in human RA synovial cells, MH7A, and RA joint tissue of collagen-induced-rheumatoid arthritis (CIA) rats.Materials and Methods: IL-1\u03b2 challenged MH7A and CIA rat joints were irradiated with SL. Total RNA was isolated from MH7A, and gene expression profiles were analyzed using DNA microarray. The mRNA levels were confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time PCR. The production of IL-1\u03b2 in rat knee joints was analyzed by immunohistochemistry.Results: DNA microarray analysis showed that IL-1\u03b2 increased IL-1\u03b2 gene expression in MH7A, and SL significantly reduced its IL-1\u03b2 mRNA level. The reduction of IL-1\u03b2 mRNA level by SL was successfully confirmed by reverse RT-PCR and real-time PCR. SL reduced the swelling of CIA rat knee joints, and the immunohistochemical study demonstrated that a strong IL-1\u03b2 staining in synovial membrane tissue of CIA rat joint, and the immuno-staining was significantly reduced by SL.Conclusion: Since autocrine IL-1\u03b2 production has been identified to be an important proinflammatory cytokine in the pathogenesis of RA\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["298"]}

{"title": "An emotion-based image retrieval system by using fuzzy integral with relevance feedback\n", "abstract": " The emotional information processing is to simulate and recognize human sensibility, sensuality or emotion, to realize natural and harmonious human-machine interface. This paper proposes an emotion-based image retrieval method. In this method, user can choose a linguistic query among some emotional adjectives. Then the system shows some corresponding representative images that are pre-evaluated by experts. Again the user can select a representative one among the representative images to initiate traditional content-based image retrieval (CBIR). By this proposed method any CBIR can be easily expanded as emotion-based image retrieval. In CBIR of our system, we use several color and texture visual descriptors recommended by MPEG-7. We also propose a fuzzy similarity measure based on Choquet integral in the CBIR system. For the communication between system and user, a relevance feedback mechanism is used to represent human subjectivity in image retrieval. This can improve the performance of image retrieval, and also satisfy the user's individual preference.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["298"]}

Morphological changes of lymphoid organs (thymus and spleen) throughout the year may relate to annual variations of circulating steroid hormones. Androgen is a kind of steroid hormones and may have direct effects on immune system via androgen receptors. Therefore, to study whether androgen receptor mRNA exists in spleen of reptile and its cellular localization is very important. In this study, Paraffin sections of spleen in five healthy Pelodiseus Sinensis were made. In situ hybridization (ISH) was conducted on the tissue sections by oligonucleotide probe marked by cardiox. The expressions and localization of androgen receptor mRNA were detected in the cells of spleen tissue. The results of in situ hybridization indicate that the AR positive cell distributing in the periaterial lymphatic sheath (PALS) and red pulp were more than those in the periellipsoidal lymphatic sheath (PELS). The results of this study demonstrate that AR mRNA exists in immune cells of spleen. Most AR mRNA positive cells are round or oval-shap in shape, the others are larger and more irregular. The signals distributed in cytoplasm and nuclei of all positive cells. The results suggest that the round or oval-shap cells might be B lymphocytes, the others might be macrophages. The presence of androgen receptor mRNA in the spleen would provide further evidence that androgen might be one of the factors which influence function of spleen and other immune organs.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["298"]}

{"title": "Large-scale simulations using first and second order adjoints with applications in data assimilation\n", "abstract": " In large-scale air quality simulations we are interested in the influence factors which cause changes of pollutants, and  optimization methods which improve forecasts. The solutions to these problems can be achieved by incorporating adjoint models, which are efficient in computing the derivatives of a functional with respect to a large number of model parameters. In this research we employ first order adjoints in air quality simulations. Moreover, we explore theoretically the computation of second order adjoints for chemical transport models, and illustrate their feasibility in several aspects.   We apply first order adjoints to sensitivity analysis and data assimilation.  Through sensitivity analysis, we can discover the area that has the largest influence on changes of ozone concentrations at a receptor. For data assimilation with optimization methods which use first order adjoints, we assess their performance under different scenarios. The results indicate that the L-BFGS method is the most efficient.    Compared with first order adjoints, second order adjoints have not been used to date in air quality simulation. To explore their utility, we show the construction of second order adjoints for chemical transport models and demonstrate several applications including sensitivity analysis, optimization, uncertainty quantification, and Hessian singular vectors. Since second order adjoints provide second order information in the form of Hessian-vector product instead of the entire Hessian matrix, it is possible to implement applications for large-scale models which require second order derivatives.

In the horizontal direction, the whole sloping land was divided into four slope segments of the top, upper, lower and bottom, each of which has three samplings taken. In vertical direction, three depths at each sampling point were determined, ie, 5, 10 and 15 cm. Totally, 36 samples were taken. The contents of N, P and K for each sample were measured, and 108 data were obtained for analysis. According to the measurements and systematic analysis, some conclusions have been gained. The absolute contents of N, P and K are the highest and the change in spatial distribution is the most obvious at the depth of 5 cm on sloping land. However, the most obvious change is observed at the depth of 10 cm on sloping land with bamboo forest. The change in the spatial distribution of the contents of N, P and K is very distinct. From the top of sloping lands to the bottom, the contents of N, P and K show a decreasing trend, and the intensity of decreasing trend is the greatest on sloping land.

So, two kinds of Maize Plummule extracts effectively protected the mRNA expression of type \u2160 procollagen and type \u2162 procollagen from the short-time oxidative damage by H2O2 in mouse dermal fibroblasts culture. The 0501 extracts had a better protection for the mRNA expression of type \u2160 procollagen and type \u2162 procollagen in mouse dermal fibroblast than that of the 0502 extracts.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["298"]}

The calculations revealed eight possible reaction pathways for acrylonitrile with the surface dimer. Full geometry optimized structures were obtained for all adducts, including intra- and interdimer reaction products. These results were analyzed in terms of both the total energy values and the detailed optimized geometries. We find that the reaction of acrylonitrile with the diamond (001) surface occurs primarily through its nonpolar CC group and the intradimer [2+2]cc product is the dominant product. All these results are in good agreement with the experimental work by Schwartz. It is noteworthy that the isomerization process plays an important role in the chemisorption process. Both intradimer [4+2] product and interdimer [2+2]cc product can isomerize to the intradimer [2+2]cc\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["298"]}

In this study, advanced thermo-analytical techniques, including thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), temperature-modulated differential scanning calorimetry (TMDSC), and thermal mechanical analysis (TMA) were applied to 13 organic samples (3 woods, 2 humic acids, 3 kerogens, and 5 black carbons) with different diagenetic and anthropogenic histories. Glass transition temperatures (Tg), marking the transition of a material from glassy state to rubbery state, were identified in most samples. Other thermodynamic properties (ie, heat capacity change, \u0394CP, thermal expansion coefficient, a) associated with glass transitions were characterized. It was also found that carbonaceous SOM (eg, kerogens, black carbons), in general, display higher Tg than humic-based SOM (eg, humic acids, fulvic acids) due to higher aromatic character, leading to different SOM macromolecular mobility and sorption/desorption behaviors. Failure to observe Tg in some carbonaceous samples (eg, select soots) does not imply nonexistence of glass transition behavior in these materials. Instead, these samples may possess transition temperatures beyond our experimental temperature-scanning range and thus require additional research.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["298"]}

Its imaging features in NHL of early stage were similar with those of squamous epithelial cancer, which often leads to misdiagnosis. This study was to discuss imaging features of Waldeyer's ring in NHL, and its clinical significance. METHODS: CT and MRI performances of 149 patients with pathologically diagnosed Waldeyer's ring-NHL were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Among 149 cases of Waldeyer's ring-NHL, 98 (65.8%) were B-cell origin, and 51 (34.2%) were T-cell or NK/T-cell origin; tonsil was the most vulnerable site followed by nasopharyngeal tonsil and other positions. CT and MRI showed that 81 were focal nodules or masses (commonly in B-cell NHL), 36 were diffuse infiltrating growth (commonly in NK/T-cell NHL), 7 were pure ulcer, and 25 were mixed type. The lesions of focal masses are characterized with even CT density and MRI signals. The lesions usually localized in pharynx-mucosa clearance, but rarely in deep space, such as parapharyngeal space, and in skull-base. Among 78 cases with involved cervical lymph nodes, 64 were B-cell origin, and 14 were NK/T-cell origin (P< 0.05).

Potentiation of effectiveness and reduction of toxicity for some anti-cancer agents through continuous intravenous infusion were shown in some pre-clinical and clinical studies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of EPOCH regimen. METHODS: A prospective phase II study of EPOCH regimen (doxorubicin/epirubicin, vincristine, etoposide over 96 hours infusion with bolus cyclophosphamade and oral prednisone) was administered to 26 patients with relapsed or refractory/resistant aggressive NHL. There were 20 patients (84.7%) among them treated by over 2 kinds of chemotherapy regimen with median regimen types of 2 (range, 1-6 types) and median chemotherapy cycles of 8 (range, 3-16 cycles) given for all patients. Fifteen patients (65.7%) were chemo-resistant recurrence. RESULTS: All the 26 patients were assessable. The response rate for the whole group was 50.0% with complete remission (CR) rate of 19.2%. Among the 7 patients with T-cell lymphoma and the 19 patients with B-cell lymphoma, the response rates were 28.6% and 57.9%, respectively.

The reaction rate showed first order dependence in oxidant, and positive fractional order dependence in ethyl alcohol. It was found that the pseudo first order ([C2H5OH] much greater than [Ni(IV)]) rate constant k(obs) increases with the increase of [OH-] and decreases with the increases of [IO4-]. A weak negative ionic strength effect was observed. Under the protection of nitrogen the reaction system does not induce polymerization of acrylamide indicating that an innersphere one-step two-election transfer is involved in the oxidation. A reasonable mechanism involving a preequilibrium of an adduct formation between Ni OM and ethyl alcohol has been proposed.

Single-phase samples are obtained in the range 0\u2a7dx\u2a7d0.25 by the soft chemical synthesis route. The substitution of Sc3+ at the Mn site results in reductions in the Curie temperature Tc and in the magnetic moment per Mn ion. The Tc transition temperature becomes broader with x, and the magnetic spontaneous state has changed into a cluster glass state for the sample of x=0.1. In addition, great enhancement in resistance and magnetoresistance effect is observed in the Sc-doped samples. In our case the notable doping effects can be mainly ascribed to the variation in the Mn3+\u2013O2\u2212\u2013Mn4+ network and to the magnetic disorder caused by the presence of the large and nonmagnetic Sc3+ ions in the Mn sublattice.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["298"]}

Cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) assay was used to assess the survival rate after PDT treatment. Laser confocal microscopy was used to observe the location of photo-sensitizer protoporphyrin and fluorescence spectrophotometer for detecting the fluorescent intensity of intracellular protoporphyrin. The protein levels of rate-limiting enzyme of protoporphyrin synthesis, ferrochelatase (FECH) and hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS) were determined by Western blot. RESULTS: Both cell lines were killed after 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)-PDT and its efficacy was dependent on 5-ALA concentration, incubation duration and light dose. The cell survival rates of 4.1 R (-/-) MEF were significantly higher than those of 4.1 R (+/+) MEF (46.9%\u00b17.1% vs 12.5%\u00b12.1%, P< 0.001) after PDT treatment with a light dose of 120 mJ/cm (2) mediated by 5-ALA 1.00 mmol/L.

The combined toxic effects of 1-NP and 1, 2-naphthoquinone (1, 2-NQ) on A549 were also evaluated. 1-NP caused a significantly concentration-dependent and time-dependent viability decrease. The LC50 for 24 h and 48 h were 5.2 \u03bcmol x L (-1) and 2.8 \u03bcmol x L (-1), respectively. DNA damage and intracellular ROS levels were also increased significantly through a dose-dependent manner after exposure to 1-NP. The LDH leakage were not significantly changed. Compared with the groups treated with 1-NP alone, the viability and LDH leakage was not changed significantly in combined-treated groups with 1-NP and 1, 2-NQ. However, the DNA damage and ROS levels were significantly reduced in the combined-treated groups compared with the groups treated with 1-NP alone. These results suggest that 1-NP may mediated the genotoxic and cytotoxic effects through ROS generation, and pretreatment with 1, 2-NQ, may inhibit the ROS generation induced by 1-NP, and thereby reducing the DNA damage in A549 cells.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["298"]}

{"title": "MvaT and MvaV transcriptionally regulate PcoI/PcoR quorum-sensing system in Pseudomonas fluorescens 2P24\n", "abstract": " OBJECTIVE: Pseudomonas fluorescens 2P24 is an effective biocontrol agent for soil-borne plant diseases caused by microbial pathogens. The PcoI/PcoR quorum-sensing system, which influences the colonization ability of 2P24 on wheat rhizosphere, is an important factor for disease suppression. In this study we performed random mutagenesis to screen novel regulators of the pcoI gene, a biosynthase gene responsible for N-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) production. METHODS: A gacA gene mutant carrying a pcoI-lacZ fusion was employed as the reporter strain and subjected to a random mini-Tn5 insertion mutagenesis. Expression of pcol kept at a low level under the gacA (-) negative background. The Tn5-mutants with increased pcoI transcription were selected. RESULTS: Two mutants with significantly increased pcoI expression were identified from approximately 10000 Tn5-inserted colonies. The interrupted locus in the mutants was identified as the mvaT gene, a global regulator belonging to the H-NS family. A homolog of the mvaT gene, named mvaV, was also found in the genome draft sequence of 2P24. Genetic inactivation of mvaT or mvaV gene resulted in increased transcription of pcoI and the production of AHL molecules. Further qutitification by HPLC showed that the 2, 4-diacetylphloroglucinol (2, 4-DAPG) levels in culture supernatant of the mvaT and mvaV mutants were significantly lower than that of the wild type strain. Furthermore, the mvaT or mvaV mutation drastically improved biofilm formation in 2P24.

In this paper a beam-and-column (BAC) macro model for walls is proposed to simulate the masonry infill walls in RC frames. In this model, the masonry panel is replaced by an equivalent rigid frame which is made up of some beam-and-column members. The geometric parameters of each member can be determined simply by equivalent stiffness combined with\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["298"]}

METHODS Total salvianolic acid extract (TSAE) was first prepared and then salvianolic B (SalB) was purified from TSAE. Seven salvianolic acids (SA) samples whose material foundations were significantly different were prepared by hydrolyzing TSAE under different conditions. Anti-hemolysis of mouse's red cell caused by auto-oxidation (model I) and mouse's liver homogenate lipid peroxidation (model II) were used to study antioxidant activity of nine SA samples. A partial least square (PLS) multivariate regression model was constructed to show the correlation between the antioxidant activity of the SA samples from the HPLC fingerprints and peaks possibly responsible for this activity. RESULTS Nine salvianolic acid samples could inhibit hemolysis of mouse's red cell caused by auto-oxidation or liver homogenate lipid peroxidation. The activity of high purity SalB was weaker in both models above than that of other SA samples involving some small molecule salvianolic acids. In the six known SA substances, SalB, caffeic acid and protocatechuic acid had positive contribution to the antioxidant activity while ferulic acid had negative effect in both models.

{"title": "Reducing impacts of systematic errors in the observation data on inversing ecosystem model parameters using different normalization methods\n", "abstract": " Modeling ecosystem carbon cycle on the regional and global scales is crucial to the prediction of future global atmospheric CO2 concentration and thus global temperature which features large uncertainties due mainly to the limitations in our knowledge and in the climate and ecosystem models. There is a growing body of research on parameter estimation against available carbon measurements to reduce model prediction uncertainty at regional and global scales. However, the systematic errors with the observation data have rarely been investigated in the optimization procedures in previous studies. In this study, we examined the feasibility of reducing the impact of systematic errors on parameter estimation using normalization methods, and evaluated the effectiveness of three normalization methods (i.e. maximum normalization, min-max normalization, and z-score normalization) on inversing key parameters, for example the maximum carboxylation rate (Vcmax,25) at a reference temperature of 25\u00b0C, in a process-based ecosystem model for deciduous needle-leaf forests in northern China constrained by the leaf area index (LAI) data. The LAI data used for parameter estimation were composed of the model output LAI (truth) and various designated systematic errors and random errors. We found that the estimation of Vcmax,25 could be severely biased with the composite LAI if no normalization was taken. Compared with the maximum normalization and the min-max normalization methods, the z-score normalization method was the most robust in reducing the impact of systematic errors on parameter estimation.

{"title": "Impact of mineral dust on nitrate, sulfate, and ozone in transpacific Asian pollution plumes.\n", "abstract": " We use a 3-d global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) to interpret aircraft observations of nitrate and sulfate partitioning in transpacific dust plumes during the INTEXB campaign of April\u2013May 2006. The model includes explicit transport of size-resolved mineral dust and its alkalinity, nitrate, and sulfate content. The observations show 5 that particulate nitrate is primarily associated with dust, sulfate is primarily associated with ammonium, and Asian dust remains alkaline across the Pacific. This can be reproduced in the model by using a reactive uptake coefficient for HNO3 on dust (\u03b3 (HNO3)\u223c 10\u2212 3) much lower than commonly assumed in models and likely reflecting limitation of uptake by dust dissolution. The model overestimates gas-phase HNO3 by 10 a factor of 2\u20133, typical of previous model studies; we show that this cannot be corrected by uptake on dust. We find that the fraction of aerosol nitrate on dust in the model increases from\u223c 30% in fresh Asian outflow to 80\u201390% over the Northeast Pacific, reflecting in part the volatilization of ammonium nitrate and the resulting transfer of nitrate to the dust. Consumption of dust alkalinity by uptake of acid gases in the model 15 is slow relative to the lifetime of dust against deposition, so that dust in general does not acidify. This argues against the hypothesis that dust iron released by acidification could become bio-available upon dust deposition. Observations in INTEX-B show no detectable ozone depletion in Asian dust plumes, consistent with the model. Uptake of HNO3 by dust, suppressing its recycling to NOx, reduces Asian pollution influence on 20 US surface ozone in the model by 10\u201315\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["298"]}

The forgoing research gave the simulation results of single blowing during stretching, and did not pay attention to the influence of the deformation, resulting from the previous blowing, upon the next blowing. ANSYS software is adopted to simulate the through-continuous blowing of HVA and FA forging methods. The transversal stress distribution along the horizontal central axis on the crosssection of the stretched forging is analyzed. The simulation results show that during the stretching with flat anvils, when the ratio of the flat anvil width to the billet height is 1.0 and the ratio of the billet width to the billet height is 0.5, the transversal stress is tensile all the time, and increases as the stretching goes. On the contrary, during the HVA stretching, the stress is compressive and its absolute value increases gradually\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["298"]}

METHODS: According to the anatomy and recipient area, we made some modifications for the two neurovascular flaps. 1) The small and great saphenous venous were ligated or anastomosed with the venous in recipient area; 2) The flap was delayed for 8-14 days if the donor area was above the middle and upper one third of leg; 3) The sural nerve and its branch were anastomosed to the nerve in recipient site to restore the sense of flap; 4) the lower turning point could be designed just 3 cm above the point of internal and external malleolus; 5) Partial gastrocnemius or soleus muscle could be included in the flap if needed; 6) Reversed cross leg flap was considered if the adjacent flap in the affected side could not be used. Sometimes, we adopted more than one modification in one patients. RESULTS: From Sep, 1994 to Apr, 2007, 63 cases were treated, including 51 cases of sural and 12 cases of saphenous neurovascular flaps. Partial necrosis (about 1-2 cm width) happened in the distal end of flaps in 2 cases which healed after dress changing. The patients were followed up for 3 months to 2 years with satisfied functional and cosmetic results. CONCLUSIONS: These two modified flaps have reliable blood supply and survival rate.

Multiple air quality monitoring networks were integrated by performing intercomparison of individual calibration standards and measurement techniques to ensure comparability of ambient measurements, along with providing consistently high time-resolution measurements of O3 and CO at the surface sites in East Asia. Ambient data collected from eight surface stations were compared with simulation results obtained by a regional chemical transport model to infer recent changes in CO emissions from East Asia. Our inverse estimates of the CO emissions from China up to 2005 suggested an increase of 16% since 2001, in good agreement with the recent MOPITT satellite observations and the bottom-up estimates up to 2006. The O3 enhancement relative to CO in continental pollution plumes traversed in the boundary layer were examined as a function of transport time from the Asian continent to the western Pacific Ocean. Comparison of the observed ?O3/? CO ratios and their modeled spatial distributions suggests an increase in the ? O3/? CO ratio due likely to en-route photochemical O3 formation during eastward transport, confirming that East Asia is an important O3 source region during spring.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["298"]}

The results showed that functional alpha (1A-) and alpha (1B-) adrenoceptors (AR) were expressed in human SMG, and might contribute to the regulation of saliva synthesis and secretion. Both beta (1)-and beta (2)-AR were expressed in rabbit SMG. beta (1)-AR was the predominant subtype and might play an important role in regulating saliva and alpha-amylase secretion. Vanilloid receptor1 (VR1) mRNA and protein were detected in rabbit SMG. Capsaicin could induce a significant increase in secretion of rabbit SMG via activitation of VR1. On the rabbit model of microvascular transfer of SMG, phenylephrine (10 (-7) mol/L) was infused into SMG through the Wharton's duct. The secretion of transferred SMG was significantly increased without significant changes of cardiovascular function. The effective mechanism of phenylephrine might involve the increased expression of alpha1-AR, translocation of AQP (5) from cytoplasm to apical membrane, activation of signal molecules related to cell proliferation, and moderate the atrophy of the gland.

Therefore, the concept of entropy was introduced into the optimization to avoid the loss of information in decision-making. A method of real weight coefficient was put forward which combines project inherent information and decision-maker's subjective sense together. In this method, subjective weight factors in project is determined through hierarchic analysis process while external weight factors through information entropy. Both two factors are then combined to optimize the selection of alternative projects. This model was applied to 13 alternative long-distance natural gas pipeline design proposals in which 9 factors were measured off according to 5 technologic indexes and 4 economic indexes. It's proved to be practical and effective because of the coherence of results using this model and others.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["298"]}

Methods The histological features and immunohistochemical characteristics were investigated by light microscopy in 3 cases of ETCC and the related literature was reviewed. Results The three patients presented with postmenopausal abnormal bleeding. Macroscopically, the tumors were polypoid and invaded the inner one-half of the myometrium. Microscopically, the tumor was composed of papillary structures with slender fibrovascular cores and covered by multilayered atypical epithelial cells. The tumor cells adjacent to the fibrovascular cores were surrounded by a layer of palisaded cells. The cells coverng the surface of the papillary had a tendency to be flat. Grandular differentiation was restricted to a few small areas of multilayered epithelial cells. The tumor showed a solid papillary component which had central necrosis. The tumor cells had relatively uniform round, oval nuclei with prominent nuclear membrane and vesicular chromatin. Nuclear grooves were not observed. Nuclea atypia was moderate and mitotic activity was 15 to 20 per 10 high-power fields. The nests of poorly differentiated transitional epithelium invaded the myometrium.

However, current methods are time-consuming, subject to interference from DON, and not reliable at low concentrations. Our new method for determining the \u03b415N of ammonium overcomes these difficulties by employing the oxidation of ammonium to nitrite followed by conversion of nitrite to nitrous oxide. In the first step, ammonium is quantitatively oxidized by hypobromite at pH~ 12. After the addition of sodium arsenite to consume excess hypobromite, yield is verified by colorimetric NO2-measurement using sulfanilamide and naphthyl ethylenediamine (NED). Nitrite is further reduced to N2O by a 1: 1 sodium azide and acetic acid buffer solution using previously established procedures.

{"title": "Generalized limit equilibrium method for slope stability analysis\n", "abstract": " The basic equations of generalized limit equilibrium method (GLE) are introduced, in which the difference from the classical methods is that the value and direction of interslice force are regarded as unknowns. The Rapid Solver is adopted to solve equations. Through defined function of interslice force angles, GLE can emulate rigorous methods such as Spencer and Morgenstern-Price methods, as well as other simplified methods satisfying force equilibrium, such as the unbalance thrust force method, Corps of Engineers, and Lowe-Karafiath method and etc.. The results show that GLE is a practical method with high precision and has the advantages of simple formulation to program easily.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["298"]}

X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) analysis the value states of Ag and Cu in the implanted composite sample, the results show that Ag and Cu exist in the form of metal state. The optical absorption spectra indicates there is only a single surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak at 442 nm before annealing, which shows the Ag-Cu binary alloy nanoclusters have been formed. After annealing for 1 hour at different temperature from 300\u2103 to 800\u2103 with intervals of 100\u2103, the SPR peaks show a blue shift and two peaks appear when the annealing temperature reaches 500\u2103 which attributes to the decomposion of alloy nanoclusters and formation of Ag and Cu nanoclusters. Applying the free electron model of metal particles, we calculate average sizes of nanoparticles in the different annealing temperatures, the results show that the sizes of nanoparticles increase gradually with increasing temperature. When the temperature is higher than 600\u2103 for Cu and 700\u2103 for Ag, the size becomes smaller, because at high temperatures Ag and Cu migrates to the sample surface and disappears from the surface.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["298"]}

Evans blue dye was used as a tracer for plasma leakage. Intradermal injections of chemical stimuli, histamine (10 micrograms), capsaicin (10 micrograms) and formalin (0.5 mg), evoked Evans blue dye extravasation in rat skin. Intraperitoneal ONO-1078 dose-dependently inhibited the dye extravasation induced by these stimuli, with ID5v values of 1.98 mg. kg-1 for histamine, 1.78 mg. kg-1 for capsaicin, and 2.23 mg. kg-1 for formalin. In contrast to chlorpheniramine, a H1 receptor antagonist, the inhibitory effect of ONO-1078 was weaker on histamine, but more potent on capsaicin and formalin. The inhibitory effect of dexamethasone was more potent than that of ONO-1078 on these stimuli. On the other hand, ONO-1078 inhibited the dye extravasation induced by leukotriene D4 (0.05 micrograms), but showed no effect on those induced by substance P (0.5 micrograms, a sensory neuropeptide), a larger dose of histamine (100 micrograms), and bradykinin (1 microgram). These results suggest that inhibition of chemically induced skin microvascular leakage by ONO-1078 may be mediated by inhibiting the release of sensory neuropeptides from capsaicin-sensitive sensory fibers.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["298"]}

{"title": "The components of somatosensory evoked potentials P250-N350 induced by nervi tibialis posterior stimulation\n", "abstract": " The pain components of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) induced by nervi tibialis posterior stimulation were studied by blocking bloodstream of leg in 10 normal adults. The SEPs following the painful stimuli (0.1 msec square wave pulse) of the right ankle were recorded from the parietal median (C'Z) and the reference electrode at earlobe. The pressure of 80 mmHg above the arterial pressure was given to the right calf by sphygmomanometer. The result showed that the P250-N350 components (latency 244.2+/-10.1 msec and 344.2+/-14.9 msec) of the SEPs persisted and the others disappeared when tactile sensation disappeared but pain existed. It suggested the P250-N350 were the pain potentials of nervi tibialis posterior SEPs.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["298"]}
{"title": "Effects of high-carbohydrate diet on VLDL-, HDL-, and apolipoprotein CII-receptor activities on liver parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells in rats\n", "abstract": " We studied the functions of hepatic VLDL-, HDL-, and apolipoprotein (apo) CIII-receptors in the endogenous hypertriglyceridemic (HTG) rats induced by feeding a high-carbohydrate diet (HCD)(80% of total calories). Compared with the control rats (60% of total calories in CHO), the fasting plasma triglyceride (TG) levels of the rats fed on the CHO diet for 5 days increased by 113.4%(P< 0.025, n= 6), but HDL-C and total cholesterol concentrations decreased by 28.4% and 14.4%(P< 0.05, P< 0.05). The binding (Bmax) and uptake of 125I-labeled VLDL by liver non-parenchymal cells (NPC) from HTG rats decreased by 65.0% and 19.1%(P< 0.001, P> 0.05) respectively. The binding of 125I-labeled apoE-deficient HDL3 to the NPC also decreased significantly (-54.5%, P< 0.05). But the affinities (Ka) of the two receptors were prone to increasing. However, the activities of VLDL-and HDL-receptors on liver parenchymal cells didn't significantly change. Meanwhile, the specific binding of 125I-labeled apo CIII to NPC from HTG rats increased by 104.5%(P< 0.025). The results of this study suggest that hepatic VLDL-and HDL-receptors could be down-and up-regulated respectively in response to plasma lipoprotein concentrations in the high CHO dietary rats, and apo CIII-receptor might play an important role in regulating VLDL-and HDL-receptor activities.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["298"]}

{"title": "Double primary cancer in the larynx and lung--report of 12 cases\n", "abstract": " 12 patients with double primary cancers in the larynx and lung were treated from 1958 to 1984. The incidence is 1.2%(12/943) of laryngeal carcinomas, 1.3%(12/904) of multiple primary cancers, 1.4%(12/873) of double primary cancers and 39%(12/31) of double primary cancers related to laryngeal cancers. There were 9 male and 3 female. 11 of the first primary cancers occurred in the larynx and only one in the lung. All were proved to be squamous cell carcinoma. In the 11 patients whose second primaries occurred in the lung, 4 were proved to be squamous cell carcinoma, one adenocarcinoma, one oat cell carcinoma, one poorly differentiated carcinoma and one cancer unclassified. Of 10 patients in whom both the first and the second primary cancer were treated, 6 survived for more than 2 years, 4 for 3 years and one for 5 years after the second treatment. It seems that double primary cancers of the larynx and lung could yield favorable results.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["298"]}

The model is investigated with sensitivity tests and observations over grass. It appears that accurate NO surface emissions are needed for better comparison with traditional constant flux models and observations. 1 Introduction The need to include chemical reactions in models of dry depositions for NO, NO? and possibly O, has been demonstrated for example by Kramm et al.[l], and Arellano and Duynkerke [2].

Methods H9c2 (2-1) cardiomyocytes were originally developed from rat BD1X heart (ATCC). These cells were cultured on coverslips. Double immunofluorescence staining with monoclonal antibodies (1: 100) against phospho-histone H3 and?-sarcomeric actin was performed on the cultured cells. Anti-mouse IgG FITC was used as the secondary antibody for the H3P antibody, and anti-mouse IgM Cy3 was used as the secondary antibody for the?-sarcomeric actin. DNA was visualized with Hochest 33342. All photographs were taken with an Olympus fluorescence microscope. Results The cytoplasm of cardiomyocytes appeared red, the mitotic chromosomes green with distinct shape, and Hochest 33342-stained nuclei blue. Conclusion Our method is the reliable and exact means to observe and assess cardiomyocytes mitosis.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["298"]}
