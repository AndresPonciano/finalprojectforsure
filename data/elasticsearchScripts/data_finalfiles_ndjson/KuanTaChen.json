{"title": "Quantifying skype user satisfaction\n", "abstract": " The success of Skype has inspired a generation of peer-to-peer-based solutions for satisfactory real-time multimedia services over the Internet. However, fundamental questions, such as whether VoIP services like Skype are good enough in terms of user satisfaction,have not been formally addressed. One of the major challenges lies in the lack of an easily accessible and objective index to quantify the degree of user satisfaction.In this work, we propose a model, geared to Skype, but generalizable to other VoIP services, to quantify VoIP user satisfaction based on a rigorous analysis of the call duration from actual Skype traces. The User Satisfaction Index (USI) derived from the model is unique in that 1) it is composed by objective source-and network-level metrics, such as the bit rate, bit rate jitter, and round-trip time, 2) unlike speech quality measures based on voice signals, such as the PESQ model standardized by\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "373\n", "authors": ["2100"]}

Nevertheless, there is no general method available for detecting the use of stepping stones from the server's perspective. In this paper, based on Nagle's algorithm, we propose a server-based scheme to detect whether a host that establishes a TCP connection to the server is a stepping stone or not. Via Internet experiments on the PlanetLab, we show that our scheme achieves an average of 92% detection rate whenever our scheme applies.

However, managing such traffic is a major challenge for network administrators, because peerto-peer applications tend to use dynamic port numbers and proprietary protocols. There has been a great deal of research in the area of peer-to-peer traffic detection, and a number of approaches have been proposed; among them, the application-layer approach and the transport-layer approach are considered the most promising. In the following, we briefly discuss the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches.The application-layer approach [3] identifies a protocolspecific signature in the packet payload. This approach achieves high detection accuracy because false positives do not occur if the signature is sufficiently unique; however, it cannot identify applications with unknown signatures and cannot be used for encrypted traffic. As a result, a peer-topeer application might easily avoid detection. Furthermore, examining user payloads incurs a high computation overhead and raises privacy concerns. On the other hand, the transport-layer approach [1, 2] is based on the observation that a host running peer-to-peer applications usually interacts with a large number of other hosts. This approach is more lightweight, as no payload examination is required, and it is more robust against countermeasures of applications.

Clustering of trajectories and giving meanings to the resulting clusters is an active research area. Recently, we proposed an analysis approach that clusters trajectories in two steps: the first step based on data distribution and the second step based on state transition. In this approach, for coping with the distinguished characteristic of each trajectory, a map of interest is dynamically divided into multiple states, according to the trajectory distribution, and a quadtree is generated for each trajectory. The first-step clustering is then performed based on the differences between the quadtrees. For all trajectories in a resulting cluster of interest, the second-step clustering is further performed based on the differences in their state-to-state transition probabilities using a proposed method for comparing a pair of trajectories with different quadtree structures. In this paper, after presenting a procedure for visualizing a cluster of interest in order to interpret its movement behaviors, we give and discuss a case study where our approach is applied to real trajectory data obtained from Angel Love Online, a massively multiplayer online game, manifesting player behaviors in the target map.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["2100"]}

It has so far no empirical approach to model the interflow and formation of crowd\u2019s opinion in elections due to two reasons. First, unlike the spread of information or flu, individuals have their intrinsic attitudes to election candidates in advance. Second, opinions are generally simply assumed as single values in most diffusion models. However, in this case, an opinion should represent preference toward multiple candidates. Previously done models thus may not intuitively interpret such scenario. This work is to design a diffusion model which is capable of managing the aforementioned scenario. To demonstrate the usefulness of our model, we simulate the diffusion on the network built based on a publicly available bibliography dataset.

{"title": "Towards user-centric rate adaptations for VoIP traffic\n", "abstract": " Voice traffic by nature is high in data volume and sensitive to network impairments. Bandwidth requirement for voice calls is, therefore, higher. An increasingly serious dilemma, as the amount of VoIP traffic increases, is that it will not be fair to give priority to the multimedia traffic and starve its best-effort counter part; yet the voice data delivered might not be perceptible if each voice call is limited to the rate of an average TCP flow. We propose to approach this problem from a user-centric view and adapt the sending rate of the voice calls based on the user satisfaction. Such a user-friendly rate adaptation mechanism will also be congestion-friendly, although not strictly TCP-friendly [1].There has not been a promising rate adaptation mechanism yet for user-and congestion-friendly VoIP services. In [2], the authors propose a TCP-like rate adaptation mechanism. In that, the sending rate is adjusted in an additive-increase-multiplicative-decrease fashion based on the measured loss rate and delay.[3][4] propose to use speech quality indicator such as E-Model as the metrics to adapt the sending rate. However, the number of parameters required to calculate the E-Model value is high, twenty-one to be exact. Some parameters such as mouthto-ear delay are not easily accessible. Many of the parameters are over-simplified in the existing works. Exploiting the User Satisfaction Index (USI) derived from a recent study on Skype traffic [5], we propose a rate adaptation mechanism for Skype voice call which requires only 3 parameters that can be measured and computed in real time.

Population increases trigger changes in city attributes that are explicable by scaling laws. These laws show superlinear scaling of communication with population size, asserting an increase in human interaction based on city size. However, it is not yet known if this is the case for social interaction among close contacts, that is, whether population growth influences connectivity in a close circle of social contacts that are dynamic and short-spanned. Following this, a network is configured, named contact networks, based on familiarity. We study the urban scaling property for three social connectivity parameters (degree, call frequency, and call volume) and analyze it at the collective level and the individual level for various cities around the world. The results show superlinear scaling of social interactions based on population for contact networks; however, the increase in level of connectivity is minimal relative to the general scenario. The statistical distributions analyze the impact of city size on close individual interactions. As a result, knowledge of the quantitative increase in social interaction with urbanization can help city planners in devising city plans, developing sustainable economic policies, and improving individuals\u2019 social and personal lives.

{"title": "Is Somebody Watching Your Facebook Newsfeed?\n", "abstract": " With the popularity of Social Networking Services (SNS), more and more sensitive information are stored online and associated with SNS accounts. The obvious value of SNS accounts motivates the usage stealing problem -- unauthorized, stealthy use of SNS accounts on the devices owned/used by account owners without any technology hacks. For example, anxious parents may use their kids' SNS accounts to inspect the kids' social status; husbands/wives may use their spouses' SNS accounts to spot possible affairs. Usage stealing could happen anywhere in any form, and seriously invades the privacy of account owners. However, there is no any currently known defense against such usage stealing. To an SNS operator (e.g., Facebook Inc.), usage stealing is hard to detect using traditional methods because such attackers come from the same IP addresses/devices, use the same credentials, and share the same accounts as the owners do. In this paper, we propose a novel continuous authentication approach that analyzes user browsing behavior to detect SNS usage stealing incidents. We use Facebook as a case study and show that it is possible to detect such incidents by analyzing SNS browsing behavior.
