It aims to motivate independent living of older adults at their place of residence by monitoring their activities in an unobtrusive way. However, challenges are still faced to develop a practical AAL system. One of those challenges is detecting failures in non-intrusive sensors in the presence of the non-deterministic human behaviour. This paper proposes sensor failure detection and isolation system in the AAL environments equipped with event-driven, ambient binary sensors. Association Rule mining is used to extract fault-free correlations between sensors during the nominal behaviour of the resident. Pruning is then applied to obtain a non-redundant set of rules that captures the strongest correlations between sensors. The pruned rules are then monitored in real-time to update the health status of each sensor according to the satisfaction and/or unsatisfaction of rules. A sensor is flagged as faulty when its health status falls below a certain threshold. The results show that detection and isolation of sensors using the proposed method could be achieved using unlabelled datasets and without prior knowledge of the sensors\u2019 topology.

{"title": "Human operator and robot resource modeling for planning purposes in assembly systems\n", "abstract": " To achieve high productivity and flexibility, assembly systems commonly need to use different Levels of Automation, ie both robots or machines and human operators are considered as resources. Tasks allocation between these resources is often planned in the design phase of the system due to machine investments, etc. However, if task allocation is done in early design phases, occurrence of unpredicted events leads to an inflexible system that cannot be dynamic and proactive during execution. For instance, if a robot breaks down, this robot cannot continue to assemble products and it must be repaired; this will have two consequences. The first consequence is that the tasks, or operations, allocated to the robot must be reallocated. The second consequence is that a repair task must be performed on this robot by another resource.For consistency reasons, in the remainder of this paper, the term operation will refer to what the resources of the assembly system can perform or execute, and the term task will refer to high-level phases, eg design tasks. For complex systems, the dynamic allocation of operations cannot be performed manually. Thus, in order to perform optimization on this allocation of operations, both operations and resources need to be precisely modeled. This paper is aiming to define these operation and resource models. The proposed method for modeling resources will be illustrated in the paper through a simple example. The sequence of operations and the allocation of operations for this example are generated using the Sequence Planner software [3].", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1410"]}
