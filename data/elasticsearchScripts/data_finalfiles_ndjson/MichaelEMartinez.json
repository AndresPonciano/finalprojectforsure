{"title": "What is metacognition?\n", "abstract": " THE DISCOVERY and theoretical elaboration of metacognition constitute a major breakthrough in recent decades of cognitive research. While it is al-ways best to begin with definitions, a concept as complex as metacognition demands that our initial definition be provisional. This definition will be-come more detailed and complete as our understanding grows. Many teachers would describe metacognition, quite acceptably, as \u201cthinking about thinking.\u201d But I would propose a more precise definition: metacognition is the monitoring and control of thought. In this article, I seek to clarify the concept of metacognition and to present ideas about how metacognitive ability can be taught.Metacognition serves many diverse functions, as does language. Consider what the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein had to say about language:\u201cThink of the tools in a tool-box: There is a hammer, pliers, a saw, a screw-driver, a rule\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "690\n", "authors": ["1046"]}
{"title": "Cognition and the question of test item format\n", "abstract": " The effects of testing on cognition bear not only on the meaning of what is measured, but also its consequences. Test item formats vary in their typical cognitive demand and in the range of cognitions they sample. Multiple-choice items, in particular, often elicit low-level cognitive processing whereas constructed-response items more often evoke complex thinking. However, the typical cognitions elicited by differing response formats are less a reflection of the limitations of those formats than they are of typical use. Even when research demonstrates that item response formats vary in cognitive features, psychometric characteristics, and costs of administration and scoring, policy implications remain ambiguous because of tradeoffs along these dimensions. No one format is appropriate for all purposes and on all occasions.

The report, which attempts to capture the interacting forces influencing computer competence among students, is presented in six chapters:(1) Overview (major findings, significance of this assessment, and importance of computer competence);(2) Assessing Computer Competence (ie, knowledge of computer technology, computer applications, and computer programming);(3) Attitudes, Instruction, and Access (student attitudes toward computers, experience with computers, computer use in the school, and computer use outside the school);(4) Computer Competence among Subgroups (eg, gender, race/ethnicity, parental education, public/non-public education, and community and religion);(5) Computer Coordinators (their characteristics, teaching activities, professional experience and training, and professional confidence); and (6) Implications. The major findings of this survey indicate that access to a computer at home is positively related to computer competence; students like using computers; computers are seldom used in subject areas such as reading, math, or science; males demonstrate more competence than females; racial differences exist, favoring white students over black students; computer competence is increased for students whose parents went to college, who attend non-public schools, and who live in the northeast; and many computer coordinators have minimal training in computer studies.

We need all the powers of the human mind if we are to defeat the vicious problems that con-front humanity, and to nurture creativity and discovery in the arts, engineering, science, and medicine. Every compelling vision of the future requires capable minds that work together to achieve positive ends. Fortunately, human cultures have devised programs to promote the mind\u2019s rational and creative abilities. Those programs collectively are called education, but their manifestations are diverse. Education can take the form of direct personal apprenticeship as practiced from prehistoric times to the present, the dialogic search for fundamental truth that characterized ancient Athens, or the formal curricula that are the mainstays of schools and universities today. But to recognize diverse forms of education is not to say that they are adequate for the future. Educators and the broader public fully recognize that education must be more effective now than ever before. Today\u2019s citizens must be smarter, more knowl-edgeable, and more creative than previous generations. What will it take to accomplish this? How can education become more effective so that current and future learners will be far more capable than those of the past? A key answer, I believe, is that we need a far greater understanding of the nature and operation of the human mind. After all, if edu-cation is intended to develop the mind\u2019s capability, then only through a deep understanding of the mind can we chart an optimal course for its development.

The next generation of STEM professionals must be prepared to engage the world\u2019s most pressing problems. Education, especially in the science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) disciplines, is vital to this endeavor. Yet the US public education system is not adequately developing the intellectual readiness needed to sustain the nation\u2019s economy (NAS, 2007). Students graduating from US high schools are seriously under-prepared to enter STEM fields, which require academic proficiency in mathematics and science, as well as proficiency in problem solving and reasoning.International comparisons show that the performance of American students is far below optimal. In the most recent PISA assessment, for example, top performing students in the US ranked well behind students in the highest achieving countries (PISA, 2007). Performance lagged especially in mathematics, with US proficiency falling well below the average for industrialized countries. In the US, one-third of 4th graders and one-fifth of 8th graders lack the competence to perform basic mathematical computations, with low-income children performing below middle-income children (NAEP, 2005).

A cross-sectional study was conducted in subjects from 5 municipalities, recruited in urban and rural locations, distributed by gender according to the demographic information available. Socio-demographic information, history of potential exposure to insect vectors, blood donating, as well as symptoms suggesting cardiac disease were collected using a questionnaire. After giving written informed consent, blood specimens were obtained from 486 people to determine the serologic evidence of past exposure to T. cruzi. Infection was diagnosed when two different tests (ELISA and IHA) were positive. The seroprevalence of antibodies against T. cruzi was 16.91% considering an estimated population of 44,355 aged between 15 and 89 years (95%IC: 13.72 to 20.01). The factors significantly associated with the infection were: 1- Housing materials like vegetable material, adobe or unfinished brick walls; 2- The fact of having previous tests for Chagas disease (regardless of the result). Of note, the mean ages among infected and not infected participants were significantly different (49.19 vs. 41.66, p\u22640.0001). Among the studied municipalities, the one with the highest frequency of T. cruzi infection was Nunchia, with 31.15% of the surveyed subjects.

If our IQ was 115 at the age of eighteen, it would be 115 at age thirty-two and at age seventy-two. But as Michael Martinez reveals in Future Bright, human intelligence is not at all a static quality. Drawing on cutting-edge research, Martinez shows that not only can we improve our IQ scores--with the right approach, we can improve intelligence itself. Future Bright introduces the radical view that intelligence can be learned. Ranging from the search for Einstein's brain to the curious case of a railroad worker whose frontal lobe was pierced by a tamping iron, Martinez looks at some of the most fascinating stories in the history of cognitive science, revealing how researchers have sought insight into intelligence by understanding more about the brain. We see how the physical structures of the brain relate to how we think, discover how memories are made, and examine the several kinds of intelligence. Martinez then explores the astonishing evidence from recent cognitive science that intelligence can be learned. Equally important, he concludes with ten strategies for enhancing our intelligence, beginning with the all-important idea of making improved intelligence a conscious goal, and including such ideas as reading books, learning to be an expert, finding where our talents lie and, not least, eating well and exercising, both of which improve brain function significantly.

The high incidence of malnutrition in hospitals and the negative effect this has on the evolution of patients, since complications are significantly greater in undernourished patients, make it important to find out the nutritional status of patients when they are admitted to hospital and to follow their progress. In the La Rioja region, there have been no prior studies establishing the nutritional status of patients in hospital, so this study was undertaken. It is important to know whether malnutrition is present, the degree of any malnutrition found, and, where necessary, to make the medical and nursing staff aware of the importance of proper nutritional care during a hospital stay. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a sample of 240 patients selected at random, a nutritional assessment was made on admission. If the patients were still hospitalized one week later, the nutritional assessment was repeated. RESULTS: After the initial assessment, only 12.5% of the 240 patients showed normal nutritional status; mild malnutrition was seen in 55% of cases while moderate and severe cases represented 28.3% and 0.8%, with the most prevalent types of malnutrition being kwasiorkor and mixed (31.6% and 29.6%, respectively). There was no statistical association between the sex of the patient and the degree of malnutrition (p> 0.05). On analysis of the cases by age group, those patients aged less than 65 years mainly presented a marasmus-like and mixed malnutrition, both to a slight degree, whereas the most prevalent malnutrition in patients over the age of 65 was the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["1046"]}

{"title": "Overexpression of genes involved in vesicular trafficking to the vacuole defends against lethal effects of oxidative damage.\n", "abstract": " Anticancer bleomycins and structurally-related analogs are oxidative agents that mimic ionizing radiation in many of their cellular effects. The current study was designed to better understand this class of radiomimetic and oxidative drugs, and how cells defend against them to become resistant. Based on some of the properties conferred by the blm5-1 mutation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a multi-step cloning strategy was developed to search for genes that protect cells against oxidative damage and lethal effects of bleomycin treatments. The strategy employed blm5-1 mutant strains to search for genes that rescued the drug hypersensitivities conferred by the mutation, and utilized the inability of homozygous blm5-1 mutant diploid strains to grow at elevated temperatures. This approach identified the VPS3, VPS8 and PEP7 genes that function in vesicular trafficking between the endosome and the yeast vacuole via the carboxypeptidase Y (CpY) pathway. Mutant blm5-1 strains possess several phenotypic characteristics consistent with CpY mutants, including reduced mitotic growth rates and sporulative abilities. However, blm5-1 strains were not found to be defective in the transport of CpY into the vacuole. We suggest that the ability of the VPS3, VPS8 and PEP7 genes to rescue lethal effects of oxidative damage resulted from the overexpression of these genes.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1046"]}

Three years later, in accordance with significant scientific progress made in this area, the statement has been thoroughly revised. The new paper in fact constitutes a second consensus statement on the use of antibiotics in COPD exacerbations. When several scientific associations expressed interest in joining the project and contributing to it the Spanish Society of Emergency Medicine (SEMES), the Spanish Society of General Medicine (SEMG) and the Spanish Society of Rural and General Medicine (SEMERGEN) their incorporation led SEPAR and SEMFyC to change the structure of the statement and certain aspects of its content. Additionally, a new group of antibiotics, the ketolides, has joined the therapeutic arsenal. Telithromycin, the single representative of the group for the moment, can be considered not only an alternative treatment but even the drug of choice in certain clinical settings that are analyzed in the new statement.

The most likely route segment to obstruct shipping is in Viscount Melville Sound, which is typically characterized haracterized by the presence of high concentration mixtures of deformed, thick first year and multiyear ice. The period for ship transits through the Passage is determined from the computer-based based analysis of digital Canadian Ice Service weekly ice charts which hich are available from the late 1960\u2019s to the present. Automated computer-based based algorithms were developed to estimate the number of, if any, weeks with ice conditions that would successfully allow transit. The results show a very large year to year variability ility in the duration of the summer shipping season with the trend towards slightly improving ice conditions. The possibility of future increases in old ice concentrations in western and central portions of Parry Channel due to an apparent trend towards more ore rapid passage of this old ice through the Queen Elizabeth Islands to the north may impede ship passages in the next decade by comparison with the last decade or two.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1046"]}

{"title": "Cloning, characterization and identification of the gene encoding phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase.\n", "abstract": " The vast majority of AIDS-related deaths are associated with opportunistic infections. For fungal infections, there are few effective antifungals, particularly for systemic use. The discovery that very low doses of the bleomycin family of anticancer chemical congeners compromise the integrity of fungal cell walls led to our approach to identify genes that complement-cell wall defects, and develop methods to facilitate the identification of new antifungals targeted to fungal cell walls. This report describes one of the genes cloned by complementation of the blm1-1 mutation of S. cerevisiae using a YCp50-based yeast genomic library. Characterization and identification of the gene were carried out using drug screening tests, Southern hybridization analyses, DNA sequencing and DNA sequence similarity searches in databases. The gene STT4, is essential for viability and encodes a phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase that plays an important role in the phosphatidylinositol-mediated signal transduction pathway required for cell wall integrity. Like blm1-1 mutant strains, stt4 cells arrest mostly in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Further studies using this approach should help us understand the role of PI4-K in maintaining fungal cell-wall integrity, identify additional genes affecting potential target structures in cell walls of opportunistic fungal pathogens in AIDS patients, and assist in drug discovery and antifungal drug design.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1046"]}

In addition, it has increased educational levels, making relations more complex and communication more difficult. At the same time, the teaching of academic knowledge has become separated from educating students for the purpose of obtaining employment. However, with the range of jobs rapidly transforming, higher education has had to continually reformulate its specialised offerings, increasingly ignoring the idea of the education of responsible citizenship and, instead, addressing immediate and changing functional necessities rather than permanent human necessities. From an economic perspective, the economic crisis in a context of a growth in the number of institutions of higher education has led to a decrease in public financing, which has in turn led public universities to find other forms of financing, less dependent on the state. At the same time, the proliferation of private universities has increased competition between schools while financial deficits have generated the adoption of forms of organisation and management based on profit. Thus, the growing demand to adapt to the market has led to a growth in the supply of new courses and degrees and the capture of resources through the creation of specialized research centres and the search for economically profitable projects.

The monthly survey and sampling of pests from the selected municipalities of the province led to the identification of the 12 insect pests and 12 diseases attacking the crop in these areas. These identified pests were present throughout the year infesting the crop at various stages of plant growth and plant parts. Fruit fly (Bactrocera umbrosa) and unidentified fruit borers dominated the insect pests associated with jackfruit in terms of counts and damage inflicted by the insects to the crop. Likewise, inflorescence rot (Rhizopus nigricans) and fruit decay (Diplodia artocarpi) severely infected the fruitlets. The insect feedings and infections of the fungal pathogens considerably destroyed the fruits of the crop. An attempt to identify some biological control agent of the major pests of the crop was done.

In secondarily generalized convulsive SE, there is a predictable progression of clinical and electroencephalographic (EEG) changes; clinical sings become increasingly subtle, whereas continuous or periodic epileptic discharges are seen on the EEG (electroclinical disassociation). Complex partial SE (CPSE) often goes unrecognized or is mistaken for behavioral or psychiatric disturbances; EEG could be difficult to distinguish from absence status, and needs rapid and vigorous treatment because permanent sequel can occur. SE is sometimes difficult to diagnose in encephalopathic epilepsy; an EEG criterion is the definitive change from the preictal state. EEG is the most useful test in SE; not only it serves to support the diagnosis of SE, but also to monitorize a successful treatment if the patient does not recover the neurologic function.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1046"]}

{"title": "AUTOMATIC SCORING OF PAPER\u2010AND\u2010PENCIL FIGURAL RESPONSES\n", "abstract": " Large\u2010scale testing is dominated by the multiple\u2010choice question format. Widespread use of the format is due, in part, to the ease with which multiple\u2010choice items can be scored automatically. This paper examines automatic scoring procedures for an alternative item type: figural response. Figural response items call for the completion or modification of figural material, including illustrations, diagrams, and graphs. Twenty\u2010five science items were written in cooperation with the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and printed with an ink that was invisible to scanning equipment. The items were answered with pencils; response sheets were scanned and the resulting data were processed by computer\u2010based scoring algorithms. The paper describes the technology that lead to successful pilot scoring of seven items for ten subjects. Implications of this technology for the future of large\u2010scale testing are\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1046"]}
{"title": "Profile: Student Characteristics from the 1986 and 1988 NAEP Assessments.\n", "abstract": " This profile is a\" biographical sketch\" of the nation's students based on information gathered in the 1986 and 1988 National Assessments of Educational Progress (NAEP) as part of their surveys of proficiencies in subject areas. The report is based primarily on data from the 1988 assessment, in which about 79,000 students in grades 4, 8, and 12 answered questions about their personal characteristics, home life, and schoolwork. The 1986 assessment involved about 73,000 students at grades 3, 7, and 11. Of particular note is that minority children compose a steadily increasing proportion of the nation's students, and this trend is likely to continue, with the most rapid growth in Hispanic and Asian populations. Data are provided in table and chart form for student characteristics that include:(1) race and ethnicity;(2) language oth. n than English;(3) high school program;(4) achievement and failure;(5) attendance;(6) part-time employment; and (7) future plans. Aspects of home life that were investigated include parental work, parent-child relationships, and leisure time activities, including television viewing. The school program is examined for different subject areas. Using these data for educational improvement is briefly discussed. Twelve figures and 29 short tables present the profile information. Each profile contains references.(SLD)", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1046"]}

An increasing of hospitalized addicts per year was observed, being infectious diseases the main pathology detected. HIV infection was present in more than 90% of individuals with non opportunistic acquired infections. Significant annual increase in the number of tuberculosis and candida infections was present. The possible association of HIV infection with increased susceptibility to commonly acquired non opportunistic infections is discussed.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1046"]}
