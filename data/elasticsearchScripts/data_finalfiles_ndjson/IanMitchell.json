{"title": "A hybrid particle level set method for improved interface capturing\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we propose a new numerical method for improving the mass conservation properties of the level set method when the interface is passively advected in a flow field. Our method uses Lagrangian marker particles to rebuild the level set in regions which are underresolved. This is often the case for flows undergoing stretching and tearing. The overall method maintains a smooth geometrical description of the interface and the implementation simplicity characteristic of the level set method. Our method compares favorably with volume of fluid methods in the conservation of mass and purely Lagrangian schemes for interface resolution. The method is presented in three spatial dimensions.", "num_citations": "1375\n", "authors": ["1884"]}

{"title": "The flexible, extensible and efficient toolbox of level set methods\n", "abstract": " Level set methods are a popular and powerful class of numerical algorithms for dynamic implicit surfaces and solution of Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs. While the advanced level set schemes combine both efficiency and accuracy, their implementation complexity makes it difficult for the community to reproduce new results and make quantitative comparisons between methods.

The Toolbox\u2019s code and interface are designed to permit flexible combinations of different schemes and PDE forms, allow easy extension through the addition of new algorithms, and achieve efficient execution despite the fact that the code is entirely written as m-files.

{"title": "Safety verification of conflict resolution manoeuvres\n", "abstract": " We address the problem of generating provably-safe conflict resolution maneuvers for aircraft in uncertain environments. We assume that a maneuver is composed of a sequence of flight modes, which are segments of constant heading, of constant bank angle, or of constant airspeed. Each of these flight modes has associated to it the kinematics of the aircraft, and hence the maneuver is a hybrid system. While the flight modes are defined ahead of time, their sequencing and parameter values do not necessarily have to be. We present an algorithm for generating provably safe maneuvers, which is based on a general procedure for designing controllers for hybrid systems. The result is a maneuver, proven to be safe within the limits of the models used, which is a familiar sequence of commands easily executable by the flight management systems. The maneuvers may be viewed as protocols, or \"rules of the road\", and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "202\n", "authors": ["1884"]}
{"title": "Overapproximating reachable sets by Hamilton-Jacobi projections\n", "abstract": " In earlier work, we showed that the set of states which can reach a target set of a continuous dynamic game is the zero sublevel set of the viscosity solution of a time dependent Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) partial differential equation (PDE). We have developed a numerical tool\u2014based on the level set methods of Osher and Sethian\u2014for computing these sets, and we can accurately calculate them for a range of continuous and hybrid systems in which control inputs are pitted against disturbance inputs. The cost of our algorithm, like that of all convergent numerical schemes, increases exponentially with the dimension of the state space. In this paper, we devise and implement a method that projects the true reachable set of a high dimensional system into a collection of lower dimensional subspaces where computation is less expensive. We formulate a method to evolve the lower dimensional reachable sets\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "170\n", "authors": ["1884"]}
{"title": "Comparing forward and backward reachability as tools for safety analysis\n", "abstract": " Using only the existence and uniqueness of trajectories for a generic dynamic system with inputs, we define and examine eight types of forward and backward reachability constructs. If the input is treated in a worst-case fashion, any forward or backward reach set or tube can be used for safety analysis, but if the input is treated in a best-case fashion only the backward reach tube always provides the correct results. Fortunately, forward and backward algorithms can be exchanged if well-posed reverse time trajectories can be defined. Unfortunately, backward reachability constructs are more likely to suffer from numerical stability issues, especially in systems with significant contraction\u2014the very systems where forward simulation and reachability are most effective.", "num_citations": "166\n", "authors": ["1884"]}

Our goal in the research described here is verifying the safety of such hybrid systems: systems which involve both discrete and continuous behaviors.

Coho represents high-dimensional objects using projections onto planes corresponding to pairs of variables. This representation is compact and allows efficient algorithms from computational geometry to be exploited while also capturing dependencies in the behaviour of related variables. Reachability is performed by integration where methods from linear programming and linear systems theory are used to bound trajectories emanating from each face of the object.

{"title": "Lagrangian methods for approximating the viability kernel in high-dimensional systems\n", "abstract": " While a number of Lagrangian algorithms to approximate reachability in dozens or even hundreds of dimensions for systems with linear dynamics have recently appeared in the literature, no similarly scalable algorithms for approximating viable sets have been developed. In this paper we describe a connection between reachability and viability that enables us to compute the viability kernel using reach sets. This connection applies to any type of system, such as those with nonlinear dynamics and/or non-convex state constraints; however, here we take advantage of it to construct three viability kernel approximation algorithms for linear systems with convex input and state constraint sets. We compare the performance of the three algorithms and demonstrate that the two based on highly scalable Lagrangian reachability\u2013those using ellipsoidal and support vector set representations\u2013are able to compute the viability\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "134\n", "authors": ["1884"]}
{"title": "Integrating projections\n", "abstract": " This paper describes three techniques for reachability analysis for systems modeled by ordinary differential equations (ODES). First, linear models with regions modeled by convex polyhedra are considered, and an exact algorithm is presented. Next, non-convex polyhedra are considered, and techniques are presented for representing a polyhedron by its projection onto two-dimensional subspaces. This approach yields a compact representation, and allows efficient algorithms from computational geometry to be employed. Within this context, an approximation technique for reducing non-linear ODE models to linear nonhomogeneous models is presented. This reduction provides a sound basis for applying methods for linear systems analysis to non-linear systems.", "num_citations": "86\n", "authors": ["1884"]}

For the single cost case, previously published research has proposed constructing the paths by gradient descent on a local minima free value function. This value function is the solution of the Eikonal partial differential equation, and efficient algorithms have been designed to compute it. In this paper we propose an auxiliary partial differential equation with which we can evaluate multiple additive cost metrics for paths which are generated by value functions; solving this auxiliary equation adds little more work to the value function computation. We then propose an algorithm which generates paths whose costs lie on the Pareto optimal surface for each possible destination location, and we can choose from these paths those which satisfy the constraints.
