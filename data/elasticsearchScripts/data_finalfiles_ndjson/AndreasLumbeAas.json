The Human Factors Assessment and Classification System (HFACS) was adapted for use in the Oil & Gas (O&G) industry to provide a common framework to systematically classify accident contributing factors. HFACS originates from the aviation industry and is based on Reason's model of latent and active failures, the\" Swiss cheese\" model. The framework defines the\" holes in the cheese\" with four main categories of conditions/failures; Acts, Preconditions, Supervision, and Organizational Influences. Each category contains a set of failure codes, known as nanocodes.", "num_citations": "34\n", "authors": ["1488"]}

We mainly focussed on ISO 11064 Part 1, because this was the most commonly used among the identified stakeholders. ISO 11064 is generally appreciated and applied in the industry, but we did observe a significant variance in use between the different parts of the standard. We also identified potential areas for improvements, like scope and application adaptation. Thus we suggest a more goal-based approach based on one normative part only.", "num_citations": "32\n", "authors": ["1488"]}

{"title": "Probing human error as causal factor in incidents with major accident potential\n", "abstract": " Existing literature suggests that human error is directly linked to the majority of industrial incidents and accidents. The increasing use of computers and software in safety-critical systems makes systems more integrated and dependent and this can increase the risk if barrier integrity is reduced. This paper demonstrates how the Human Factors Assessment and Classification System (HFACS) can be applied to analyze incidents with major accident potential. One report from a Norwegian offshore Oil & Gas incident with major accident potential was analyzed to classify the causal factors for the purpose of making a relative comparison of these factors. The results revealed that failures on the organizational level were the most prevailing, representing almost three-quarters of all causal factors, while unsafe acts represented fourteen percent. Thus, organizational factors appear essential in risk management and failures on\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1488"]}
{"title": "A method to assess and classify HSE standards\n", "abstract": " We established metrics to assess HSE standards for the purpose of making cross standard comparisons to rank the standards and to predict resource requirements. We assessed six international safety standards, thirteen parts in total, to determine their degree of goal-based or prescriptive, generic, and process-oriented approach. We also recorded size, year of publication and the number of normative references. These standards were published in the period 1994\u20132006 and were selected because they were normative references in the working environment standard NORSOK-S002, developed by the Norwegian petroleum industry.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1488"]}
{"title": "Industrial Application of Human Factors Safety Standards\n", "abstract": " The main objective of this thesis is to investigate how selected standards are applied within an industrial context and to suggest strategies to improve their application. This thesis focuses on the human part of large and complex systems. Humans are essential in any large and complex system, but their complexity makes it virtually impossible to fully predict their behaviour and impact on such systems. Safety standards should be an aid to handle such complexity in a safe, efficient and effective manner. Standards adapt several strategies, such as prescriptive or goal-based and process or product focus, to utilize advantages and manage challenges related to humans as parts of safety-critical and safety-related systems. A survey of selected HSE standards used in the Norwegian petroleum industry revealed that the standards differ in how goal-based or prescriptive and how process-or product-oriented they are and recent standards were not more goal-based than older ones. Studies of the application of ISO 11064 revealed that the standard is well appreciated measured by the opinion of its users. However, many users of the standard also found it to be too comprehensive to be used efficiently and effectively. Also, the application of the standard must be adapted to each project. Studies of the partly prescriptive CRIOP methodology revealed that it is well appreciated measured by the opinion of its users, but CRIOP also requires adaptation in its application to be effective and efficient in use.Even strictly prescriptive standards are adapted in their application to real world problems.

{"title": "The impact of the ON-S1 standard on railway risk levels in Australia\n", "abstract": " The objective of this study was to compare risk levels, based on reported railway occurrences, across Australian states. A secondary aim was to use these numbers to assess the impact of a new reporting system, ON-S1, introduced in 2004, on the calculated risk levels. The Australian nationwide standard, ON-S1, defines how to categorize occurrences and their consequences, but it has not been consistently applied in all states. For example, New South Wales and Victoria use broader definitions of 'serious injury' than specified in ON-S1. This paper outlines challenges related to ON-SI's use and the appropriateness of calculating risks based on reported occurrences. Railway occurrence data from five Australian states/territories from 2001 to 2007 were reviewed. Data on fatalities, serious injuries and train kilometres were obtained from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) and The Independent Transport\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1488"]}

{"title": "Experiences with Human Factors in Norwegian petroleum Control Centre Design and suggestions to handle an increasingly complex future\n", "abstract": " A longitudinal analysis of human error in maritime accidents in Canada and the US showed that fewer accidents were attributed to human errors than suggested elsewhere in the literature and that factors such as managerial and regulatory context of maritime operations played a role (Johnson & Holloway 2008). Two analyses from the Norwegian petroleum sector suggest that the majority of causal factors were in the organizational domain, while the number of operator errors that contributed to the analyzed accidents and incidents were small (Aas 2008; Aas 2009). Thus it appears that not only the complexity of humans themselves, but also the complex interaction between humans, technology and organization should be in focus when trying to understand human error.ABSTRACT", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1488"]}
{"title": "Use of COTS Software in Safety-Critical Systems\n", "abstract": " The use of COTS (Commercial-Off-The-Shelf) software in safety-critical systems is increasing due to the potential for reduced development costs, reduced development time, reduced time to market and increased quality of the end product. Developing safetycritical systems using COTS software raise some new challenges. This essay investigates the appropriateness of using COTS in safety-critical systems and discusses potential problems and suggested solutions related to the use of COTS in such systems.The use of COTS makes it more difficult to demonstrate that a system is actually safe enough. Most safety standards set requirements to the development process. However, evidence of the development process is often not available to the buyer and user of COTS, as COTS components are usually used as black-box. This creates a conflict between the intentions of the safety standards and the construction of safety-critical systems.\u2018Proven in use\u2019is often used as evidence for safety-critical components and their ability to fulfil the safety requirements when they are used. The context of use can vary greatly for software and \u2018proven in use\u2019is only valid for very similar or equal contexts. Evidence that a system complies with a safety standard is usually diverse and hence, structuring of the evidence can be a challenge. This essay will explore the possibility and appropriateness of using Safety Case for this purpose.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1488"]}
