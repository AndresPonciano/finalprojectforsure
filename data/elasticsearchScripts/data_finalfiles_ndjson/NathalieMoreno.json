{"title": "Expressing measurement uncertainty in OCL/UML datatypes\n", "abstract": " Uncertainty is an inherent property of any measure or estimation performed in any physical setting, and therefore it needs to be considered when modeling systems that manage real data. Although several modeling languages permit the representation of measurement uncertainty for describing certain system attributes, these aspects are not normally incorporated into their type systems. Thus, operating with uncertain values and propagating uncertainty are normally cumbersome processes, difficult to achieve at the model level. This paper proposes an extension of OCL and UML datatypes to incorporate data uncertainty coming from physical measurements or user estimations into the models, along with the set of operations defined for the values of these types.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["616"]}
{"title": "Embedding semantic annotations into dynamic Web contents\n", "abstract": " The semantic Web explosion has not yet been accompanied by efficient search engines or intelligent applications that can exploit semantic query capabilities. This is the reason why the amount of semantically annotated Web pages is still very small compared to the total amount of information on the Web. In this sense, there have been several approaches that deal with the semantic annotation of static Web pages. However, they do not support the annotation of dynamically generated Web content. This paper offers two main contributions: first, the automatic generation of a function that dynamically calculates annotations for a Web document; secondly, a novel approach for annotating dynamic Web documents by annotating the queries enveloped in each document and their results.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["616"]}
{"title": "Model-driven component adaptation in the context of Web Engineering\n", "abstract": " Currently, Web-based applications are no longer monolithic and isolated systems but, rather, distributed applications that need to interoperate with third-party systems, such as external Web services, LDAP repositories or legacy applications. When one component provides a service that the Web application requires, it is often not possible to bind the two systems together if they were not programmed to have compatible collaboration specifications. Modeling the adaptation between a Web application and external assets becomes therefore an essential issue in any realistic model-driven development scenario. However, most of the existing Web Engineering proposals do not take this issue into account, or they simply address it at the implementation level (in a platform-specific way). In this work, we discuss the problems involved in dealing with component adaptation within the context of Model-Driven Web\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["616"]}
{"title": "e-MDA Framework: Model reuse in building e-learning systems\n", "abstract": " The increasing advances in software engineering and information technology trends have promoted the development of numerous e-learning resources and platforms. Although they provide similar functionalities, they are usually implemented from scratch and ad-hoc, according to specific requirements, architectures and development approaches. In this context, software model reuse is not considered and interoperability among elearning platforms is carried out constrained by development agreements that allow systems to exchange/reuse learning objects and tools not reusable/interoperable from the beginning. The need to achieve a more efficient interoperability mechanism, which preserves the business investments, has motivated both an active standardization process and new approaches to address software interoperability such as the MDA framework. In this article, we present briefly our e-MDA framework\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["616"]}
{"title": "A MDA-based framework for building interoperable e-learning platforms\n", "abstract": " The increasing interest in new technology trends has promoted the diffusion of e-learning systems in the academic and enterprise fields. Different technological and organizational proposals have emerged for the development of these systems. However, this implies great effort and business investments which should be preserved. With this purpose, new standard specifications have appeared, such as SCORM or IMS, but the current lack of integration among already existing e-learning platforms is sometimes critical despite their providing similar functionalities. To address this issue, we propose a framework that allows us to separate the system specification into different complementary perspectives. Moreover, this framework isolates the final development process (technology) from the system modelling by using the MDA (Model Driven Architecture) concepts provided to capture the system functionality and organize the specification of complex e-learning systems.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["616"]}

Fractions of 14\u2013250 kDa were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted to nitrocellulose membranes and eluted for use in lymphocyte stimulation studies. Lymphocyte proliferation following stimulation with the separated protein fractions demonstrated that the fractions were recognized only by patients' T cells.

{"title": "A web-based e-commerce facilitator intermediary for small and medium enterprises: a b2b/b2c hybrid proposal\n", "abstract": " The importance of intermediaries in electronic commerce and also in electronic marketplaces has long been recognised in specialised literature. In this paper, we propose a web-based intermediary for e-commerce, whose main goal is to facilitate the entry of small and medium enterprises into the virtual business arena, by allowing the formation of enterprise coalitions based on the role of this intermediary, which acts as a shopping-window for their products. The main characteristics of this intermediary for e-commerce are as follows. First of all, it offers a trading area, based on product catalogues (multi-vendor ecatalogues). Secondly, SMEs are represented by a software catalogue-designer tool that leaves the definition, publication and update of catalogues of products in the hands of these enterprises. From this point of view, the intermediary represents a B2B/B2C hybrid proposal instead of the typical B2B\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["616"]}
{"title": "Digital Avatars: Promoting Independent Living for Older Adults\n", "abstract": " Population ageing, together with the desire to maintain an autonomous lifestyle, poses today\u2019s societies with a challenge that technological advances can help considerably to cope with. The widespread use of smartphones and their increasing computing power and storage capacity make them the ideal tool to achieve this goal. In this paper, we present Digital Avatars, a software framework adapted to the needs of older adults who wish to preserve their lifestyle, but who require assistance through technology. Building on previous work on the People as a Service model, Digital Avatars takes advantage of a smartphone\u2019s capabilities and services to collect information about the people who own them. To do this, it applies Complex Event Processing techniques extended with uncertainty to infer the habits, preferences, and needs of the device owner to build with them an enhanced virtual profile of the user. These virtual profiles are the mechanism for monitoring the quality of life of older adults: analyzing their patterns of activity, reminding them of medication schedules, or detecting risky situations that generate alerts to relatives, caregivers, or the community health system.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["616"]}

{"title": "WebML modelling in UML\n", "abstract": " In recent years, we have witnessed how the Web Engineering community has started using the standard unified modelling language (UML) notation, techniques and supporting tools for modelling Web systems, which has led to the adaptation to UML of several existing modelling languages, notations and development processes. This interest for being MOF and UML-compliant arises from the increasing need to interoperate with other notations and tools, and to exchange data and models, thus facilitating reuse. WebML, like any other domain-specific language, allows one to express in a precise and natural way the concepts and mechanisms of its domain of reference. However, it cannot fully interoperate with other notations, nor be integrated with other model-based tools. As a solution to these requirements, a UML 2.0 profile for WebML which allows WebML models to be used in conjunction with other notations and modelling tools has been described. The paper also evaluates UML 2.0 as a platform for Web modelling and identifies some key requirements for making this version of the standard more usable.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["616"]}
