{"title": "REDOSPLAT: A readable domain-specific language for timetabling requirements definition\n", "abstract": " Automatic creation of school timetables is a complex problem when it involves defining specific constraints and requirements. This paper presents a domain-specific language called REDOSPLAT which supports such definitions in a readable format. REDOSPLAT can be used when timetable programs with a graphical user interface are limited or too cluttered to express specific domain features. It uses customised, readable notation instead of technically oriented data formats which are usually used in timetable problems. The desired timetabling requirements are defined using sentences whose syntax is close to the syntax of spoken language. This paper encompasses the entire language syntax and semantics, the way a sentence is transformed into data structures which describe timetabling requirements, and the way the obtained data structures are transformed into models needed for different problem-solving\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["600"]}
{"title": "Simultaneous multiple representation editing environment for primary school education\n", "abstract": " Modern approaches to introductory Computer Science education utilize block-based programming languages heavily, which poses a problem, as students latter have to switch to textual programming languages for real-world programming. We present the Poliglot environment that aims to smooth this transition by presenting the program simultaneously in both notations, and allows editing in either one. The environment features an educational programming language, Limpid, which we developed for this project. We evaluated it using a preliminary user study on primary school students. The responses were encouraging and we also noted a spontaneous shift from block to text-based programming.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["600"]}
