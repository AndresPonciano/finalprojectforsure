{"title": "Finding interesting patterns using user expectations\n", "abstract": " One of the major problems in the field of knowledge discovery (or data mining) is the interestingness problem. Past research and applications have found that, in practice, it is all too easy to discover a huge number of patterns in a database. Most of these patterns are actually useless or uninteresting to the user. But due to the huge number of patterns, it is difficult for the user to comprehend them and to identify those interesting to him/her. To prevent the user from being overwhelmed by the large number of patterns, techniques are needed to rank them according to their interestingness. In this paper, we propose such a technique, called the user-expectation method. In this technique, the user is first asked to provide his/her expected patterns according to his/her past knowledge or intuitive feelings. Given these expectations, the system uses a fuzzy matching technique to match the discovered patterns against the user's\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "233\n", "authors": ["2192"]}

However, no single testbed supports research spanning systems, applications, services, open-source development, and datacenters. Towards this end, we have developed Open Cirrus, a cloud computing testbed for the research community that federates heterogeneous distributed data centers. Open Cirrus offers a cloud stack consisting of physical and virtual machines, and global services, such as sign-on, monitoring, storage, and job submission. By developing the testbed and making it available to the research community, we hope to help spur innovation in cloud computing and catalyze the development of an open source stack for the cloud.", "num_citations": "122\n", "authors": ["2192"]}

{"title": "Some privacy issues in knowledge discovery: the OECD personal privacy guidelines\n", "abstract": " Several countries have generated principles to protect individuals from the potential invasion of privacy that data collection and retrieval poses. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has provided probably the best known set of guidelines. A number of countries have adopted these guidelines as statutory law, in whole or in part. The OECD has specific guidelines pertaining to data privacy that directly affect those performing knowledge discovery generally, and those who use so called \"personal data\" in particular. The article addresses such questions as: What are the implications of the existing privacy guidelines, especially those of the OECD, for knowledge discovery? What are the limitations of these guidelines? How do the restrictions on knowledge discovery about individuals affect knowledge discovery on groups? How do legal systems influence knowledge discovery?.< >", "num_citations": "74\n", "authors": ["2192"]}

{"title": "A multi-dimensional data visualization tool for knowledge discovery in databases\n", "abstract": " The paper describes a multidimensional visualization (MDV) technique, a refined and improved form of a computational geometry method known as parallel coordinates, that has been realized by WinViz. It shows how MDV differs significantly from parallel coordinates as originally conceived by Alfred Inselberg (T. Chomut, 1987). The paper also discusses WinViz's underlying design considerations. A primary principle is known as \"seeing your data in a single picture\". The novel visualization interface of WinViz supports both the display of multidimensional data and the visual formulation of query interactively. In particular, we compare WinViz's query operators with those in SQL to highlight its salient features realized through the MDV interface. Applications of WinViz include exploratory data analysis and knowledge discovery of databases for a diverse range of domains.", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["2192"]}
{"title": "A new visualisation technique for knowledge discovery in OLAP\n", "abstract": " Knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) has as its primary objective the uncovering of new and useful knowledge from huge masses of raw data. Our research in KDD has focused on how visualisation can be exploited in the dialectic process of knowledge discovery [6]. Our approach uses a multi-dimensional data visualisation (MDV) technique that builds upon a refined and improved method of parallel coordinates. We also explore how visualisation can be used synergistically with other techniques such as inductive learning (eg, C4. 5) and hierarchical clustering to harness their respective strengths in KDD. Our recent work investigates whether the requirements for visualisation would differ if the input to the knowledge discovery comprises aggregated data instead of raw unprocessed data. In particular, we concentrate on the multi-dimensional model, an emerging model for analysis, that underlies the on-line analytical processing (OLAP) concept [2]. The OLAP camp uses the two-dimensional cross-tabulation table as its visualisation tool. We argue that this is inadequate and that a modified MDV can provide superior results for KDD.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["2192"]}

{"title": "Identifying Interesting Missing Patterns\n", "abstract": " One of the important issues in data mining is the subjective \u201cinterestingness\u201d problem. It has been shown that in many situations a huge number of patterns can be discovered from a database. Most of these patterns are actually useless or uninteresting to the user. But because of the huge number of patterns, it is difficult for the user to identify those patterns that are of interest to him/her. Past research proposed two main measures of subjective interestingness: unexpectedness and actionability. Both these measures focus on helping the user identify interesting discovered patterns. In this paper, we show that missing patterns (absence of some patterns) are interesting too. An approach has been proposed to identify the interesting missing patterns. The proposed approach is an extension of our previous work. In our previous work, we studied the subjective interestingness problem based on the concept of user\u2019s expectations and fuzzy set theory. In that study, the discovered patterns are ranked in different ways according to their unexpectedness to the user.

{"title": "Data-as-a-Service: A Cloud-Based Federated Platform to Facilitate Discovery of Private Sector Datasets\n", "abstract": " Frequently described as the oil of the digital economy, data is today fervently sought after and its innovative use demonstrated in increasingly wide-ranging applications. To use data however, data users would first have to find them.

However, the equivalent is not available for datasets from the private sector, where data providers currently operate in highly-siloed environments. Data users seeking data but unfamiliar with the industry sector of interest have no straightforward mechanism to do so.
