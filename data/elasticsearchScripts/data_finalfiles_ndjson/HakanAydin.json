In this paper, we consider real-time tasks with precedence constraints and fault tolerance requirements, and investigate how they can be implemented on heterogeneous dual-core systems in energy-aware fashion. Our framework is able to tolerate one transient fault per task, and one permanent processing core fault simultaneously. We develop a number of task partitioning, ordering, and frequency assignment techniques for energy efficiency.

{"title": "On minimizing expected energy usage of embedded wireless systems with probabilistic workloads\n", "abstract": " A large number of embedded wireless systems must handle complex and time-varying computational and communication workloads. Further, a significant number of these systems support real-time applications. Most of the existing energy management studies for such systems have focused on relatively simple scenarios that assume deterministic workloads, and only consider a limited range of energy management techniques, such as Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS). Our paper addresses these deficiencies by proposing a general purpose probabilistic workload model for computation and communication. To account for the importance of radio energy consumption, we also analyse Dynamic Modulation Scaling (DMS), an often overlooked method for energy management.

{"title": "Energy-aware primary/backup scheduling of periodic real-time tasks on heterogeneous multicore systems\n", "abstract": " For real-time embedded systems, energy management and fault tolerance are both critical. However these two objectives are often at odds, because extra resources needed to tolerate faults significantly increase the energy consumption. In this paper, we consider energy-aware and fault-tolerant scheduling of periodic real-time tasks. Our target platform is a heterogeneous multicore system. We reduce the energy consumption by both applying DVFS to scale the primary tasks, and maximizing the opportunities to cancel the back-up tasks in fault-free execution scenarios. To tolerate both transient and permanent faults, primary and backup copies of tasks are scheduled on different cores. Our framework consists of offline and online phases to manage energy and fault-tolerant scheduling of periodic tasks in tandem. The latter objective is achieved through an explicit task priority assignment phase, coupled with a dual\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["522"]}
{"title": "Adaptive Transmission Scheduling for Energy-Aware Real-Time Wireless Communication\n", "abstract": " Real-time low-power wireless networks are increasingly being used in applications such as: Industrial Internet-of-Things, Smart City technologies, and critical infrastructure monitoring. These networks typically use time-slotted super-frame techniques to ensure real-time performance. Often the time slots are assigned statically, and energy conservation is regulated to other mechanisms such as duty cycling. This paper combines real-time performance with novel energy conservation methods by describing a set of dynamic modulation based adaptive packet transmission scheduling algorithms that are designed to reclaim unused slot times. Our approach uses hybrid link access mechanisms.

Specifically, we derive worst-case performance bounds that apply to any online algorithm, when compared to an optimal algorithm that has the knowledge of the input sequence in advance. First, by focusing on uniform value-density settings, we prove that no online algorithm can achieve a competitive factor greater than 1 - e max /E, where e max  is the upper bound on the size of any job and E is the available energy budget. Then we propose a variant of EDF algorithm, EC-EDF, that is able to achieve this upper bound. We show that a priori information about the largest job size in the actual input sequence makes possible the design of a semi-online algorithm EC-EDF* which achieves a constant competitive factor of 0.5.

{"title": "Periodic Reward-Based Scheduling and Its Application to Power-Aware Real-Time Systems\n", "abstract": " In this chapter, we introduce Reward-based and Power-aware scheduling frameworks. Reward-based scheduling is based on the principle of trading precision for timeliness and it is particularly suitable for real-time applications when worst-case guarantees cannot be provided due to overload conditions and/or faults. Power-aware scheduling exploits the convex relation between the CPU speed and the power dissipation: it is targeted towards saving energy through the reduction of the CPU speed and the supply voltage. However, utmost care must be exercised in order to still satisfy the timing constraints when using the reduced speed. We show that two frameworks are closely related and we provide an overview of the major research findings in these areas for periodic real-time applications.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["522"]}

Dynamic Modulation Scaling (DMS) which is a technique that manages transmission power levels in order to change the number of bits encoded per symbol has a direct impact on connection driven topology control. In this paper we investigate the transmission scheduling of multi-hop real-time WSNs equipped with DMS enabled radio chips while taking the effect of DMS on topology control into account. To our best knowledge, this is the first paper that addresses this issue. The current work on DMS enabled WSN tend to rely on theoretical DMS models to predict network performance metrics.

In this work, focusing on multiprocessor real-time systems, we study the foundational guidelines to design partition-based PO scheduling algorithms for tasks with mixed preference requirements. In particular, through a concrete example, we illustrate that the harmonicity of tasks' periods should be incorporated when making scheduling decisions in addition to their execution preferences to obtain favorable schedules that better fulfill tasks' preference requirements. Based on such guidelines, we design a period-aware preference-oriented (PAPO) partitioned scheduling algorithm and discuss several variations by considering harmonicity as well as\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["522"]}

{"title": "A Software-Defined Radio Analysis of the Impact of Dynamic Modulation Scaling within Low-Power Wireless Systems\n", "abstract": " Dynamic Modulation Scaling (DMS) is a well-known mechanism that can effectively exploit the tradeoff between communication time and energy consumption. In recent years a number of studies have suggested that DMS techniques can reduce energy consumption while maintaining performance objectives in low-power wireless transmission technologies such as those defined in IEEE 802.15. 4. These studies tend to rely on theoretical or simulation DMS models to predict network performance metrics. However, there is little, if any, work that is based upon empirically verified network performance outcomes using DMS. This paper fills that gap. Our contribution is four-fold; first, using GNU~ Radio and SDR hardware we show how to emulate DMS in low power wireless systems.

In this paper, we consider the optimal period assignment problem on a homogeneous multiprocessor platform. The problem is intractable in nature. We analyze the performance of the approaches that first partition the tasks, before assigning periods to optimize overall cost on each CPU locally.

The main idea of the algorithm is to plan in advance for periodic charging and discharging of the battery to avoid energy outage, while still meeting the timing constraints.

After introducing the idea of preference-oriented (PO) execution, we formally define the concept of PO-optimality. For fully-loaded systems (with 100% utilization), we first propose a PO-optimal scheduler, namely ASAP-ensured earliest deadline (SEED), by focusing on ASAP tasks where the optimality of tasks\u2019 ALAP preference is achieved implicitly due to the harmonicity of the PO-optimal schedules for such systems. Then, for underutilized systems (with less than 100% utilization), we show the discrepancies between different PO-optimal schedules. By extending SEED, we propose a generalized preference-oriented earliest deadline (POED) scheduler that can obtain a PO-optimal schedule for any schedulable task set. We further evaluate the proposed PO-optimal schedulers through extensive simulations. The results show that, comparing to that of the well-known EDF scheduler, the scheduling overheads of SEED and POED are higher (but still manageable) due to the additional consideration of tasks\u2019 preferences.
