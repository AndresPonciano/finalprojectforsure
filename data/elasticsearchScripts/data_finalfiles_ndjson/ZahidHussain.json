{"title": "Current state of agile user-centered design: A survey\n", "abstract": " Agile software development methods are quite popular nowadays and are being adopted at an increasing rate in the industry every year. However, these methods are still lacking usability awareness in their development lifecycle, and the integration of usability/User-Centered Design (UCD) into agile methods is not adequately addressed. This paper presents the preliminary results of a recently conducted online survey regarding the current state of the integration of agile methods and usability/UCD. A world wide response of 92 practitioners was received. The results show that the majority of practitioners perceive that the integration of agile methods with usability/UCD has added value to their adopted processes and to their teams; has resulted in the improvement of usability and quality of the product developed; and has increased the satisfaction of the end-users of the product developed.

{"title": "Extending UTAUT2 toward acceptance of mobile learning in the context of higher education\n", "abstract": " The use of smartphones as a learning tool in education is on the rise, causing a rapidly developing use of mobile learning (m-learning) in both developed and developing countries. The key features of smartphones, i.e., mobility, ubiquity, lightweight, low-cost and connectivity from anywhere and anytime, enhance their usage in a variety of ways. M-learning is an innovative idea that provides enormous opportunities by connecting humans and technology, such as better learning experiences and technology acceptance. The use of m-learning is growing at a higher pace worldwide, yet sufficient understanding of the factors that influence its acceptance in society is still lacking, particularly in developing countries. A number of models related to m-learning acceptance do exist, for instance, the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2); however, the use of UTAUT2 to study m\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "54\n", "authors": ["2245"]}
{"title": "Investigating agile user-centered design in practice: A grounded theory perspective\n", "abstract": " This paper investigates how the integration of agile methods and User-Centered Design (UCD) is carried out in practice. For this study, we have applied grounded theory as a suitable qualitative approach to determine what is happening in actual practice. The data was collected by semi-structured interviews with professionals who have already worked with an integrated agile UCD methodology. Further data was collected by observing these professionals in their working context, and by studying their documents, where possible. The emerging themes that the study found show that there is an increasing realization of the importance of usability in software development among agile team members. The requirements are emerging; and both low and high fidelity prototypes based usability tests are highly used in agile teams. There is an appreciation of each other\u2019s work from both UCD professionals and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "45\n", "authors": ["2245"]}

The portal is based on responsive web design which is accessible from anywhere, at any time and on any device. A complementary user experience evaluation methodology consisting of heuristic evaluation, usability testing, user experience questionnaire and eye tracking has been applied to get a holistic understanding and identification of the potential usability problems in the portal. The methodology highlights the relative efficacy of each method. The results suggest that the heuristic evaluation identified more usability problems than the usability testing. However, few severe usability problems were identified in the usability testing and most of them were not spotted in the heuristic evaluation. For additional insights, the participants\u2019 objective visual responses were tracked using an eye tracker (Tobii X-30\u00a0Hz); the eye\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["2245"]}

The App facilitates the children aged between 4 and 9 of Class-KG and Class-I to learn English with the help of their native language named Sindhi. After the pilot study, actual usability test was conducted with 100 children. In the study, besides usability tasks performed by the children, Smileyometer and Again-Again Table from the Fun Toolkit were also used to assess user experience. The outcomes disclose that the App was very easy and effective as task accomplishment rate was hundred percent. The results from the Smileyometer and Again-Again Table show that most of the children enjoyed the App. There was no statistically significant difference between the baby girls and the baby boys in terms of task completion time which shows that the App was equally efficient\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["2245"]}

Various web applications and services are emerging on mobile phones. One such application is consuming multimedia-Audio and Video (AV)-on mobile devices. We have been working on an application that enables a user to perform content-based search for AV content in large digital archives and play the streamed content on a mobile phone. The search is not only possible in meta data but the application is intelligent enough that it also searches in spoken words and shows the context of spoken words in the clip so that user can immediately watch the particular part of the clip where these words were spoken.

Seventy participants ranging between the ages of 20 and 40 participated in this study. They read four different texts with an average length of 2000 characters. The texts contained substitution words, which were to be detected by the subjects to measure reading accuracy. Moreover, the subjects were asked to subjectively vote on their reading experience in the context of subjective measures like reading speed and accuracy. The results of the study revealed that 90 characters per line (CPL) were preferred by most of the participants. Nonetheless, some participants falling between the ages of 35 and 40 years preferred 60 CPL.

{"title": "Development and Validation of User Experience-Based E-Learning Acceptance Model for Sustainable Higher Education\n", "abstract": " E-learning is a convenient way of learning through a portal. E-learning is being increasingly adopted in the world; however, the factors that influence the intention of users for accepting the e-learning technology have not been sufficiently explored, particularly in developing countries. Although many e-learning acceptance models do exist, the research on a user experience (UX)-based e-learning acceptance model is still lacking. As UX is one of the crucial factors for the acceptance of an e-learning portal, this research study aims to develop and validate a UX-based e-learning acceptance framework for sustainable higher education. In this connection, a web-based responsive e-learning portal for university students has been developed. The portal can be accessed from anywhere, at any time, and on any device, making the learning sustainable. The UX-based e-learning acceptance framework is developed by integrating the selected constructs of a widely accepted UX model, technology acceptance model (TAM), and four well-known constructs from various technology acceptance models. The constructs are appeal, pleasure, satisfaction, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, information quality, self-efficacy, social influence, benefits, and behavioral intention, which can predict the intentions of the students for acceptance of the e-learning portal. The data were collected from 650 university students using online and manual questionnaires. After data screening, 513 valid responses were further analyzed using structural equation modeling. According to the results, the framework fits the data well. The constructs satisfaction, perceived ease of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["2245"]}
