{"title": "Proactive control of approximate programs\n", "abstract": " Approximate computing trades off accuracy of results for resources such as energy or computing time. There is a large and rapidly growing literature on approximate computing that has focused mostly on showing the benefits of approximate computing. However, we know relatively little about how to control approximation in a disciplined way. In this paper, we address the problem of controlling approximation for non-streaming programs that have a set of \"knobs\" that can be dialed up or down to control the level of approximation of different components in the program. We formulate this control problem as a constrained optimization problem, and describe a system called Capri that uses machine learning to learn cost and error models for the program, and uses these models to determine, for a desired level of approximation, knob settings that optimize metrics such as running time or energy usage.

{"title": "Structure-driven optimizations for amorphous data-parallel programs\n", "abstract": " Irregular algorithms are organized around pointer-based data structures such as graphs and trees, and they are ubiquitous in applications. Recent work by the Galois project has provided a systematic approach for parallelizing irregular applications based on the idea of optimistic or speculative execution of programs. However, the overhead of optimistic parallel execution can be substantial. In this paper, we show that many irregular algorithms have structure that can be exploited and present three key optimizations that take advantage of algorithmic structure to reduce speculative overheads. We describe the implementation of these optimizations in the Galois system and present experimental results to demonstrate their benefits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first system to exploit algorithmic structure to optimize the execution of irregular programs.", "num_citations": "78\n", "authors": ["714"]}
{"title": "Exploiting the commutativity lattice\n", "abstract": " Speculative execution is a promising approach for exploiting parallelism in many programs, but it requires efficient schemes for detecting conflicts between concurrently executing threads. Prior work has argued that checking semantic commutativity of method invocations is the right way to detect conflicts for complex data structures such as kd-trees. Several ad hoc ways of checking commutativity have been proposed in the literature, but there is no systematic approach for producing implementations.", "num_citations": "60\n", "authors": ["714"]}
{"title": "Scalable and memory-efficient clustering of large-scale social networks\n", "abstract": " Clustering of social networks is an important task for their analysis, however, most existing algorithms do not scale to the massive size of today\u00e2s social networks. A popular class of graph clustering algorithms for large-scale networks, such as PMetis, KMetis and Graclus, is based on a multilevel framework. Generally, these multilevel algorithms work reasonably well on networks with a few million vertices. However, when the network size increases to the scale of 10 million vertices or greater, the performance of these algorithms rapidly degrades. Furthermore, an inherent property of social networks, the power law degree distribution, makes these algorithms infeasible to apply to large-scale social networks. In this paper, we propose a scalable and memory-efficient clustering algorithm for large-scale social networks.

{"title": "Amorphous data-parallelism in irregular algorithms\n", "abstract": " Most client-side applications running on multicore processors are likely to be irregular programs that deal with complex, pointerbased data structures such as large sparse graphs and trees. However, we understand very little about the nature of parallelism in irregular algorithms, let alone how to exploit it effectively on multicore processors.In this paper, we show that, although the behavior of irregular algorithms can be very complex, many of them have a generalized data-parallelism that we call amorphous data-parallelism. The algorithms in our study come from a variety of important disciplines such as data-mining, AI, compilers, networks, and scientific computing. We also argue that these algorithms can be divided naturally into a small number of categories, and that this categorization provides a lot of insight into their behavior. Finally, we discuss how these insights should guide programming language support and parallel system implementation for irregular algorithms.", "num_citations": "37\n", "authors": ["714"]}
{"title": "Parallel graph partitioning on multicore architectures\n", "abstract": " Graph partitioning is a common and frequent preprocessing step in many high-performance parallel applications on distributed- and shared-memory architectures. It is used to distribute graphs across memory and to improve spatial locality. There are several parallel implementations of graph partitioning for distributed-memory architectures.             In this paper, we present a parallel graph partitioner that implements a variation of the Metis partitioner for shared-memory, multicore architectures. We show that (1) the parallelism in this algorithm is an instance of the general amorphous data-parallelism pattern, and (2) a parallel implementation can be derived systematically from a sequential specification of the algorithm. The resulting program can be executed in parallel using the Galois system for optimistic parallelization. The scalability of this parallel implementation compares favorably with that of a publicly\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "35\n", "authors": ["714"]}
{"title": "Parallel clustered low-rank approximation of graphs and its application to link prediction\n", "abstract": " Social network analysis has become a major research area that has impact in diverse applications ranging from search engines to product recommendation systems. A major problem in implementing social network analysis algorithms is the sheer size of many social networks, for example, the Facebook graph has more than 900 million vertices and even small networks may have tens of millions of vertices. One solution to dealing with these large graphs is dimensionality reduction using spectral or SVD analysis of the adjacency matrix of the network, but these global techniques do not necessarily take into account local structures or clusters of the network that are critical in network analysis. A more promising approach is clustered low-rank approximation: instead of computing a global low-rank approximation, the adjacency matrix is first clustered, and then a low-rank approximation of each cluster (i.e\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["714"]}

Then an algorithm is proposed, which selectd from the binary tree the significative nodes as topics implying concepts of domain interests. Lastly, the Chinese generic ontology, HowNet, is introduced to evolve the topics (together with their hierarchical structures) into domain ontology.
