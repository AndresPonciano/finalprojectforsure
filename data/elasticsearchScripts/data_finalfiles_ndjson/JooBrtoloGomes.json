{"title": "Scalable real-time classification of data streams with concept drift\n", "abstract": " Inducing adaptive predictive models in real-time from high throughput data streams is one of the most challenging areas of Big Data Analytics. The fact that data streams may contain concept drifts (changes of the pattern encoded in the stream over time) and are unbounded, imposes unique challenges in comparison with predictive data mining from batch data. Several real-time predictive data stream algorithms exist, however, most approaches are not naturally parallel and thus limited in their scalability. This paper highlights the Micro-Cluster Nearest Neighbour (MC-NN) data stream classifier. MC-NN is based on statistical summaries of the data stream and a nearest neighbour approach, which makes MC-NN naturally parallel. In its serial version MC-NN is able to handle data streams, the data does not need to reside in memory and is processed incrementally. MC-NN is also able to adapt to concept drifts.

Our features include both the original driver factors as well as some derived features. We evaluated our features on the imbalance corrected dataset, i.e. under-sampled dataset and compare a large number of existing machine learning tools, especially decision tree-based classifiers, for predicting the churners and win-backs. In general, we find RandomForest and SimpleCart learning algorithms generally perform well and tend to provide us with highly competitive prediction performance.

{"title": "Fast adaptive real-time classification for data streams with concept drift\n", "abstract": " An important application of Big Data Analytics is the real-time analysis of streaming data. Streaming data imposes unique challenges to data mining algorithms, such as concept drifts, the need to analyse the data on the fly due to unbounded data streams and scalable algorithms due to potentially high throughput of data. Real-time classification algorithms that are adaptive to concept drifts and fast exist, however, most approaches are not naturally parallel and are thus limited in their scalability. This paper presents work on the Micro-Cluster Nearest Neighbour (MC-NN) classifier. MC-NN is based on an adaptive statistical data summary based on Micro-Clusters. MC-NN is very fast and adaptive to concept drift whilst maintaining the parallel properties of the base KNN classifier. Also MC-NN is competitive compared with existing data stream classifiers in terms of accuracy and speed.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1078"]}

By analyzing it one can find mobility patterns of most of the population thus leading to efficient urban planning, disease and traffic control, etc. But its granularity is low as the latitude and longitude (lat-lon) of a cell tower is used as the current location of all mobile phones that are connected to the cell tower at that time. Granularity can range between 10s of metres to several kms depending on population density of a locality. This is one reason why, although there are many existing systems on visualizing mobility of people based on GPS data, there is hardly any existing system for CDR. We develop a Mobility Visualization System (MoVis) for visualizing mobility of people from their CDR records.

Its implementation and evaluation phases have been oriented to solve the spam detection problem, taking into account that it is a real-world situation where concepts (spam patterns) may reappear. The possibility of detecting recurring drifts allows to reuse previously learnt models, enhancing the overall learning process specifically in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Consequently, in this paper we propose the Meta-Model Drift Detector (MM-DD). The proposed system is able to deal with the underlying context that results from the drifts detected throughout the data stream learning process. In order to do so, a meta-model is trained in parallel to the learning process. While the learning process of the base classifier is feeding the meta-model with all the context information when a drift occurs, the later is able to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1078"]}

Several methods have been proposed to learn in the presence of concept drift, but few consider recurring concepts and context integration. To address these issues, we presented a method that stores previously learned models along with context information of that learning period. When concepts recur, the appropriate model is reused, avoiding relearning a previously seen concept. In this work, in order to model the vagueness and uncertainty associated with context, we propose the inference of high-level fuzzy contexts from fuzzy logic rules, where the conditions result from fuzzified context inputs.
