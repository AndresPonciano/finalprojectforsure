{"title": "PANFIS: A novel incremental learning machine\n", "abstract": " Most of the dynamics in real-world systems are compiled by shifts and drifts, which are uneasy to be overcome by omnipresent neuro-fuzzy systems. Nonetheless, learning in nonstationary environment entails a system owning high degree of flexibility capable of assembling its rule base autonomously according to the degree of nonlinearity contained in the system. In practice, the rule growing and pruning are carried out merely benefiting from a small snapshot of the complete training data to truncate the computational load and memory demand to the low level. An exposure of a novel algorithm, namely parsimonious network based on fuzzy inference system (PANFIS), is to this end presented herein.

We therefore propose an incremental rule splitting concept for generalized fuzzy rules in order to autonomously compensate these negative effects of gradual drifts.

In this paper, we propose a new Deep Transformation Method (DTM) that extracts the discriminant latent feature space from rsfMRI and projects it in the subsequent layer for classification of rs-fMRI data. The hidden transformation layer in DTM projects the original rs-fMRI data into a new space using the learning policy and extracts the spatio-temporal correlations of the functional activities as a latent feature space. The subsequent convolution and decision layers transform the latent feature space into high-level features and provide accurate classification. The performance of DTM has been evaluated using the ADHD200 rs-fMRI benchmark data with crossvalidation. The results show that the proposed DTM achieves a mean classification accuracy of 70.36% and an improvement of 8.25% on the state of the art methodologies was observed.

However, in a practical scenario, it is quite natural that the data labels are available only after some temporal lag. This paper explores how a stream classifier model can be made adaptive to such label latency scenario. We propose SkipE-RNN, a self-evolutionary recurrent neural network with dynamically evolving skipped-recurrent-connection for the best utilization of previously observed label information while classifying the current data. When the data label is unavailable, SkipE-RNN uses an auto-learned mapping function to find the best match from the already known data labels and updates the network parameter accordingly. Later, upon availability of true data label, if the previously mapped label is found to be incorrect, SkipE-RNN employs a regularization technique along with the parameter updating process, so as to penalize the model. In addition, SkipE-RNN has inborn power of self-adjusting the network capacity by growing/pruning hidden nodes to cope with the evolving nature of data stream. Rigorous empirical evaluations using synthetic as well as real-world datasets reveal effectiveness of SkipE-RNN in both finitely delayed and infinitely delayed data label scenarios.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1075"]}

{"title": "Online bagging of evolving fuzzy systems\n", "abstract": " Evolving fuzzy systems (EFS) have received increased attention from the community for the purpose of data stream modeling in an incremental, single-pass and transparent manner. To date, a wide variety of EFS approaches have been developed and successfully used in real-world applications which address structural evolution and parameter adaptation in single EFS models. We propose a specific ensemble scheme of EFS to increase their robustness in predictive performance on new stream samples. Our approach relies on an online variant of bagging in which various EFS ensemble members are generated from online bags, that is, the members are updated based on a specific probabilistic online sampling technique, and this with guaranteed convergence to classical sampling in batch bagging. The autonomous pruning of ensemble members is undertaken to omit undesired members with atypically higher\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1075"]}

This issue raises strong demand for automated real-time quality monitoring developed from data-driven approaches thus alleviating from operator dependence and adapting to various process uncertainties. Nonetheless, current approaches do not take into account the streaming nature of sensory information while relying heavily on handcrafted features making them application-specific. This paper proposes the online quality monitoring methodology developed from recently developed deep learning algorithms for data streams, Neural Networks with Dynamically Evolved Capacity (NADINE), namely NADINE++.

{"title": "Continual learning via inter-task synaptic mapping\n", "abstract": " Learning from streaming tasks leads a model to catastrophically erase unique experiences it absorbs from previous episodes. While regularization techniques such as LWF, SI, EWC have proven themselves as an effective avenue to overcome this issue by constraining important parameters of old tasks from changing when accepting new concepts, these approaches do not exploit common information of each task which can be shared to existing neurons. As a result, they do not scale well to large-scale problems since the parameter importance variables quickly explode. An Inter-Task Synaptic Mapping (ISYANA) is proposed here to underpin knowledge retention for continual learning. ISYANA combines task-to-neuron relationship as well as concept-to-concept relationship such that it prevents a neuron to embrace distinct concepts while merely accepting relevant concept.

Each mission may require the robot to conduct a different task. A conventional learning approach can handle these variations when the system is trained for similar tasks in a representative environment. However, it may result in overfitting to the new data stream or the failure to adapt, leading to degradation or a potential crash. These problems can be mitigated with an excessive amount of data and embedded model, but the computational power and the memory of the aerial robots are limited.

However, the existing machine learning models for TCM are mostly offline and not suitable for the non-stationary environment of the machining settings. Moreover, the access of the ground truth always imposes a shutdown of the machining process and the existing models are severely affected by such delay in receiving labelled samples. In order to tackle these issues, we propose SERMON as a novel learning model based on a pair of self-evolving mutually-operative recurrent neural networks.
