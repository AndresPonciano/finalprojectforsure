{"title": "BrainGrid+ Workbench: High-performance/high-quality neural simulation\n", "abstract": " Availability of affordable hardware that in effect enables desktop supercomputing has enabled more ambitious neural simulations driven by more complex software. However, this opportunity comes with costs, in terms of long learning curves to take advantage of the performance possibilities of idiosyncratic, architecturally heterogenous hardware and decreasing ability to be confident in the quality of simulation results. This paper describes a new neural simulation and software/data provenance framework that reduces the difficulty of taking full advantage of GPU computing and increases investigator confidence that simulations results are valid.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["2265"]}
{"title": "A multi-level funneling approach to data provenance reconstruction\n", "abstract": " When data are retrieved from a file storage system or the Internet, is there information about their provenance (i.e., their origin or history)? It is possible that data could have been copied from another source and then transformed. Often, provenance is not readily available for data sets created in the past. Solving such a problem is the motivation behind the 2014 Provenance Reconstruction Challenge. This challenge is aimed at recovering lost provenance for two data sets: one data set (WikiNews articles) in which a list of possible sources has been provided, and another data set (files from GitHub repositories) in which the file sources are not provided. To address this challenge, we present a multi-level funneling approach to provenance reconstruction, a technique that incorporates text processing techniques from different disciplines to approximate the provenance of a given data set. We built three prototypes using\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["2265"]}
{"title": "Towards Recovering Provenance with Experiment Explorer\n", "abstract": " In this work, we present Experiment Explorer (EE), a framework for recovering provenance that uses provenancecompatible research processes and a lightweight, user-friendly metadata search tool. EE facilitates the capture of recovered provenance and file relationships and incorporates new files to support provenance recovery over time. Our case study at a research laboratory suggests that EE is effective in connecting distributed provenance information and in increasing the accessibility of related experiment files. Our scalability analysis also indicates that EE\u2019s tool support can scale to hundreds of thousands of heterogeneous files.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["2265"]}
{"title": "Experiment explorer: Lightweight provenance search over metadata\n", "abstract": " Scientific experiments typically produce a plethora of files in the form of intermediate data or experimental results. As the project grows in scale, there is an increased need for tools and techniques that link together relevant experimental artifacts, especially if the files are heterogeneous and distributed across multiple locations. Current provenance and search techniques, however, fall short in efficiently retrieving experiment-related files, presumably because they are not tailored towards the common use cases of researchers. In this position paper, we propose Experiment Explorer, a lightweight and efficient approach that takes advantage of metadata to retrieve and visualize relevant experiment-related files.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["2265"]}
{"title": "Data provenance for multi-agent models\n", "abstract": " Multi-agent simulations are useful for exploring collective patterns of individual behavior in social, biological, economic, network, and physical systems. However, there is no provenance support for multi-agent models (MAMs) in a distributed setting. To this end, we introduce ProvMASS, a novel approach to capture provenance of MAMs in a distributed memory by combining inter-process identification, lightweight coordination of in-memory provenance storage, and adaptive provenance capture. ProvMASS is built on top of the Multi-Agent Spatial Simulation (MASS) library, a framework that combines multi-agent systems with large-scale fine-grained agent-based models, or MAMs. Unlike other environments supporting MAMs, MASS parallelizes simulations with distributed memory, where agents and spatial data are shared application resources. We evaluate our approach with provenance queries to support three\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["2265"]}
{"title": "WIP: provenance support for interdisciplinary research on the North Creek Wetlands\n", "abstract": " Researchers working in the North Creek Wetlands are faced with the task of gathering and managing large amounts of data. This interdisciplinary group of researchers also require data provenance to ensure the integrity of their collected data. Currently, they record notes in the wetlands with pen and paper, transcribe these notes, and combine them with the other data they collected, such as spatial and image data. This process is error-prone and can be time consuming. Current provenance techniques also do not focus on supporting provenance from data collection to data processing and do not provide a flexible means of capturing provenance across different software tools and platforms. Our technique and our tool support, ProvEco System, leverages various technologies such as mobile devices, an off-the-shelf geographic information system software, an enterprise-level search facility, and open data standards\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["2265"]}
{"title": "Uncovering file relationships using association mining and topic modeling\n", "abstract": " Software maintenance tasks, such as feature enhancements and bug fixes, require familiarity with the entire software system. A modification task could become very time consuming if there is no prior knowledge of the system. Association mining has been used to identify the files that frequently change together in a software repository, and this information can aid a software engineer locate relevant files for a maintenance task. However, association mining techniques are limited to the amount of project history stored in a software repository. We address this difficulty by using a technique that combines association mining with topic modeling, referred to as Frequent Pattern Growth with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (FP-LDA). Topic modeling aims to uncover file relationships by learning semantic topics from source files. We validated our technique via case studies on two open source projects. Our results indicate that topic modeling can increase the effectiveness of association mining in uncovering the file relationships.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["2265"]}
{"title": "Data Provenance for Agent-Based Models in a Distributed Memory\n", "abstract": " Agent-Based Models (ABMs) assist with studying emergent collective behavior of individual entities in social, biological, economic, network, and physical systems. Data provenance can support ABM by explaining individual agent behavior. However, there is no provenance support for ABMs in a distributed setting. The Multi-Agent Spatial Simulation (MASS) library provides a framework for simulating ABMs at fine granularity, where agents and spatial data are shared application resources in a distributed memory. We introduce a novel approach to capture ABM provenance in a distributed memory, called ProvMASS. We evaluate our technique with traditional data provenance queries and performance measures. Our results indicate that a configurable approach can capture provenance that explains coordination of distributed shared resources, simulation logic, and agent behavior while limiting performance overhead. We also show the ability to support practical analyses (eg, agent tracking) and storage requirements for different capture configurations.

{"title": "Software and Data Provenance in Computational Neuroscience Research\n", "abstract": " The wide variety of data and the exploratory nature of data analysis in computational neuroscience research require management of both software (ie, analysis modules or function objects) and data. Current neuroinformatics techniques focus on managing data. Meanwhile, though some data provenance techniques connect the output files with the analysis modules, they fall short in providing an understanding of the changes that co-occur in both software and data. In this paper, we present the BrainGrid Workbench, which enables computational neuroscientists to explicitly capture software and data provenance throughout an entire simulation lifecycle. Initial results indicate that our technique is feasible to use and imposes minimal performance overhead.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2265"]}
