Calculations were performed for a tank in forced motions at different frequencies, for which experimental results were available. The tank had a dividing wall with an opening. The overall behaviour of the force time history was well captured with the pendulum model. In particular at lower frequency the agreement of the force range is very good. Some small force peaks due to the sloshing were predicted in a good correspondence with the CFD simulations. At a higher frequency slight discrepancy is shown also in the CFD calculations.

{"title": "The influence of hydrodynamic assumptions on ship maneuvering\n", "abstract": " We present a preliminary assessment on the influence of the hydrodynamic assumptions associated with ship motions, for vessels maneuvering in calm waters. Three approaches are considered:(a) Model 1 idealising the maneuvering of a ship in 3-dof as per Brix (1993);(b) Model 2 representing the 6-dof hybrid time domain unified seakeeping/maneuvering model of Matusiak (2017); and (c) Model 3-idealising combined seakeeping and maneuvering nonlinear characteristics in 6-dof by the time domain Green function method of McTaggart (2005). Simulations of turning circle and zig-zag manoeuvers are assessed and compared against available data for two tankers (KVLCC2 & Esso Osaka) and a container ship (DTC). It is concluded that in calm waters simplified models with hydrodynamic derivatives from either RANSE CFD or model tests can be used.

{"title": "Time accurate simulation of a plunger type wave maker using unstructured finite volume solver with surface tracking\n", "abstract": " As a part of a wave maker renewal project unstructured, time accurate, finite volume method has been used for a wave maker design problem. The performance of different wedge angles for a plunger type wave maker have been compared in terms of the height and quality of the generated wave. A verification and validation has first been performed using the wave radiation benchmark case of the ISOPE Numerical Wave Tank Group and simulation of the plunger type wave maker of the Ship Laboratory of Helsinki University of Technology. Trends of the harmonic components of the wave profile and hydrodynamic force with different frequencies and amplitudes agree well with the measurements. In the design problem three wedges with angles 25, 35 and 45 degrees have been considered. The results show that the wedge angle has considerable effect on the wave height as well as the wave quality. Increasing wedge angle increases the wave height, but at the same time the fluctuations of the asymmetries of the wave profile increase. The motion frequency has also a significant influence on the wave quality. Due to its overall performance the 35 degree wedge has been chosen for the new wave maker and a further analysis to estimate the requirements for the driving mechanism has been performed.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1428"]}

This is a logical consequence of the absurdity of building models in full scale and the long computing times needed for numerical simulations at full-scale Reynolds numbers. The problem regarding the predictions at model-scale Reynolds numbers is that the viscous effects of the actual ship-water interaction in full scale become overestimated.Only within the recent years the increased computing capacities have enabled computations of viscous ship flows in full scale. One significant contribution to study the possibilities of the numerical ship-flow simulations has been given by the European Union project European Full-Scale Flow Research and Technology, EFFORT.

{"title": "Simulation of Unsteady Free Surface Flows\u2013Code Verification and Discretisation Error\n", "abstract": " In this work a numerical method for the solution of unsteady, inviscid free surface flows is developed. The method is verified and the behaviour of the error related to the numerical method, as the discretisation is refined, is studied in detail. The work divides into two distinct parts. The first one focuses on the development of the solution method. The method is based on unstructured, two dimensional finite volume method. The free surface boundary conditions are satisfied on the instantaneous free surface and the computational grid tracks the deformation of the surface. Typically, in comparable methods the flow and free surface solutions are solved by time integrating the governing equations in two separate stages, which are iterated. The decoupling of the solutions limits the allowable time step in the integration, which makes the approach computationally expensive. In this work two different approaches are presented for the coupling of the solutions, which relax the time step restriction. The approaches that are proposed differ significantly from the coupling approaches presented previously in the literature in that the implementation into the existing pressure correction type solvers is straightforward. The second part concentrates on the verification of the implementation of the numerical method, i.e. on code verification, and on the investigation of the error related to the discretisation of the continuous problem. In both cases, the analysis is based on the method of manufactured solutions (MMS), in which the governing equations are modified, so that the modified equations have a desired analytical solution.

{"title": "Development of an unstructured pressure-correction solver based on triangle meshes\n", "abstract": " In the recent years a lot of effort has been put in the development of computational methods for viscous ship flow calculations. The methods used have almost exlusively been based on structured grids. However, within the field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in general, the interest in unstructured methods has been constantly increasing. The difference between these two alternatives is in the structure and indexing of the division of the computational domain into finite elements. In the case of a structured approach, the computational grid can be projected into a cartesian grid with a continous mapping, that preserves the structured ordering of the elements relative to each other. By knowing the index of an element we hence know the indeces of its neighbours as well. With unstructured grid, on the other hand, the ordering of the elements is arbitrary and thus the grid does not have any well-defined structure. It is therefore not possible to deduce the indeces of the neighbouring cells from the structure of the grid. Both structured and unstructured grid based methods have their respective advantages and disadvantages. Due to the nature of the linear equation systems arising from the use of structured grids, the numerical solution methods for these are very efficient compared to the ones for unstructured grids. On the other hand, grid generation, especially for complex geometries, has become a bottle-neck in the solution process using structured methods. The drawbacks related to structured grids have been emphasized in case of complex hull forms with the deforming grid based surface tracking method used at Ship Laboratory for free surface\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1428"]}
{"title": "Development of vertical second harmonic wave loads of a large cruise ship in short and steep head waves\n", "abstract": " The reliable prediction of springing excitation requires a detailed understanding of the origin of exciting wave loads. This study clarifies the origin of the second harmonic wave loads that can excite the springing of a large cruise ship (roughly 300\u00a0m long) in short and steep head waves. The findings are based on the analysis of previously validated numerical simulations (RANS-VOF) of the flow around a rigid hull. The accumulation of the loading is presented both along the length and the depth of the hull. The results show that the second harmonic vertical loading originates mainly in the foremost part of the ship, where the whole depth of the hull matters. The analysis focuses on the effect of the phase and the amplitude of second harmonic local loading. The irregular variation of the phase of the local loading with respect to that of the freely propagating wave demonstrates a serious deformation of the waves\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1428"]}

{"title": "On time accurate kinematic boundary condition in surface tracking context\n", "abstract": " In the following, the numerical implementation of time accurate, kinematic free surface boundary condition for a surface tracking flow solver has been studied. Kinematic boundary condition states, that the velocities of the surface and the particles on the surface have to match. Hence, the implementation can be divided into two parts: the discretization of the normal component of the particle velocity on the free surface and the discretization of the velocity of the bounding surface. The former constitutes the steady state part of the equation, whereas the latter has, in principle, signifigance only in time accurate simulations, as in steady state the velocity of the surface vanishes. It is known from several reports, that special measures may be required to ensure a stable discretization of the steady state part of the kinematic boundary condition. In this paper it will be shown, that the implementation of the boundary velocity may in some cases affect the stability of the method as well.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1428"]}
{"title": "Time accurate simulation of free surface flows in 2D using unstructured grids\n", "abstract": " Within the field of computational marine hydrodynamics, there is a growing interest in time dependent flows. Several examples of such flows exist, eg unsteady flows around blunt bodies, wave generation of bodies in motion as well as motions and loads of bodies due to waves to name just a few. At the same time, the complexity of the geometries and motions considered is also increasing, setting limits to the applicability of some of the current methods.A few years ago, a long term basic research on unstructured FVM for the simulation of complex, time dependent free surface flows was started at the Ship Laboratory. First phase of the project focused on the development of a basic 2D flow solver for steady flows without free surface.[7] In the second phase, the emphasis was on the inclusion of the free surface.[9] Recently, the method has been extended for unsteady free surface flows. At the same time, a possibility to model boundaries following a predefined movement was implemented in the solver. This included some necessary improvements to the free surface and boundary geometry treatments as well. The abstract discusses these recently added features, namely the implementation of time accurate solution of the bulk flow and free surface problems as well as the current grid updating routine.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1428"]}
{"title": "Development and application of an unstructured finite volume solver for free surface flows in 2D\n", "abstract": " Within the field of ship research, viscous free surface flows have commonly been solved using surface tracking methods based on structured boundary fitted grids. Due to the use of structured grids, these methods are, however, not very well suited for cases involving complex geometries and large deformations of the free surface. Unstructured methods, having the capability to cope also with geometrical complexities, are therefore a more suitable choice for these kind of cases. An equally important feature of unstructured grids is adaptivity, ie the possibility to regenerate the grid locally during the solution process without affecting the rest of the grid. The purpose of the on-going research at Helsinki University of Technology Shiplaboratory is the development of an unstructured, finite volume flow solver for free surface flows with surface tracking, adaptive grid reconstruction. The first part of the work was the development of a basic laminar 2D solver without free surface for triangles based on the pressure correction method.[8] In this paper the solver is extended for free surface flows with emphasis on the coupling of free surface solution and pressure correction method. Two approaches for the solution of the free surface deformation, with partial coupling to the bulk flow solution, are presented. As the interest is on the free surface solution approach, only Eulerian flow is considered.
