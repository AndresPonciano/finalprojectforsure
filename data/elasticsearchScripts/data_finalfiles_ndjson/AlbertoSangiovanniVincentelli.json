{"title": "Logic minimization algorithms for VLSI synthesis\n", "abstract": " The roots of the project which culminates with the writing of this book can be traced to the work on logic synthesis started in 1979 at the IBM Watson Research Center and at University of California, Berkeley. During the preliminary phases of these projects, the impor tance of logic minimization for the synthesis of area and performance effective circuits clearly emerged. In 1980, Richard Newton stirred our interest by pointing out new heuristic algorithms for two-level logic minimization and the potential for improving upon existing approaches. In the summer of 1981, the authors organized and participated in a seminar on logic manipulation at IBM Research. One of the goals of the seminar was to study the literature on logic minimization and to look at heuristic algorithms from a fundamental and comparative point of view. The fruits of this investigation were surprisingly abundant: it was apparent from an initial implementation of recursive logic minimiza tion (ESPRESSO-I) that, if we merged our new results into a two-level minimization program, an important step forward in automatic logic synthesis could result. ESPRESSO-II was born and an APL implemen tation was created in the summer of 1982. The results of preliminary tests on a fairly large set of industrial examples were good enough to justify the publication of our algorithms. It is hoped that the strength and speed of our minimizer warrant its Italian name, which denotes both express delivery and a specially-brewed black coffee.", "num_citations": "2232\n", "authors": ["1859"]}

Examining the problem of computing steady-state solutions in this context has led to a collection of novel numerical algorithms which we have gathered, along with some background material, into this book. Although we wished to appeal to as broad an audience as possible, to treat the subject in depth required maintaining a narrow focus. Our compromise was to assume that the reader is familiar with basic numerical methods, such as might be found in [dahlquist74] or [vlach83], but not assume any specialized knowledge of methods for steady-state problems. Although we focus on algorithms for computing steady-state solutions of analog and microwave circuits, the methods herein are general in nature and may find use in other disciplines. A number of new algorithms are presented, the contributions primarily centering around new approaches to harmonic balance and mixed frequency-time methods. These methods are described, along with appropriate background material, in what we hope is a reasonably satisfying blend of theory, practice, and results.

{"title": "Minimizing production test time to detect faults in analog circuits\n", "abstract": " Analog testing is a difficult task without a clearcut methodology. Analog circuits are tested for satisfying their specifications, not for faults. Given the high cost of testing analog specifications, it is proposed that tests for analog circuits should be designed to detect faults. Therefore analog fault modeling is discussed. Based on an analysis of the types of tests needed for different types of faults, algorithms for fault-driven test set selection are presented. A major reduction in testing time should come from reducing the number of specification tests that need to be performed. Hence algorithms are presented for minimizing specification testing time. After specification testing time is minimized, the resulting test sets are supplemented with some simple, possibly non-specification, tests to achieve 100% fault coverage. Examples indicate that fault-driven test set development can lead to drastic reductions in production testing time.< >", "num_citations": "232\n", "authors": ["1859"]}

A fast heuristic algorithm is used to obtain an initial sizing of the circuit and convert the transistor sizing problem into a nonlinear optimization problem.

To cope with the nondifferentiability of the circuit delays, the concept of generalized gradients is proposed to compute the delay sensitivities. Experiments justify the use of this sensitivity computation technique and show that the approach is a good compromise between the speed of the heuristic algorithm and the power of mathematical programming.< >", "num_citations": "212\n", "authors": ["1859"]}
{"title": "Analysis and simulation of noise in nonlinear electronic circuits and systems\n", "abstract": " In electronic circuit and system design, the word noise is used to refer to any undesired excitation on the system. In other contexts, noise is also used to refer to signals or excitations which exhibit chaotic or random behavior. The source of noise can be either internal or external to the system. For instance, the thermal and shot noise generated within integrated circuit devices are in ternal noise sources, and the noise picked up from the environment through electromagnetic interference is an external one. Electromagnetic interference can also occur between different components of the same system. In integrated circuits (Ies), signals in one part of the system can propagate to the other parts of the same system through electromagnetic coupling, power supply lines and the Ie substrate. For instance, in a mixed-signal Ie, the switching activity in the digital parts of the circuit can adversely affect the performance of the analog section of the circuit by traveling through the power supply lines and the substrate. Prediction of the effect of these noise sources on the performance of an electronic system is called noise analysis or noise simulation. A methodology for the noise analysis or simulation of an electronic system usually has the following four components: 2 NOISE IN NONLINEAR ELECTRONIC CIRCUITS\u2022 Mathematical representations or models for the noise sources.\u2022 Mathematical model or representation for the system that is under the in fluence of the noise sources.", "num_citations": "208\n", "authors": ["1859"]}

{"title": "Algorithms for synthesis and testing of asynchronous circuits\n", "abstract": " Since the second half of the 1980s asynchronous circuits have been the subject of a great deal of research following a period of relative oblivion. The lack of interest in asynchronous techniques was motivated by the progressive shift towards synchronous design techniques that had much more structure and were much easier to verify and synthesize. System design requirements made it impossible to eliminate totally the use of asynchronous circuits. Given the objective difficulty encountered by designers, the asynchronous components of electronic systems such as interfaces became a serious bottleneck in the design process. The use of new models and some theoretical breakthroughs made it possible to develop asynchronous design techniques that were reliable and effective. This book describes a variety of mathematical models and of algorithms that form the backbone and the body of a new design methodology for asyn chronous design. The book is intended for asynchronous hardware designers, for computer-aided tool experts, and for digital designers interested in ex ploring the possibility of designing asynchronous circuits.

This paper presents two methodologies to handle model uncertainty for building MPC.

Second, we propose a robust model predictive control (RMPC) formulation to make a building controller robust to model uncertainties. The results from these two approaches are compared with those from a nominal MPC and a common building rule based control (RBC). The results are then used to develop a methodology for selecting a controller type (i.e. RMPC, MPC, or RBC) as a function of building model uncertainty.

It is both efficient and accurate. Unlike previous attempts to solve this problem, the new algorithm does not constrain the input frequencies and uses the theoretical minimum number of time points. Also presented is a particularly simple derivation of harmonic Newton (the algorithm that results when Newton's method is applied to solve the harmonic balance equations) using the APFT; this derivation uses the same matrix representation used in the derivation of the APFT. Since the APFT includes the DFT (discrete Fourier transform) as a special case, all results are applicable to both the periodic and almost-periodic forms of harmonic Newton.< >", "num_citations": "146\n", "authors": ["1859"]}

{"title": "Synthesis of finite state machines: logic optimization\n", "abstract": " Synthesis of Finite State Machines: Logic Optimization is the second in a set of two monographs devoted to the synthesis of Finite State Machines (FSMs). The first volume, Synthesis of Finite State Machines: Functional Optimization, addresses functional optimization, whereas this one addresses logic optimization. The result of functional optimization is a symbolic description of an FSM which represents a sequential function chosen from a collection of permissible candidates. Logic optimization is the body of techniques for converting a symbolic description of an FSM into a hardware implementation. The mapping of a given symbolic representation into a two-valued logic implementation is called state encoding (or state assignment) and it impacts heavily area, speed, testability and power consumption of the realized circuit. The first part of the book introduces the relevant background, presents results previously scattered in the literature on the computational complexity of encoding problems, and surveys in depth old and new approaches to encoding in logic synthesis. The second part of the book presents two main results about symbolic minimization; a new procedure to find minimal two-level symbolic covers, under face, dominance and disjunctive constraints, and a unified frame to check encodability of encoding constraints and find codes of minimum length that satisfy them. The third part of the book introduces generalized prime implicants (GPIs), which are the counterpart, in symbolic minimization of two-level logic, to prime implicants in two-valued two-level minimization.

A concurrent specification is well-suited for medium-grained partitioning. However, in order to be implemented in software, concurrent tasks need to be scheduled on a shared resource (the processor). The choice of the scheduling policy mainly depends on the specification of the system. For pure dataflow specifications, it is possible to apply a fully static scheduling technique, while for algorithms containing data-dependent control structures, like the if-then-else or while-do constructs, the dynamic behaviour of the system cannot be completely predicted at compile time and some scheduling decisions are to be made at run-time. For such applications we propose a Quasi-static scheduling (QSS) algorithm that generates a schedule in which run-time decisions are made only for data-dependent control\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "134\n", "authors": ["1859"]}

The routing regions that can be handled are very general: the boundaries can be described by any rectilinear edges, the pins can be on or inside the boundaries of the region, and the obstructions can be of any shape and size. The technique is based on an algorithm that routes the nets in the routing region incrementally and intelligently, and allows modifications and rip-up of nets when an existing shortest path is \"far\" from optimal or when no path exists.

By a clever arrangement of power/ground and signal pins, we almost completely eliminate the capacitive effects between signal wires. Additionally. We get a power and ground distribution network with a very low resistance at any point on the die. Another advantage of our scheme is that the arrangement of conductors ensures that on-chip inductances are uniformly negligible. Finally, characterization of the circuit delays, capacitances and resistances becomes extremely simple in our scheme, and needs to be done only once for a design.

In particular, crosstalk is an analog phenomenon of increasing relevance. To cope with the increasingly analog nature of highperformance digital system design, we propose using a constraintdriven methodology. In this paper we describe new constraint generation ideas incorporating digital sensitivity. In constraint-driven synthesis, we show that a fundamental subproblem of crosstalk channel routing, coupling-constrained graph levelization (CCL), is NP-complete, and develop a novel heuristic algorithm.

We address the issue of satisfying the lower bound constraints. Such a problem also arises in wave pipelining of circuits. We propose to handle short path constraints as a post processing step after traditional delay optimization techniques. There are two issues presented in this paper.

User-programmable gate arrays (field-programmable gate arrays, FPGAs) have recently emerged and are changing the way electronic systems are designed and implemented. The growing complexity of the logic circuits that can be packed onto an FPGA chip means that it has become important to have automatic synthesis tools that implement logic functions on these architectures.

{"title": "Modeling digital substrate noise injection in mixed-signal IC's\n", "abstract": " Techniques are presented to compactly represent substrate noise currents injected by digital networks. Using device-level simulation, every gate in a given library is modeled by means of the signal waveform it injects into the substrate, depending on its input transition scheme. For a given sequence of input vectors, the switching activity of every node in the Boolean network is computed. Assuming that technology mapping has been performed, each node corresponds to a gate in the library, hence, to a specific injection waveform. The noise contribution of each node is computed by convolving its switching activity with the associated injection waveforms. The total injected noise for the digital block is then obtained by summing all the noise contributions in the circuit. The resulting injected noise can be viewed as a random process, whose power spectrum is computed using standard signal processing techniques.

In this paper a new routing technique that can be applied for general two-layer detailed routing problems including switch boxes, channels and partially routed areas, is presented. The routing regions that can be handled are very general: the boundaries can be described by any rectilinear chains and the pins can be on the boundaries of the region or inside it, the obstructions can be of any shape and size.The technique is based on an algorithm that routes incrementally and intelligently the nets in the routing region and allows modifications and rip-up of nets that may impede the complete routing of other nets.

We prove that 100% delay fault testability is not necessary to guarantee the speed of a combinational circuit. There exist path delay faults which can never impact the circuit delay (computed using any correct timing analysis method) unless some other path delay faults also affect it.
