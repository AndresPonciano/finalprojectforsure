{"title": "Impact of social media usage on students academic performance in Saudi Arabia\n", "abstract": " Social media is a popular method for communication amongst university students in Saudi Arabia. However excessive social media use can raise questions about whether academic performance is affected. This research explores this question by conducting a survey on university students in Saudi Arabia in regards to social media usage and their academic performance. The survey also explored which social network is the most popular amongst Saudi students, what students thought about their social media usage and factors besides social media usage which negatively affect academic performance.The survey received 108 responses and descriptive statistics including normality tests i.e. scatter plots were used to examine the relationship between the average number of hours students spent of social media a week and GPA scores of the students.

The historical perspective presented in the last two decades suggests that it has not been so successful due to the security and privacy flaws observed over time. This paper suggests a framework by using effective hashing techniques to ensure the security of the data. The concept of block creation and block sealing is introduced in this paper. The introduction of a block sealing concept helps in making the blockchain adjustable to meet the need of the polling process. The use of consortium blockchain is suggested, which ensures that the blockchain is owned by a governing body (e.g., election commission), and no unauthorized access can be made from outside. The framework proposed in this paper discusses the effectiveness of the polling process, hashing algorithms' utility\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "78\n", "authors": ["419"]}

The detection of such attacks demands an adaptive and incremental learning classifier capable of accurate decision making with less computation. Hence, the DDoS attack detection using existing machine learning techniques requires full data set to be stored in the memory and are not appropriate for real-time network traffic. To overcome these shortcomings, Very Fast Decision Tree (VFDT) algorithm has been proposed in the past that can handle high speed streaming data efficiently. Whilst considering the data generated by WBAN sensors, noise is an obvious aspect that severely affects the accuracy and increases false alarms. In this paper, an enhanced VFDT (EVFDT) is proposed to efficiently detect the occurrence of DDoS attack in cloud-assisted WBAN. EVFDT uses an adaptive tie-breaking threshold for node splitting. To resolve the tree size expansion under extreme noise, a lightweight iterative pruning technique is proposed. To analyze the performance of EVFDT, four metrics are evaluated: classification accuracy, tree size, time, and memory. Simulation results show that EVFDT attains significantly high detection accuracy with fewer false alarms.", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["419"]}

There are many social networking products available and they are widely used for social interaction. As the amount of threading data is growing, producing analysis from this large volume of communications is becoming increasingly difficult for public and private organisations. One of the important applications of this work is to determine the trends in social networks that depend on identifying relationships between members of a community. This is not a trivial task as it has numerous challenges. Information shared between social members does not have a formal data structure but is transmitted in the form of texts, emoticons, and multimedia. The inspiration for addressing this area is that if a company is advertising a sports product, for example, it has a difficulty in identifying targeted samples of Arab people on social networks who are interested in sports. In order to accomplish this, an experiment oriented approach is adopted in this study. A goal for this company is to discover users who have been interacting with other users who have the same interests, so they can receive the same type of message or advertisement. This information will help a company to determine how to develop advertisements based on Arab people\u2019s interests.

A project manager must decide how to handle them as any delay requires some action on the part of manager. The choices of software project managers are rather limited. First of all, right engineering talent can help. Thus temporarily reassigning senior engineers to a part of project that is suffering can be a viable option. Another option is requirement scrubbing as sometimes requirements are not essential and hence not needed. Therefore, such unnecessary requirements must be cut off.

By centralizing the network state in control layer, SDN architecture makes it easier to define and enforce consistent policies across the network. By separating data plane from control plane, dynamic requirements of complex networks can be easily manage through SDN. For future networks, SDN is already playing a significant role. SDN offers robustness, flexibility, vendor's independent platform and consistent policies across the network. In this article, we analyze different Input-Output (IO) buffering strategies which effect flow control blocking in SDN. We evaluate the performance of three different IO buffering strategies: single buffering, double buffering and ring buffering. Analyses of three IO buffering strategies are carried out in terms of two network parameters: latency and packet delivery ratio (PDR). Our results show that in terms of latency, ring buffering performs much better than single and double buffering for varying number of hosts and switches in a network. Furthermore, PDR is significantly minimized by use of buffers during network congestion in SDN.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["419"]}

While the need for a broader and more diverse range of available services is growing, the multifaceted and deep rooted challenges of the mobile technology such as security, privacy, efficiency, coherence, and resilience have to evolve. While most of the online businesses, social networking, financial transactions, personal record managements, and so forth are increasingly being done from mobile phones, it is important that an appropriate infrastructure capable of handling this data is in place to keep, handle, update, secure, and make it available when needed in accordance with national and international rules and regulations.

One prominent area of growing interest in this regard is the support of healthcare provision anywhere, anyhow, and at any time. Suitable information systems and the relevant network infrastructures are moving closer and closer together. There is the need to have security, privacy, efficiency, robustness, consistency, and availability at all times. In order to incorporate the said objectives, it is justified to advocate an information system that can operate on mobile devices to provide healthcare services, whereby the service layer and the data transportation layer are moving increasingly closer to each other. Healthcare systems are at the cusp of being revolutionized by advancements in technology, which when appropriately integrated into existing best\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["419"]}
{"title": "Software cost estimations for projects requiring customized revisions\n", "abstract": " Software failures are common and persistent and so are the dealing strategies. But the ultimate race is to be won by the best. Software failures are not only caused by the poor development effort but also by the poor requirement gathering and cost estimation. During the development lifecycle when the requirement are to be re-established or the cost and schedule of project are immediately threatened. The cost to develop the project with revisions remains an open question and calculated by intuition. This paper describes the possible cost of changing the software modules by considering the software development life cycle in its generic terms. An equation is presented in this paper that calculates the cost of revision based on the initial cost and the number of the phases to be revised.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["419"]}
