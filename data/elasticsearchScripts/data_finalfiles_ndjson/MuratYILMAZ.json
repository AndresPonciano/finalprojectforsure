{"title": "Exploring the relationship between software process adaptive capability and organisational performance\n", "abstract": " Software development is a complex socio-technical activity, with the result that software development organisations need to establish and maintain robust software development processes. While much debate exists regarding the effectiveness of various software development approaches, no single approach is perfectly suited to all settings and no setting is unchanging. The capability to adapt the software process is therefore essential to sustaining an optimal software process. We designed an exploratory study to concurrently examine software process adaptive capability and organisational performance in 15 software development organisations, finding that companies with greater software process adaptive capability are shown to also experience greater business success. While our exploratory study of the complex relationship between these phenomena is limited in some respects, the findings indicate that\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "54\n", "authors": ["1366"]}

{"title": "An Exploratory Study to Assess Analytical and Logical Thinking Skills of the Software Practitioners using a Gamification Perspective\n", "abstract": " The link between analytical and logical thinking skills and success of software practitioners attracted an increasing attention in the last decade. Several studies report that the ability to think logically is a requirement for improving software development skills, which exhibits a strong reasoning. Additionally, analytical thinking is a vital part of software development for example while dividing a task into elemental parts with respect to basic rules and principles.\u00a0 Using the basic essence of gamification, this study proposes a mobile testing platform for assessing analytical and logical thinking skills of software practitioners as well as computer engineering students. The assessment questions were taken from the literature and transformed into a gamified tool based on the software requirements. A focus group study was conducted to capture the requirements. Using the Delphi method, these requirements were discussed by a group of experts to reach a multidisciplinary understanding where a level of moderate agreement has been achieved. In light of these, an assessment tool was developed, which was tested on both software practitioners from the industry and senior computer engineering students. Our results suggest that individuals who exhibit skills in analytical and logical thinking are also more inclined to be successful in software development.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1366"]}
{"title": "Designing games for improving the software development process\n", "abstract": " With the proliferation of relevant technologies that enables interactive social engagements, games became a strong driving power for next generation social environments. One of the reason for this is that there is an engaging nature in both digital and non-digital games, which is also suitable for creating serious kind of interactions such as teaching, training, learning, etc. Recently, researchers have started developing games or game-like applications in particular domains such as education, management, medicine. Although there are loads of empirical studies about game-based learning in general, scholars from information systems, computer science and software engineering domains have only a few attempts to develop and use the specific properties of games in their context-dependent environments.

{"title": "The Design Process of a Board Game for Exploring the Territories of the United States\n", "abstract": " The paper reports the design experience of a board game with an educational aspect, which takes place on the location of states and territories of the United States. Based on a territorial acquisition dynamic, the goal was to articulate the design process of a board game that provides information for individuals who are willing to learn the locations of the US states by playing a game. The game was developed using an iterative design process based on focus groups studies and brainstorming sessions. A mechanic-driven design approach was adopted instead of a theme or setting-driven alternative and a relatively abstract game was developed. The initial design idea was formed and refined according to the player feedback. The paper details play-testing sessions conducted and documents the design experience from a qualitative perspective. Our preliminary results suggest that the initial design is moderately balanced and despite the lack of quantitative evidence, our subjective observations indicate that participants\u2019 knowledge about the location of states was improved in an entertaining and interactive way.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1366"]}

In particular, software development organizations are willing to transform their software development culture to benefit from its fruitful practices. In addition, it is almost inevitable for the organizations with historical development practices to face many dysfunctions during transformation phase, which is normal and expected. It is important to uncover, analyze and solve these dysfunctions, which may take some time. One of the problems organizations may encounter is the confusion and misapplication of the roles in Scrum.

{"title": "Towards a process management life-cycle model for graduation projects in computer engineering\n", "abstract": " Graduation projects play an important role in computer engineering careers in which students are expected to draw upon their knowledge and skills that were acquired since admission. To manage the activities of graduation projects, an iterative and incremental approach which aims continuous improvement is proposed as an alternative to a controversial delivery model. However, such integration brings up a set of challenges to be taken into account: e.g. multiple project deliveries, more labor-intensive effort from instructors, and ultimately continuous learning for all participants. One promising way to achieve such an integrated and continuous deployment velocity is to eliminate potential bottlenecks by giving student teams to receive early and continuous feedback. To this end, we propose a continuous feedback and delivery mechanism for managing the life-cycle of a graduation project through draft proposal, literature review, requirements gathering, design, implementation and testing which should produce intermediate outputs at predefined intervals. Most importantly, our approach makes it possible to quantify most of the activities involved in life-cycle process with various rubrics (i.e. measurement scales) that have been purposefully developed. The proposed model promotes the fact that all improvements should be monitored, evaluated and documented. The results of this study indicate that students who were managed using this approach produced better project deliverables and ultimately have delivered better and successful projects.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1366"]}

A new generation of software development models based on product demands of software customers with marketable functions aims to increase the intermediate product production speed and thus the number of interim versions. In the light of these needs, software companies need to oversee their development processes to meet their customers' needs. But more importantly, companies are forced to change their processes in line with innovative practices in order not to cut back on the software production line. In this article, the software development methods of the three companies that develop software are examined in detail by the case study method, and the process change activities are systematically detailed. In the light of the information obtained, the experiences of the three firms in the software development methods are questioned and the effects of these acquisitions on the processes are discussed. As a result of the study, it has been observed that the software development success has a significant impact on the well-being of the process, and the software development teams are trying to design their own processes in the light of the gains they acquire.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1366"]}
