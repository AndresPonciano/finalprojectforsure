{"title": "Janus kinase 2 inhibitor AG490 inhibits the STAT3 signaling pathway by suppressing protein translation of gp130\n", "abstract": " The binding of interleukin-6 (IL-6) cytokine family ligands to the gp130 receptor complex activates the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signal transduction pathway, where STAT3 plays an important role in cell survival and tumorigenesis. Constitutive activation of STAT3 has been frequently observed in many cancer tissues, and thus, blocking of the gp130 signaling pathway, at the JAK level, might be a useful therapeutic approach for the suppression of STAT3 activity, as anticancer therapy. AG490 is a tyrphostin tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has been extensively used for inhibiting JAK2 in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we demonstrate a novel mechanism associated with AG490 that inhibits the JAK/STAT3 pathway. AG490 induced downregulation of gp130, a common receptor for the IL-6 cytokine family compounds, but not JAK2 or STAT3, within three hours of exposure. The downregulation of gp130 was not caused by enhanced degradation of gp130 or by inhibition of mRNA transcription. It most likely occurred by translation inhibition of gp130 in association with phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor-2\u03b1. The inhibition of protein synthesis of gp130 by AG490 led to immediate loss of mature gp130 in cell membranes, due to its short half-life, thereby resulting in reduction in the STAT3 response to IL-6. Taken together, these results suggest that AG490 blocks the STAT3 activation pathway via a novel pathway.", "num_citations": "44\n", "authors": ["1646"]}

While current middleware technologies can hide many low-level details, designers must provide a static configuration for the system's underlying network in order to achieve required performance characteristics. This has not been a problem for many types of DRE systems where the configuration of the system is relatively fixed from the factory (e.g., aircraft or naval vessels). However for truly open systems (i.e., systems where end users can add or substract components at runtime)the standard static network configuration approach cannot guarantee that required performance will be met because network resource demands are not fully known a priori.

The idea behind distributed simulations is to achieve a speedup by utilizing multiple computing resources.

Leveraging this history in combination with spatial reasoning, this paper presents a novel reputation model (PreSTA), designed to aid in spam classification.

The problem becomes more complex when both time- and event-triggered mode changes are allowed.

This problem is particularly serious in real time systems because unbounded time values cause the state space to be infinite even for simple systems. The author presents an algorithm that produces a compact representation of the reachable state space of a real time system. The algorithm yields a small state space, but still retains enough information for analysis. To avoid the state explosion which can be caused by simply adding time values to states, our algorithm uses history equivalence and transition bisimulation to collapse states into equivalent classes. Through history equivalence, states are merged into an equivalence class with the same untimed executions up to the states. Using transition bisimulation, the states that have the same future behaviors are further collapsed. The resultant state space is\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "23\n", "authors": ["1646"]}

{"title": "Symbolic weak bisimulation for value-passing calculi\n", "abstract": " Bisimulation equivalence has proved to be a useful notion for providing semantics to process calculi, and it has been an object of rigorous study within the concurrency theory community. Recently there have been signi cant e orts for extending bisimulation techniques to encompass process calculi that allow the communication of data, that is value-passing calculi. A main challenge in achieving this has been the fact that in value-passing processes, where the values are from an in nite domain, checking for process equivalence involves comparing an in nite number of behaviors. Central among work in this area is the approach in which a new notion of process semantics, namely symbolic semantics, is proposed as a means of expressing a class of value-passing processes as nite graphs, although their traditional underlying graphs are in nite. This paper presents new algorithms for computing symbolic weak bisimulation for value-passing processes. These algorithms are built on the basis of a new formulation of late weak bisimulation which we propose. Unlike the traditional de nition, this formulation allows the use of a single symbolic weak transition relation for expressing both early and late bisimulations. In addition to being easy to implement, our algorithms highlight the distinction between early and late weak bisimulations. Furthermore, we propose a simple variation of symbolic transition graphs with assignment proposed by Lin, in which the order of assignments and actions in transitions is exchanged.

This paper presents a model of real-time program execution and a system for reasoning about real-time programs. We model program execution by interactions with an external environment (events) and the time between events. This model extends Hoare's trace model for concurrent programs by adding timing constraints to the traces describing program execution. To prove programs correct we define a reat relation which holds if a program satisfies its specifications. We show the use of the model for representing program execution and the use of the proof system for showing that a program satisfies its specifications.We write all real-time programs in a CSP-type language [6). Currently the language only allows for synchronous communication, though in the future we hope to extend it to include asynchronous communication as well. The major difference between our language and CSP as defined by Hoare is that we have defined a deterministic choice operator, while in Hoare's language choice is nondeterministic. We have chosen a deterministic operator because in real-time programs the time at which an event occurs is critical and although two events may occur simultaneously, the designer may know that one is more critical than the other and should be serviced first (5).

The underlying computation model of CSR is resource-based in which multiple resources execute synchronously, while processes assigned to the same resource are interleaved according to their priorities. CSR bridges the gap between an abstract computation model and implementation environments, but is too complex to be treated as a process algebra. We therefore give a calculus for CSR (CCSR), that provides the ability to perform equivalence proofs by syntactic manipulation.

Each developed a monocular corneal opacity. Three patients with a chief complaint of corneal opacity were transferred to our clinic from other clinics. These patients had documented histories of treatment for EKC in infancy. All patients were treated with early occlusion therapy, but amblyopia persisted in four patients. Furthermore, all patients had strabismus and showed a significant reduction of stereoscopic vision.ConclusionsAlthough infants with EKC are not always cooperative, slit lamp examination should be performed as early as possible, and appropriate medical treatment should be performed, thus reducing the development of corneal opacity.

Each discharge cell is filled with an inert gas containing a main discharge gas Such as neon (Ne), helium (He) and a mixture of Ne and He, and a small amount of xenon (Xe). The plurality of discharge cells form one pixel. For example, a red (R) discharge cell, a green (G) discharge cell, and a blue (B) discharge cell form one pixel. When the plasma display panel is discharged by applying a high frequency Voltage to the discharge cells, the inert gas generates vacuum ultraviolet rays, which thereby cause phos phors formed between the barrier ribs to emit light, thus displaying an image.The plasma display panel includes a plurality of electrodes\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1646"]}

Network code is a verifiable, executable model for coordinating and controlling access to a shared communication medium in a distributed real-time system.

Many animal species as well as categories of agents have been involved in the emergence of diseases. Nearly all of these emergent disease episodes have involved zoonotic infectious agents; that is, they have involved the transmission of the etiologic agent to humans from an ongoing reservoir life cycle in animals or arthropods. Control of zooneses depends on attempts to reduce vector populations of limit contact with reservior species. But in most instances, the control efforts require environmental or human behavioral modification in addition to direct efforts at vector population reduction. We described the general ecological characteristics of zoonses and epidemiologic features of 7 important zoonoses in Korea-anthrax, brucellosis, rabies, E. coli O157 infection, japanese B encephalitis, bovine spongiform encephalitis and variant Creutzfelt-Jacob diseases, and high pathogenic avian influenza. We have made some suggestions in this article. First the network of medical field and veterinary field (including experts and governmental organization) should be systematically organized in zoonosis surveillance, epidemic investigation, outbreak control and so forth. Second, we should practically prepare the new emerging epidemics-including pandemic and bioterrorism in connection with zoonoses control.

{"title": "On the throughput of multicasting with incremental forward error correction\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we consider a multicasting model that uses incremental forward error correction (FEC). In this model, there is one sender and r/sup n/ receivers.

Packets to the receivers are lost independently with probability q. For this model, we prove several strong laws of large numbers for the asymptotic throughput as n /spl rarr/ /spl infin/. The asymptotic throughput is characterized by the unique solution of an equation in terms of p, q, and r. These strong laws not only provide theoretical justification for several important observations made in the literature, but also provide insights that might have impact on future design of multicasting protocols.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1646"]}

{"title": "Mitigating spam using spatio-temporal reputation\n", "abstract": " In this paper we present Preventive Spatio-Temporal Aggregation (PRESTA), a reputation model that combines spatial and temporal features to produce values that are behavior predictive and useful in partial-knowledge situations. To evaluate its effectiveness, we applied PRESTA in the domain of spam detection. Studying the temporal properties of IP blacklists, we found that 25% of IP addresses once listed on a blacklist were re-listed within 10 days. Further, during our evaluation period over 45% of IPs de-listed were re-listed. By using the IP address assignment hierarchy to define spatial groupings and leveraging these temporal statistics, PRESTA produces reputation values that correctly classify up to 50% of spam email not identified by blacklists alone, while maintaining low false-positive rates. When used in conjunction with blacklists, an average of 93% of spam emails are identified, and we find the system is consistent in maintaining this blockage rate even during periods of decreased blacklist performance. PRESTA spam filtering can be employed as an intermediate filter (perhaps in-network) prior to context-based analysis.

However, existing approaches to estimating uncertainty largely ignore the possibility of covariate shift\u2014ie, where the real-world data distribution may differ from the training distribution. As a consequence, existing algorithms can overestimate certainty, possibly yielding a false sense of confidence in the predictive model. We pro-pose an algorithm for calibrating predictions that accounts for the possibility of covariate shift, given labeled examples from the train-ing distribution and unlabeled examples from the real-world distribution. Our algorithm uses importance weighting to correct for the shift from the training to the real-world distribution. However, importance weighting relies on the training and real-world distributions to be sufficiently close. Building on ideas from domain adaptation, we additionally learn a feature map that tries to equalize these two distributions.

Typically, the pipelines used in industrial facilities have extremely stringent requirements, for example, high strength, ductility, toughness, and corrosion resistance. Various methods have been employed to manufacture pipes that meet the mechanical characteristics requirements of pipes; among them, the bending process employing local induction heating is an efficient method since bent pipes of various radii can be produced with lower costs and higher quality. Many studies have been conducted to predict and verify these mechanical characteristics; 1 6) however, they were localized and primarily focused on specific specimens and did not adequately consider products with small curvature (or bending) radii. Small pipes with smaller bending radii have many advantages such as smaller space requirements and lower costs. However, the mechanical properties of such bent pipes with small radii can deteriorate, especially in the outer sections, due to smaller thicknesses, and, in fact, their properties worsen with decreasing bending radii. Therefore, it is important to investigate the mechanical properties that can enable the optimum utilization of pipes having smaller radii than those of conventional bent pipes in structural facilities.

DRE systems combine the stringent quality of service (QoS) requirements of traditional closed embedded systems with the challenges of the dynamic conditions associated with being widely distributed across an often volatile network environment. Traditionally, embedded systems have been able to rely on their closed environments and self-contained bus architectures to limit the dynamic inputs possible and could rely on static resource management techniques to provide the QoS and reliable performance they need. The environment of distributed, networked systems is more open with heterogeneous platforms, where inputs can come from external devices and platforms, and dynamic, in which conditions, resource availability, and interactions can change. Because of this, achieving the necessary predictable real-time behavior in these DRE systems relies on the ability to manage resources end-to-end, map system level requirements to platform level controls, aggregate conflicting requirements, and adapt and reconfigure to changing conditions.Middleware, such as CORBA, is being applied to these types of applications because of its ability to abstract issues of distribution, heterogeneity, and programming language from the design of systems.

Context measurements provide binary information as obtained from the system's environment, e.g., a medical alarm indicating that a vital sign is above a certain threshold. Since they provide state information, these measurements can be used for estimation purposes, similar to standard continuous measurements, especially when standard sensors are biased or attacked. Context measurements are assumed to have a known probability of occurring given the state; in particular, we focus on the probit function to model threshold-based measurements, such as the medical-alarm scenario. We develop a recursive context-aware filter by approximating the posterior distribution with a Gaussian distribution with the same first two moments as the true posterior.

This carries the potential to radically improve medical care through coordinating, cooperating devices, but also to undermine the patient safety by giving rise to security vulnerabilities in the cyber world. In this paper, we propose an authentication framework as the first step to build an ICE security architecture. This framework is designed in a three-layered structure, allowing it to fit in the variety of authentication requirements from different ICE entities and of networking middleware from ICE instantiations. We implement the authentication framework on OpenICE, an open source ICE instantiation.

To predict sharp drops in blood oxygen concentration, we employ available noninvasive respiratory measurements and build a parameterized physiological model of the circulation of these gases through the cardiopulmonary system.

Early detection and management can significantly improve a patient's quality of life. A large number of therapeutic options are used, such as the application of topical agents, iontophoresis, sympathectomy, and botulinum toxin injection. Objective: We aim to comprehensively evaluate the effects of botulinum toxin type A and 20% aluminum chloride on primary palmar hyperhidrosis. Methods: A total of 55 patients with clinical diagnosis of primary hyperhidrosis were treated by botulinum toxin type A and 20% aluminum chloride solution. To prospectively assess the effects on primary palmar hyperhidrosis, we checked comeometer at baseline, 2 and 4 months later. By regular meetings with patients, including telephone interviews, we analyzed patients' subjective satisfaction scores and complaints during the follow-up periods. Results: During the 2-month period, as compared with that of the control group, the level of comeometer of both groups declined. In the 4-month period, the group treated with 20% aluminum chloride sustained a lower level of comeometer. In the questionnaire, in the 2-month period, the group treated with botulinum toxin resulted in a lower level of overall treatment scores than that of the group treated with 20% aluminum chloride.

As such, a concurrent real-time-process has AND-OR resource requirements. If locking is used to provide exclusive access to resources, deadlock is possible since processes can request additional resources while holding other resources.

We present here a semantic domain for real-time processes that captures the temporal constraints of concurrent programs. A partial ordering based on process containment is defined and shown to be a complete partial order on the domain. The domain is used to define the denotational semantics of a CSP-like language that incorporates pure time delay. An axiomatization of process containment is presented and shown to be complete for finite terms in this language.

In this paper, we propose VisionGuard, a novel attack- and dataset-agnostic and computationally-light defense mechanism for adversarial inputs to DNN-based perception systems. In particular, VisionGuard relies on the observation that adversarial images are sensitive to lossy compression transformations. Specifically, to determine if an image is adversarial, VisionGuard checks if the output of the target classifier on a given input image changes significantly after feeding it a transformed version of the image under investigation. Moreover, we show that VisionGuard is computationally-light both at runtime and design-time which makes it suitable for real-time applications that may also involve large-scale image domains. To highlight this, we demonstrate the efficiency of VisionGuard on ImageNet, a task that is computationally challenging for the majority of relevant defenses. Finally, we include extensive comparative experiments on the MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets that show that VisionGuard outperforms existing defenses in terms of scalability and detection performance.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1646"]}

This can reduce the cost and environmental issues. In this study, oyster shell powder (OSP) is reinforced as a filler in polypropylene (PP) matrix to make a new composite. The purpose is to improve fire retardant properties of PP as a result of OSP reinforcement. Mechanical, fire retardant and water absorption properties of the new composite have been studied in this research. Concentration of OSP reinforcement in PP has been varied by wt% and its effect on the above mentioned properties has been observed. SEM (scanning electron microscopy) images of tensile and bending fractured surfaces have been taken to observe the failure mechanism during mechanical tests. An increase in the fire retardancy has been observed as a result of the OSP reinforcement while tensile strength decreased.

Although both techniques increase computation cost, overall performance can still be enhanced by reducing communication cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the two techniques via two case studies: radix sort and 3-star, a deployment algorithm in wireless sensor networks. For radix sort, a new algorithm, which mixes MSD and LSD algorithms and employs data streaming, is presented.

{"title": "An efficient generation of the timed reachability graph for the analysis of real-time systems\n", "abstract": " As computers become ubiquitous, they are increasingly used in safety critical environments. Since many safety critical applications are real-time systems, automated analysis technique of real-time properties is desirable. Most widely used automated analysis techniques are based on state space exploration. Automatic analysis techniques based on state space exploration suffer from the state space explosion problem. In particular, a real-time system may have an unbounded number of states due to infinitely many possible time values. This paper presents our approach for generating a finite and efficient representation of the reachable states called a timed reachability graph for a real-time system. In this paper, a real-time system is specified using a timed automaton which is a timed extension of the well-known finite automaton. Our approach for coping with the state explosion problem is to extract timing information from states and to represent it as relative time relations between transitions. We also present an algorithm for computing the minimum and maximum time bounds between executions of two actions from a timed reachability graph to determine timing properties.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1646"]}

When the application and library codes are loaded from the disk into memory, TrapFetch inserts breakpoints at the designated addresses based on the logs. During subsequent runs, TrapFetch is invoked at each breakpoint when it prefetches the corresponding data into the page cache. This approach is effective during both launch and run-time.

To guarantee non-interference between these applications, the hardware resources, in particular the processor, are statically partitioned among them. To overcome the inefficiencies in resource utilization of such a static scheme, the concept of mixed-criticality real-time scheduling has emerged as a promising solution. Although there are several studies on such scheduling strategies for uniprocessor platforms, the problem of efficient scheduling for the multiprocessor case has largely remained open.

{"title": "Towards non-invasive monitoring of hypovolemia in intensive care patients\n", "abstract": " Hypovolemia caused by internal hemorrhage is a major cause of death in critical care patients. However, hypovolemia is difficult to diagnose in a timely fashion, as obvious symptoms do not manifest until patients are already nearing a critical state of shock. Novel non-invasive methods for detecting hypovolemia in the literature utilize the photoplethysmogram (PPG) waveform generated by the pulse-oximeter attached to a finger or ear. Until now, PPG-based alarms have been evaluated only on healthy patients under ideal testing scenarios (eg, motionless patients); however, the PPG is sensitive to patient health and significant artifacts manifest when patients move. Since patient health varies within the intensive care unit (ICU) and ICU patients typically do not remain motionless, this work introduces a PPG-based monitor designed to be robust to waveform artifacts and health variability in the underlying patient population. To demonstrate the promise of our approach, we evaluate the proposed monitor on a small sample of intensive care patients from the Physionet database. The monitor detects hypovolemia within a twelve hour window of nurse documentation of hypovolemia when it is present, and achieves a low false alarm rate over patients without documented hypovolemia.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1646"]}

A simple extension, a network of communicating hybrid automata, allows for modeling distributed embedded systems. Although it is possible to generate code from such models, it is difficult to provide formal guarantees in the code with respect to the model. One of the reasons for this is that, the model is set in continuous time and concurrent execution with instantaneous communication, whereas the generated code is set in discrete time with delayed communication. This can introduce semantic differences between the model and the code such as missed transitions, faulty transitions, and altered continuous behavior.

In addition, right heart thrombi are frequently associated with major pulmonary thromboembolism, and carry a very high risk of mortality, and therefore, require accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment.

In addition, some systemic diseases, such as malignant tumors, amyloidosis and nephrotic syndrome, have been shown to contribute to the formation of an intracardiac thrombus. Echocardiography is valuable in the diagnosis of RA thrombi. There are some options in the treatment of RA thrombi, such as anticoagulant therapy using heparin, thrombolytic therapy and surgical removal. However, there is still adverse criticism as to the selection of the correct treatment method. A patient with RA thrombi, who presented with sudden cardiogenic shock, was diagnosed by two-dimensional echocardiography.

A natural question is how to provide fair resource allocation to real-time traffic in wireless LANs. Wireless networks are subject to unpredictable location-dependent error bursts, which is different from wired networks. We propose a fair real-time scheduling model whose goal is to minimize the maximum loss rate among all the flows and additionally to maximize the overall throughput. We develop algorithms for this scheduling model that takes the wireless channel error characteristics into consideration.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1646"]}

It is not well established how each individual neuroblast in the ventral neuroectoderm acquires its characteristic identity along the dorsal-ventral axis. The role of the CNS midline cells in the fate determination of Drosophila ventral neuroectoderm was investigated using several molecular markers for the identified ventral neuroblasts, neurons, and axon pathways. This study showed that the CNS midline cells are required for the expression of neuroblast-specific marker genes from S1 to S5 stages of neurogenesis, indicating that the CNS midline cells are essential for neuroblast identity determination. The CNS midline cells are also required for the proper formation of neurons and axon pathways.

In explaining this so-called turn-of-the-year or January effect, the tax-loss-selling hypothesis has received some support from recent research. This hypothesis asserts that toward the end of the year investors sell stocks that have declined in price during the year to reduce their taxes, thereby putting downward pressure on stock prices. As soon as the year ends, the selling pressure in relieved, and hence stock prices rebound to their equilibrium levels, resulting in abnormally high\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1646"]}

Balanced Accuracy is a popular metric used to evaluate a classifier's prediction performance under such scenarios.

In this paper, we propose a simple and general-purpose evaluation framework for imbalanced data classification that is sensitive to arbitrary skews in class cardinalities and importances. Experiments with several state-of-the-art classifiers tested on real-world datasets and benchmarks from two different domains show that our new framework is more effective than Balanced Accuracy -- not only in evaluating and ranking model predictions, but also in training the models themselves.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1646"]}

L. casei and L. reuteri had the highest propionic acid production and were therefore used for fermenting the forages. The forages were fermented using monoculture and co-culture of L. casei and L. reuteri for 30, 45 and 60 days of ensiling. Addition of LAB lowered the pH of the IRG silage (p< 0.05). Moisture content, lactic acid and acetic acid contents were higher (p< 0.05) after addition of LAB. Water soluble carbohydrate was significantly lower (p< 0.05) in WCB with a co-culture containing L. casei and L. reuteri. Propionic acid production was comparatively higher after addition of LAB to WCB on days 30, 45 and 60 while butyric acid was only detected in the IRG control on day 60. Fungi was not detected within 60 days after addition of LAB in IRG and WCB. Through this experiment, improved forage preservation was achieved using a co-culture containing L. casei and L. reuteri. WCB silage had higher propionic acid concentration and thus, it was a better forage for ensiling using co-culture of L. casei and L. reuteri.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1646"]}

While this is important, analysis is often based on the assumption that the task parameters such as execution requirements and inter-arrival times between jobs are known exactly. In most cases, however, only a worst-case estimate of these quantities is available at the time of analysis. It is therefore imperative that schedulability analysis hold for better parameter values (Sustainable Analysis). On the other hand, if the task or system parameters turn out to be worse off, then the analysis should tolerate some deterioration (Robust Analysis). Robust analysis is especially important, because the implication of task schedulability is often weakened in the presence of optimizations that are performed on its code, or dynamic system parameters.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1646"]}

A GCSR specification consists of a set of nodes that are connected with directed, labeled edges, which describe possible execution flows. Nodes represent instantaneous selection among execution flows, or time and resource consuming system activities. In addition, a node can represent a system subcomponent, which allows modular, hierarchical, thus scalable system specifications. Edges are labeled with instantaneous communication actions or time to describe the duration of activities in the source node. GCSR supports the explicit representation of resources and priorities to resolve resource contention. The semantics of GCSR is the Algebra of Communicating Shared Resources, a timed process algebra with operational semantics that makes GCSR specifications executable. Furthermore, the process algebra provides behavioral equivalence relations between GCSR specifications. These equivalence relations can be used to replace a GCSR specification with an equivalent specification inside another, and to minimize a GCSR specification in terms of the number of nodes and edges.

{"title": "PAC Prediction Sets Under Covariate Shift\n", "abstract": " An important challenge facing modern machine learning is how to rigorously quantify the uncertainty of model predictions. Conveying uncertainty is especially important when there are changes to the underlying data distribution that might invalidate the predictive model. Yet, most existing uncertainty quantification algorithms break down in the presence of such shifts. We propose a novel approach that addresses this challenge by constructing \\emph{probably approximately correct (PAC)} prediction sets in the presence of covariate shift. Our approach focuses on the setting where there is a covariate shift from the source distribution (where we have labeled training examples) to the target distribution (for which we want to quantify uncertainty). Our algorithm assumes given importance weights that encode how the probabilities of the training examples change under the covariate shift. In practice, importance weights typically need to be estimated; thus, we extend our algorithm to the setting where we are given confidence intervals for the importance weights rather than their true value. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on various covariate shifts designed based on the DomainNet and ImageNet datasets.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1646"]}

Consequently, multiple techniques have been proposed that leverage label-invariant transformations of the input (ie, an input manifold) to improve worst-case confidence calibration. However, manifold-based confidence calibration techniques generally do not scale and/or require expensive retraining when applied to models with large input spaces (eg, ImageNet). In this paper, we present the recursive lossy label-invariant calibration (ReCal) technique that leverages label-invariant transformations of the input that induce a loss of discriminatory information to recursively group (and calibrate) inputs\u2013without requiring model retraining.

The use of a HMM in this regard presents multiple challenges including dealing with incomplete observation sequences (due to data losses and corruptions) and the lack of a priori information about the model complexity (number of states in the model). We address the first challenges by using the plant state information and history of received/applied control inputs to fill in the gaps in the observation sequences, and by enhancing the HMM learning algorithm to deal with missing observations. Further, we adopt two model quality criteria for determining behavior model complexity. The contributions of this paper include:(1) an\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1646"]}

Such ECUs are connected to sensors and actuators and communicate via shared buses. Resource arbitration at the ECUs and also in the communication medium, coupled with variabilities in execution requirements of tasks results in jitter in the signal/data streams existing in the system. As a result, buffers are required at the ECUs and bus controllers. However, these buffers often implement different semantics--FIFO queuing, which is the most straightforward buffering scheme, and data refreshing, where stale data is overwritten by freshly sampled data. Traditional timing and schedulability analysis that are used to compute, eg, end-to-end delays, in such automotive architectures can only model FIFO buffering. As a result, they return pessimistic delay and resource estimates because in reality paper\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1646"]}

The results of the investigation show that the change in injection mass curve when using BD30 instead of diesel was insignificant. A combustion analysis shows BD30 has a shorter ignition delay at part-load operating condition where heavy exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rate is used. This difference in behavior is due to the oxygen contents and lower stoichiometric air-fuel ratio of BD30, which leads to higher O2 concentration in the exhaust gas.

JuliaReach is a new participant in this category, Verisig participated previously in 2019 and NNV has participated in all previous competitions. This report is a snapshot of the current landscape of tools and the types of benchmarks for which these tools are suited. Due to the diversity of problems, lack of a shared hardware platform, and the early stage of the competition, we are not ranking tools in terms of performance, yet the presented results combined with 2020 results probably provide the most complete assessment of current tools for safety verification of NNCS.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1646"]}
{"title": "Monotonic Safety for Scalable and Data-Efficient Probabilistic Safety Analysis\n", "abstract": " Autonomous systems with machine learning-based perception can exhibit unpredictable behaviors that are difficult to quantify, let alone verify. Such behaviors are convenient to capture in probabilistic models, but probabilistic model checking of such models is difficult to scale -- largely due to the non-determinism added to models as a prerequisite for provable conservatism. Statistical model checking (SMC) has been proposed to address the scalability issue. However it requires large amounts of data to account for the aforementioned non-determinism, which in turn limits its scalability. This work introduces a general technique for reduction of non-determinism based on assumptions of \"monotonic safety'\", which define a partial order between system states in terms of their probabilities of being safe. We exploit these assumptions to remove non-determinism from controller/plant models to drastically speed up probabilistic model checking and statistical model checking while providing provably conservative estimates as long as the safety is indeed monotonic. Our experiments demonstrate model-checking speed-ups of an order of magnitude while maintaining acceptable accuracy and require much less data for accurate estimates when running SMC -- even when monotonic safety does not perfectly hold and provable conservatism is not achieved.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1646"]}
{"title": "Confidence Composition for Monitors of Verification Assumptions\n", "abstract": " Closed-loop verification of cyber-physical systems with neural network controllers offers strong safety guarantees under certain assumptions. It is, however, difficult to determine whether these guarantees apply at run time because verification assumptions may be violated. To predict safety violations in a verified system, we propose a three-step framework for monitoring the confidence in verification assumptions. First, we represent the sufficient condition for verified safety with a propositional logical formula over assumptions. Second, we build calibrated confidence monitors that evaluate the probability that each assumption holds. Third, we obtain the confidence in the verification guarantees by composing the assumption monitors using a composition function suitable for the logical formula. Our framework provides theoretical bounds on the calibration and conservatism of compositional monitors. In two case studies, we demonstrate that the composed monitors improve over their constituents and successfully predict safety violations.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1646"]}
{"title": "Model Checking Resiliency and Sustainability of In-Vehicle Network for Real-Time Authenticity\n", "abstract": " The Controller Area Network (CAN) is the most common network system in automotive systems. However, the standardized design of a CAN protocol does not consider security issues, so it is vulnerable to various security attacks from internal and external electronic devices. Recently, in-vehicle network is often connected to external network systems, including the Internet, and can result in an unwarranted third-party application becoming an attack point. Message Authentication CAN (MAuth-CAN) is a new centralized authentication for CAN system, where two dual-CAN controllers are utilized to process message authentication. MAuth-CAN is designed to provide an authentication mechanism as well as provide resilience to a message flooding attack and sustainably protect against a bus-off attack. This paper presents formal techniques to guarantee critical timing properties of MAuth-CAN, based on model checking, which can be also used for safety certificates of vehicle components, such as ISO 26262. Using model checking, we prove sufficient conditions that MAuth-CAN is resilient and sustainable against message flooding and bus-off attacks and provide two formal models of MAuth-CAN in timed automata that are applicable for formal analysis of other applications running on CAN bus. In addition, we discuss that the results of model checking of those properties are consistent with the experiment results of MAuth-CAN implementation.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1646"]}

The realization of this promise however critically depends on the deployment of judicious wireless and vehicular control strategies (e.g., how vehicular routing choices respond to V2X messages, how wireless network schedules these messages, how traffic signals may be controlled to optimize their spread) that exploit the opportunities and stymie the obstacles that the interdependence between the wireless and transportation infrastructures introduce. To that end, one needs mechanisms to model, evaluate and control V2X, which is what we seek to obtain, by proposing deployment of formal methods\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1646"]}

However, compositional frameworks suffer from abstraction overhead in composing components. In this paper, we decompose the abstraction overhead into: 1) supply abstraction overhead associated with the supply from a resource provider and 2) demand abstraction overhead associated with the component workload. Then, we provide sufficient conditions for each abstraction overhead to be eliminated. In addition, this paper provides a heuristic technique that transforms a component to satisfy the sufficient conditions so that the abstraction overhead can be minimized. In experiments, we show that our technique outperforms two prior overhead-reducing techniques.

The OMMT was uniformly dispersed in vinyl ester resin at 1, 2 and 3 wt%, loading through high speed mechanical stirrer at room temperature and further nanocomposites were manufactured through vacuum assisted resin infusion (VARI) technique. Effects of OMMT on the mechanical properties of vinyl ester/Jute composites were carefully investigated through tensile, bending and Izod impact tests, which revealed significant improvement in mechanical properties. The morphology of the nanocomposites after tensile test was investigated by SEM which affirmed that OMMT filled nanocomposites has improved interactions with the host matrix than the pure composites.

{"title": "RT-OpenStack: a Real-Time Cloud Management System\n", "abstract": " Clouds have become appealing platforms for running not only general-purpose applications but also real-time applications. However, current clouds cannot provide real-time performance for virtual machines (VM) for two reasons:(1) the lack of a real-time virtual machine monitor (VMM) scheduler on a single host, and (2) the lack of a real-time aware VM placement scheme by the cloud manager. While real-time VM schedulers do exist, prior solutions employ either heuristics-based approaches that cannot always achieve predictable latency or apply real-time scheduling theory that may result in low CPU utilization. We observe the demand and advantage for co-hosting real-time (RT) VMs with non-real-time (regular) VMs in the same cloud.

{"title": "Leptin: A Multifunctional Role as an Immunomodulator in Mycobacterial Lung Disease\n", "abstract": " Leptin is a 16 kDa protein which consists of 167 amino acids. Leptin is considered as one of the adipokines, secreted by white adipocytes, and is the product of the obese (ob) gene. Recently, leptin is recognized as the immuno-stimulator which belongs to the same class of long chain helical cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6. Leptin is related to the immune responses evoked by Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Thus, studies of association between immunomolecules including leptin and tuberculosis may contribute to provide an essential solution regulating adverse immune responses in several mycobacterial diseases. Leptin has a multifunctional role in the secretion of acute-phase cytokines including IL-1\u03b2 and tumor-necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), and links to T helper 1 (Th1) immune response. Moreover, the binding of leptin to leptin receptor (LepR) is important in that this binding involves janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway. In addition, the activation of LepR mediates extra-cellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) pathways. Furthermore, many studies suggest that leptin may play a critical role in respiratory diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma as well as tuberculosis. These findings indicate that leptin is one of the important regulators for immune responses in respiratory diseases. We herein discuss the multifunctional role of leptin in mycobacterial lung disease, especially focusing on the related pathway to immune responses.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1646"]}

Our analysis is performed on job execution traces obtained over a one year period collected from tens of thousands of IDCP machines from 20 different pools. Our analysis demonstrates that job completion time can be severely impacted due to job suspension when higher priority jobs preempt lower priority jobs. We then develop cost-based dynamic job rescheduling strategies that adaptively restart suspended jobs, which better utilize system resources and improve completion times. Our trace-driven evaluation results show that dynamic rescheduling enables IDCP to significantly reduce job completion times.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1646"]}

The measured power distribution is calculated with the INCORE code by combining measured reaction rate data from the movable fission chambers with the ratios of analytic power to reaction rate from the nuclear core model [1]. In the case of 3-loop plant, the number of movable detectors is 50. So, the unmeasured assembly powers are inferred using the empirical fitting with the measured neighborhood assembly powers.The empirical fitting method has given us reasonable inferred assembly powers using 50 measured powers. But, in the case of some movable detectors failure or deletion, since it is wondering if the empirical fitting method is still valid, the verification calculations of INCORE code are performed for 50% assumed deletion cases of 4 domestic 3-loop plants. Empirical fitting method as a function of the distance and power deviation of the neighborhood assemblies is out of date to predict unmeasured assembly powers. It is expected that the inferred powers can be distorted, if there is no measured neighborhood assembly because of failure and deletion. So, surface spline fitting method is employed to improve radial power distribution fitting capability of INCORE code.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1646"]}
{"title": "Schedulability analysis of hierarchical real-time systems\n", "abstract": " Embedded systems are complex as a whole but consist of smaller independent modules interacting with each other. This structure makes embedded systems amenable to compositional design. Real-time embedded systems consist of real-time workloads having temporal deadlines. Compositional design of real-time embedded systems can be done using systems consisting of real-time components arranged in a scheduling hierarchy. Each component consists of some real-time workload and a scheduling policy for the workload. To simplify schedulability analysis for such systems, analysis can be done compositionally using interfaces that abstract the timing requirements of components. To facilitate analysis of dynam-ically changing real-time systems, the framework must support incremental analysis. In this paper, we summarize our work [19, 6] on schedulability analysis for hierarchical real-time systems. We describe a compositional analysis technique that abstracts resource requirements of components using periodic resource models. To support incremental analysis and resource bandwidth minimization, we describe an extension to this interface model. Each extended interface consists of multiple periodic resource models for different periods. This allows the selection of a periodic model that can schedule the system using minimum bandwidth. We also account for context switch overheads in these interfaces. We then describe an associative composition technique for such interfaces that supports incremental analysis.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1646"]}

In the bicriteria scheduling problems, we are concerned with (1) minimizing the total w-weighted error, subject to the constraint that the maximum w\u2032-weighted error is minimum and (2) minimizing the maximum w\u2032-weighted error, subject to the constraint that the total w-weighted error is minimum. For a given task system TS, we use\u220a w\u2032 w (TS) to denote the minimum total w-weighted error, subject to the constraint that the maximum w\u2032-weighted error is minimum. Similarly, we use \u03d2 w w\u2032(TS) to denote the maximum w\u2032-weighted error, subject to the constraint that the total w-weighted error is minimum.

The 0/1-constraint is motivated by some practical applications. In real life, many tasks can be implemented by either a fast or a slow algorithm, with the slow algorithm producing better-quality results than the fast one.

In this study, therefore, we examined spatial working memory in aged rats after propofol anesthesia.METHODS: Eighteen month-old rats were randomized to 2 h of 100% oxygen-propofol anesthesia (N= 11) or to a control group that breathed 100% oxygen (N= 10). Propofol was administered by continuous infusion via a tail vein catheter. Rats breathed spontaneously and rectal temperature was maintained. MAP pressure was measured non-invasively and a venous blood gas was obtained just prior to discontinuation of propofol. After a 2 d recovery, spatial working memory was assessed for 14 d using a 12 arm radial maze. The number of total errors, correct choices to first error, and time to complete the maze were recorded and analyzed using a repeated measure ANOVA.RESULTS: The average propofol infusion rate was 0.6\u00b10.1 mg/kg/min, a rate corresponding to an ED50 dose in adult rats.(3) MAP during anesthesia was 100\u00b12 mmHg and venous blood gases were in the normal range.

Many techniques, developed for reducing resource consumption, often yield resource vs. time tradeoffs.

In particular, two architectural alternatives are compared. The results indicate that end-to-end application-level performance must be incorporated in all development phases and the benefit of AAL2 switching in Iub depends heavily on the traffic load.

We present a hybrid approach that exploits formal methods to verify subcomponents of a system and testing to gain con dence in the correctness of the assembled system. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated by application of the method to a process algebra model of the Sunshine ATM switching network.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1646"]}

{"title": "Automation of analysis and simulation for understanding of large real-time Ada software\n", "abstract": " This paper describes analysis and simulation for understanding of large Ada-83 real-time software. Ada real-time software is frequently very large in size and very complex. The objective is to describe: (1) discovery of the architecture of the software by decomposing the software into a hierarchical structure, (2) generation of state machines that preserve the real-time properties of the hierarchically organized units, and (3) simulation of the software represented by the state machines. Because of the severe limitation of space, these capabilities are only briefly described, without an example. The first two items above have been exercised in processing over 100,000 lines of Ada-83 code. The third item is still being developed.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1646"]}
{"title": "Experiences with TeleMentoring: Lab Teaching over ATM Networks\n", "abstract": " Using the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network infrastructure of the AURORA Gigabit Testbed \u00a7 , we were able to carry out a trial of interactive distance learning. The trial used teleconferencing hardware which converts NTSC television and audio signals to and from ATM cells. This hardware connected the Bellcore VideoWindow (TM) with other apparatus to create a realistic two-way interaction. In our trial, the interaction was between teams of undergraduate computer science students and researchers at Bellcore, and was used to support work by these students on advanced laboratory projects for a course.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1646"]}
{"title": "Fast parallel algorithms for model checking using BDDs\n", "abstract": " Binary decision diagrams (BDDs) have recently been used in model checking to verify systems with a large number of states (of the order of 5*10/sup 20/). Representing both the state space and the state transition graph as BDDs has been demonstrated to alleviate the problem of state space explosion. But there are limitations to this heuristic approach. Even systems of reasonable complexity have many more states. Also, the BDD approach might fail even on some simple systems. The authors propose the use of parallelism to extend the applicability of BDDs in model checking. They present fast algorithms for model checking that employ BDDs. The algorithms presented are much faster than the best known previous algorithms.< >", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1646"]}

{"title": "Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) Frequency in Korean Patients with Myasthenia Gravis\n", "abstract": " Acquired myasthenia gravis (MG) is quite well known to be caused by the autoimmune mechanism. In addition, there are some opinions that MG is heavily associated with HLA-B8 in the Caucasians and HLA-B12 in the Japanese. To asses the association between human leukocyte antigens (HLA) and Korean myasthenic patients, the authours studied the HLA types in 30 myasthenic patients and 100 healthy controls. The results were as follows; The frequencies of HLA-Bw46 and DRwlO were found to be high in Korean myasthenic subjects compared with those in normal population. But there was no statistical difference in the prevalence of HLA type between myasthenic patients and control population. And we further analysed those data in view of sex, age of onset, clinical severity, and thymic pathology to know close association of any other HLA types with particular myasthenic groups. The HLA-Bw52 showed significant association in ocular myasthenic patients, the Bw46 in generalized myasthenic patients, the A30, B14 in severe generalized myasthenic patients. And HLA-B39 showed close association in myasthenic patients with thymoma, compared with normal controls. However the authors could not find any significant associations with reference to the sex, age of onset compared with those in normal controls.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1646"]}
{"title": "Language constructs for distributed real-time consistency\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we present a model and language constructs for a distributed real-time system with the goal of allowing the structured specification of functional and timing constraints, along with explicit, early error recovery from timing faults. To do this, we draw on ideas from (non-distributed) real-time programming and distributed transaction-based systems [81]. A complete language is not specified; the constructs described are assumed to be embedded in a block-structured procedural host programming language such as C [9] or C++[10](our current preliminary implementation is in C). The model consists of resources, processes, and a global scheduler. Resources are abstractions that export operations to processes, and specify acceptable concurrency of operations to the scheduler. Processes manipulate resources using the exported operations, and specify synchronization and restrictions on concurrency (at the exported operation level) to the scheduler. Examples of the types of information given to the scheduler are that a set of operations should be performed\" simultaneously\", or that a sequence of operations should be performed without interference by another process. The global scheduler embodies the entity or entities that schedule the CPU, memory, devices and other resources in the system. It performs preemptive scheduling of all resources based on dynamic priorities associated with the processes, preserves restrictions on concurrency stated by resources and processes, and is capable of giving\" guarantees\" to processes that they will receive resources during a specified future time interval.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1646"]}
{"title": "Integrated environments\n", "abstract": " The session on debugging in integrated environments started with Fairley's characterization of integrated environments as follows: (1) versatile collection of analysis, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance tools; (2) consistent user interface among the tools; (3) common representation of information (e.g., Stoneman's database model, Unix pipe); (4) history/version control/configuration management capability; and (5) encouragement of good practice. He then asked the audience the following questions: (1) what is your view of environments? (2) what possibilities exist for debugging in integrated environments that do not exist in a mere collection of tools? (3) what is the difference between high--level debugging and low--level debugging with high--level tools?", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1646"]}
{"title": "High-Confidence Data Programming for Evaluating Suppression of Physiological Alarms\n", "abstract": " False alarms generated by physiological monitors can overwhelm clinical caretakers with a variety of alarms. The resulting alarm fatigue can be mitigated with alarm suppression. Before being deployed, such suppression mechanisms need to be evaluated through a costly observational study, which would determine and label the truly suppressible alarms. This paper proposes a lightweight method for evaluating alarm suppression without access to the true alarm labels. The method is based on the data programming paradigm, which combines noisy and cheap-to-obtain labeling heuristics into probabilistic labels. Based on these labels, the method estimates the sensitivity/specificity of a suppression mechanism and describes the likely outcomes of an observational study in the form of confidence bounds. We evaluate the proposed method in a case study of low SpO2 alarms using a dataset collected at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and show that our method provides tight and accurate bounds that significantly outperform the naive comparative method.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1646"]}
{"title": "PARAGON: A Paradigm for the Specification, Verification and Testing of Real-Time Systems\n", "abstract": " The PARAGON toolset provides an environment for the modular and hierarchical design of resource-bound, real-time systems. It o ers well-integrated graphical and textual speci cation languages with formal semantics. Both languages are based on the Algebra of Communicating Shared Resources (ACSR), a process algebra with explicit notions of time, resources and priority. The integration of the three notions widens the applicability of the PARAGON formalisms to embedded systems, control systems, and faulttolerant systems where run-time resource requirements must be considered during the design phase. To facilitate the design of complex systems, PARAGON allows a designer to describe a system incrementally through re nement steps that preserve system properties. To increase dependentability of system models, PARAGON o ers three types of analysis: automated veri cation of system requirements, interactive simulation, and testing. In this paper, we demonstrate the design methodology that PARAGON o ers through examples.This research was supported in part by NSF CCR-9415346, AFOSR F49620-95-1-0508, ARO DAAH04-95-1-0092, NSF-STC-SBR-8920230 and a grant from ETRI.
