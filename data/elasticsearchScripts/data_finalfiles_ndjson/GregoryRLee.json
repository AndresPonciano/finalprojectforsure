{"title": "PyWavelets: A Python package for wavelet analysis\n", "abstract": " Wavelets are a popular tool for computational harmonic analysis. They provide localization in both the temporal (or spatial) domain as well as in the frequency domain (Daubechies, 1992). A prominent feature is the ability to perform a multiresolution analysis (S. Mallat, 2008). The wavelet transform of natural signals and images tends to have most of its energy concentrated in a small fraction of the coefficients. This sparse representation property is key to the good performance of wavelets in applications such as data compression and denoising. For example, the wavelet transform is a key component of the JPEG 2000 image compression standard.PyWavelets is a Python package implementing a number of n-dimensional discrete wavelet transforms as well as the 1D continuous wavelet transform. A wide variety of predefined wavelets are provided and it is possible for users to specify custom wavelet filter banks. All discrete wavelet transforms are implemented by convolution with finite impulse response filters. The required up/downsampling convolutions are implemented in C for good performance. Cython (Behnel et al., 2011) is used to wrap the C code and implement axis-specific 1D transformations based on the low-level C routines. All multi-dimensional transforms are implemented in Python via separable application of the 1D transforms. The API for PyWavelets was designed to be similar to Matlab\u2019s wavelet toolbox and functions such as the 1D, 2D and 3D discrete wavelet transforms are tested for accuracy vs. their Matlab counterparts. PyWavelets has additional functionality not common in other wavelet toolboxes such as support for\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "203\n", "authors": ["888"]}
{"title": "Estimation efficiency and statistical power in arterial spin labeling fMRI\n", "abstract": " Arterial spin labeling (ASL) data are typically differenced, sometimes after interpolation, as part of preprocessing before statistical analysis in fMRI. While this process can reduce the number of time points by half, it simplifies the subsequent signal and noise models (i.e., smoothed box-car predictors and white noise). In this paper, we argue that ASL data are best viewed in the same data analytic framework as BOLD fMRI data, in that all scans are modeled and colored noise is accommodated. The data are not differenced, but the control/label effect is implicitly built into the model. While the models using differenced data may seem easier to implement, we show that differencing models fit with ordinary least squares either produce biased estimates of the standard errors or suffer from a loss in efficiency. The main disadvantage to our approach is that non-white noise must be modeled in order to yield accurate standard\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "80\n", "authors": ["888"]}

It is well known that the spiral trajectory offers a higher scan efficiency compared to radial trajectories. For this reason, we have developed a novel through\u2010time spiral GRAPPA method and demonstrate its application to real\u2010time cardiac imaging. By moving from the radial trajectory to the spiral trajectory, the temporal resolution can be further improved at lower acceleration factors compared to radial GRAPPA. In addition, the image quality is improved compared to those generated using the radial trajectory due to the lower acceleration factor. Here, we show that 2D frame rates of up to 56 images/s can be achieved using this parallel imaging method with the spiral trajectory.

{"title": "Effects of activation induced transit time changes on functional Turbo ASL imaging\n", "abstract": " Recently, a few methods for acquiring arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion images at a greatly reduced TR compared to traditional schemes have been introduced [1-3]. These\" turbo\" methods all work on the basic premise of tagging spins for a shorter period of time such that a control image can be acquired immediately after the tagging period. The tag reaches the slice the following TR, during which the tag image is acquired. These techniques can be used for mapping functional activations at higher temporal resolution than is possible using standard ASL techniques. A concern with such turbo ASL techniques, however, is that the optimal choice of TR depends on the transit time of the label to the voxels of interest. The largest perfusion signal is seen for a TR equal to the (arterial) transit time. Choice of an improper TR will result in reduced perfusion signal. In addition, it has been shown [4, 5] that a change in transit time on the order of 10% occurs upon functional activation. This means that the optimal turbo ASL TR is different for the baseline and active states. This could result in either increased or reduced relative changes in CBF being observed as compared to the true CBF change as demonstrated in Figure 1. The curves in this figure were produced using a modified form of Buxton's convolution based model [6] as described in [1].

The method relies on a quick estimation of arterial transit time prior to the experiment. In this work, we present the theoretical basis for the methodology, as well as experimental data from both blocked design and event related activation paradigms demonstrating the technique and its characteristics.Introduction:", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["888"]}
{"title": "A phantom for quantitative spin tagging perfusion measurements\n", "abstract": " In order to test and validate arterial spin tagging methods, we have developed a phantom that approximates the movement of blood water protons as they perfuse brain tissue. For the purpose of current spin tagging techniques, brain blood flow can be subdivided into two categories coherent (as in the flow through larger vessels), and incoherent (as in the perfusion through capillaries and tissue) The phantom described here consists of a set of perforated pipes that force water to flow though a chamber filled with glass beads The flow through the pipes nnnncs larger vessels, and the movement of the water among the beads mimics tissue perfusion. The phantom provides perfusion rates between zero and 600 mI/rmn/lOO mL.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["888"]}

{"title": "Robust rigid-body motion estimation from extremely short subsets of 3D Cartesian scans\n", "abstract": " In this work, the ability to accurately co-register 3D volumes reconstructed from subsets of a variable-density 3D Cartesian acquisition is shown. Accurate rigid-body motion correction was possible for undersampling factors as high as a factor of 125 in a brain imaging application employing a 32-channel head coil. This enables efficient retrospective motion correction without loss of scan efficiency and without the need for any specialized MR hardware. This approach may help reduce the incidence of failed scans due to motion, potentially leading to a reduction for the need for sedation in pediatric patients.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["888"]}
{"title": "Single-shot turbo spin echo acquisition for in vivo cardiac diffusion MRI\n", "abstract": " Diffusion MRI offers the ability to noninvasively characterize the microstructure of myocardium tissue and detect disease related pathology in cardiovascular examination. This study investigates the feasibility of in vivo cardiac diffusion MRI under free-breathing condition. A high-speed imaging technique, correlation imaging, is used to enable single-shot turbo spin echo for free-breathing cardiac data acquisition. The obtained in vivo cardiac diffusion-weighted images illustrate robust image quality and minor geometry distortions. The resultant diffusion scalar maps show reliable quantitative values consistent with those previously published in the literature. It is demonstrated that this technique has the potential for in vivo free-breathing cardiac diffusion MRI.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["888"]}

{"title": "Ordering projections for magnetic resonance\n", "abstract": " Example apparatus and methods order projections in a 3D MRI acquisition to achieve improved equidistant spacing or to achieve improved adherence to a target distribution. The equidistant or target spacing may exist in k-space and/or in kt-space. In one embodiment, the improved equidistant spacing is a substantially uniform spacing. The substantially uniform spacing may be achieved using a modification of a charge repulsion analysis that treats points of projections that intersect the surface of a 3D volume to be imaged as point charges distributed on the 3D volume. In another embodiment, the target spacing may be uniform, non-uniform, uniform in parts and non-uniform in other parts, and other combinations.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["888"]}
{"title": "Clinical & Cellular Immunology\n", "abstract": " The expression of immunoglobulins by cancer cells have been known for two decades. However, the mechanisms of action behind these cancerous immunoglobulins (cIgG) are not well understood and may be different from immunoglobulins secreted by normal B lymphocytes. Therefore, the structural and functional roles of cIgG have been actively investigated to resolve this mystery. A monoclonal antibody, RP215, was generated in 1987 and was shown to react with a carbohydrate-associated epitope localized mainly on the heavy chains of cIgG but not on normal immunoglobulins. The knowledge of cIgG has been greatly advanced by using RP215 as a unique probe. Not only was RP215 shown to act as an anti-cIgG to induce apoptosis of cultured cancer cells in vitro/in vivo, it was also shown to elicit complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) reactions to trigger lysis of cancer cells. It has now been established that besides serving to preserve growth/proliferation of cancer cells by capturing growth factors from the human serum, cIgG may also interact with certain human serum proteins which may be harmful to cancer cells. Thus, the hypothesis of dual functional roles of cIgG can be adequately explained in cancer immunology. Furthermore, RP215 may also be used to target cancer cells with surface bound cIgG for development of antibodybased anti-cancer drugs, provided that bioequivalent humanized RP215 is available for preclinical and clinical studies of immunotherapy.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["888"]}

The data set includes data acquired at two or more echo times (TE) per repetition (TR) and an element in the data set is sampled two or more times as a function of a non-Cartesian trajectory that crosses itself at least once. The process also includes controlling the MRI apparatus to reconstruct an image of the object to be imaged from the data set.

{"title": "Image reconstruction from 3D non-Cartesian data employing a combined conjugate gradient and denoising algorithm\n", "abstract": " 3D radial acquisitions (eg VIPR [1]) are attractive for applications where k-space is highly undersampled due to the incoherent aliasing artifacts produced. This makes these trajectories suitable for use with compressed sensing (CS) reconstructions [2]. CS MRI typically formulates the reconstruction as an inverse problem where the cost function to be minimized has both a data fidelity term and a sparsity promoting penalty term based on the L1 norm. In contrast enhanced MR angiography (CE-MRA) with precontrast subtraction, the vessel images are sparse and the L1 norm can be applied directly in the image domain. An alternative reconstruction approach proposed by Adluru et. al.[3], uses an iterative projection onto convex sets (POCS) framework. In this case, the image estimate is alternately: 1.) projected onto a data fidelity term and 2) denoised using the non-local means (NLM) algorithm. In this work we propose a CG-POCS algorithm suitable for combined CS and parallel imaging reconstruction of images from undersamled 3D non-Cartesian data. The proposed conjugate gradient and denoising (CGDN) algorithm requires very few iterations and does not require the tuning of any regularization parameters.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["888"]}
{"title": "Throughtime spiral GRAPPA for real-time cardiac imaging\n", "abstract": " Introduction: Accelerated data acquisition followed by parallel imaging reconstruction has been used in cardiac imaging to reduce imaging times and avoid artifacts due to motion. Coupled with non-Cartesian trajectories, such parallel imaging techniques can yield images with high acceleration factors with little residual aliasing. Recently, a method has been proposed which improves the radial GRAPPA technique by employing a through-time calibration scheme [1]. This through time calibration involves generating GRAPPA weights by using similar kernel patterns through k-space, as in standard GRAPPA, but also through time to improve the reconstruction quality. Although frame rates of 20 frames/sec can be achieved with through-time radial GRAPPA, the k-space coverage efficiency of the radial trajectory is limited when compared to others. In contrast, spiral trajectories can be designed which offer faster traversal through k-space, thereby offering a much faster image acquisition with a lower acceleration factor than the radial trajectory. In this abstract, through-time spiral GRAPPA is demonstrated for real-time cardiac imaging with frame rates of 56 frames/sec (a temporal resolution of 17.9 ms/image, R= 12). Materials and Methods: A spiral trajectory which covers a 1282 matrix in 48 spiral arms was designed using Matlab code written by Brian Hargreaves [3, 4]. This variable density spiral offers full coverage of the central 10x10 region of k-space with only 4 spiral arms, and is 0th and 1st gradient moment compensated for flow insensitivity [5] and compatibility with a TrueFISP acquisition. This trajectory was implemented with the following\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["888"]}
