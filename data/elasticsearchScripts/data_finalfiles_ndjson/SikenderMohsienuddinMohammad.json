{"title": "Continuous Integration and Automation\n", "abstract": " Current IT strategies depend largely on the ability of companies to push changes/features/fixes in an agile and error-free manner. The need for automation increases dramatically as technology advances. Waterfall software development techniques have been replaced by agile software development approaches in the last decades. In this shift, companies, operations, and software developers are unquestionably relatively close to the shared goals. To promote this merger, the industry offers a large range of open source and proprietary solutions. Technologies have increased themselves and thus new techniques have been developed, namely continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery (CDE) and permanent deployment (CD), assisted by all of the above mentioned open source and proprietary solution. Automation is the primary requirement for DevOps, and DevOps's main concept is\" Automate everything.\" DevOps automation commences from the coding on the developer machine until the code is run and then the application and system are controlled in production. The whole DevOps pipeline includes continuous integration, ongoing testing, and continuous deployment, including live application monitoring. The main focus of DevOps practice is the design and configuration of automated infrastructure and software delivery. DevOps practice depends heavily on automation, to implement for a few hours, and to execute frequently across different platforms. Automation in DevOps, therefore, promotes speed, greater precision, consistent, and reliable delivery rates.

{"title": "Security automation in Information technology\n", "abstract": " Security automation has been a major issue for many companies in the fight against rising cyber threats enabled by new cloud network attacks and proliferating the Internet of Things. A recent survey by the threat detection and hunting company Fidelis Cybersecurity has revealed this trend among 300 CISOs, CIOs, CTOs, architects, engineers, and analysts studied in a range of industries. More than half of the professionals analyzed (57 percent) said that their companies are concerned with a lack of automation. Cybersecurity automation is one of the developments in information technology. Automating humandriven, and repeatable processes will focus on the more productive problem-solving tasks within organizations and individuals. Focusing on these issues will foster innovation and contribute to a more robust organization from a cyber-security point of view. Automation also adds to the complexity of information systems in an organization and as malicious targets grow, cybersecurity initiatives must be prepared to implement automated cybersecurity solutions. As long as the information is available, the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the cybersecurity programs must be safeguarded. In most industrial industries, automation is the main force of transition. By 2030, the automation industry is expected to completely replace over 800 million workers and technology transforms our way of working and organizing and communicating with others. The almost constant occurrence of data breaches suggests that it does not stop so that organizations are unable to have long-term reservations regarding security automation concepts and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "68\n", "authors": ["1967"]}

However, DevOps is also associated with agile as well as continuous software development delivery approaches, given its increasing importance. The study of DevOps follows which are the roots, acceptance, integration, and priorities with agile, lean, and ongoing delivery strategies in software development. DevOps phenomenon was influenced by the development of agile software, based on lean principles. Successful DevOps deployment needs the agile development of software. DevOps is end-to-end automation in developing and delivering software. No one could approach it with a cook book like approach, but most developers would benefit from improving connectivity between previously isolated creation and activity silos. Even though agile software development methodologies are more and more common, many organizations have discovered that they have not reached a frequent release rate, largely because of the various departmental features in silos. Organizations have shifted towards DevOps to remove these silos. Companies are increasingly introducing DevOps as digitization continue. There are three different phases of the agile transition to DevOps: agile, ongoing integration, and constant delivery. Based on a comprehensive case study done in an enterprise with a long background of DevOps, we detect a fundamental disturbance in the soft ability and patterns of communication that software teams are supposed to possess.", "num_citations": "61\n", "authors": ["1967"]}

Research has shown that business risks related to information technology risk management can be considered and adopted within an organization or enterprise. The study has been demonstrated that some organizations have a well-laid enterprise risk management set out. In this case, therefore, risk management is seen as part of enterprise risk management. The study will also further expound on the risk management methodology, which constitutes a generic framework. The framework must, therefore, be considered as a risk management exercise. Based on a review of literature, the risk management procedure has taken into account risk assessment that ENISA has over time, reviewed the process to parameterize the entire risk management process. Risk identification states that there can be potential losses when threats, assets vulnerabilities, consequences, and related business processes are not considered. Therefore risk management in information technology must revolve around integrating risk management through the system development life cycle.

The findings indicate that the simulation hypothesis is the belief that everything is a digital simulation. This scientific theory is the systematic technique that must be followed for any appropriate scientific endeavors. The relationship between philosophy in the context of the hypothesis and quantitative experimental research is continually established with this approach. The scientific method has evolved to include a modern phase that includes the use of computer simulations and simulation experiments. Computer models may be used in modeling experiments to assess theories until they are tested experimentally as they are integrated into hypothesis formulation. An iterative input between these experiments and existing theories makes it possible to improve the hypothesis preliminarily and create smarter research protocols. Technological advancements would eventually lead to the creation of automated human superintelligence, which will in turn lead to the creation of simulations that can help us truly comprehend the world. This lends credence to the notion that superintelligence currently exists and has produced simulations that humans already occupy.

Their classification techniques are consistent with the predictions of various sequence-based human protein properties, such as the structure of amino acids, the structure of pseudo amino acids, and correlational triads. This paper will focus on the SARS-CoV-2 virus, hepatitis E virus-human, and hepatitis B virus-human PPIs to illustrate how machine learning techniques are used to predict a sequence-based viral to host interaction. This research can promote the detection of possible targets for the more efficient production of antiviral drugs, which have now affected the entire world. The basic well-known automated machine learning methods are widely implemented to predict PPIs, such as Random Forest, Na\u00efve Bayes, and SVM, are used to determine the output measure focused on five-fold methods of crossvalidations. In the last phase of viral infections in the host, protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play an important role. Human cells, however, are made up of a vast number of proteins. Consequently, it is just not possible to verify all different combinations of interactions through laboratory experiments. It contributes to the emergence of different computational techniques to predict and further verify PPIs in between virus and human proteins through biological experimentation. For drug usage, an understanding of how the PPIs virus proteins associate with cells of the host for reproduction and survival is important.
