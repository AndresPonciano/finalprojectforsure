{"title": "Subtitling norms for television: An exploration focussing on extralinguistic cultural references\n", "abstract": " In most subtitling countries, those lines at the bottom of the screen are the most read medium of all, for which reason they deserve all the academic attention they can get. This monograph represents a large-scale attempt to provide such attention, by exploring the norms of subtitling for television. It does so by empirically investigating a large corpus of television subtitles from Scandinavia, one of the bastions of subtitling, along with other European data. The aim of the book is twofold: first, to provide an advanced and comprehensive model for investigating translation problems in the form of Extralinguistic Cultural References (ECRs). Second, to empirically explore current European television subtitling norms, and to look into future developments in this area. This book will be of interest to anyone interested in gaining access to state-of-the-art tools for translation analysis, or in learning more about the norms of subtitling, based on empirically reliable and current material.", "num_citations": "421\n", "authors": ["1829"]}

If you have your mind set on watching the Royal Shakespeare Company perform The Merchant of Venice, you are not likely to find it interchangeable with Britney Spears performing \u2018Oops (I did it Again)\u2019.

The FAR model is based on error analysis and has a penalty score system that allows the assessor to pinpoint which area (s) need (s) improvement, which should make it useful for education and feedback. It is a tentative and generalised model that can be localised using norms from guidelines, commissioner specs, best practice etc. The model was developed using existing models, empirical data, best practice and recent eye-tracking studies and it was tried and tested on Swedish fansubs.", "num_citations": "63\n", "authors": ["1829"]}

{"title": "Conducting experimental research in audiovisual translation (AVT): A position paper\n", "abstract": " Experimental studies on AVT have grown incrementally over the past decade. This growing body of research has explored several aspects of AVT reception and production using behavioural measures such as eye tracking, as well as venturing into physiological measures such as electroencephalography (EEG), galvanic skin response, and heart rate. As a novel approach to the field of AVT, the experimental approach has borrowed heavily from other fields with established experimental traditions, such as psycholinguistics, psychology, and cognitive science. However, these methodologies are often not implemented with the same rigour as in the disciplines from which they were taken, making for highly eclectic and, at times, inconsistent practices. The absence of a common framework and best practice for experimental research in AVT poses significant risk in addition to the potential reputational damage. Some of the most important risks are: the duplication of efforts, studies that cannot be replicated due to a lack of methodological standardisation and rigour, and findings that are, at best, impossible to generalise from and, at worst, invalid. Given the growing body of work in AVT taking a quasi-experimental approach, it is time to consolidate our position and establish a common framework in order to ensure the integrity of our endeavours. This chapter analyses problems and discusses solutions specifically related to the multidisciplinary nature of experimental AVT research. In so doing, it aims to set the course for future experimental research in AVT, in order to gain credibility in the wider scientific community and contributes new insights to the fields\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "52\n", "authors": ["1829"]}
{"title": "Audiovisual translation\u2013in general and in Scandinavia\n", "abstract": " This article gives an overview of different modes of audiovisual translation (AVT). It surveys both intralingual and interlingual forms of AVT. Intralingual forms of AVT are forms of transfer of linguistic material within the same language, mainly for the use of people with hearing or sight disabilities. In these forms the language is not altered, but the semiotic code is, e.g. from spoken to written in subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing, or from visual to spoken as in audio description. In interlingual forms of AVT, translation proper takes place, as one natural language is substituted for (as in dubbing) or accompanied by (as in subtitling) a translation into another natural language. Furthermore, the article explores how the various forms of AVT are used in Scandinavia, which is \u2018a bastion of subtitling\u2019, and comes to the conclusion that even though subtitling is clearly predominant, the picture is complex and other forms\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "42\n", "authors": ["1829"]}

There are currently about 800 variable-region sequences known, whereas there are only 16 deposited Fab structures.

While for many protein families the presence of 16 highly homologous structures would enable accurate modeling of new family members by homology, the hypervariability of combining site sequences and structures precludes this. To solve this problem we have developed an algorithm (CAMAL) that exploits the knowledge base of protein structures but adds to it the power of conformational search and the subtlety of energy screening. The accuracy that this algorithm is able to achieve leads to the possibility that, with further development, extensive use of X-ray crystallography for antibody structure determination will become\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "35\n", "authors": ["1829"]}

{"title": "On the subtitling of visualized metaphors\n", "abstract": " There has been a great interest in metaphors in translation in recent years, but few scholars have taken into consideration the extra complexities that are involved when translation takes place in audiovisual media. This paper seeks to remedy that, by qualitatively investigating how visualised metaphors in the TV series Yes, Prime Minister, and other audiovisual sources, have been translated into Swedish subtitles. When a metaphor is visualised, the vehicle of the metaphor is visible on screen, and this means that there is ambiguity between the literal and the figurative sense of the metaphor, with one sense coming through one discourse channel and the other coming via another of the discourse channels that makes up the polysemiotic text. This may cause serious translation crisis points and put severe constraints on the options available to the subtitler if unintended intersemiotic tension is to be avoided. This paper puts forward the theories necessary for handling these complexities and also offers some advice as to what strategies can be useful for solving these translation problems. The results indicate that it is a fairly rare translation problem, and one which can often be solved using conventional strategies. However, occasionally, it creates nearly unsolvable obstacles that cannot be solved without intersemiotic tension.", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["1829"]}

These days, the most influential force driving subtitling norms is arguably the global video on demand (VOD) providers. This paper investigates the subtitling guidelines of VOD giant Netflix, in search of the question: How local are interlingual subtitling norms for streamed television?

Even models with only a few million polygons cannot be handled. A typical workstation has a gigabyte of memory, but these large models require an order of magnitude more. Rendering and other manipulations of polygonal models often requires that they be fully constructed in memory. Even with large amounts of swap the program will page fault, which severly increases the computation time. So, the algorithms must be parallelized and the data distributed acrosss a number of processors to handle such large models. One such class of algorithms is mesh simplification. Given R-Simp, a sequential model simplification algorithm, we derive a parallel implementation (PR-Simp). Our results show that very large models can be simplified with minimal degredation of model quality. Other advantages of PR-Simp include good speedup and scalability. Despite inherent difficulties of parallelizing mesh simplification algorithms without degradation of output quality, we believe that PR-Simp is a step in the right direction.", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["1829"]}

This paper investigates how metaphors in the British sitcom Yes, Prime Minister were subtitled into Swedish. The results show that subtitlers treat metaphors as an important language feature, less prone to omission than other features. Furthermore, monocultural metaphors, which are not shared between cultures, are subtitled using more strategies than transcultural ones.

Although the number of antibody structures is increasing rapidly\u2014at the time of writing 48 structures have been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Database (PDB)(1)\u2014the rate of structure determination will never match that of sequence acquisition. Thus, to explore fully the structural variability of antibody combining sites, encoded in immunoglobulin variable region sequences, effective structural prediction methods have become essential. Such models will have increasing utility where the structural effects of point mutations within the antibody combining site need to be assessed, where minimal perturbation strategies for the grafting of complementarity determining regions (CDRs) during the process of'humanization'are required, and even where the residues to be targeted for random mutation in the gene library methods now available (eg phage libraries) are selected in a more rational manner on the basis of their likely accessibility to antigen. In time, when the antibody sequence/structure relationship is fully understood, de novo design of antibodies will also become possible (2).

{"title": "ProcessJ: A Possible Future of Process-Oriented Design.\n", "abstract": " We propose ProcessJ as a new, more contemporary programming language that supports process-oriented design, which raises the level of abstraction and lowers the barrier of entry for parallel and concurrent programming. ProcessJ promises verifiability (eg, deadlock detection), based on Hoare\u2019s CSP model of concurrency, and existing model checkers like FDR. Process-oriented means processes compose, unlike thread-based or asynchronous message-passing models of concurrency; this means that programmers can incrementally define larger and larger concurrent processes without concern for undesirable nondeterminism or unexpected side effects. Processes at their lowest, most granular level are sequential programs; there are no global variables, so no race conditions, and the rules of parallel composition are functional in nature, not imperative, and based on the mathematically sound CSP process algebra. Collectively, these ideas raise the level of abstraction for concurrency; they were successful once before with the occam language and the Transputer. We believe their time has come again, and will not go away, in this new age of multi-core processors. Computers have finally caught up with CSP and process-oriented design.

Instead of programming the Arduino in C or C++ as is the custom, we propose using occam-\u03c0 as a language as that can help the user manage the concurrency introduced when using interrupts and help in the creation of modular, well-designed programs.

{"title": "Schedulability Analysis of Timed CSP Models Using the PAT Model Checker.\n", "abstract": " Timed CSP can be used to model and analyse real-time and concurrent behaviour of embedded control systems. Practical CSP implementations combine the CSP model of a real-time control system with prioritized scheduling to achieve efficient and orderly use of limited resources. Schedulability analysis of a timed CSP model of a system with respect to a scheduling scheme and a particular execution platform is important to ensure that the system design satisfies its timing requirements. In this paper, we propose a framework to analyse schedulability of CSP-based designs for non-preemptive fixed-priority multiprocessor scheduling. The framework is based on the PAT model checker and the analysis is done with dense-time model checking on timed CSP models. We also provide a schedulability analysis workflow to construct and analyse, using the proposed framework, a timed CSP model with scheduling from an initial untimed CSP model without scheduling. We demonstrate our schedulability analysis workflow on a case study of control software design for a mobile robot. The proposed approach provides non-pessimistic schedulability results.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1829"]}
{"title": "Error classifications for parallel message passing programs: A case study\n", "abstract": " Parallel programming poses additional challenges over sequential programming. In particular, parallel programming raises complexities in design, implementation, and debugging. In this work, we analyze the mistakes that student programmers make on several parallel programming problems so that we can better understand their difficulties. We administer surveys for several parallel programming projects that use MPI in two graduate level courses. The survey records the problems that the programmer had with respect to error type, and location in the parallel programming domain, the time spent on each, and the tool usage. We classify the types of errors that they encounter and find that a large percentage of the errors are sequential; these errors turned out to be the fastest to correct. We also found that the most time consuming errors to correct are associated with the messages in the message passing system. The results of the study raise implications that we can address in the classroom and through improved programming and debugging tools.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1829"]}

{"title": "Multilevel debugging of parallel message passing programs\n", "abstract": " Description\" Errare humanum est\"-To err is human (Hieronymus, Epistle 57, 12); this fact has been known throughout time, and inevitably this means that humans writing computer programs are bound to introduce errors. With computers operating in Frankenstein's Igor mode,'Your wish is my command', executing instructions without questioning their validity, errors introduced by humans are carried out. When adding parallel programming with message passing an error in one process can spread like a virus through message passing to other processes. Much research has been done on debugging sequential programs, and most of these theories and results apply directly to parallel programs, but the set of potential errors dramatically increases in size when introducing parallelism and message passing. Not only can one process fail, but sets of processes can deadlock, computational errors can be propagated from process to process, thus infecting otherwise correct programs. Correct programs can stop working because of the underlying implementation of the message passing system. We propose a framework for debugging parallel message passing programs: a multilevel approach that divides errors into separate groups at various levels from the well known sequential errors, such as stray pointers and array out of bound, to deadlock caused by incorrect message passing code, protocol errors and buffer allocation problems. We show the validity of this approach by developing new debugging techniques and analyses, and by implementing these in Millipede, a prototype multilevel debugger written for C programs that use the PVM message\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1829"]}

Active objects execute their methods in their own threads. The active object queues method invocations and executes them one at a time. Method invocations do not overlap, thus the object cannot be put into or seen to be in an inconsistent state. We propose an active object system implemented by extending the Java language with four new keywords: active, async, on and waitfor. We have modified Sun\u2019s open-source compiler to accept the new keywords and to translate them to regular Java code during desugaring phase.

{"title": "Recovering temporal context for relevance assessments\n", "abstract": " Relevance assessment is a key aspect of information retrieval evaluation. For a typical web search engine, an editor will look at the search engine results page and judge if the results are relevant or not.For certain types of queries, those that are time sensitive, it is desirable to be looking at the search results as soon as the event is happening. Unfortunately, editors are not always available at the right time so it is difficult to assess relevance after the fact. This is, in particular, true in the case of real-time search: the need to be present observing the results otherwise the content maybe out of date. In this paper, we present the problem of gathering relevance assessments in the absence of temporal context and suggest a technique for addressing the problem.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1829"]}
{"title": "Freightwise: ICT Framework Architecture for Freight\n", "abstract": " Freightwise is a research project and set of ICT system architectures. It establishes a Framework for comodal freight transport. It defines the main roles that need to interact. It divides the freight transport domain into manageable sub-domains and defines necessary interactions between these. The main roles are: Transport User and Transport Service Provider, supported by the Transportation Network Manager and the Transport Regulator. It has defined a generic specification of a transport service and a small set of information objects that need to be exchanged between the four main roles. This paper explores the goal, context, methodologies utilised, results and validation in multiple business cases. The paper ends with reflections on how the Framework meets business needs and how it may be revised accordingly.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1829"]}
{"title": "The Emergent Scandinavian Subtitling Norm\n", "abstract": " In the last two decades, the Scandinavian mediascape has changed radically, just as it has elsewhere in Europe and indeed, in the world. The number of broadcasters has ballooned, and many new operators have entered the screen translation scene and challenged the old national norms that were set by the translating units of the public service broadcasters. One might therefore think that the Scandinavian subtitling norms have diversified and that a number of competing norms could be found in Scandinavia. Instead, however, the norms are converging, so that the old national norms are giving way to an emergent Scandinavian subtitling norm.This paper is based on a project called Scandinavian Subtitles, which is a comparative study of the subtitling norms found in Sweden, Denmark and Norway. The project has a descriptive approach and is based on a corpus of one hundred Anglophone films and TV programmes and their Swedish, Danish and (to a certain extent) Norwegian subtitles. The material was recorded on Scandinavian TV channels over one year and has been chosen to represent multiple genres and programme types from documentaries to reality shows, with a main emphasis on fiction.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1829"]}
{"title": "High Felicity\n", "abstract": " more often than not make this form of translation true to the spirit, rather than the letter of the original. The big question in quality assessment of subtitling could then be how to achieve fidelity to the original, when much linguistic material has to be discarded. One answer could be that basic fidelity should be towards the speech acts rather than the surface structures of the Source Texts.S/he has to make an active decision on how to render the reference in the target language, in order to bridge the gap between the source and the target culture and For this, s/he has a set of different strategies to his/her disposal all of which could be felicitous (to borrow a term from Speech Act Theory) in fulfilling the task. The quality of the translation, or how felicitous it is, depends upon many factors, In order to evaluate whether a certain strategy is felicitous, it could be advantageous to draw on Skopos Theory to ascertain what the overriding goals etc. are for the translation at hand.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1829"]}
{"title": "Homogenization of subtitling norms\u2013on all fronts?\n", "abstract": " In the Scandinavian countries, as elsewhere, subtitling standards have developed in parallel, yet in some isolation from the standards of the surrounding countries. This has lead to each country developing its own norms and rules, which have become familiar to both viewers and professionals within these countries. Once in a while, scholars and professionals get together to compare their national norms, to discuss how different they are, and to ask each other whether it is not time to agree upon a common standard for the whole region. In Scandinavia, this happened in Copenhagen in 1988, where many distinguished speakers discussed the various national norms and the value of a common standard for the Scandinavian countries, which are linguistically speaking fairly similar. Nothing was decided at the conference, and as the proceedings show, the norms of the Scandinavian countries deviated significantly.A lot has happened since then. DVD technology has been introduced, the number of television channels in the EU has ballooned from 47 in 1984 to more than 1500 in 2002, and the phenomenon that I refer to as central cuing (using the same cueing, or spotting, for multiple language versions) has become widespread. Attitudes have changed as well. More and more the virtue of having a single standard for a whole region has been questioned, and professionals and scholars alike are now more keen on keeping their old standards.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1829"]}
{"title": "ENISYS: APPLYING ITS IN MULTIMODAL TRANSPORT\n", "abstract": " ENISYS is a door-to-door transport concept, using waterborne transport as a key element. Transport Chain Management System (TCMS) is a system for managing multimodal transport operations efficiently. These two elements combined can be used to establish efficient door-to-door transport operations in regions where water transport is available, without relying on extensive use of land transport infrastructure. The underlying requirement for such a solution to work is that a number of transport users cooperate to develop one, common transport solution. If each transport user wants to develop individual solutions, such operations are based on individual sub-optimisation, and not on the best possible use of resources for the best of all involved and the environment. This paper illustrates the need for a harmonised development of the transport infrastructure, and the information systems needed to use the infrastructure properly (as seen form the transport user and operator). The combined ENISYS/TCMS development is therefore a good example of practical intelligent transportation systems (ITS) realisation. It is also an example showing that such development may be realised without governmental and other public involvement.(ENISYS is a purely industrial initiative).", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1829"]}
{"title": "Antibody-combining sites: prediction and design.\n", "abstract": " For maximum value, a predicted model of an antibody-combining site should have an accuracy approaching that of an X-ray structure (1.6-2.7 A). In addition, the method by which the combining site is modelled should make no demands on the user of a sort that require arbitrary or subjective decisions to be made during the process. We have made substantial progress towards this objective and some recent results are reviewed. In addition, we describe how the modelling protocols developed can aid in the design of novel features within the antibody-combining site. The particular design example reported here suggests an approach for the introduction of metal-binding sites to create metallo-antibodies. This type of modification may be useful in the design of immunobiosensors, the induction of catalytic activity or simply as an alternative to metal chelates in the preparation of antibodies for imaging.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1829"]}
