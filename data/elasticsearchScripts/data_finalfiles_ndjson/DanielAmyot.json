UCMs are a scenario-based software engineering technique most useful at the early stages of software development.

UCMs provide a behavioural framework for evaluating and making architectural decisions at a high level of design. Architectural decisions may be based on performance analysis of UCMs. UCMs bridge the gap between requirements and design by combining behaviour and structure in one view and by flexibly allocating scenario responsibilities to architectural components.

In the first stages of common development processes, telecommunications features, services, and functionalities are defined in terms of informal requirements and visual descriptions. As these descriptions grow and evolve, they quickly become error-prone and difficult to understand. Consequently, designs can hardly be checked or validated against such descriptions. This thesis proposes an innovative methodology named Specification-Validation Approach with LOTOS and UCMs (SPEC-VALU E), which tackles these problems using two notations. The first notation, called Use Case Maps (UCMs), is used to capture and integrate functional requirements in terms of causal scenarios. Scenarios describing system views, uses, and services are becoming a common method of capturing functional requirements of reactive and distributed systems. They are particularly appropriate to represent behavioral aspects so that various stakeholders can understand them. In addition to these general properties of scenarios, UCMs can help reasoning about system-wide functionalities at a high level of abstraction. Integrating UCMs together also helps avoiding many undesirable interactions, usually resulting from the composition of different scenarios, before the generation of prototypes. The second notation is the formal specification language LOTOS . It will be shown that UCM scenarios bound to architectural components can be translated into high-level LOTOS specifications.

This catalogue should be used to better characterize services and enable consumers to perform advanced applications such as NFP-aware service selection. We have identified an initial catalogue of SOA-related NFPs that are relevant from the perspective of consumers (as opposed to providers). Then, we have designed an online survey and invited international SOA experts in many application areas to criticize the relevance and definitions of the proposed NFPs and to enhance this catalogue.

Despite their importance, many decisions are still made based on experience and intuition rather than on evidence supported by rigorous approaches. Decisions are often made this way because of lack of data, unknown relationships between data and goals, conflicting goals, and poorly understood risks. This research presents a goal-oriented, business intelligence-supported methodology for decision making. The methodology, which is iterative, allows enterprises to begin with limited data, discover required data to build their models, capture stakeholders goals, and model threats, opportunities, and their impact.

A pattern-based framework that lays down a foundation for capturing knowledge about business goals and processes and customising it for specific organisations in a given domain is hence valuable. For many reasons however, the problems and solutions within a business domain are constantly changing. Consequently, such framework can be useful only if it provides mechanisms for evolving pattern families over time. In this paper, we propose and formalise four mechanisms for evolving a goal-driven pattern family targeting the modelling of business goals, business processes, and traceability links between these two views.

In this context, it is imperative for organizations to continuously monitor their performance and adjust when there is a need or an opportunity to do so.

Unfortunately, there is a huge cognitive gap between a requirements view of a strategic initiative articulated in terms of business goals, processes, and performance on one hand, and an implementation view of BI monitoring articulated in terms of databases, networks, and computational processing.

{"title": "Location-aware business process management for real-time monitoring of a cardiac care process.\n", "abstract": " Long wait times are a global issue in the Canadian healthcare system. Patient flow management relies on flow managers to manually detect, investigate and mitigate wait time issues. However, existing data that could support this activity is usually not accurate (because of possible human errors), incomplete, late, and scattered across various information systems in a typical hospital. Yet, in the case of cardiac patients, ensuring a prompt, smooth and continuous care delivery becomes extremely important and motivates improvement of data support for patient flow management activities. This paper presents the development of a location-aware business process management system (LA-BPMS) for monitoring a cardiac care delivery process in a hospital and in real-time. The system provides a better visibility of process execution to patient flow managers who can rely on accurate and real-time information about patient process states, as well as wait time measurements to control patient flow efficiently. We show how an intelligent approach of combining location awareness and business process automation allow this to be possible.

{"title": "A virtual patient navigation application for lung cancer assessment patients\n", "abstract": " A virtual patient navigator is a web/mobile application that helps patients with lung cancer diagnosis reduce their anxiety and uncertainties. In particular, lung cancer patients easily become overwhelmed when having to manage information overload, many appointments with different instructions and locations, and recommendations on how to improve their lifestyle. Existing solutions such as paper-based patient navigators provide much reliable information but are limited in terms of dynamic updates and do not provide opportunities for interactions between care providers and patients. In this paper, we propose a new web-based, mobile, and user-friendly virtual patient navigator application named Care Ami, which incorporates the information found in an existing paper-based navigator along with new features such as remote updates to personal care paths and calendars, personalized navigation guidance\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1465"]}
{"title": "What can information systems do for regulators? A review of the state-of-practice in Canada\n", "abstract": " Regulations constitute a rich source of requirements for software systems, especially so for information systems that handle sensitive data. However, there has been little attention paid to regulators and their requirements for managing the regulatory lifecycle. This paper presents a study of the state-of-practice for regulators in Canada by examining seven Government of Canada (GoC) agencies responsible for regulations. In each case, we attempt to capture the context within which regulations are created, the motivation behind these regulations, and the practices related to their design, enforcement, and review. Our aims are to understand how regulators currently design, monitor, and assess regulations and other regulatory instruments in their respective domains, and to identify opportunities where information system (IS) solutions can be applied to improve practice.

{"title": "Predictive Analytics to Support Real-Time Management in Pathology Facilities\n", "abstract": " Predictive analytics can provide valuable support to the effective management of pathology facilities. The introduction of new tests and technologies in anatomical pathology will increase the volume of specimens to be processed, as well as the complexity of pathology processes. In order for predictive analytics to address managerial challenges associated with the volume and complexity increases, it is important to pinpoint the areas where pathology managers would most benefit from predictive capabilities. We illustrate common issues in managing pathology facilities with an analysis of the surgical specimen process at the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine (DPLM) at The Ottawa Hospital, which processes all surgical specimens for the Eastern Ontario Regional Laboratory Association. We then show how predictive analytics could be used to support management. Our proposed approach can be\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1465"]}
{"title": "Towards systems for increased access to justice using goal modeling\n", "abstract": " Emerging cyberjustice systems are in need of relevant requirements engineering approaches, for example, to provide citizens with better access to the judicial system. In this context, this paper proposes the use of goal modeling for developing Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) systems in Canada. With ODR, the use of technology has the potential of increasing access to justice at low cost. We argue that a goal-oriented view is needed to capture early requirements about who are the stakeholders, what goals and quality criteria they have and how the various enabling technologies can be combined to meet these goals. A particular case is made for the use of the Goal-oriented Requirement Language (GRL), which covers the above and enables trade-off analysis as well as the introduction of indicators for measurement activities. GRL also has the potential of being used to guide some run-time decisions in ODR systems.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1465"]}
{"title": "Efficient Privacy-Preserving Identity Scheme for Electronic Validation of Phase 1 Clinical Trials\n", "abstract": " New drug studies are essential to advance the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s ability to fight diseases. These studies are typically performed in four phases. We are interested in \u201cphase 1\u201d clinical trials where the goal is to evaluate the safety of a new drug. Contract research organizations recruit participants for their studies and need to verify electronically certain criteria without revealing the identity of these participants to other organizations. We outline some potential attacks against current identity representation schemes. Afterwards, we present privacy-preserving techniques to represent the identity of a participant in a scheme where operations can be performed efficiently and accurately. Our methods and scheme can also be applied to other domains to preserve an individual\u2019s privacy.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1465"]}
{"title": "Consented consumer-centric non-functional property description and composition for SOA-based applications\n", "abstract": " Non-functional properties (NFPs) play an important role in the service-oriented architecture (SOA). Consumer-centric NFPs are the NFPs that should be included in a service description to help service consumers decide whether a given service suits their needs. They can hence be used to enable NFP-based service selection and composition. However, nowadays, NFPs are often simply not advertised or are described in ad-hoc proprietary ways. Three important factors impede on the proper handling of NFPs in service descriptions: 1) the neglect of consumer perspectives in SOA; 2) the lack of adequate descriptive mechanisms for a number of NFPs; 3) a good understanding of NFP composability. This paper contributes a concrete syntax for an externally consented catalogue of 17 consumer-centric NFPs, together with composition algorithms that can be effectively used for defining, selecting, and composing\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1465"]}
{"title": "A tool for simple and efficient clinical protocol evaluation\n", "abstract": " Researchers need to evaluate newly thought clinical protocols for validity and performance. A main challenge for such evaluations is the lack of real-world data sets due to the private nature of patient information. Researchers resort to synthetic data in order to simulate the real-world counterpart. We present a tool for researchers to increase their confidence in the evaluations they perform by allowing them to run their evaluations on a large number of synthetic data sets efficiently. This tool is used for distributing the evaluation on multiple machines in parallel, hence reducing processing time by the number of machines used, and for monitoring and merging the results. It allows the comparison of multiple algorithms and includes filters based on name length and record field selection to evaluate the effectiveness of algorithms in that regard. It also addresses the firewall limitations of current laboratory infrastructures\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1465"]}
{"title": "Narrowing the gaps in concern-driven development\n", "abstract": " Concern-Driven Development (CDD) promises improved productivity, reusability, and maintainability because high-level concerns that are important to stakeholders are encapsulated regardless of how these concerns are distributed over the system structure. However, to truly capitalize on the benefits promised by CDD, concerns need to be encapsulated across software development phases, i.e., across different types of models at different levels of abstraction. Model-Driven Engineering plays an important role in this context as the automated transformation of concern-oriented models (a) allows a software engineer to use the most appropriate modeling notation for a particular task, (b) automates error-prone tasks, and (c) avoids duplication of modeling effort. The earlier transformations can be applied in a CDD process, the greater the potential cost savings. Hence, we report on our experiences in applying tool\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1465"]}

{"title": "\"Union is power\" analyzing families of goal models using union models\n", "abstract": " A goal model family is a set of related goal models that conform to the same metamodel, with commonalities and variabilities between models. Such families stem from the evolution of initial models into several versions over time and/or the variation of models over the space dimension (eg, products). In contexts where there are several versions/variations of a goal model, analyzing a set of related models with typical similarities, one model at a time, often involves redundant computations and may require repeated user assistance (eg, for interactive analysis) and laborious activities. This paper proposes the use of union models as first-class artifacts to analyze families of goal models, in order to improve performance of language-specific analysis procedures. The paper empirically evaluates the performance gain resulting from adapting (or lifting) an existing analysis technique specific to the Goal-oriented\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1465"]}
{"title": "Goal Modeling for FinTech Certification\n", "abstract": " With an increasing investment in digital assets such as cryptocurrencies, many financial technology (FinTech) systems and custodians have become safety critical. Yet, current FinTech system development approaches often lack the rigorous safety practices found in other certified industries. This paper focuses on the development of goal models for analyzing a FinTech\u2019s system stakeholders, goals, and processes, as a first step towards system certification. A strategic dependency model is used to identify the interfaces of the system with its context, and is enriched with an operational/process view using Use Case Maps. This goal/process combination brought much in the identification of stakeholders, critical resources, priorities, and appropriate safety controls.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1465"]}
{"title": "Goal Model Integration: Advanced Relationships and Rationales Documentation\n", "abstract": " Integrating new technology in a business environment raises many challenges such as ensuring that this technology meets stakeholder requirements and contributes to organizational goals. However, before analyzing the impact of technology on requirements and goals, goal models of the current context and of the proposed technology should be merged to reflect the whole context. Existing merging approaches mainly focus on merging partial views of a goal model, which belong to one context. However, merging different goal models to reflect one holistic context, such as in technology integration, is not addressed. This paper presents a Goal Integration Method targeting different initial contexts, enabling completeness and consistency analysis of the integrated goal model, and providing traceability to rationales and decisions made at integration time.

{"title": "Telepresence: a case study of a timethread-LOTOS approach to multimedia system design\n", "abstract": " Telepresence is a very complete multimedia system. The complexity of such real-time and distributed system makes its design a true challenge. In this tutorially-oriented document, we will try to use some techniques based on the timethread notation [Buh 93 & BuC93] and the formal language LOTOS [ISO 88] to help specifying a first design. The method used follows the timethread-LOTOS approach presented in [Amy 93] and [BoA 93] and the timethread-centered design process presented in [Buh 93]. This approach aims the soft integration of formal methods in the design process in order to make them more appealing and cost effective for industries. For this reason, the chosen formal technique used (LOTOS) is more or less hidden from the designer. This language will however be able to support different types of manipulations.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1465"]}
