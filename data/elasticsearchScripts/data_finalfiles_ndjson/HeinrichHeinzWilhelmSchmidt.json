In our model, a temporal interval as an execution duration is assigned to every workflow task.

We extend workflow nets (WF-nets) with time intervals and call the new nets Time WF-nets (TWF-nets). Extending our previous results on timed Petri nets, we show that certain behavioural properties of workflow processes modelled in TWF-nets can be verified.

Overlap-detection tools can pinpoint interconnections in a corpus of documents and could be used in search engines. We describe a web-accessible text registry based on signature extraction. We extract a small but diagnostic signature from each registered text for permanent storage and comparison against other stored signatures.

Presently there is already much research effort in the areas of service discovery and orchestration, business process modelling, and the semantic web. While these are all important aspects for moving towards the pervasive adoption of SOC, most existing work assumes the existence of black box services, with little attention given to how such services might be developed in a systematic manner. Furthermore, a precise description of what constitutes a service-oriented system is yet to be formally defined, and the overall impact of service-orientation on the software design process is not well understood. Therefore, this work presents a formal model covering design artefacts in service-oriented systems and their structural and behavioural properties. The model promotes a better understanding of service-oriented design concepts, and in particular, enables the definition of software metrics in an unambiguous, formal manner. Defining such a model and metrics is an initial step towards deriving a comprehensive service-oriented software design methodology.", "num_citations": "50\n", "authors": ["467"]}

{"title": "Object test coverage using finite state machines\n", "abstract": " Objects have been described as having identity, state and behaviour, but there are differing views as to what are an object's states. For a programmer using an object-oriented programming language, the state is the current values of all the attributes, hidden and accessible. In most object-oriented design methods, an object's state is an abstraction of this: design states are determined by the observable behaviour of the object. The difference is significant, for example the two views behave differently under inheritance, and this can make it difficult to validate an implementation against its design specification.  We describe a technique for resolving these different views of state. The representation states of an object can be partitioned into abstract states by predicates on the attributes. We relate this to an operational semantics for the object-oriented programming language Sather.  A direct implication is that the behaviour of objects can be described by finite state machines.  Since there are testing techniques based on proving the equivalence of two state machines (for example, a design specification and its implementation), it is now feasible to prove test coverage of automatically generated tests for object oriented programs to the level of abstract states.", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["467"]}

The growth of industrial automation communications is an outcome of the shift to harness the productivity and efficiency of manufacturing and process automation with a minimum of human intervention. Due to the ongoing evolution of industrial networks from Fieldbus technologies to Ethernet, a new opportunity has emerged to harness the benefits of Software Defined Networking (SDN). In this paper, we provide a brief overview of SDN in the industrial automation domain and propose a network architecture called the Software Defined Industrial Automation Network (SDIAN), with the objective of improving network scalability and efficiency. To match the specific considerations and requirements of having a deterministic system in an industrial network, we propose two solutions for flow creation: the Pro-active Flow Installation Scheme and the Hybrid Flow Installation Scheme. We analytically quantify the proposed solutions that alleviate the overhead incurred from the flow setup. The analytical model is verified using Monte Carlo simulations. We also evaluate the SDIAN architecture and analyze the network performance of the modified topology using the Mininet emulator. We further list and motivate SDIAN features and report on an experimental food processing plant demonstration featuring Raspberry Pi as a software-defined controller instead of traditional proprietary Programmable Logic Controllers.

{"title": "Dynamic dispatch in object-oriented languages\n", "abstract": " Dynamic binding in object-oriented languages is perhaps the most important semantic aspect of these languages. At the same time it can contribute to inefficiency and lack of robustness because it incurs lookup overheads on function calls and hinders the compiler determining the exact type of objects held in variables or returned by functions. This may, for instance, preclude inlining of small functions or attribute offset computation at compile time. Yet attribute accesses are the most frequently executed operations. As a result, to regain lost performance, OO programmers are tempted to break the encapsulation of classes or want explicit control over dynamic dispatch, trading off extensibility.  In the implementation of parallel object-oriented languages the additional complication arises that object accesses may require more expensive remote memory accesses. Lookup at the call may be inappropriate if the code has to be executed on a different processor and there perhaps has a different address.  This paper summarizes dispatching as addressed in several modern object-oriented languages. We then describe and benchmark fast and exible dispatch schemes that we are currently implementing on SPARC based workstations and multi-processors. These involve elements of C++ virtual function tables and Eiffel's and Sather's ability to redefine abstract functions as attributes. Initial benchmarks seem to promise improved efficiency on a range of modern RISC based architectures.", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["467"]}

Most current implementations include a comfortable suite of Lisp support tools in cluding an Emacs Lisp editor, an interpreter, an incremental compiler, a debugger, and an inspector that together promote rapid prototyping and design. What else might one want from a system? We argue that static typing yields earlier error detec tion, greater robustness, and higher efficiency and that greater simplicity and more orthogonality in the language constructs leads to a shorter learning curve and more in tuitive programming. These elements can be found in Eiffel and a new object-oriented language, Sather, that we are developing at leS!. Language simplicity and static typ ing are not for free,\u00b7 though. Programmers have to pay with loss of polymorphism and flexibility in prototyping. We give a short comparison of CLOS, Eiffel and Sather, addressing both language and environment issues.

We define a modified suffix tree that only considers chunks starting at the beginning of words and we show how the algorithm can work on this structure.

One of the main arguments against widespread usage of the structure is its space requirement. This paper describes a new structure called suffix vector, which is not only better in terms of storage space but also simpler than the most efficient suffix tree representation known to date. Alternatives of storage representations are discussed and a linear-time construction algorithm is also proposed in this paper. Space requirement of the suffix vector structure is compared to the space requirement of alternative suffix tree representations.

To improve the effectiveness of the regression testing required for extensive fault detection, test cases have to be prioritized. The test cases with the higher chance of capturing faults are executed earlier in the series. This prioritization enables faster feedback for fixing more faults earlier. Various prioritization techniques have been proposed based on the information provided by offline (static) test execution history on previous versions of the software. In this paper, we propose a family of new test case prioritization techniques, which utilize online (dynamic) information about the locations of previously revealed faults in the detection of other faults. Our empirical studies demonstrate that the new techniques are more effective than the existing traditional test case prioritization techniques.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["467"]}

We identify design, composition, distribution and management as key stages of this model and propose an Intelligent Collaborative Care Management (ICCM) System as its realisation. The distribution and management stages are implemented as multi-agent systems. Agents in the distribution stage carry out domain-specific negotiation and distribution processes for the assignment of tasks in the care plan. Through the agents in the management stage, we introduce the notion of \u201cfailure prevention\u201d and \u201cadherence support\u201d in contrast to \u201cfailure recovery\u201d in planning. The key to failure prevention is to identify what has to be carried out to prevent care plan failures.

{"title": "Typed formal concept analysis\n", "abstract": " Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) appears to be ideal for interpreting data in domains that are a-priori unstructured. In our research we focus on complex contexts with very large and rapidly changing numbers of real-world objects\u2013for instance, data generated on-line and tracking real-time contexts in transport, enterprise warehousing, manufacturing control or social networking activities on the web. The ontology of such contexts, ie, the types of attribute data and those of objects, and their interrelation (such as subtyping or which objects have which attributes or reference which other objects via surrogate attributes) is partly known to domain experts. Because of incomplete knowledge however, missing classes and relationships need to be inferred. In addition, domain experts need assistance in checking the partial ontology declarations against FCA interpretations added to the context. To make FCA more accessible in such applications, we explore the use of types similar to those available in object-oriented design and programming, for which methods, tools, training and skills are widely available. We present typed FCA and report about supporting tools. We also introduce typed priming and show that it is consistent with conceptual scaling without requiring the generation of binary lattices.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["467"]}

{"title": "Towards an intelligent agent framework to manage and coordinate collaborative care\n", "abstract": " Our project investigates computational models of collaboration between entities involved in the coordination and management of complex, consumer care provision systems. We use the agent paradigm to assist service providers in the coordination and decision processes that enable the management of patient care. One important aspect is to adapt dynamically to changing patient situations, service provider characteristics and changing quality requirements. This paper discusses how we have built a Multi-Agent System to (a) plan the delivery of healthcare services,(b) negotiate the responsibility of healthcare providers to provide services (reaching agreements), and (c) ensure that the selected team of providers and patients adhere to careplans (maintaining agreements). Coordination of healthcare services is a powerful example of a complex domain requiring models of collaborating agents that make agreements and adhere to them. The scope of our project is on investigating settings where collaborators are unreliable and non-conformant, ie, where agreements are made but are not always maintained. This issue not only arises in collaborative healthcare management, but also in many other service industries, including the telecommunications and electricity supply. In the healthcare domain, better knowledge of patients and their needs can lead to dramatic improvements in the quality, safety, and efficiency of care provision, particularly in relation to patients suffering from chronic disease. However, a realisation of these benefits requires an adequate technological infrastructure.

In addition to the information contained in the query itself, data derived from the environment in which the query is situated is used to further trim down the search space. Sources for this derivation process are data about the task under investigation as well as the history of user interactions.

An implementation of the arti cial neural networks used for these tasks is based on ICSIM, a connectionist simulator developed at ICSI.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["467"]}
{"title": "A High Level Net Language for Stepwise Modeling of Organizational Systems\n", "abstract": " A high level net language for modeling and analyzing the structure and behavior of socio-technical systems is introduced. These systems consist of human and technical components which are concurrently engaged in partially independent activities and are embedded in some larger organization. Action and decision processes associated with a certain system part, and information flow between that part and its environment, are graphically modelled by nets. Formally based concepts for combining separate nets allow iterative extensions, restrictions, and multiple decompositions of a system description into several overlapping hierarchies. The concepts are illustrated by a simplified registration authority such as for voting registration or for citizen registration. The paper stresses the formal background of the concepts that is necessary for computer assisted construction and analysis of complex systems.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["467"]}

{"title": "Monitoring Informed Testing for IoT\n", "abstract": " Internet of Things (IoT) systems continuously collect a large amount of data from heterogeneous \"smart objects\" through standardised service interfaces. A key challenge is how to use these data and relevant event logs to construct continuously adapted usage profiles and apply them to enhance testing methods, i.e., prioritization of tests for the testing of continuous integration of an IoT system. In addition, these usage profiles provide relevance weightings to analyse architecture and behaviour of the system. Based on the analysis, testing methods can predict specific system locations that are susceptible to error, and therefore suggest where expanded runtime monitoring is necessary. Furthermore, IoT aims to connect billions of \"smart devices\" over the network. Testing even a small IoT system connecting a few dozens of smart devices would require a network of test Virtual Machines (VMs) possibly spreading across\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["467"]}
{"title": "Spatio-Temporal Aware Testing for Complex Systems\n", "abstract": " Nowadays, more and more systems are coordinated and controlled to compose globally-distributed, highly-complex systems of systems (SoS). Existing testing methods focus on single devices and on performance characteristics from the network architecture upwards, but ignore the innate complexity caused by the spatial and temporal separation of these systems over vastly differing scales. As a result, quality assurance of today's SoS is a major challenge, especially where there is a need to consistently and robustly account for the spatial and temporal context of systems. In this paper, we propose the development of a methodology that tests the rich spatial and temporal properties specified in the spatio-temporal aware models. We illustrate our approach based on a spatio-temporal modeling and reasoning language, namely BeSpaceD. Our research highlights the opportunity of developing a comprehensive tool\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["467"]}
{"title": "Emergency Management Support by Spatial Reasoning\n", "abstract": " Emergency management benefits from techniques such as the eCall that allow an automatic transmission of vehicle data and location to initiate response operations in case of an accident. Such operations may comprise the deployment of ambulances and recovery vehicles. Based on available data one can decide on the type of ambulances, police and other recovery vehicles needed, on prioritization in case of multiple events and on strategies for an efficient management of available resources. Automatically handling these constraints which can go beyond traditional database operations and deriving decisions is a challenging problem. In this paper, we describe how\u00a0our existing spatio-temporal description and reasoning framework based on formal methods can\u00a0be used to facilitate decisions in emergency recovery situations in combination with indexing of available information.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["467"]}
{"title": "Strategic approach towards green enterprise architecture of campuses and academic institutions\n", "abstract": " Academic institutions and campuses in Australia have witnessed an increase in academic and research activities. This has increased the resource consumption and contributes to impact on environment. The growth in consumption of information technology through various initiatives such as research data repositories (ARROW, ANDS), eResearch and eLearning has contributed to the environmental impact. There is a need for universities and academic institutions to think strategically and holistically about Green Enterprise Architecture of their educational and research enterprises. We introduce a strategic approach for implementing Green Enterprise Architecture (EA) based on Total Sustainability Framework (TSF) and Total sustainability Indicator (TSI) using a case study. Application of TSI and TSF in achieving Green EA would assist universities in meeting their goals and objectives of sustainability in a holistic and balanced manner.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["467"]}

The framework and findings are generalised to include agents in any domain that adopts similar behaviour monitoring and intervention mechanisms.

The aim of this paper is twofold: (1) to develop concepts and algorithms for goal-directed service selection; and (2) to compare and reconcile our goal-directed approach with a service-oriented approach. The proposed goal-directed service selection algorithm is based on a goal-directed domain description that represents the customer objectives and the business processes. We use service component architectures with formalised contractual service process definitions as a software engineering approach to architectural design and realisation of service-oriented architectures (SOA). The comparison aims to understand the relationship between and benefits of a goal-directed approach and a service oriented approach\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["467"]}

{"title": "Using a notion of safety in petri nets to analyse real-time systems\n", "abstract": " The Petri net formalism has been used to model many types of systems, in particular, concurrent, distributed and non-deterministic. Important system properties, such as liveness and safety, can be studied based on the system's net model. A means of analysing its behaviour is by examining its net structure. In Petri net theory, safety or boundedness, in its usual sense, sets a bound on the maximum number of tokens that can be assembled in a place. In a type of standard Petri nets with simple tokens, the Elementary net (EN) system, to be safe is to avoid a phenomenon called a contact situation, in which pre-and postconditions of an event are satis ed at the same time.To model real-time systems, we de ne a time extension of EN system called Time EN (TEN) system. By attaching time intervals to transitions, one is able to control the ow of tokens, and ensure that a system can still be safe even in a contact situation. With this notion of time safety and a new de nition of free-choice structure, the existing liveness theorems for standard Petri nets are modi ed, so that they can be applied to TEN systems.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["467"]}
