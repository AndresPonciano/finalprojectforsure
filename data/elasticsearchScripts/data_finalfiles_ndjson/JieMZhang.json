{"title": "\u201cIgnorance and Prejudice\u201d in Software Fairness\n", "abstract": " Machine learning software can be unfair when making human-related decisions, having prejudices over certain groups of people. Existing work primarily focuses on proposing fairness metrics and presenting fairness improvement approaches. It remains unclear how key aspect of any machine learning system, such as feature set and training data, affect fairness. This paper presents results from a comprehensive study that addresses this problem. We find that enlarging the feature set plays a significant role in fairness (with an average effect rate of 38%). Importantly, and contrary to widely-held beliefs that greater fairness often corresponds to lower accuracy, our findings reveal that an enlarged feature set has both higher accuracy and fairness. Perhaps also surprisingly, we find that a larger training data does not help to improve fairness. Our results suggest a larger training data set has more unfairness than a\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["2026"]}
{"title": "Scalability studies on selective mutation testing\n", "abstract": " Mutation testing is a test method which is designed to evaluate a test suite's quality. Due to the expensive cost of mutation testing, selective mutation testing was first proposed in 1991 by Mathur, in which a subset of mutants are selected aiming to achieve the same effectiveness as the whole set of mutants in evaluating the quality of test suites. Though selective mutation testing has been widely investigated in recent years, many people still doubt if it can suit well for large programs. Realizing that none of the existing work has systematically studied the scalability of selective mutation testing, I plan to work on the scalability of selective mutation testing through several studies.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["2026"]}
{"title": "Facebook\u2019s Cyber\u2013Cyber and Cyber\u2013Physical Digital Twins\n", "abstract": " A cyber\u2013cyber digital twin is a simulation of a software system. By contrast, a cyber\u2013physical digital twin is a simulation of a non-software (physical) system. Although cyber\u2013physical digital twins have received a lot of recent attention, their cyber\u2013cyber counterparts have been comparatively overlooked. In this paper we show how the unique properties of cyber\u2013cyber digital twins open up exciting opportunities for research and development. Like all digital twins, the cyber\u2013cyber digital twin is both informed by and informs the behaviour of the twin it simulates. It is therefore a software system that simulates another software system, making it conceptually truly a twin, blurring the distinction between the simulated and the simulator. Cyber\u2013cyber digital twins can be twins of other cyber\u2013cyber digital twins, leading to a hierarchy of twins. As we shall see, these apparently philosophical observations have practical\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["2026"]}
