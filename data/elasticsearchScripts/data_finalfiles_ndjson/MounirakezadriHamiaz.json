{"title": "Comprehensive mitigation framework for concurrent application of multiple clinical practice guidelines\n", "abstract": " In this work we propose a comprehensive framework based on first-order logic (FOL) for mitigating (identifying and addressing) interactions between multiple clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) applied to a multi-morbid patient while also considering patient preferences related to the prescribed treatment. With this framework we respond to two fundamental challenges associated with clinical decision support: (1) concurrent application of multiple CPGs and (2) incorporation of patient preferences into the decision making process.We significantly expand our earlier research by (1) proposing a revised and improved mitigation-oriented representation of CPGs and secondary medical knowledge for addressing adverse interactions and incorporating patient preferences and (2) introducing a new mitigation algorithm. Specifically, actionable graphs representing CPGs allow for parallel and temporal activities (decisions\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "49\n", "authors": ["1434"]}
{"title": "Expanding a First-Order Logic Mitigation Framework to Handle Multimorbid Patient Preferences\n", "abstract": " The increasing prevalence of multimorbidity is a challenge for physicians who have to manage a constantly growing number of patients with simultaneous diseases. Adding to this challenge is the need to incorporate patient preferences as key components of the care process, thanks in part to the emergence of personalized and participatory medicine. In our previous work we proposed a framework employing first order logic to represent clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) and to mitigate possible adverse interactions when concurrently applying multiple CPGs to a multimorbid patient. In this paper, we describe extensions to our methodological framework that (1) broaden our definition of revision operators to support required and desired types of revisions defined in secondary knowledge sources, and (2) expand the mitigation algorithm to apply revisions based on their type.

It summarizes the concepts existing in this area of interest and the relationships among them. We propose a classification of different modeling formalisms and a representation of possible verification and validation methods. A system is represented using several views conforming to different modeling languages. Its properties can be assessed with verification and validation technologies. We also describe existing V&V tools and how they are related to the other elements.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1434"]}
{"title": "A proof assistant based formalization of MDE components\n", "abstract": " Model driven engineering (MDE) now plays a key role in the development of safety critical systems through the use of early validation and verification of models, and the automatic generation of software and hardware artifacts from the validated and verified models. In order to ease the integration of formal specification and verification technologies, various formalizations of the MDE technologies were proposed by different authors using term or graph rewriting, proof assistants, logical frameworks, etc.             The use of components is also mandatory to improve the efficiency of system development. Invasive Software Composition (ISC) has been proposed by A$\\ss$man in [1] to add a generic component structure to existing Domain Specific Modeling Languages in MDE. This approach is the basis of the ReuseWare toolset.             We present in this paper an extension of a formal embedding of some key\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1434"]}
{"title": "Correct-by-construction model composition: Application to the invasive software composition method\n", "abstract": " Composition technologies improve reuse in the development of large-scale complex systems. Safety critical systems require intensive validation and verification activities. These activities should be compositional in order to reduce the amount of residual verification activities that must be conducted on the composite in addition to the ones conducted on each components. In order to ensure the correctness of compositional verification and assess the minimality of the residual verification, the contribution proposes to use formal specification and verification at the composition operator level. A first experiment was conducted in [15] using proof assistants to formalize the generic composition technology ISC and prove that type checking was compositional. This contribution extends our early work to handle full model conformance and study the mandatory residual verification. It shows that ISC operators are not fully compositional with respect to conformance and provides the minimal preconditions on the operators mandatory to ensure compositional conformance. The appropriate operators from ISC (especially bind) have been implemented in the COQ4MDE framework that provides a full implementation of MOF in the COQ proof assistant. Expected properties, respectively residual verification, are expressed as post, respectfully pre, conditions for the composition operators. The correctness of the compositional verification is proven in COQ.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1434"]}
{"title": "Correct-by-construction model driven engineering composition operators\n", "abstract": " Model composition is a crucial activity in Model Driven Engineering both to reuse validated and verified model elements and to handle separately the various aspects in a complex system and then weave them while preserving their properties. Many research activities target this compositional validation and verification (V & V) strategy: allow the independent assessment of components and minimize the residual V & V activities at assembly time. However, there is a continuous and increasing need for the definition of new composition operators that allow the reconciliation of existing models to build new systems according to various requirements. These ones are usually built from scratch and must be systematically verified to assess that they preserve the properties of the assembled elements. This verification is usually tedious but is mandatory to avoid verifying the composite system for each use of the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1434"]}

{"title": "Aligning interdisciplinary healthcare team behavior with workflow execution: an example of a radical prostatectomy workflow\n", "abstract": " Operationalizing care delivery through an interdisciplinary healthcare team (IHT) requires knowledge about the overall structure of an IHT and the behavioral rules that \"control\" the dynamics of this structure interpreted as team and clinical leadership maintenance and task allocation. While progress has been made in understanding IHT structure, there is less work on the behavioral aspects of an IHT associated with its dynamics. In this paper we fill this void by extending our Team and Workflow Management Framework (TWMF) with a set of rules to operationalize IHT behavior in terms of clinical leadership, coordination of workflow execution over multiple days as part of continuity of care, and management of tasks, including urgent ones that prevent planned workflow execution.
