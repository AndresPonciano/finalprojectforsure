This shift is not only redefining the software industry but also the way we teach and learn in our software engineering (SE) courses. But for many universities F/OSS is seen as an optional low cost technology to support the IT infrastructure and administrational duties. Few see F/OSS as an opportunity for students to learn the SE concepts and skills we teach. Furthermore, it is still an open question as to whether the F/OSS methodology can be effectively used to teach SE courses within the formally structured curriculwn in most universities. This paper discusses F/OSS projects as bazaars of learning that offer a meaningful learning context. The discussion is centered on a pilot study in which students were involved in software testing in F/OSS projects. We present the teaching and learning framework we used in the pilot study and report on our experiences, lessons learned, and some practical problems we encountered. Our grading and evaluation approach show that the students did relatively well as bug hunters and reporters. Results from two online surveys indicate that students are motivated in participating in software testing in the bazaar, and they are willing to participate in project activities long after their graduation.

Reuse of OSS software in systems that will have to guarantee certain product properties is still complicated. The main reason is the many different levels of trust that can be placed on the various OSS sources and the lack of information for the impact that a reused OSS component can have on the system properties. A prerequisite for promoting widespread reuse of OSS software is certification at the component level in an affordable cost. This work addresses the main technical issues behind OSS component certification by formal and semiformal techniques, as well as the incentives that raised the need for the OPEN-SME European funded project. OPEN-SME introduces an OSS software reuse service for SMEs, in order to address the problem that OSS evolves by volunteers that follow different development processes. We discuss the requirements relating to OSS software reuse based on the findings of a survey. Then we present the OPEN-SME tool-set and approach for OSS reuse and finally we show how the provision of verifiable certificates can provide assurance that an OSS component conforms to one or more anticipated requirements, necessary for reusing it in a system.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["892"]}

The test target is faults that may appear in predicates found in the specification or implementation of a computer program. A hierarchy of fault classes has been recently established, identifying associative shift faults (ASFs) as one of the strongest fault classes in predicate testing. The upto date proposed approaches resolve adequately the issue of test generation for weaker fault classes but do not guarantee the detection of all ASFs. In this paper we define a suitable fault model to represent this type of faults and propose a heuristic test strategy, while trying to keep low the number of required tests by fault simulation. Empirical results of the algorithm application on the TCAS-II expression suite are encouraging and suggest that it is easy to detect a significant subset of ASFs by considering only few additional tests.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["892"]}

To achieve this goal, we:(a) gathered game scenario characteristics that are related to users' satisfaction,(b) proposed several metrics for quantifying these characteristics, and (c) performed a case study on three interactive\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["892"]}
{"title": "A Novel Framework for the Seamless Integration of FPGA Accelerators with Big Data Analytics Frameworks in Heterogeneous Data Centers\n", "abstract": " To face the increased network traffic in the cloud, data center operators have started adopting an heterogeneous approach in their infrastructures. Heterogeneous infrastructures, e.g. based on FPGAs, can provide higher performance and better energy-efficiency compared to the contemporary processors. However, FPGAs lack of an easy-to-use framework for the efficient deployment from high-level programming frameworks. In this paper, we present a novel framework that allows the seamless integration of FPGAs from high-level programming languages, like Java and Scala. The proposed approach provides all the required APIs for the utilization of FPGAs from these languages. The proposed scheme has been mapped on Amazon AWS f1 infrastructure and a performance evaluation is presented for two widely used machine learning algorithms.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["892"]}

The reuse of OSS components however is restricted to ready-made components and developers who want to reuse code that exists in OSS projects but is not offered as a black-box component often resort to copying existing code and adapting it in their projects. OPEN-SME is a European research project which aims at providing ready-to-use OSS components that originate from existing OSS projects but are not necessarily provided as such. In this work we describe the Component Adaptation Environment (COPE) tool that was developed in the context of the OPEN-SME project and enables software experts, called reuse engineers, to extract components from OSS projects, test them and provide test documentation, validate them with Model-Based Testing techniques, package them\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["892"]}
{"title": "On the Approximation of the Substitution Costs for Free/Libre Open Source Software\n", "abstract": " In this paper we describe our work in progress towards approximating the substitution costs for FLOSS. Substitution cost is the monetary value of the effort necessary for implementing a FLOSS application from scratch in a software company. We describe our approach for estimating substitution cost, based on building generic estimation models for the modern software industry. For this purpose we use the latest version of ISBSG, and apply our models on a subset of projects from a Debian distribution. This yields an approximation of the total substitution costs for this collection of FLOSS applications. We report on various problems, limitations and issues related to the data, the model precision, and the currently available FLOSS project data. However, the anticipated arrival of more coherent FLOSS databases is expected to alleviate many of these issues, and more precise calculations will become feasible, using the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["892"]}

Despite source transparency in the Open Source Software (OSS) realm, the vast number of available components hinder the component selection process. To overcome this, various software evaluation methods have been proposed, offering assistance in measuring various qualities and aspects of software components. However, these methods fail to take into consideration the profit generated due to selected quality characteristics, and thus, to provide an additional value-based view to decision makers.

{"title": "A unified approach for software process representation and analysis.\n", "abstract": " This paper presents a unified approach for software process management which combines object-oriented (OO) structures with formal models based on (high-level timed) Petri nets. This pairing may be proved beneficial not only for the integrated representation of software development processes, human resources and work products, but also in analysing properties and detecting errors of a software process specification, before the process is put to actual use. The use of OO models provides the advantages of graphical abstraction, highlevel of understanding and manageable representation of software process classes and instances. Resulted OO models are mechanically transformed into a high-level timed Petri net representation to derive a model for formally proving process properties as well as applying managerial analysis. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by addressing a simple software process modelling example problem used in the literature to exercise various software process modelling notations.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["892"]}
{"title": "Using mcda and bayesian belief networks to aid decision making based on software project management antipatterns\n", "abstract": " Antipatterns in software project management are mechanisms that describe commonly occurring solutions to problems that generate negative consequences. The Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) approach has been recently proposed for modelling software project management antipatterns. BBNs provide a solution for software project managers, who would like to model the cause-effect relationship that underlies antipatterns by considering their inherent uncertainty. Although a BBN model can be used to aid decisions by observing the effect of uncertainty on a specific attribute of interest (such as software quality), in many circumstances decisions based on multiple criteria need to be made. Multi-criteria decision aid (MCDA) can be applied to improve the effectiveness of management decisions. A BBN model ignores the multiple, and often conflicting, criteria that surround a managerial decision (such as development time and total collaboration costs). In this paper such an approach is exemplified through a specific BBN model of an antipattern complemented by MCDA. The final resulted model is helpful in evaluating the impact of developer personalities and temperaments on communication, collaboration viability and effectiveness in pair programming.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["892"]}
