{"title": "Computer assisted plant identification system for Android\n", "abstract": " Plant leaves provide sufficient features to distinguish them among other species. Identification of plants using leaf images is a classic problem in digital image processing. Usually those image processing systems use shape based digital morphological features for leaf identification task. Even there are number of studies on leaf based plant identification, very few of them are for mobiles. In this paper we describe a leaf image based plant identification system using SIFT features combining with Bag Of Word (BOW) model and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The system is trained to classify 20 species and obtained 96.48 % accuracy level. Based on the results, we developed an Android application communicates with the server and gives users the ability to identify plant species using photographs taken of plant leaves using the smart phone.", "num_citations": "23\n", "authors": ["407"]}
{"title": "Transforming Sri Lankan Education with Interactive Multimedia Technology: The Journey to E-Lankapura\n", "abstract": " With the introduction of e-Sri Lanka project by the Sri Lankan government in 2003, many public and private sector organizations have increased their services online. As a result, there is an increasing demand for empowering the population of Sri Lanka through affordable community access to technologies and through the provision of basic computer literacy training services to regularly use ICT or e-services. Therefore, it is a national priority to provide proper guidance on basic computer usage and to obtain electronic services to young generation to make them e-citizens. To fulfill this objective, the research team of National E-Learning Resource Centre (NELRC) of the University of Kelaniya in collaboration with Information and Communication Technology Industry Skill (ICTISC) has taken a step to develop an interactive multimedia-based e-learning material to offer National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) level 2\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["407"]}
{"title": "Identifying Irrelevant Answers in Web Based Question Answering Systems\n", "abstract": " Answer re-ranking and quality tagging are two major techniques used to address irrelevant answers in web-based community question answering systems (CQA). However, answer re-ranking is memory inefficient, and quality tagging lacks the ability to predict partially relevant responses. The reported precisions of both mechanisms are also low. Those facts emphasize the importance of finding alternative techniques for identifying irrelevant answers. In this paper, we have analyzed the capability of three widely popular deep learning models (CNN, LSTM and CLSTM) in the NLP literature to identify irrelevant answers in factoid and non-factoid systems. Further, we studied the ability of the same deep learning models to detect partially relevant answers in non-factoid systems. According to the results, the CLSTM model performed over CNN and LSTM in detecting irrelevant answers.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["407"]}
{"title": "Vyapthi: A Leveraged P2P Content Sharing Platform for Distributed e-Learning Systems\n", "abstract": " e-Learning is a popular research area in the modern era. Most of the existing e-Learning systems are web based and developed as traditional centralized client/server systems [1], [22], [23]. However, there are few Peer-to-Peer distributed eLearning platforms in existence. For any e-Learning system content searching and sharing is important. In a distributed e-Learning network locating and sharing learning materials is still a challenge due to high resource and time requirements. In this paper, we propose a lightweight, scalable and low-cost digital content sharing platform which facilitates for general internet-based users to search and share e-Learning materials in an unstructured P2P network. The proposed platform addresses the learning martial search latency problem in distributed e-Learning networks by introducing content advertising and local indexing.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["407"]}
