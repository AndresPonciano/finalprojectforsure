{"title": "Performance evaluation of distributed ledger technologies for iot data registry: A comparative study\n", "abstract": " Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies have gained prevalence in various areas including Smart Vehicles, Smart Buildings, and Smart Health. Especially on these domains, the use of IoT involves certain challenges around security, privacy and trust, which can be characterized as sensitive issues. Blockchain technologies have emerged as the potential solution to address these issues. However, Blockchain can be inefficient in terms of both performance and cost due to high bandwidth overhead and delays. In this paper, we have examined four different popular Blockchain platforms (Hyperledger Fabric, Hyperledger Burrow, Hyperledger Sawtooth, and BigchainDB) to identify what are the overheads around the use of Blockchain and to study whether there is a single optimal solution with respect to time and computation overheads, or if there are trade-offs between the four platforms for IoT applications.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["739"]}
{"title": "A Self-Adaptive Blockchain Framework to Balance Performance, Security, and Energy Consumption in IoT applications\n", "abstract": " The Internet of Things (IoT) is \u201cthe network of physical objects, devices, vehicles, buildings and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity which allows them to gather and exchange data\u201d [1]. The main feature of IoT is its notable impact on various aspects of the daily life of potential users. Some examples of the possible applications where IoT will play a leading role in the next years include Smart Buildings, healthcare and enhanced learning [2]. There are several challenges that IoT poses to organizations and developers such as security, big-data, heterogeneity, variety and variability, real-time deployment and logging, integration, and many others. The privacy risks of IoT are exacerbated by a lack of fundamental security safeguards in many of the first generation IoT products on the market, for instance, in video surveillance and the cameras which can be considered as\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["739"]}
