The present paper proposes a DFA on AES-128 key schedule which requires only one single byte fault and a brute-force search of 2 8  keys, showing that a DFA on AES key schedule is equally dangerous as a fault analysis when the fault is injected in the intermediate state of AES. Further, the fault model of the present attack is a single byte fault.

Interestingly, not every possible fault for a cryptosystem is maliciously exploitable, and evaluation of the exploitability of a fault is nontrivial. In order to devise precise defense mechanisms against such rogue faults, a comprehensive knowledge is required about the exploitable part of the fault space of a cryptosystem. Unfortunately, the fault space is diversified and of formidable size even while a single cryptoprimitive is considered and traditional manual fault analysis techniques may often fall short to practically cover such a fault space within reasonable time. An automation for analyzing individual fault instances for their exploitability is thus inevitable. Such an automation is supposed to work as the core engine for analyzing the fault spaces of cryptographic primitives. In this paper, we propose an automation for evaluating the exploitability status of fault instances from block ciphers, mainly in the context of Differential Fault Analysis (DFA) attacks. The proposed framework is generic and scalable, which are perhaps the two most important features for covering diversified fault spaces of formidable size originating from different ciphers. As a proof-of-concept, we reconstruct some known attack examples on AES and PRESENT using the framework and finally analyze a recently proposed cipher GIFT [BPP+ 17] for the first time.

However, we emphasize that conventional CED assumes a uniform distribution of faults, which is not a valid assumption in the context of DFA. In contrast, we show practical examples which highlight that an attacker can inject specific and exploitable faults, thus threatening existing CED. This paper brings to the surface a new CED approach for cryptography, aimed at providing provable security by detecting all possible DFA-exploitable faults, which is a small subset of the entire fault space. We analyze the fault coverage of conventional CED against DFA-exploitable faults, and we find that the fault coverage of most of these techniques are significantly lower than the one they claimed.

Combining the seminal idea by Boneh, DeMillo and Lipton with Differential Cryptanalysis, a new field of Differential Fault Attacks (DFA) has emerged.

DFA is not restricted to old ciphers, but can be a powerful attack vector even for modern ciphers, like the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). In this book chapter, we present an overview on the history of fault attacks and their general principle.

Biased fault attacks have also been shown to weaken traditional redundancy based countermeasures, such as Concurrent Error Detection (CED) techniques, that provide security against classical fault attacks such as Differential Fault Analysis (DFA). While these countermeasures are effective under the assumption that the adversary uses a uniform fault model, they are vulnerable to attacks using biased fault models. Till date, no effective countermeasure against such biased fault attacks has been reported in literature. In this work, we propose a countermeasure strategy that combines the principles of redundancy with that of fault space transformation to achieve security against both classical and biased fault attacks.

Over the years the FA techniques have evolved, gradually moving towards the exploitation of device-centric properties of the faults.

Next, we show that this property of combinational circuits leads to powerful Fault Template Attacks (FTA), even for implementations having dedicated protections against both power and fault-based vulnerabilities. The attacks found in this work are applicable even if the fault injection is made at the middle rounds of a block cipher, which are out of reach for most of the other existing fault analysis strategies.

We propose a technique that combines a sliding window protocol and a dynamic integrity tree to rapidly detect multiple bit-flips caused by RowHammer attacks. Sliding window protocol monitors the frequent accesses made to the same bank in short intervals to identify the vulnerable rows. Dynamic integrity tree relies on SHA-3 Keccak hash function while maintaining the minimal number of vulnerable rows at any particular time to enable detection of bit flips. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by performing RowHammer attacks using the prime and probe method with a DDR3 DRAM. We show that the dynamic tree structure only needs to maintain a small number of vulnerable rows at a time, thus notably reducing the height of the integrity tree to enable rapid detection of the bit-flips.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["515"]}

In this context, storing and computing directly on encrypted data is an attractive solution, especially against insider attacks. Homomorphic encryption, the keystone enabling technology is unfortunately prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we focus on finding k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) directly on encrypted data, a basic data-mining and machine learning algorithm. The goal is to compute the nearest neighbours to a given query, and present exact results to the clients, without the cloud learning anything about the data, query, results, or the access and search patterns. We describe a novel protocol in the two-party cloud setting, using an underlying somewhat homomorphic encryption scheme. In comparison to the state-of-the-art protocol in this setting, we provide asymptotically faster performance, without sacrificing any security guarantees.

Motivated by the fact that unknown branch predictors of standard processors bear a strong correlation with 2-bit dynamic predictors, this paper develops a formal analysis of such a bimodal predictor under the effect of faults. Assuming a popular bit-flip fault model, the analysis shows that differences of branch misses under the effect of such faults can be exploited to attack implementations of RSA-like asymmetric key algorithms, based on square and multiplication operations.

Differential cache attacks were first demonstrated on the block cipher CLEFIA, which has a type-2 generalized Feistel structure. In this paper we improve the attack methodology by showing that a sophisticated method of choosing plaintexts can result in a considerable reduction in attack complexity. This coupled with other cryptanalytic techniques, when applied to the block cipher SMS4, requires just 210 plaintexts to recover the SMS4 secret key from power traces for a 64 byte cache line. Further, the attack becomes more dangerous for large cache lines. For example, with a 128 byte cache line, only 52 power traces are required.

{"title": "Template Attack on Blinded Scalar Multiplication with Asynchronous perf-ioctl Calls.\n", "abstract": " In recent years, performance counters have been used as a side channel source for the branch mispredictions which has been used to attack ciphers with user privileges. However, existing research considers blinding techniques, like scalar blinding, scalar splitting as a mechanism of thwarting such attacks. In this endeavour, we reverse engineer the undisclosed model of Intel\u2019s Broadwell and Sandybridge branch predictor and further utilize the largely unexplored perf ioctl calls in sampling mode to granularly monitor the branch prediction events asynchronously when a victim cipher is executing. With these artifacts in place, we target scalar blinding and splitting countermeasures to develop a key retrieval process using what is called as Deduce & Remove. The Deduce step uses template based on the number of branch misses as expected from the 3-bit model of the BPU to infer the matched candidate values. In the Remove step, we correct any erroneous conclusions that are made, by using the properties of the blinding technique under attack. It may be emphasized that as in iterated attacks the cost of a mistaken deduction could be significant, the blinding techniques actually aids in removing wrong guesses and in a way auto-corrects the key retrieval process. Finally, detailed experimental results have been provided to illustrate all the above steps for point blinding, scalar blinding, and scalar splitting to show that the secret scalar can be correctly recovered with high confidence.

Many countermeasures have been proposed to thwart side channel attacks, especially power trace measurement based side channel attacks. Additionally, researchers have proposed several evaluation metrics to evaluate side channel security of crypto-system. However, evaluation of any crypto-system is done during the testing phase and is not part of the actual hardware. In our approach, we propose to implement such evaluation metrics on-chip for run-time side channel vulnerability estimation of a cryptosystem. The objective is to create a watchdog on the hardware which will monitor the side channel leakage of the device, and will alert the user if that leakage crosses a pre-determined threshold, beyond which the system might be considered vulnerable. Once such alert signal is activated, proactive countermeasures can be activated either at the device level or at the protocol level, to prevent the impending side channel attack. A FPGA based prototype designed by us show low hardware overhead, and is an effective option that avoids the use of bulky and inconvenient on-field measurement setup.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["515"]}

The literature on dynamic SSE has identified two crucial security properties in this regard-forward and backward privacy. Forward privacy makes it hard for the server to correlate an update operation with previously executed search operations. Backward privacy limits the amount of information learnt by the server about documents that have already been deleted from the database.To date, work on forward and backward private SSE has focused mainly on single keyword search. However, for any SSE scheme to be truly practical, it should at least support conjunctive keyword search. In this setting, most prior SSE constructions with sub-linear search complexity do not support dynamic databases. The only exception is the scheme of Kamara and Moataz (EUROCRYPT'17); however it only achieves forward privacy.

However the combination of underlying microarchitectural features and performance counters lead to sidechannels which can be exploited for attacking cipher implementations. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge we study for the first time, the combination of branch-predictor algorithms and performance counters to demonstrate a fault attack on the popular square-and-multiply based exponentiation algorithm, used in RSA. The attacks exploiting branching event like branch taken can be foiled by Montgomery Ladder based implementation of the exponentiation algorithm, while attacks based on branch miss are more devastating. We demonstrate the power of the attack exploiting branch misses from performance monitors by formalizing a fault attack model, where the adversary is capable of performing a bit flip at a desired bit position of the secret exponent. The paper characterizes the branch predictors using the popular two-bit predictor and formulates the dependence on the number of branch misses on the fault induced. This characterization is exploited to develop an iterative attack algorithm where knowledge of the previously determined key-bits and the difference of branch misses (as gathered from the performance counters) are utilized to determine the next bit.

Over the years the FA techniques have evolved, gradually moving towards the exploitation of devicecentric properties of the faults. In this paper, we exploit the fact that activation and propagation of a fault through a given combinational circuit (ie observability of a fault) is data dependent. Next, we show that this property of combinational circuits leads to powerful fault attacks even for implementations having dedicated and provably secure protections against both power and fault-assisted vulnerabilities. The attacks found in this work are applicable even if the fault injection is made at the middle rounds of a block cipher, which are out of reach for most of the other existing fault analysis strategies. Quite evidently, they also work for a known plaintext scenario. Moreover, the middle round attacks are entirely blind in the sense that no access to the ciphertexts (correct/faulty) or plaintexts are required.

There has been an enormous effort in developing a generalised solution to this problem, but a little has been done considering the security of resource constraint embedded devices. In this paper, we attempt to develop a lightweight malware detection tool designed specifically for embedded platforms using micro-architectural side-channel information obtained through Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs). The methodology aims to develop a distance metric, called \u03bb, for a given program from a benign set of programs which are expected to execute in the embedded environment. The distance metric is decided based on observations from carefully chosen features, which are tuples of high-level system calls along with low-level HPC events. An ideal \u03bb-value for a malicious program is 1, as opposed to 0 for a benign program. However, in reality, the efficacy of \u03bb to classify a malware largely depends on the proper assignment of weights to the features. We employ a gradient-descent based learning mechanism to determine optimal choices for these weights. We justify through experimental results on an embedded Linux running on an ARM processor that such a side-channel based learning mechanism improves the classification accuracy significantly compared to an ad-hoc selection of the weights, and leads to significantly low false positives and false negatives in all our test cases.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["515"]}

There are two FPGA variants of this design, namely, Programmable Delay Line APUF (PAPUF) and Double APUF (DAPUF) to mitigate the FPGA platform specific implementation issues. In this paper, we introduce the idea of Architectural Bias to compare the impact of the architecture of these APUF designs on their design bias. The biased challenge-response behavior of a delay PUF implies the non-uniform distributions of 0\u2019s and 1\u2019s in its response, and if this bias is due to the architectural issue of the PUF design, then it is called \u201cArchitectural Bias\u201d. Another important source of bias is the implementation issue specific to an implementation platform. According to our study, a good PUF architecture results in PUF instances with a small amount of architectural bias. In this paper, we provide a comparison of APUF, PAPUF, and DAPUF based on their architectural bias values. In addition, we also compare these APUF architectures with respect to fulfilling the Strict Avalanche Criterion (SAC) and robustness against the machine learning (ML) based modeling attack. We validate our theoretical findings with Matlab based simulations, and the results reveal that the classic APUF has the least architectural bias, followed by DAPUF and PAPUF, respectively. We also conclude from the experimental results that the SAC property of DAPUF is better than that of APUF and PAPUF, and PAPUF\u2019s SAC property is significantly poor.

{"title": "Modern cryptography\n", "abstract": " The art of cryptographic algorithms is an ever evolving field. Initiating from prehistoric times, the main objective of cryptographic algorithms have been to protect and allow usage of information in a legal manner. Encryption is a process of converting a plaintext message into a piece of random-looking text, often called ciphertext. The ciphertext, ideally, should contain or transfer no information to the curious third party, often referred to as the adversary. In order to allow the intended receiver to obtain back the message from the ciphertext, every encryption algorithm is reversible. Thus, the inverse operation of obtaining back the plaintext from the ciphertext, is called decryption. According to the wisdom in cryptography, the algorithms for encryption and decryption are always published and known to even the adversary. Then what does the security rely on?

{"title": "Provably secure concurrent error detection for advanced encryption standard\n", "abstract": " Differential fault analysis (DFA) poses a significant threat to Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Only a single faulty ciphertext is required for contemporary DFA to extract the secret key of AES using an average of 230 computations. Concurrent error detection (CED) is widely used to protect AES against DFA. Traditionally, these CEDs are evaluated with uniformly distributed faults, and the resulting fault coverage indicates the security strength of CEDs. However, DFA-exploitable faults are not uniformly distributed and are a small subspace of the entire fault space. We provide a systematic study of various DFAs of AES and experimentally show that in the context of DFA, the attacker is capable of biasing the induced faults to improve the success rate of the attacks. Then we show that the fault coverage of most CED techniques drops significantly against the fault model used by the attacker. This work challenges the traditional use of fault coverage for uniformly distributed faults as a metric for evaluating security against DFA. Good cryptographic designs always consider the worst scenario. Because a single carefully injected fault can leak the secret key, we propose a DFA-aware design flow for CEDs. We point out that CEDs should provide 100% fault coverage for DFA-exploitable faults. We show that cryptographic algorithm-specific CEDs have higher fault coverage against DFA faults and lower area overhead compared to general CEDs.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["515"]}

It has already been shown that a straightforward combination of SCA and FA countermeasures are vulnerable against FAs, such as Statistical Ineffective Fault Analysis (SIFA) and Fault Template Attacks (FTA). Consequently, new classes of countermeasures have been proposed which prevent against SIFA, and also includes masking for SCA protection. While they are secure against SIFA and SCA individually, one important question is whether the security claim still holds at the presence of a combined SCA and FA adversary. Security against combined attacks is, however, desired, as countermeasures for both threats are included in such implementations. In this paper, we show that some of the recently proposed combined SIFA and SCA countermeasures fall prey against combined attacks. To this end, we enhance the FTA attacks by considering side-channel information during fault injection. The success of the proposed attacks stems from some non-trivial fault propagation properties of S-Boxes, which remains unexplored in the original FTA proposal.

{"title": "Leakage Assessment in Fault Attacks: A Deep Learning Perspective.\n", "abstract": " Generic vulnerability assessment of cipher implementations against fault attacks (FA) is a research area which is still largely unexplored. The security assessment for FA becomes especially interesting in the presence of countermeasures, as countermeasure structures are not very well-formalized so far, and on several occasions, they fail to fulfil their sole purpose of preventing FAs. In this paper, we propose a general, simulation-based, statistical yes/no test to assess information leakage in the context of FAs. The fascinating feature of the proposed test is that it is oblivious to the structure of the countermeasure/cipher under test, and detects faultinduced leakage solely by observing the ciphertext distributions. Unlike a recently proposed approach [SKP+ 19a], which utilizes t-test and its higher-order variants for detecting leakage at different moments of ciphertext distributions, in this work we present a Deep Learning (DL) based leakage assessment method. Our DL-based method is not specific to moment-based leakages only and thus, can expose leakages in several cases where t-test based technique either fails or demands a prohibitively large number of ciphertexts. Experimental evaluation over a representative set of countermeasures establishes that the DL-based method mostly outperforms the t-test based leakage assessment in terms of the number of ciphertexts required.

Existing function private predicate encryption constructions in the public-key setting can be divided into two broad categories. The first category of constructions are based on standard assumptions, but impose highly stringent requirements on the min-entropy of predicate distributions, thereby limiting their applicability in the context of real-world predicates. For example, the statistically function private constructions of Boneh, Raghunathan and Segev (CRYPTO\u201913 and ASIACRYPT\u201913) are inherently restricted to predicate distributions with min-entropy roughly proportional to the security parameter \u03bb. The second category of constructions mandate more relaxed min-entropy requirements, but are either based on non-standard assumptions (such as indistinguishability obfuscation) or are secure in the generic group model. In this paper, we affirmatively bridge the gap between these categories by presenting new public-key constructions for identity-based encryption, hidden-vector encryption, and subspace-membership encryption (a generalization of inner-product encryption) that are both data and function private under variants of the well-known DBDH, DLIN and matrix DDH assumptions, while relaxing the min-entropy requirement on the predicate distributions to \u03c9 (log \u03bb).

In this paper, we address the open problem of constructing a lightweight symmetric-key HVE scheme that does not use bilinear pairings, but only efficient cryptographic primitives such as pseudo-random functions (PRFs) and block ciphers. The relevance of this problem stems from the implementation and performance overheads for bilinear pairings over composite/prime order groups, which are significantly larger than that for PRFs and block ciphers, in both software and hardware.

However, security concerns arising from the threat of insider and external attacks often require the data to be stored in an encrypted manner. Secure and efficient keyword searching on such large volumes of encrypted data is an important and yet one of the most challenging services to realize in practice. Even more challenging is to incorporate fine-grained client-specific access control-a commonly encountered requirement in cloud applications-in such searchable encryption solutions. Existing searchable encryption schemes in literature tend to focus on the use of specialized data structures for efficiency, and are not explicitly designed to address controlled access scenarios.

If a cipher implementation uses a conditional branch that depends on the secret key, then information about the key can leak through the processor\u2019s branch predictor. A misprediction causes the execution to take considerably more time compared with predictions that are correct. This variation in execution time is exploited by attackers to determine bits of the secret key. Several-timing attacks based on branch prediction have been proposed. Unlike cache attacks, which are mostly effective on block ciphers, branch prediction attacks are applicable only on public key ciphers such as the Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (RSA) algorithm. This chapter begins with a review of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["515"]}
{"title": "Access-Driven Cache Attacks on Block Ciphers\n", "abstract": " Cache memories are a shared resource in a system. If a process running in a system fetches a block of data into the cache, the data will remain in the cache memory unless evicted. The eviction can be done by any process in the system and can result in a covert timing channel. The channel was first discovered by Wray in (An analysis of covert timing channels in research in security and privacy, 1991) and Hu in (Lattice scheduling and covert channels, 1992). Attacks on cryptographic algorithms using the shared feature in cache memories were suggested independently by Percival in (Cache missing for fun and profit, 2005) and Osvik, Shamir, and Tromer (Cache attacks and countermeasures: the case of AES, 2005). These attacks are known as access-driven attacks and use time as a side-channel instead of power or electro-magnetic traces. We briefly describe selected works in this category of cache attacks.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["515"]}

{"title": "Pkdpa: An enhanced probabilistic differential power attack methodology\n", "abstract": " The paper presents an enhancement of univariate Differential Power Analysis (DPA), referred to as Probable Key Differential Power Analysis (PKDPA). The proposed analysis uses the standard Difference of Means (DoM) test as the distinguisher and employs its enhancement strategy to reduce the number of power traces required to mount the attack. Theoretical analysis for the developed attack has been furnished to justify the efficiency of the proposed attack in retrieving the key using significantly less number of traces compared to conventional DPA attacks. The theoretical claims have been supported by extensive experiments on real life attacks mounted on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementations of the Data Encryption Standard (DES), Triple-DES (3-DES) and the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). The efficacy of the proposed method is further proved by attacking a masked\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["515"]}
{"title": "Fault based attack of the Rijndael cryptosystem\n", "abstract": " In the present paper a fault based attack has been proposed against Rijndael. The paper shows how the algebraic properties of Rijndael can help an attacker to control and mount attacks against Rijndael. The paper describes a step by step approach how an attacker induces a fault, detects the nature of the fault induced and accordingly use different strategies to evaluate the key. The computations of the algorithms are simpler and the attack requires minimum number of faulty ciphertexts compared to the best known work in the related field.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["515"]}
{"title": "A Programmable Parallel Structure to perform Galois Field Exponentiation\n", "abstract": " In this paper we propose a new exponentiation architecture in GF(2 m ). The core of the architecture is a parallel structure for multiplication and squaring, which is based on the state transitions of programmable cellular automata (CA). The proposed architecture requires hardware of the order m2 and the time complexity is m. The performance of the design outperformed existing architectures based on systolic array and cellular automata. The design can thus be effectively applied in public key cryptosystems like ElGamal and Diffie-Hellman Key exchange. The regular, cascadable structure of the cellular automata leads to extremely scalable VLSI design.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["515"]}
{"title": "Cellular automata based key agreement.\n", "abstract": " This paper proposes a new key agreement protocol using Cellular Automata (CA). The primitives on which the protocol is based has been developed using specially designed CA structures. The paper aims at developing a key agreement technique which is not based on the Diffie-Hellman problem. The removal of exponentiations makes the protocol fast and have a linear time complexity. The protocol has been found to resist known forms of attacks. Indeed the initial review promises the development of a key agreement protocol which meets nicely the conflicting ends of security and efficiency.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["515"]}
{"title": "Best repair: An efficient reconfiguration for RRAM\n", "abstract": " Reconfiguration of memory arrays with spare rows and columns has been shown to be NP-complete problem. The present paper develops a novel heuristic algorithm which solves the reconfiguration problem. The conventional technique to find the vertex cover using maximum degree has been modified using an additional step to search first for the vertices of degree one. The new heuristic algorithm found to offer a better solution in repairing the memory faults in cases where some of the existing algorithms have failed. The performance has been evaluated using extensive experimentation and probabilistic approach based on a random graph model.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["515"]}

Institutions and its activities contribute substantially to the cause of deforestation or afforestation. Reversal of deforestation processes need strengthening of the Forest Protection Committee (FPC) institutions which facilitates the effectiveness of Joint Forest Management (JFM) where the community and foresters work towards a common goal of forest conservation. The paper describes the problem and process of strengthening institution with illustrations from West Bengal JFM. The authors have used systemic approach to forest conservation where structured intervention made in a planned sequence has produced synergic action where the community has not only conserved forest but also made their own self-help group.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["515"]}
{"title": "Correlation of mitotic abnormalities and the presence of human papillomavirus antigens in squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity\n", "abstract": " To determine the association of human papillomavirus (HPV) with oral cancer lesions containing abnormal mitoses, we analysed 54 of them by immmnohistochemical techniques for the presence of HPV structural antigens and correlated the results with their histology. Sixteen out of 19 lesions with abnormal mitotic figures (MFs) and 15 of the 25 lesions with normal MFs contained the HPV antigen. However, 9 of the 11 koilocytotic lesions with abnormal MFs and 13 of the 17 lesions with normal MFs were HPV antigen-positive. The nature of mitosis was not influenced by the grades of koilocytosis. No correlation of HPV antigen positivity and severity of the oral carcinomas was observed.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["515"]}
