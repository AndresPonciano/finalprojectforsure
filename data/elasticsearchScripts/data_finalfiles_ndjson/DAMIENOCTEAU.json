{"title": "On demystifying the android application framework: Re-visiting android permission specification analysis\n", "abstract": " In contrast to the Android application layer, Android\u2019s application framework\u2019s internals and their influence on the platform security and user privacy are still largely a black box for us. In this paper, we establish a static runtime model of the application framework in order to study its internals and provide the first high-level classification of the framework\u2019s protected resources. We thereby uncover design patterns that differ highly from the runtime model at the application layer. We demonstrate the benefits of our insights for security-focused analysis of the framework by re-visiting the important use-case of mapping Android permissions to framework/SDK API methods. We, in particular, present a novel mapping based on our findings that significantly improves on prior results in this area that were established based on insufficient knowledge about the framework\u2019s internals. Moreover, we introduce the concept of permission locality to show that although framework services follow the principle of separation of duty, the accompanying permission checks to guard sensitive operations violate it.", "num_citations": "123\n", "authors": ["291"]}
{"title": "Duet: library integrity verification for android applications\n", "abstract": " In recent years, the Android operating system has had an explosive growth in the number of applications containing third-party libraries for different purposes. In this paper, we identify three library-centric threats in the real-world Android application markets:(i) the library modification threat,(ii) the masquerading threat and (iii) the aggressive library threat. These three threats cannot effectively be fully addressed by existing defense mechanisms such as software analysis, anti-virus software and anti-repackaging techniques. To mitigate these threats, we propose Duet, a library integrity verification tool for Android applications at application stores. This is non-trivial because the Android application build process merges library code and application-specific logic into a single binary file. Our approach uses reverse-engineering to achieve integrity verification. We implemented a full working prototype of Duet. In a dataset\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "32\n", "authors": ["291"]}
{"title": "Optimal strategies for targeted influence in signed networks\n", "abstract": " Online social communities often exhibit complex relationship structures, ranging from close friends to political rivals. As a result, persons are influenced by their friends and foes differently. Network applications can benefit from accompanying these structural differences in propagation schemes. In this paper, we study the optimal influence propagation policies for networks with positive and negative relationship types. We tackle the problem of minimizing the end-to-end propagation cost of influencing a target person in favor of an idea by utilizing the relationship types in the underlying social graph. The propagation cost is incurred by social and physical network dynamics such as frequency of interaction, the strength of friendship and foe ties, propagation delay or the impact factor of the propagating idea. We extend this problem by incorporating the impact of message deterioration and ignorance. We demonstrate our\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["291"]}
{"title": "Methods and systems to determine user relationships, events and spaces using wireless fingerprints\n", "abstract": " Methods, systems, and articles of manufacture for tracking users based upon wireless fingerprint information are provided. These include accessing proximity records, clustering the proximity records based upon time information and user information to generate a plurality of clusters, identifying one or more events based upon the generated clusters, and outputting information related to the identified one or more events. Each proximity record includes user information. User information includes at least a first user identifier and a second user identifier respectively identifying a first user and a second user, and time information. Time information specifies one or more times when the first user and the second user have respective wireless fingerprints that are within a threshold fingerprint distance of each other.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["291"]}
{"title": "Using social sensors for influence propagation in networks with positive and negative relationships\n", "abstract": " Online social communities often exhibit complex relationship structures, ranging from close friends to political rivals. As a result, persons are influenced by their friends and foes differently. Future network applications can benefit from integrating these structural differences in propagation schemes through socially aware sensors. In this paper, we introduce a propagation model for such social sensor networks with positive and negative relationship types. We tackle two main scenarios based on this model. The first one is to minimize the end-to-end propagation cost of influencing a target person in favor of an idea by utilizing sensor observations about the relationship types in the underlying social graph. The propagation cost is incurred by social and physical network dynamics such as propagation delay, frequency of interaction, the strength of friendship/foe ties or the impact factor of the propagating idea.

{"title": "Communicating in a socially-aware network: Impact of relationship types\n", "abstract": " Communication networks are linked to and influenced by human interactions. Socially-aware systems should integrate these complex relationship patterns in the network design. This paper studies the impact of friendship and antagonistic relationships between individuals on optimal network propagation policies. We develop a network propagation model for signed networks, and determine the optimal policies to influence a target node with an opinion while minimizing the total number of persons against it. We also provide extensions to this problem to elaborate on the impact of network parameters, such as minimum-delay propagation, while limiting the number of persons influenced against the idea before reaching the target. We provide numerical evaluations in a synthetic setup as well as the Epinions online social dataset. We demonstrate that propagation schemes with social and influence-centric constraints\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["291"]}
