{"title": "Software quality: A curriculum postscript?\n", "abstract": " This paper addresses a central and critical issue in the development of computer software-its quality. The main thesis of the paper is that computer science faculty, in their design and implementation of curricula, do not devote sufficient attention to teaching their students how to develop high-quality software. As in industry, the most common and popular way of assuring the quality of programs is through software testing. In other words, quality is treated as an afterthought or as postscript in program development. The paper presents and discusses a quality model that can be used to incorporate a wide variety of quality assurance techniques within a curriculum. The model also presents a structured approach for introducing software testing into the educational environment. Finally, there is a discussion of how the model has been implemented using two current software process technologies, the PSP and the TSP.", "num_citations": "75\n", "authors": ["1253"]}

While researchers have made various attempts at SFTA, software assurance practitioners have been slow to adopt it. One reason is the intense manual effort needed to identify and draw the fault trees for the code of large software projects. Another is the lack of commercial tools to assist in the technique for software. Most SFTA research efforts have been directed at requirements or code. Performing SFTA on the design may enable application of SFTA to critical code only, thus reducing the amount of effort.

Although engineering programs typically have a yearlong senior level design project to provide engineering development experience, it is still a challenge to provide students with the full life-cycle experience and expose them to all of the various dimensions of engineering practice. This paper advocates the development and use of a full life-cycle case study to address such a challenge. A software engineering case study, developed by the authors, and used in various courses and workshops, illustrates the nature, structure and value of this approach. The case study learning objectives emphasize development of engineering practice and acquiring team, problem solving, and analysis skills. The paper also describes how this life-cycle case study can be used throughout a software engineering curriculum.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1253"]}
{"title": "Introducing case study based teaching in computing curricula: pre-conference workshop\n", "abstract": " The use of case studies is an effective method for introducing real-world professional practices into the classroom. Case studies have become a proven and pervasive method of teaching about professional practice in such fields as business, law, and medicine. The term \u201ccase study\u201d is used in a variety of ways. In its most naive form, it simply refers to a realistic example used to illustrate a concept or technique. Although the use of case studies in education has shown success in the above mentioned disciplines, it is yet to be adopted in any significant way in the computer science education. One of the reasons for the lack of use of the case-study approach is the lack of sufficient material for this purpose. The main aim of the workshop is fourfold. First, the participants will be introduced to a comprehensive set of case study (the DigitalHomecase study) that can be used throughout a computing curriculum, emphasizing full software development life cycle. Second, the workshop will include an interactive discussion of how to use the case study artifacts and the associated teaching support materials to complement their teaching artifacts throughout their computing curriculum. Third, the attendees will be asked to participate in the assessment of case study material and make recommendations for improving both the material and the delivery. Fourth, we intend to follow up with the attendees who are interested to participate in our project, by incorporating some of the case study material as part of their course work during the fall 2011 semester.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1253"]}

While scientists have developed many models to predict the paths and intensifications of these storms, there are still a tremendous number of unknowns. In order to enhance these models, it is necessary to develop new data collection techniques to fill the knowledge gaps. The current state-of-the-art utilizes several in-situ sensing techniques including airborne data collection via aircraft and expendable GPS dropsondes1in addition to surface-based sensing via ocean buoys. Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) provide a new and powerful means for collecting additional in-situ data from tropical cyclones. These unmanned aircraft (UA) can be used to collect data from much lower altitudes than is feasible or safe for manned operations.

This has resulted in a great workforce demand for people who have the appropriate knowledge and experience in software engineering. In 2014, IEEE Computer Society published the Software Engineering Competency Model (SWECOM). SWECOM describes competencies for software engineers who participate in the development and alteration of a software system. This competency model framework is based on a series of five life-cycle skill areas and eight cross cutting skill areas. Each skill area defined by different skills and each skill is defined by series of activities. Each activity can have up to five level of competencies (Follow, Assist, Perform, Lead and Create).

We are leveraging the excitement of computing capstone design courses and real-world projects to attract more students to computing. The target audience includes less advanced computing students, students in other majors, and pre-college students who might choose to study software engineering or computer science. To date, we have concentrated on activities targeting freshmen, sophomore, and junior students in computing fields, college students who are pursuing non computing degrees, and high school and middle school students. In the last phase of the project we exposed high school students to real-world projects, as they integrate with professional software developers at the NextGeneration Applied Research (NEAR) Laboratory (www. near. aero). Twenty five students from high schools across the Volusia and Seminole county (Florida) were selected to come to NEAR lab and interact with NEAR lab staffs and students through fall 2014 and spring 2015 semester. During this time, students were given an opportunity to work one-on-one with the NEAR lab personnel on specific projects. They were also given an opportunity to shadow them while they are working on one of the current projects that are being conducted at the lab. Some of these projects are funded by Federal Aviation Administrations (FAA), Boeing Corporations, New York Port Authority, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), etc. The twenty five students were selected among\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1253"]}

{"title": "Using Vertically Integrated Project Teams to Inspire Studnet Interest in Computing Careers\n", "abstract": " Using Vertically Integrated Project Teams to Inspire Student Interest in Computing Careers The precipitous decline in students majoring in computing degree programs has stopped, butno adequate recovery is in sight. The most recent numbers available show about 62,000 newcomputing graduates for a market estimated by the Department of Labor to require over 150,000 new entrants each year. Attracting students in the computing field has always been a major challenge. Factors suchas the geek image, a demanding mathematical foundation, the lack of a \u201cgee wiz\u201d element earlyin the curriculum, and the dot com bust are all contributors to this problem. However, attractingstudents is only a first step. Maintaining student interest is also difficult. This paper describes aNSF-funded project that is exploring vertically integrated teams as a way of inspiring studentinterest in computing. This project is focused on undergraduate computing education. The central tenet of theproject is that computing education will benefit by engaging students in hands-on, team-basedprojects much earlier in their education. The excitement of student teams working on capstonedesign projects is commonly observed. The goal of this project is to let much less experiencedstudents see and share in that excitement based on their skill levels. Advanced undergraduates working on capstone design projects are at the center of theproject. The capstone experience will be shared with less experienced students by teamingadvanced undergraduates with beginning undergraduates. This teaming will be designed tobenefit both the beginning and advanced students. The core focus\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1253"]}
