{"title": "SkyscrapAR: An augmented reality visualization for software evolution\n", "abstract": " Many software visualizations have been proposed to help stakeholders identify potential threats in the design of evolving software systems, often employing metaphors such as trees, graphs, constellations, maps, and cities, among others. In this scenario, three-dimensional visualizations have also been adopted. They can represent visual metaphors realistically and efficiently engage users. However, the interaction with such visualizations is either cumbersome or requires expensive equipment. This paper presents SkyscrapAR, an augmented reality visualization that employs the city metaphor to represent evolving software, along with its potential applications in the practice. The use of augmented reality allows the user to interact with the city in an intuitive way, by manipulating a marker, while requiring nothing but a computer and an inexpensive camera to make it work.", "num_citations": "23\n", "authors": ["937"]}

{"title": "Bisoprolol-induced thrombocytopenia: A case report.\n", "abstract": " Thrombocytopenia, not associated with bone marrow primary disease, is a common clinical problem. The possibility of drug-induced thrombocytopenia must be considered, especially in hospitalized patients. Drugs can cause thrombocytopenia by several mechanisms including direct bone marrow or other organ toxicity, and immune reactions. We describe a patient presenting with thrombocytopenia likely related to bisoprolol. We report a case of bisoprolol-induced thrombocytopenia which resolved with drug discontinuation and steroid therapy. We review the mechanisms involved in drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["937"]}

One of the major diagnostic criteria for ET is the absence of the philadelphia chromosome, thus when present it is almost indicative of CML. ET and CML are considered to be mutually exclusive; however, there are rare situations in which patients with ET present positive BCR\u2011ABL without the features of CML. Although from the literature review, the frequency of JAK2V617F mutation and BCR\u2011ABL translocation coexistence in MPNs is low, it may be higher than expected. The current study reported cases of two patients with an initial diagnosis of ET in the presence of JAK2V617F mutation and BCR\u2011ABL translocation by\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["937"]}

Although no standard protocol exists for this condition, intrathecal chemotherapy, combined with systemic chemoimmunotherapy, has been used previously. This case describes the treatment of a patient with CLL and symptomatic compromise of the central nervous system. Our results suggest that a combination of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and ibrutinib, administered sequentially over a 2-year period, led to a near-complete resolution of the cerebral spinal fluid neoplastic infiltration. Importantly, this response has been maintained with ibrutinib monotherapy for more than 12 months.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["937"]}
{"title": "A Procedural Approach for Evaluating the Performance of Business Processes Based on a Model of Quantative and Qualitative Measurements\n", "abstract": " Evaluating the performance of processes is of vital importance if organizations are to seek continuous improvements. It is by measuring processes that data on their performance is provided, thus showing the evolution of the organization in terms of its strategic objectives. These results will serve as the basis for making better decisions, thereby leading to continuous improvement. The approach set out in this paper is prompted by the relative lack of empirical investigations into performance measures contained in the literature and the difficulties that organizations face when trying to verify the results of their business processes. Based on analyzing studies selected in a Systematic Review of the Literature, there it was found the need to propose a new approach to evaluating business processes that brings together elements and recommendations selected from the analyzed approaches.
