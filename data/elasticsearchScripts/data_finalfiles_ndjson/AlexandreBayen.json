The main challenge has been to build vehicles which are safe and dependable, and meet the intrinsic societal need for mobility. The automobile has enjoyed dominance in meeting this need, which has been characterized at a fundamental level as getting people and goods where they need to be. As the demands for mobility have increased in complexity, from simply enabling people to reach destinations that were previously impractical, to getting people to their destination safely and reliably, technology developed in the automobile sector has also increased in complexity. The vehicle has developed from a purely physical system based on the laws of mechanics and chemistry, to a more sophisticated Cyber Physical System (CPS) which embeds electronic components and control systems to improve performance and safety.

{"title": "Emergent behaviors in mixed-autonomy traffic\n", "abstract": " Traffic dynamics are often modeled by complex dynamical systems for which classical analysis tools can struggle to provide tractable policies used by transportation agencies and planners. In light of the introduction of automated vehicles into transportation systems, there is a new need for understanding the impacts of automation on transportation networks. The present article formulates and approaches the mixed-autonomy traffic control problem (where both automated and human-driven vehicles are present) using the powerful framework of deep reinforcement learning (RL). The resulting policies and emergent behaviors in mixed-autonomy traffic settings provide insight for the potential for automation of traffic through mixed fleets of automated and manned vehicles. Model-free learning methods are shown to naturally select policies and behaviors previously designed by model-driven approaches, such as stabilization and platooning, known to improve ring road efficiency and to even exceed a theoretical velocity limit. Remarkably, RL succeeds at maximizing velocity by effectively leveraging the structure of the human driving behavior to form an efficient vehicle spacing for an intersection network. We describe our results in the context of existing control theoretic results for stability analysis and mixed-autonomy analysis.

{"title": "Probability distributions of travel times on arterial networks: a traffic flow and horizontal queuing theory approach\n", "abstract": " In arterial networks, traffic flow dynamics are driven by the presence of traffic signals, for which precise signal timing is difficult to obtain in arbitrary networks or might change over time. A comprehensive model of arterial traffic flow dynamics is necessary to capture its specific features in order to provide accurate traffic estimation approaches. From hydrodynamic theory, we model arterial traffic dynamics under specific assumptions standard in transportation engineering. We use this flow model to develop a statistical model of arterial traffic. The statistical approach is essential to capture the variability of travel times among vehicles:(1) the delay experienced by a vehicle depends on the time when it enters the link (in relation to the signal green/red phases) and this entrance time can occur at any random time during the cycle and (2) the free flow speed of a vehicle depends both on the driver and on external factors (jaywalking, double parking, etc.) and is another source of uncertainty. These two sources of uncertainty are captured by deriving the probability distribution of delays (from hydrodynamic theory) and modeling the nominal free flow travel time as a random variable (which encodes variability in driving behavior). We derive an analytical expression for the probability distribution of travel times between any two locations on an arterial link, parameterized by traffic parameters (cycle time, red time, free flow speed distribution, queue length and queue length at saturation). We validate the model using probe vehicle data collected during a field test in San Francisco, as part of the Mobile Millennium system.

The problem of fusing this data with probe data is formulated using the Moskowitz function, which results from kinematic wave theory. Using this formulation, two linear programs are posed to compute upper and lower bounds travel time through the corresponding section of highway. The method thus provides a guaranteed range for the average travel time experienced by vehicles on the highway.

{"title": "Building-in-Briefcase: A rapidly-deployable environmental sensor suite for the smart building\n", "abstract": " A building\u2019s environment has profound influence on occupant comfort and health. Continuous monitoring of building occupancy and environment is essential to fault detection, intelligent control, and building commissioning. Though many solutions for environmental measuring based on wireless sensor networks exist, they are not easily accessible to households and building owners who may lack time or technical expertise needed to set up a system and get quick and detailed overview of environmental conditions. Building-in-Briefcase (BiB) is a portable sensor network platform that is trivially easy to deploy in any building environment. Once the sensors are distributed, the environmental data is collected and communicated to the BiB router via the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and WiFi technology, which then forwards the data to the central database securely over the internet through a 3G radio. The user, with minimal effort, can access the aggregated data and visualize the trends in real time on the BiB web portal. Paramount to the adoption and continued operation of an indoor sensing platform is battery lifetime. This design has achieved a multi-year lifespan by careful selection of components, an efficient binary communications protocol and data compression. Our BiB sensor is capable of collecting a rich set of environmental parameters, and is expandable to measure others, such as CO 2. This paper describes the power characteristics of BiB sensors and their occupancy estimation and activity recognition functionality.

{"title": "Large scale estimation of arterial traffic and structural analysis of traffic patterns using probe vehicles\n", "abstract": " Estimating and analyzing traffic conditions on large arterial networks is an inherently difficult task. The first goal of this article is to demonstrate how arterial traffic conditions can be estimated using sparsely sampled GPS probe vehicle data provided by a small percentage of vehicles. Traffic signals, stop signs, and other flow inhibitors make estimating arterial traffic conditions significantly more difficult than estimating highway traffic conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a statistical modeling framework that leverages a large historical database and relies on the fact that traffic conditions tend to follow distinct patterns over the course of a week. This model is operational in North California, as part of the Mobile Millennium traffic estimation platform. The second goal of the article is to provide a global network-level analysis of traffic patterns using matrix factorization and clustering methods. These techniques allow us to characterize spatial traffic patterns in the network and to analyze traffic dynamics at a network scale. We identify traffic patterns that indicate intrinsic spatiotemporal characteristics over the entire network and give insight into the traffic dynamics of an entire city. By integrating our estimation technique with our analysis method, we achieve a general framework for extracting, processing and interpreting traffic information using GPS probe vehicle data.", "num_citations": "29\n", "authors": ["2071"]}

With ubiquity of traffic information and the increased use of routing apps, urban and suburban areas in the US have seen a recent rise in \u201ccut-through\u201d traffic and related congestion patterns. This increase is suspected to be both an instantaneous phenomenon (a natural response of routing apps to special events, accidents, or other problems reducing capacity locally in transportation networks) and a trend (progressive increase of such traffic over time, with a corresponding shift in demand on the transportation network). Data is presented that supports both theories on the I-210 corridor in the LA Basin. Then, two models (including a new one) are presented to capture these phenomena. The models are extensions of known user equilibrium formulations that take into account routing preferences of motorists when using apps. The ability of the models to capture the trends observed in field data (and often mentioned in the popular media) are validated on benchmark examples for the same corridor. Simulations are run in which the percentage of routing app users is progressively increased to demonstrate the impact of these apps on traffic patterns and, in particular, potential convergence to Nash equilibria solutions of traffic flow problems.

However, due to numerous technical, political, and human factors challenges, new methodologies are needed to design vehicles and transportation systems for these positive outcomes. This article tackles technical challenges arising from the partial adoption of autonomy: partial control, partial observation, complex multi-vehicle interactions, and the sheer variety of traffic settings represented by real-world networks. The article presents a modular learning framework which leverages deep Reinforcement Learning methods to address complex traffic dynamics. Modules are composed to capture common traffic phenomena (traffic jams, lane changing, intersections). Learned control laws are found to exceed human driving performance by at least 40% with only 5-10% adoption of AVs. In partially-observed single-lane traffic, a small neural network control law can eliminate stop-and-go traffic -- surpassing all known model-based controllers, achieving near-optimal performance, and generalizing to out-of-distribution traffic densities.", "num_citations": "26\n", "authors": ["2071"]}

However, creating a useful distribution of environments is error prone, and takes a significant amount of developer time and effort. We propose Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) as an alternative paradigm, where developers provide environments with unknown parameters, and these parameters are used to automatically produce a distribution over valid, solvable environments. Existing approaches to automatically generating environments suffer from common failure modes: domain randomization cannot generate structure or adapt the difficulty of the environment to the agent's learning progress, and minimax adversarial training leads to worst-case environments that are often unsolvable. To generate structured, solvable environments for our protagonist agent, we introduce a second, antagonist agent that is allied with the environment-generating adversary. The adversary is motivated to generate environments which maximize regret, defined as the difference between the protagonist and antagonist agent's return. We call our technique Protagonist Antagonist Induced Regret Environment Design (PAIRED).

We train the autonomous vehicles to coordinate with each other while crossing a roundabout in the presence of an adversary in simulation. The adversarial policy successfully reproduces the simulated behavior and incidentally outperforms, in terms of travel time, both a human-driving baseline and adversary-free trained policies.

More specifically, we consider the differential privacy of the mapping from the amount of flow for each origin-destination pair to the traffic flow measurements on each link of a traffic network.

The modeling and monitoring of river hydraulics are increasingly important as they provide drinkable water for populations as well as irrigation for a variety of crops. These flows are usually modeled using the shallow water equations, whether in a one or two dimensional formulation [10]. In this approximation, the flow is assumed to be nearly horizontal and the water column well-mixed. Since these models are an approximation of the flow, they are bound to gradually drift away from the physical phenomenon. An accurate modeling requires the use of experimental measurements to keep the model accurate with respect to the actual", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["2071"]}

{"title": "Robust reinforcement learning using adversarial populations\n", "abstract": " Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an effective tool for controller design but can struggle with issues of robustness, failing catastrophically when the underlying system dynamics are perturbed. The Robust RL formulation tackles this by adding worst-case adversarial noise to the dynamics and constructing the noise distribution as the solution to a zero-sum minimax game. However, existing work on learning solutions to the Robust RL formulation has primarily focused on training a single RL agent against a single adversary. In this work, we demonstrate that using a single adversary does not consistently yield robustness to dynamics variations under standard parametrizations of the adversary; the resulting policy is highly exploitable by new adversaries. We propose a population-based augmentation to the Robust RL formulation in which we randomly initialize a population of adversaries and sample from the population uniformly during training. We empirically validate across robotics benchmarks that the use of an adversarial population results in a more robust policy that also improves out-of-distribution generalization. Finally, we demonstrate that this approach provides comparable robustness and generalization as domain randomization on these benchmarks while avoiding a ubiquitous domain randomization failure mode.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["2071"]}

{"title": "Adaptive averaging in accelerated descent dynamics\n", "abstract": " We study accelerated descent dynamics for constrained convex optimization. This dynamics can be described naturally as a coupling of a dual variable accumulating gradients at a given rate \u03b7 (t), and a primal variable obtained as the weighted average of the mirrored dual trajectory, with weights w (t). Using a Lyapunov argument, we give sufficient conditions on \u03b7 and w to achieve a desired convergence rate. As an example, we show that the replicator dynamics (an example of mirror descent on the simplex) can be accelerated using a simple averaging scheme. We then propose an adaptive averaging heuristic which adaptively computes the weights to speed up the decrease of the Lyapunov function. We provide guarantees on adaptive averaging in continuous-time, prove that it preserves the quadratic convergence rate of accelerated first-order methods in discrete-time, and give numerical experiments to compare it with existing heuristics, such as adaptive restarting. The experiments indicate that adaptive averaging performs at least as well as adaptive restarting, with significant improvements in some cases.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["2071"]}

Latencies on horizontal queues increase as a function of density, and flow can decrease with increasing latencies. This class of latency functions arises in transportation networks. For static analysis of horizontal queues on parallel-link networks, we show that there may exist multiple Nash equilibria with different total costs, which contrasts with results for increasing latency functions.

The large 4 amount of individual probe measurements allows the study of phenomena previously 5 unobservable with conventional sensing technologies, and the design of novel traffic 6 monitoring and control strategies. However, challenges inherent to the use of speed and 7 location data arise. One of the main challenges of measurements collected from individual 8 vehicles lies in their ability to provide relevant information on the macroscopic properties 9 of traffic flow.

A new class of latency functions is introduced to model congestion due to the formation of physical queues, inspired from the fundamental diagram of traffic. For this new class, some results from the classical congestion games literature (in which latency is assumed to be a non-decreasing function of the flow) do not hold. A characterization of Nash equilibria is given, and it is shown, in particular, that there may exist multiple equilibria that have different total costs. A simple polynomial-time algorithm is provided, for computing the best Nash equilibrium, ie the one which achieves minimal total cost. In the Stackelberg routing game, a central authority (leader) is assumed to have control over a fraction of the flow on the network (compliant flow), and the remaining flow responds selfishly. The leader seeks to route the compliant flow in order to minimize the total cost. A simple Stackelberg strategy, the Non-Compliant First (NCF) strategy, is introduced, which can be computed in polynomial time, and it is shown to be optimal for this new class of latency on parallel networks. This work is applied to modeling and simulating congestion mitigation on transportation networks, in which a coordinator (traffic management agency) can choose to route a fraction of compliant drivers, while the rest of the drivers choose their routes selfishly.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["2071"]}

Using results from infinite dimensional convex analysis, we generalize the method of Dual Averaging (or Follow the Regularized Leader) to our setting and obtain upper bounds on the worst-case regret that generalize many previous results. Under the assumption of uniformly continuous rewards, we obtain explicit regret bounds in a setting where the decision set is the set of probability distributions on a compact metric space S. Importantly, we make no convexity assumptions on either the set S or the reward functions. We also prove a general lower bound on the worst-case regret for any online algorithm.

The problem is to regulate the release of water at the upstream end such that the measured water level (or stage) at the downstream end does not deviate outside of prescribed bounds under the effect of downstream perturbations. Under the assumption of small perturbations, the Saint-Venant model is linearized around a steady state flow. The resulting linear model is discretized to obtain a linear state-space model using a method of characteristics based numerical scheme. For the state space model, the control is the upstream discharge deviation, the disturbance is the downstream discharge deviation and the output is the downstream stage deviation; the deviations are defined with respect to the steady state.

We pose the following estimation problem: given a sequence of player decisions and the corresponding costs, we would like to estimate the parameters of the learning model. We consider, in particular, entropic mirror descent dynamics and reduce the problem to estimating the learning rates of each player.

The strategy consists in two level control, namely, pressure loop control and temperature loop control. The pressure control loop is to make sure that the air pressure at the inlet of each room is equal to a certain value while the temperature control loop is to control the room temperature which is achieved by adjusting the VAV box so that the supply air flow rate can be varied to achieve the room setting temperature. For the pressure control loop, a cooperative control technique is applied. The two control loops are coupled. This paper will analyze the stability of the overall system and give a sufficient condition on the initial values in terms of rooms and the HVAC system parameters.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["2071"]}

{"title": "A Three-Stream Model for Arterial Traffic\n", "abstract": " In this article, we propose a new analytical traffic flow model for traffic dynamics at signalized intersections. During each cycle, both the arrival and the departure traffic are approximated by three distinct traffic streams with uniform density. Because of the similar representation of the arrival and the departure traffic, the results from a single intersection can easily be extended to a series of intersections. The number of parameters of the model is tractable, leading to analytical solutions of the problem. We prove that the total delay of one-way traffic is a quasi-convex function in the offset between consecutive traffic cycles and derive analytically the optimal signal control corresponding to different profiles of arrival densities. This allows timely adjustments of the control as congestion evolves throughout the day. We also study how different density profiles evolve in a corridor, from one intersection to the downstream one, if there is no traffic from/to side streets. We find that all density profiles eventually lead to one profile after a few intersections. This corresponds to a green wave, in agreement with physical intuition. Finally, we test the model against data from microsimulation using CORSIM. Vehicle delay predicted by the model is shown to be close to that from the microsimulation.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["2071"]}

We present the models in their discretized form under a new formulation similar to the classical supply demand formulation used by the seminal Cell-Transmission Model. We then show their equivalence to hydrodynamic models. We detail the proper- ties of these so-called perturbed cell-transmission models and illustrate their modeling capabilities on a simple benchmark case.

Existing adaptive control systems require lengthy location-specific tuning procedures or expensive central communications infrastructure. Previous theoretical work proposed the application of a max pressure controller to maximize network throughput in a distributed manner with minimal calibration. Yet this algorithm as originally formulated has unpractical hardware and safety constraints. We fundamentally alter the formulation of the max pressure controller to a setting where the actuation can only update once per multiple time steps of the modeled dynamics. This is motivated by the case of a traffic signal that can only update green splits based on observed link-counts once per \u201ccycle time\u201d of 60-120 seconds. Furthermore, we extend the domain of allowable actuations from a single signal phase to any convex combination of available signal phases to model intra-cycle signal changes dictated by pre-selected cycle green splits. We show that this extended max pressure controller will stabilize a vertical queueing network given restrictions on admissible demand flows that are slightly stronger than those suggested in the original formulation of max pressure.

Much of the existing literature in linear causal analysis operates in the time domain. Unfortunately, the direct application of time domain linear causal analysis to many real-world time series presents three critical challenges: irregular temporal sampling, long range dependencies, and scale. Moreover, real-world data is often collected at irregular time intervals across vast arrays of decentralized sensors and with long range dependencies which make naive time domain correlation estimators spurious. In this paper we present a frequency domain based estimation framework which naturally handles irregularly sampled data and long range dependencies while enabled memory and communication efficient distributed processing of time series data. By operating in the frequency domain we eliminate the need to interpolate and help mitigate the effects of long range dependencies.

Control strategies are designed with the ultimate goal of using a small 4 number of AVs (less than 5% penetration rate) to represent Lagrangian control actuators that can 5 smooth the multilane traffic flow and dissipate the stop-and-go waves. This in turn may reduce fuel 6 consumption and emissions. 7The lane-changing mechanism is based on three components that we treat as parameters 8 in the model: safety, incentive and cool-down time. The choice of these parameters in the lane-9 change mechanism is critical to modeling traffic accurately, because different parameter values 10 can lead to drastically different traffic behaviors. In particular, the number of lane-changes and the 11 speed variance are highly affected by the choice of parameters. 12 Despite this modeling issue, when using sufficiently simple and robust controllers for AVs, 13 the stabilization of uniform flow steady-state is effective for any realistic value of the parameters, 14 and ultimately bypasses the observed modeling issue. 15 Our approach is based on accurate and rigorous mathematical models, which allows a limit 16 procedure that is termed, in gas dynamic terminology, mean-field.

In particular, with a map-reduce nomenclature, most of these operations can be modeled as mapping a kernel that only depends on short windows of consecutive data and reducing the results produced by each computation. This computational pattern stems from the ergodicity of the model under consideration and is often referred to as weak or short memory when it comes to data indexed with respect to time. In the following we will show how studying weak memory systems can be done in a scalable manner thanks to a framework relying on specifically designed overlapping distributed data structures that enable fragmentation and replication of the data across many machines as well as parallelism in computations. This scheme has been implemented for Apache Spark but is certainly not system specific.

In fact, almost all existing validations of CTM focus 5 on modeling freeways. In this paper, we aim to provide evidence towards selecting the appropriate queueing model dynamics for use in analysis and control of a large-scale network of signalized traffic intersections. We introduce a new vertical queueing dynamics called the Vertical Cell Model (VCM) that incorporates a representation of link transit time and finite queue capacity. The linear link model of VCM provides an attractive new alternative to CTM for practical network-wide 10 estimation and control procedures. We then compare the link outflow and density outputs of both VCM and CTM to a set of high fidelity ground-truth observations on a multi-intersection segment of an existing urban roadway. Ultimately we provide a validation of both CTM and VCM for use in arterial networks which have minimal observed over-saturation. The development and validation of VCM is a first step toward a new control-theoretic approach to the operations of signalized 15 intersections in a large-scale network.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["2071"]}

Furthermore, since the hyperparameters of the algorithms are carefully tuned to the task of interest, it is unclear whether hyperparameters can easily be found that allow the algorithm to be repurposed for other cooperative tasks with different reward structure and environment dynamics. To investigate the consistency of the performance of MARL algorithms, we build an open-source library of multi-agent algorithms including DDPG/TD3/SAC with centralized Q functions, PPO with centralized value functions, and QMix and test them across a range of tasks that vary in coordination difficulty and agent number.

{"title": "Adaptive Coordination Offsets for Signalized Arterial Intersections using Deep Reinforcement Learning\n", "abstract": " One of the most critical components of an urban transportation system is the coordination of intersections in arterial networks. With the advent of data-driven approaches for traffic control systems, deep reinforcement learning (RL) has gained significant traction in traffic control research. Proposed deep RL solutions to traffic control are designed to directly modify either phase order or timings; such approaches can lead to unfair situations -- bypassing low volume links for several cycles -- in the name of optimizing traffic flow. To address the issues and feasibility of the present approach, we propose a deep RL framework that dynamically adjusts the offsets based on traffic states and preserves the planned phase timings and order derived from model-based methods. This framework allows us to improve arterial coordination while preserving the notion of fairness for competing streams of traffic in an intersection. Using a validated and calibrated traffic model, we trained the policy of a deep RL agent that aims to reduce travel delays in the network. We evaluated the resulting policy by comparing its performance against the phase offsets obtained by a state-of-the-practice baseline, SYNCHRO. The resulting policy dynamically readjusts phase offsets in response to changes in traffic demand. Simulation results show that the proposed deep RL agent outperformed SYNCHRO on average, effectively reducing delay time by 13.21% in the AM Scenario, 2.42% in the noon scenario, and 6.2% in the PM scenario. Finally, we also show the robustness of our agent to extreme traffic conditions, such as demand surges and localized traffic incidents.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2071"]}
{"title": "Arterial Traffic Flow Prediction: A Deep Learning Approach with Embedded Signal Phasing Information\n", "abstract": " Accurate and reliable prediction of traffic measurements plays a crucial role in the development of modern intelligent transportation systems. Due to more complex road geometries and the presence of signal control, arterial traffic prediction is a level above freeway traffic prediction. Many existing studies on arterial traffic prediction only consider temporal measurements of flow and occupancy from loop sensors and neglect the rich spatial relationships between upstream and downstream detectors. As a result, they often suffer large prediction errors, especially for long horizons. We fill this gap by enhancing a deep learning approach, Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network, with spatial information generated from signal timing plans at targeted intersections. Traffic at signalized intersections is modeled as a diffusion process with a transition matrix constructed from the green times of the signal phase timing plan. We apply this novel method to predict traffic flow from loop sensor measurements and signal timing plans at an arterial intersection in Arcadia, CA. We demonstrate that our proposed method yields superior forecasts; for a prediction horizon of 30 minutes, we cut the MAPE down to 16% for morning peaks, 10% for off peaks, and even 8% for afternoon peaks. In addition, we exemplify the robustness of our model through a number of experiments with various settings in detector coverage, detector type, and data quality.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2071"]}
{"title": "ResiliNet: Failure-Resilient Inference in Distributed Neural Networks\n", "abstract": " Federated Learning aims to train distributed deep models without sharing the raw data with the centralized server. Similarly, in distributed inference of neural networks, by partitioning the network and distributing it across several physical nodes, activations and gradients are exchanged between physical nodes, rather than raw data. Nevertheless, when a neural network is partitioned and distributed among physical nodes, failure of physical nodes causes the failure of the neural units that are placed on those nodes, which results in a significant performance drop. Current approaches focus on resiliency of training in distributed neural networks. However, resiliency of inference in distributed neural networks is less explored. We introduce ResiliNet, a scheme for making inference in distributed neural networks resilient to physical node failures. ResiliNet combines two concepts to provide resiliency: skip hyperconnection, a concept for skipping nodes in distributed neural networks similar to skip connection in resnets, and a novel technique called failout, which is introduced in this paper. Failout simulates physical node failure conditions during training using dropout, and is specifically designed to improve the resiliency of distributed neural networks. The results of the experiments and ablation studies using three datasets confirm the ability of ResiliNet to provide inference resiliency for distributed neural networks.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2071"]}

In the Markovian traffic assignment framework, transition matrices are used to derive the traffic flow allocation.

Consequently, compared to static traffic assignment, drivers\u2019 routing behaviors can be modeled with fewer variables. As a result, it could be used to improve the efficiency of traffic management, especially in large scale applications. To begin with, the article introduces Markovian traffic assignment and connects it to the classic static traffic assignment. Then, the framework is extended to dynamic traffic assignment using microscopic traffic simulator Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO). In a case study, the framework is applied to a standard benchmark network, where optimal routing behaviors are independently learned through grid search, random search, and evolution strategies, under three different reward functions (network outflow, total vehicle hours of travel, and average marginal regret).

The queuing in the network is assumed to be contained at each junction node and spill-back to the previous junction is ignored. We show that this model leads to a well-posed problem for computing the dynamics of the system and prove that the solution is unique through a mathematical derivation of the model properties. The framework is then used to analytically prescribe the delays at each junction of the network and across any sub-path, which is the main contribution of the article. This is a critical requirement when solving control and optimization problems over the network, such as system optimal network routing and solving for equilibrium behavior. In fact, the framework provides analytical expressions for the delay at any node or sub-path as a function of the inflow at any upstream node. Furthermore, the model can be solved numerically using a very simple and efficient feed forward algorithm.

We characterize a set of tolls that guarantee the existence of a potential function when only two types of users are participating in the game. We present an upper bound for the price of anarchy (i.e., the worst-case ratio of the social cost calculated for a Nash equilibrium over the social cost for a socially optimal flow) for the case in which only two types of players are participating in a game with affine edge cost functions. A heterogeneous routing game with vehicle platooning incentives is used as an example throughout the article to clarify the concepts and to validate the results.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2071"]}

{"title": "Special issue on mathematics of traffic flow modeling, estimation and control\n", "abstract": " Control: The control of traffic flow suffers from the same challenges as estimation, because typically the involved control schemes will have to deal with nonsmoothness of the solutions, making the use of adjoint based techniques challenging. Various approaches were presented and the control of PDE models was addressed. The Special Issue is formed of eleven papers, which cover the topics mentioned above. In particular, the paper of Bressan and Han focused on the existence of optimal solutions and Nash equilibria for a model of Dynamic Traffic Assignment based on conservation laws. Garavello and Piccoli defined a new approach to couple microscopic and macroscopic models, with phase transitions, at boundaries.

{"title": "Providing In-Vehicle Soft Safety Alerts Using Mobile Millennium Data and Vehicle Event Information Final Report For Renault\n", "abstract": " The UC Berkeley, California PATH-Renault collaboration, detailed in this report, built upon the Mobile Millennium and Networked Traveler projects that were conducted from 2007 to 2011 as part of the US DOT\u2019s SafeTrip-21 Initiative. The Mobile Millennium project provided a platform for aggregating traffic information across various sources, including infrastructure sensors, commercial data feeds, probe vehicles, and probe cell phones. The Networked Traveler project provided the California PATH instrumented research vehicle platform used to both deliver vehicle probe data back to the infrastructure and to generate Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) alerts to the drivers of those vehicles. The main theme of this collaboration project was to demonstrate the potential to create Enhanced Probe Vehicles (EPVs) by merging vehicle CAN-bus data with the typical GPS data that is provided by normal probe vehicles. EPVs could then provide more accurate speed information to the traffic servers along with additional information that only the vehicle knows, such as current gear, hazard light warning activation, or even airbag deployment events.During SafeTrip-21, the two California PATH research platforms were built independently, so the first goal of this project was integrate the two systems, allowing the instrumented research vehicles to communicate with the Mobile Millennium traffic aggregation servers. The second goal was to enhance the data gathered and stored by the Mobile Millennium traffic aggregation server to include the enhanced information provided by the EPVs, specifically, to include hazard warning light activation events.

{"title": "State estimation in large-scale open channel networks using particle filters\n", "abstract": " We consider the problem of estimating flow state in real time in large-scale open channel networks. After constructing a state space model of the flow based on the Saint-Venant equations, we implement the optimal sequential importance resampling (SIR) filter to perform state estimation using some additional flow measurements. The estimation method is implemented using a model of a network of 19 subchannels and one reservoir, Clifton Court Forebay, in Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California and the numerical results are presented.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2071"]}
{"title": "Stackelberg Routing on Horizontal Queueing Networks\n", "abstract": " In order to address inefficiencies of Nash equilibria for horizontal queuing congestion networks, we study the Stackelberg routing game on parallel networks: assuming a coordinator has control over a fraction of the flow, what is a good way of routing that compliant flow so that the induced Nash equilibrium is closer to the social optimum than the initial Nash equilibrium?We study Stackelberg routing for a new class of latency functions, that models congestion on horizontal queuing networks. We show that in this setting, optimal Stackelberg strategies can be computed in polynomial time in the size of the network. We introduce a candidate Stackelberg strategy, the non-compliant first strategy, and prove it to be optimal. We apply these results by modeling a transportation network in which a coordinator can choose the routes of fraction of compliant agents, while the rest of the agents choose their routes selfishly. Some proofs are omitted for brevity, and are available for the reviewer\u2019s convenience in [6].", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2071"]}
{"title": "On the Characterization and Computation of Nash Equilibria in Horizontal Queueing Networks\n", "abstract": " We study inefficiencies in horizontal queueing networks due to the selfish behavior of agents, by comparing social optima to Nash equilibria. The article expands studies on routing games which traditionally model congestion with latency functions that increase with the flow on a particular link. This type of latency function cannot capture congestion effects on horizontal queueing networks. Latencies on horizontal queueing networks increase as a function of density, and flow can decrease with increasing latencies. For example, this class of latency functions arises in transportation networks. For static analysis of horizontal queuing on parallel-link networks, we show that there are multiple Nash equilibria with different total costs, which contrasts results for increasing latency functions. We present a novel algorithm, quadratic in the number of links, for computing the Nash equilibrium that minimizes total cost (best Nash equilibrium). The relative inefficiencies of best Nash equilibria are evaluated through analysis of the price of stability, and analytical results are presented for two-link networks. Price of stability is shown to be sensitive to changes in demand when links are near capacity, and congestion mitigation strategies are discussed, motivated by our results.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2071"]}
{"title": "iShake: Mobile Phones as Seismic Sensors\n", "abstract": " Emergency responders must \u201csee\u201d the effects of an earthquake clearly and rapidly so that they can respond effectively to the damage it has produced. Great strides have been made recently in developing methodologies that deliver rapid and accurate post-earthquake information. However, shortcomings still exist. The iShake project is an innovative use of cell phones and information technology to bridge the gap between the high quality, but sparse, ground motion instrument data that are used to help develop ShakeMap and the low quality, but large quantity, human observational data collected to construct a \u201cDid You Feel It?\u201d(DYFI)-based map. Rather than using people as measurement \u201cdevices\u201d as is being done through DYFI, the iShake project is using their cell phones to measure ground motion intensity parameters and automatically deliver the data to the US Geological Survey (USGS) for processing and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2071"]}
{"title": "A framework for analyzing the sensitivity of traffic data quality to sensor location and spacing\n", "abstract": " This paper presents a framework and tools developed to study the sensitivity of traffic data quality to detectors location and spacing. Our ultimate objective is to formulate generalized detector deployment guidelines that are based on the functional needs of practitioners, and for which funding can be objectively justified. Our approach consists in using trajectory sets obtained from field experiments and traffic simulation models as ground truth, and to run a traffic detector model from which we extract information that would normally be available to practitioners. Ground truth information and detector-generated information are compared through selected quality benchmark measures, and we search detector configurations that optimize this comparison. We test both model-based and so-called na\u00efve traffic estimation techniques, and find that while the former is superior, the difference becomes negligible as detector density increases. 1/2 mile spacing seems to always yield reasonably good information, but no such analysis should overlook detector failure rates. We conclude that those must be taken into account in the formulation of deployment guidelines, a step we defer to further studies.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2071"]}
