Approximately 30,000 of these infants were born before 28\u00a0weeks of gestation. These infants, termed Extremely Low Gestational Age Neonates (ELGANs), experience high morbidity and mortality despite modern therapies: approximately 20\u00a0% of ELGANs admitted to an NICU die before discharge, 20\u00a0% of survivors have severe, and 20\u00a0% moderate neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI). New approaches are needed to improve neonatal outcomes. Recombinant erythropoietin (Epo) is a promising neuroprotective agent that is widely available, affordable, and has been used safely in neonates to stimulate erythropoiesis. There are extensive preclinical data to support its use as a neuroprotective intervention: Epo promotes normal brain maturation by increasing neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and by protecting oligodendrocytes. Epo also decreases acute brain injury following hypoxia ischemia by decreasing inflammation, oxidative and excitotoxic injury, resulting in decreased apoptosis. Despite the availability of both preclinical and safety data there has not been a definitive clinical evaluation of the benefit of Epo, and a large phase III trial is necessary to provide evidence to support potential changes in practice guidelines. We first review the preclinical data motivating further clinical trials, and then describe in detail the design of the PENUT study (Preterm Epo Neuroprotection). PENUT is a phase III study evaluating the effect of neonatal Epo treatment on the combined outcome of death or severe NDI among ELGANS. 940 subjects will be randomized\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "64\n", "authors": ["2089"]}

Thirty medical students completed a randomized controlled trial evaluating whether the Raven robot could be used as an alternative training tool for the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) block transfer task on the da Vinci robot. Two groups, one trained on the da Vinci and one trained on the Raven, were tested on a criterion FLS block transfer task on the da Vinci. After robotic FLS block transfer proficiency training there was no statistically significant difference between path length (p= 0.39) and economy of motion scores (p= 0.06) between the two groups, but those trained on the da Vinci did have faster task times (p= 0.01).

We performed genome wide methylation and whole transcriptome analyses to elucidate the early pathogenesis of CP in extremely low gestational age neonates (ELGANs). We evaluated peripheral blood cell specimens collected during a randomized trial of erythropoietin for neuroprotection in the ELGAN (PENUT Trial, NCT# 01378273). DNA methylation data were generated from 94 PENUT subjects (n= 47 CP vs. n= 47 Control) on day 1 and 14 of life. Gene expression data were generated from a subset of 56 subjects. Only one differentially methylated region was identified for the day 1 to 14 change between CP versus no CP, without evidence for differential gene expression of the associated gene RNA Pseudouridine\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2089"]}

Currently, most assessments are based on the opinion of patients and their plastic surgeons. The objective of this research was to analyze the reliability of crowdworkers assessing de-identified photographs using a validated scale that depicts lower facial aging.Methods:Twenty photographs of the facial nasolabial region of various non-identifiable faces were obtained for which various degrees of facial aging were present. Independent crowds of 100 crowd workers were tasked with assessing the degree of aging using a photograph numeric scale.

PACE has 7 domains: bladder drop, preparation of prostate, bladder neck dissection, dissection of seminal vesicles, nerve-sparing, apical dissection, and anastomosis. Anchors for poor and ideal performance were assigned scores 1 and 5, respectively. Linear mixed-effects models derived mean ratings for each segment.

Observational studies may be better suited than RCTs for evaluating the long-term risks and benefits of a therapy [4]. Conclusions regarding long-term benefits of a therapy evaluated in RCTs are often hampered by patient crossover to a non-randomized treatment. Most observers would agree that other advantages of observational studies relative to RCTs include their greater ease and lower costs, as well as the benefit of not restricting access to desired treatments [4\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2089"]}

The multi-center randomized clinical trial (RCT)[3] also considered the primary SCS analysis group to be all the patients who received a trial.
