{"title": "Encrypted jihad: Investigating the role of Telegram App in lone wolf attacks in the West\n", "abstract": " The study aims to capture links between the use of encrypted communication channel - Telegram and lone wolf attacks occurred in Europe between 2015-2016. To understand threads of ISIS communication on Telegram we used digital ethnography approach which consists of the self-observation of information flows on four of ISIS\u2019s most celebrated telegram Channels. We draw on public sphere theory and coined the term terror socio-sphere 3.0 as the theoretical background of this study. The collected data is presented as screenshots to capture a visual evidence of ISIS communication threads. This study shows that ISIS Telegram channels play critical role in personal communication between potential recruits and dissemination of propaganda that encourage \u2018lone wolves\u2019 to carry attacks in the world at large. This study was limited to the number of the channels that have been widely celebrated.", "num_citations": "62\n", "authors": ["2256"]}
{"title": "Fog computing security and privacy for the Internet of Thing applications: State\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art\n", "abstract": " Fog nodes are implemented near to end\u2010users Internet of Things (IoT) devices, which mitigate the impact of low latency, location awareness, and geographic distribution unsupported features of many IoT applications. Moreover, Fog computing decreases the data offload into the Cloud, which decreases the response time. Despite these benefits, Fog computing faces many challenges in meeting security and privacy requirements. These challenges occur due to the limitations of Fog computing resources. In fact, Fog computing may add new security and privacy issues. Although many papers have discussed the Fog security and privacy issues recently, most of these papers have discussed these issues at a very high level. This paper provides a comprehensive understanding of Fog privacy and security issue. In this survey, we review the literature on Fog computing to draw the state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art of the security and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["2256"]}
{"title": "Rankings of importance of location-based services utilisation for emergency management\n", "abstract": " Driven by several issues from earlier commercial public alerting projects, this paper investigates people's opinions in regard to the current and expected deployments of mobile location-based services under national emergency alerting and warning systems. In particular, the paper examines general public perspective of the importance of utilising the services in different types of emergency events, categorised as natural and human-caused. A survey was carried out to fulfil the requirements of the investigation. The findings clearly denoted significant differences between the mean ranks of all emergency types in the two categories, providing evidence that the importance of utilising LBS is perceived differently by the public for different emergency event types. It is expected that such validated criterion of investigation would help systems' designers to narrow down their selection of emergency event types to only those\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["2256"]}
{"title": "Fog computing security and privacy issues, open challenges, and blockchain solution: An overview.\n", "abstract": " Due to the expansion growth of the IoT devices, Fog computing was proposed to enhance the low latency IoT applications and meet the distribution nature of these devices. However, Fog computing was criticized for several privacy and security vulnerabilities. This paper aims to identify and discuss the security challenges for Fog computing. It also discusses blockchain technology as a complementary mechanism associated with Fog computing to mitigate the impact of these issues. The findings of this paper reveal that blockchain can meet the privacy and security requirements of fog computing; however, there are several limitations of blockchain that should be further investigated in the context of Fog computing.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["2256"]}
{"title": "Mobile cloud computing models security issues: A systematic review\n", "abstract": " Mobile cloud computing (MCC) is a trending technology employed in several domains to overcome the limitations of mobile devices by using cloud capabilities. Communication between mobile devices and clouds is maintained via wireless media to make use of cloud services. Hence, MCC models show vital security issues related to many disciplines, especially authentication, privacy, and trust. Current MCC models lack the ability to secure and protect data, resources, communication channels, and authentication (client-to-cloud and cloud-to-client). MCC security issues have appeared mainly as a result of the integration between mobile devices and cloud computing. MCC issues represent critical challenges that must be addressed by model developers and practitioners. Enormous models have been proposed to enhance mobile cloud computing security issues, which makes it essential to systematically review\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["2256"]}
{"title": "An agile enterprise architecture driven approach to enhance communication in geographically distributed agile development\n", "abstract": " Agile development is a highly collaborative environment, which requires active communication among stakeholders. This active communication helps in producing high quality working software systems in short releases and iterations. Due to the ever-increasing competition, there is an increasing interest among practitioners and researchers in contemporary geographically distributed agile development (GDAD). GDAD claims to offer several benefits over co-located agile development such as lower production cost, around the clock development, faster time to market, and the liberty of involving the most talented developers across the globe. However, in the GDAD environment, active communication is difficult to achieve due to many challenges such as differences in geographical locations and time. Literature has reported that agile enterprise architecture (EA) could help enhancing GDAD communication and performance. However, little empirical evidence is known to support this claim. Furthermore, it is not clear how to effectively achieve and study active communication construct in GDAD in terms of its dimensions, determinants and effects on performance? As a result, there is a lack of understanding about how GDAD organisations can establish and maintain active communication among distributed teams. This dissertation contributes to this research gap, first, by developing a research model based on an extensive systematic literature review on the GDAD communication challenges, techniques and strategies to mitigate these challenges, and the impact of communication on GDAD software performance. This study provides important insights\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2256"]}
