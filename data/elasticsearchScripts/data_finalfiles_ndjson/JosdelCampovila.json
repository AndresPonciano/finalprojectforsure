In this context, the target function may change overtime, an inherent problem of online learning (known as concept drift). In order to handle concept drift regardless of the learning model, we propose new methods to monitor the performance metrics measured during the learning process, to trigger drift signals when a significant variation has been detected. To monitor this performance, we apply some probability inequalities that assume only independent, univariate and bounded random variables to obtain theoretical guarantees for the detection of such distributional changes. Some common restrictions for the online change detection as well as relevant types of change (abrupt and gradual) are considered. Two main approaches are proposed, the first one involves\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "186\n", "authors": ["1080"]}
{"title": "Online adaptive decision trees based on concentration inequalities\n", "abstract": " Classification trees are a powerful tool for mining non-stationary data streams. In these situations, massive data are constantly generated at high speed and the underlying target function can change over time. The iadem family of algorithms is based on Hoeffding\u2019s and Chernoff\u2019s bounds and induces online decision trees from data streams, but is not able to handle concept drift. This study extends this family to deal with time-changing data streams. The new online algorithm, named iadem-3, performs two main actions in response to a concept drift. Firstly, it resets the variables affected by the change and maintains unbroken the structure of the tree, which allows for changes in which consecutive target functions are very similar. Secondly, it creates alternative models that replace parts of the main tree when they significantly improve the accuracy of the model, thereby rebuilding the main tree if needed.

Conceivably Twitter stands out from the others, not only for the platform's simplicity but also for the great influence that the messages sent over the network can have. The impact of such messages determines the influence of a Twitter user and is what tools such as Klout, PeerIndex or TwitterGrader aim to calculate. Reducing all the factors that make a person influential into a single number is not an easy task, and the effort involved could become useless if the Twitter users do not know how to improve it. In this paper we identify what specific actions should be carried out for a Twitterer to increase their influence in each of above-mentioned tools applying, for this purpose, data mining techniques based on classification and regression algorithms to the information collected from a set of Twitter users.", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["1080"]}
{"title": "Fast Adapting Ensemble: A New Algorithm for Mining Data Streams with Concept Drift\n", "abstract": " The treatment of large data streams in the presence of concept drifts is one of the main challenges in the field of data mining, particularly when the algorithms have to deal with concepts that disappear and then reappear. This paper presents a new algorithm, called Fast Adapting Ensemble (FAE), which adapts very quickly to both abrupt and gradual concept drifts, and has been specifically designed to deal with recurring concepts. FAE processes the learning examples in blocks of the same size, but it does not have to wait for the batch to be complete in order to adapt its base classification mechanism. FAE incorporates a drift detector to improve the handling of abrupt concept drifts and stores a set of inactive classifiers that represent old concepts, which are activated very quickly when these concepts reappear. We compare our new algorithm with various well-known learning algorithms, taking into account, common benchmark datasets. The experiments show promising results from the proposed algorithm (regarding accuracy and runtime), handling different types of concept drifts.", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["1080"]}
{"title": "Improving Prediction Accuracy of an Incremental Algorithm Driven by Error Margins\n", "abstract": " Incremental learning is an approach to deal with the classification task when datasets are too large or when new examples can arrive at any time. One possible approach uses concentration bounds (like Chernoff or Hoeffding bounds) to ensure that expansions are done when the number of examples supports the change. Two algorithms that use this approach are VFDT or IADEM. In this paper we extend the IADEM system in two directions: adding the ability to deal with continuous data and including the use of more powerful classification techniques at tree leaves. The proposed system, IADEMc, can incorporate and classify new information as the basic algorithms do, using shorter time per example. Another relevant property of our system is the ability to obtain a performance similar to a standard decision tree algorithm independently of the datasets size.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["1080"]}

The most relevant features of this new algorithm are: its capability to deal with datasets of any size for inducing accurate trees and its capacity to keep updated the estimation error of the tree that is being induced. This estimation of the error is fundamental to satisfy the user requirements about the desired error in the tree and to detect noise in the datasets.", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["1080"]}

It is directly connected with Web-based Educational Systems (WBES) and Data Mining (DM, a fundamental part of Knowledge Discovery in Databases). The former defines the context: WBES store and manage huge amounts of data. Such data are increasingly growing and they contain hidden knowledge that could be very useful to the users (both teachers and students). It is desirable to identify such knowledge in the form of models, patterns or any other representation schema that allows a better exploitation of the system. The latter reveals itself as the tool to achieve such discovering. Data mining must afford very complex and different situations to reach quality solutions. Therefore, data mining is a research field where many advances are being done to accommodate and solve emerging problems. For this purpose, many techniques are usually considered. In this paper we study how data mining can be used to induce student models from the data acquired by a specific Web-based tool for adaptive testing, called SIETTE. Concretely we have used top down induction decision trees algorithms to extract the patterns because these models, decision trees, are easily understandable.

Method: This is a retrospective, descriptive study that records all the calls made to the SUE due to suicidal behaviour (suicide attempts and consummated suicides) in 2014. Sociodemographic variables (age, sex and health district) and variables related to the calls (time-slot, time of day, type of day, month, quarters and season of the year, time of the year, holiday period, priority and number of resources mobilised) were extracted from these calls. The number of cases and percentages were presented for the qualitative variables. The rates per 100,000 were calculated by sex and health district and presented with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: Of the total valid calls (n=181,824), 1,728 calls were made due to suicidal behaviour (0.9%). The mean age was 43.21 (\u00b118) years, and 57.4% were women. The rate of calls due to suicidal behaviour was 112.1 per 100,000 inhabitants. The health district of M\u00e1laga (city) yielded the highest rate (121.7 per 100,000 inhabitants), whereas Ronda yielded the lowest (94.62 per 100,000 inhabitants).
