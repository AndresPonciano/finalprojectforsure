The use of public transportation is an alternative to improve this scenario, since it diminishes the number of private vehicles on the roads.

Due to their ability to automate tasks, bots have been widely adopted by Open Source Software (OSS) projects hosted on GitHub. Commonly, OSS projects use bots to automate a variety of routine tasks to save time from maintainers and contributors. Although bots can be useful for supporting maintainers' work, sometimes their comments are seen as spams, and are quickly ignored by contributors. In fact, the way that these bots interact on pull requests can be disruptive and perceived as unwelcoming. In this paper, we propose the concept of a meta-bot to deal with current problems on the human-bot interaction on pull requests. Besides providing additional value to this interaction, meta-bot will reduce interruptions and help maintainers and contributors stay aware of important information.", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["207"]}

{"title": "Supporting newcomers to overcome the barriers to contribute to open source software projects\n", "abstract": " Community-based Open Source Software (OSS) projects are generally self-organized and dynamic, receiving contributions from volunteers spread across the globe. These communities survival, long-term success, and continuity demand a constant influx of newcomers. However, newcomers face many barriers when making their first contribution to an OSS project, leading in many cases to dropouts. Therefore, a major challenge for OSS projects is to provide ways to support newcomers during their first contribution. In this thesis, our goal was to identify and understand the barriers newcomers face and provide appropriate strategies to lower these barriers. Toward this end, we conducted multiple studies, using multiple research methods. To identify the barriers, we used data collected from: semi-structured interviews with 35 developers from 13 different projects; 24 answers to an open questionnaire conducted with OSS developers; feedback from 9 graduate and undergraduate students after they tried to join OSS projects; and 20 primary studies gathered via a systematic literature review. The data was analyzed using Grounded Theory procedures: namely, open and axial coding. Subsequently, the analysis resulted in a preliminary conceptual model composed of 58 barriers grouped into six categories: cultural differences, newcomers characteristics, reception issues, newcomers orientation, technical hurdles, and documentation problems. Based on the conceptual model, we developed FLOSScoach, a portal to support newcomers making their first OSS project contribution. To assess the portal, we conducted a study with undergraduate students\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["207"]}

Recently, crowdsourcing has also been used for software development to run tests, fix small defects, or perform small coding tasks. Among the pillars upholding the crowdsourcing business model are the platform participants, as they are responsible for accomplishing the requested tasks. Since successful crowdsourcing heavily relies on attracting and retaining participants, it is essential to understand how they behave. This exploratory study aims to understand a specific contributor profile: hyperspecialists. We analyzed developers\u2019 participation on challenges in two ways. First, we analyzed the type of challenge that 664 Topcoder platform developers participated in during the first 18 months of their participation. Second, we focused on the profile of users who had more collaborations in the development challenges. After quantitative analysis, we observed that, in general, users who do not stop participating have behavioral traits that indicate hyper-specialization, since they participate in the majority of the same types of challenge. An interesting, though troubling, finding was the high dropout rate on the platform: 66% of participants discontinued their participation during the study period. The results also showed that hyperspecialization can be observed in terms of technologies required in the development challenges. We found that 60% of the 2,086 developers analyzed participated in at least 75% of challenges that required the same technology.
