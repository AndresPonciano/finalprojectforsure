{"title": "Blockchain for IoT security and privacy: The case study of a smart home\n", "abstract": " Internet of Things (IoT) security and privacy remain a major challenge, mainly due to the massive scale and distributed nature of IoT networks. Blockchain-based approaches provide decentralized security and privacy, yet they involve significant energy, delay, and computational overhead that is not suitable for most resource-constrained IoT devices. In our previous work, we presented a lightweight instantiation of a BC particularly geared for use in IoT by eliminating the Proof of Work (POW) and the concept of coins. Our approach was exemplified in a smart home setting and consists of three main tiers namely: cloud storage, overlay, and smart home. In this paper we delve deeper and outline the various core components and functions of the smart home tier.

It can raise citizen awareness of noise pollution levels, and aid in the development of mitigation strategies to cope with the adverse effects. However, state-of-the-art techniques for rendering noise maps in urban areas are expensive and rarely updated (months or even years), as they rely on population and traffic models rather than on real data.

{"title": "Towards an optimized blockchain for IoT\n", "abstract": " There has been increasing interest in adopting BlockChain (BC), that underpins the crypto-currency Bitcoin, in Internet of Things (IoT) for security and privacy. However, BCs are computationally expensive and involve high bandwidth overhead and delays, which are not suitable for most IoT devices. This paper proposes a lightweight BC-based architecture for IoT that virtually eliminates the overheads of classic BC, while maintaining most of its security and privacy benefits. IoT devices benefit from a private immutable ledger, that acts similar to BC but is managed centrally, to optimize energy consumption. High resource devices create an overlay network to implement a publicly accessible distributed BC that ensures end-to-end security and privacy.

{"title": "Blockchain in internet of things: challenges and solutions\n", "abstract": " The Internet of Things IoT is experiencing exponential growth in research and industry, but it still suffers from privacy and security vulnerabilities. Conventional security and privacy approaches tend to be inapplicable for IoT, mainly due to its decentralized topology and the resource-constraints of the majority of its devices. BlockChain BC that underpin the crypto-currency Bitcoin have been recently used to provide security and privacy in peer-to-peer networks with similar topologies to IoT. However, BCs are computationally expensive and involve high bandwidth overhead and delays, which are not suitable for IoT devices. This position paper proposes a new secure, private, and lightweight architecture for IoT, based on BC technology that eliminates the overhead of BC while maintaining most of its security and privacy benefits. The described method is investigated on a smart home application as a representative case study for broader IoT applications. The proposed architecture is hierarchical, and consists of smart homes, an overlay network and cloud storages coordinating data transactions with BC to provide privacy and security. Our design uses different types of BCs depending on where in the network hierarchy a transaction occurs, and uses distributed trust methods to ensure a decentralized topology. Qualitative evaluation of the architecture under common threat models highlights its effectiveness in providing security and privacy for IoT applications.", "num_citations": "426\n", "authors": ["2079"]}

The goal of our project is to develop a prototype of WSN for outdoor deployment. We aim to design a system, which can detect and classify multiple targets (eg, vehicles and troop movements), using inexpensive off-the-shelf wireless sensor devices, capable of sensing acoustic and magnetic signals generated by different target objects. In order to archive our goals, we intend to design a system, which is capable of automatic selforganization and calibration. Such a system would need to be capable of performing detection and tracking of targets as well as sending the real time enemy mobility information to a command centre.Real-time tacking with WSN is extremely challenging since it requires high system robustness, real time decision making, high frequency sampling, multi-modality of sensing, complex signal processing and data fusion, distributed coordination and wide area coverage. We propose a Hybrid Sensor Network architecture (HSN), tailored specifically to meet these challenges.

In this paper, we show for the first time WiFi signals can also be used to uniquely identify people. There is strong evidence that suggests that all humans have a unique gait. An individual's gait will thus create unique perturbations in the WiFi spectrum. We propose a system called WiFi-ID that analyses the channel state information to extract unique features that are representative of the walking style of that individual and thus allow us to uniquely identify that person. We implement WiFi-ID on commercial off-the-shelf devices. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our system can uniquely identify people with average accuracy of 93% to 77% from a group of 2 to 6 people, respectively.

Fairness is an intuitively desirable property in the allocation of bandwidth available on a link among traffic flows of different users that share the link.

This paper presents a simple, fair, efficient, and easily implementable scheduling discipline, called Elastic Round Robin (ERR), designed to satisfy the unique needs of wormhole switching, which is popular in interconnection networks of parallel systems.
