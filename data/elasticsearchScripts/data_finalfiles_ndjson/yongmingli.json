{"title": "Multiparty quantum direct secret sharing of classical information with bell states and bell measurements\n", "abstract": " This paper proposed a new and efficient multiparty quantum direct secret sharing (QDSS) by using swapping quantum entanglement of Bell states. In the proposed scheme, the quantum correlation between the possible measurement results of the members (except dealer) and the original local unitary operation encoded by the dealer was presented. All agents only need to perform Bell measurements to share dealer\u2019s secret by recovering dealer\u2019s operation without performing any unitary operation. Our scheme has several advantages. The dealer is not required to retain any photons, and can further share a predetermined key instead of a random key to the agents. It has high capacity as two bits of secret messages can be transmitted by an EPR pair and the intrinsic efficiency approaches 100%, because no classical bit needs to be transmitted except those for detection.

One advantage of our setting is that it is easy to complement a given fuzzy alternating automaton. It suffices to take the dual operation on the transition function and negate final costs on states. Moreover, we show that fuzzy alternating automata have the same expressive power as fuzzy nondeterministic automata, and the former ones are exponentially more succinct than the latter ones.

{"title": "Reachability in fuzzy game graphs\n", "abstract": " Two-player turn-based games on graphs (or game graphs for short) and their probabilistic versions have received increasing attention in computer science, especially in the formal verification of reactive systems. However, in the fuzzy setting, game graphs are yet to be addressed, although some practical applications, such as modeling fuzzy systems that interact with their environments, appeal to such models. To fill the gap, in this paper, we propose a fuzzy version of game graphs and focus on the fuzzy game graphs with reachability objectives, which we will refer to as fuzzy reachability games (FRGs). In an FRG, the goal of one player is to maximize her truth value of reaching a given target set, while the other player aims at the opposite. In this framework, we show that FRGs are determined in the sense that for every state, both of the two players have the same value, and there exist optimal memoryless strategies\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1636"]}

However, it seems that there is no existing research devoted to the discussion of applying soft sets to approximate reasoning. This paper aims to initiate an approximate reasoning scheme based on soft set theory. We consider proposition logic in the framework of a given soft set. By taking parameters of the underlying soft set as atomic formulas, the concept of (well-formed) formulas over a soft set is defined in a natural way. The semantic meaning of formulas is then given by taking objects of the underlying soft set as valuation functions. We propose the notion of decision soft sets and define decision rules as implicative type of formulas in decision soft sets. Motivated by basic ideas from quantitative logic, we also introduce several measures and preorders to evaluate the soundness of formulas and decision rules in soft sets.

Then, we provide a model-checking algorithm for GPoCTL. The main advantage of the algorithm is that it can use scheduling in the decision making processes to convert the model-checking problem into operations of the fuzzy matrix or fixed point of fuzzy matrix functions, which need polynomial time.

In this paper, we generalize important results in multipartite entanglement theory to their counterparts in quantum coherence theory. First, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for when two pure multipartite states are equivalent under local incoherent operations assisted by classical communications (LICC), ie, two states can be deterministically transformed to each other under LICC operations. Next, we investigate and give the conditions in which such a transformation succeeds only stochastically. Different from the entanglement case for two-qubit states, we find that the stochastic LICC (sLICC) equivalence classes are infinite.

It is also an important physical resource in quantum information processing. In this paper, using relative entropy, we consider a more general definition of the cohering power of quantum operations.

{"title": "Fuzzy alternating B\u00fcchi automata over distributive lattices\n", "abstract": " Alternation was first proposed by Chandra et al. for obtaining a theoretical model of parallel computations. Compared with nondeterminism, alternation gives computing devices the power of universal choice in addition to existential choice. In this paper, we put forward a notion of fuzzy alternating B\u00fcchi automata over a distributive lattice L (L-ABAs, for short). In our setting, a weight is the label of a leaf node of the run tree when executing a transition, which is helpful in complementing L-ABAs. Taking the dual operation on the transition function and negating final costs on states, we can get the complement of a given L-ABA. We point out that L-ABAs have the same expressive power as L-valued fuzzy nondeterministic B\u00fcchi automata (L-NBAs). A construction presented here shows that languages accepted by L-valued fuzzy alternating co-B\u00fcchi automata (L-ACAs) are also \u03c9-regular languages.

Firstly, the bone edges were obtained by modified adaptive canny edge detection and multi-feature support vector machine classifier. The accurate bone-cartilage interface edges were achieved by optimizing the bone edges. Subsequently, the seeds and candidate regions were chosen based on the bone-cartilage interface edges and the preliminary segmentation of articular cartilages were achieved by using the elastic region growing. Finally, the anatomic knowledge and morphology were used to improve the primary segmentation results. Anatomical knowledge was used to distinguish the overlapped cartilage parts, and morphology was used to optimize the results. The proposed automatic segmentation\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1636"]}
{"title": "Entropic characterization of coherence in quantum evolutions\n", "abstract": " By using relative entropy of coherence, we characterize the coherence gain induced by some quantum evolutions, including the cohering power of unitary operations and the decohering power of quantum operations. We find that the cohering power of the controlled unitary operation can be reduced to the cohering power of the corresponding unitary operation. We observe that the global coherence generated via incoherent operation applied to the system and an incoherent ancilla do not exceed the amount of coherence contained in the initial system. Our result provides a much tighter lower bound of coherence for the initial quantum state, and give an interesting chain of inequalities for coherence, quantum correlation and entanglement. We also strengthen the relations between quantum correlations and coherence.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1636"]}

{"title": "Generalized intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets and multiattribute decision making\n", "abstract": " Both Fuzzy set theory and rough set theory are effective tools in dealing with uncertainty problems. However, these theories have their own inherent limitation, which is the inadequacy of the parameterizations tool. Soft set theory is a new mathematical tool in dealing with uncertainties which is free from the above difficulties. Soft set can deal with broader uncertain problems by the combination of them. The present paper aims to further generalize intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets and investigate their application in multiattribute decision making. A new soft computing model called generalized intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets is defined and some related properties are investigated. This new model could give approximate description of concerned objects in an intuitionistic fuzzy environment, together with some additional information on the weights of attributes.

{"title": "On tree-preserving constraints\n", "abstract": " The study of tractable subclasses of constraint satisfaction problems is a central topic in constraint solving. Tree convex constraints are extensions of the well-known row convex constraints. Just like the latter, every path-consistent tree convex constraint network is globally consistent. However, it is NP-complete to decide whether a tree convex constraint network has solutions. This paper studies and compares three subclasses of tree convex constraints, which are called chain-, path-, and tree-preserving constraints respectively. The class of tree-preserving constraints strictly contains the subclasses of path-preserving and arc-consistent chain-preserving constraints. We prove that, when enforcing strong path-consistency on a tree-preserving constraint network, in each step, the network remains tree-preserving. This ensures the global consistency of consistent tree-preserving networks after enforcing strong\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1636"]}

In this paper, we review a quantum secret sharing scheme to realize a class of access structures. Based on this protocol, we give a concrete example with three participants. Since the noisy channel has a great influence on the shared quantum secret, we analyze the impacts of two kinds of noisy channels on quantum secret sharing and obtain the expression among the fidelity, noisy coefficient and shared quantum state coefficients. In order to enhance the fidelity of the shared secret, we give an optimized strategy through the concrete scheme. Furthermore, we analyze two specific cases, and we can enhance the fidelity through properly adjusting the compensation parameters.

Then we put forward the notion of surjective functional bisimulation relations and construct the related equivalence relations on A. We also give the properties of these related equivalence relations and define bisimulations relations for A with these properties. Finally, we prove the existence of the greatest bisimulation relation and give the method of constructing the greatest bisimulation relation.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1636"]}

{"title": "The pasting constructions for effect algebras\n", "abstract": " The aim of this paper is to present several techniques of constructing a lattice-ordered effect algebra from a given family of lattice-ordered effect algebras, and to study the structure of finite lattice-ordered effect algebras. Firstly, we prove that any finite MV-effect algebra can be obtained by substituting the atoms of some Boolean algebra by linear MV-effect algebras. Then some conditions which can guarantee that the pasting of a family of effect algebras is an effect algebra are provided. At last, we prove that any finite lattice-ordered effect algebra E without atoms of type 2 can be obtained by substituting the atoms of some orthomodular lattice by linear MV-effect algebras. Furthermore, we give a way how to paste a lattice-ordered effect algebra from the family of MV-effect algebras.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1636"]}

We show that a semiring-induced valuation algebra is a complete (resp. continuous) lattice if and only if the semiring is complete (resp. continuous) lattice with respect to the reverse order-relation on semirings. Furthermore, a semiring-induced information algebra is compact, if the dual of the semiring is an algebraic lattice.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1636"]}

All the rowing on water and ergometer, as well as cross-training (running and cycling) from October, 2007 to OG in 2008 was documented in minutes. As established by Seiler et al., three zones of intensity were divided by lactate threshold 1 (LT1, approximate 2 mM) and lactate threshold 2 (LT2, approximate 4 mM).RESULTS: In the observed period, 5827km (127km/week) were covered by the W1x, including 4202km on water, 910km on ergometer, and 715km in running and cycling. When divided by intensity zones, 75.2% of the distance was distributed in zone 1. The percentage of zone 2 and zone 3 was 22.4% and 2.4%, respectively. After dividing the training year into preparatory period (October to middle of March) and competition period (middle of March to OG), it was found that the training at or around lactate threshold (zone 2) decreased significantly from 34.4% in the preparatory period to 8.7% in the competition period, which was sacrificed by increasing the training volume in zone 1 and 3 from 63.5% to 88.6%, and from 2.1% to 2.7%, respectively.CONCLUSION: Compared with the so-called polarized-training model on the basis of diary record of training session, the training of the studied subject on the basis of recording every actual training\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1636"]}
{"title": "On quotients of formal power series\n", "abstract": " Quotient is a basic operation of formal languages, which plays a key role in the construction of minimal deterministic finite automata (DFA) and the universal automata. In this paper, we extend this operation to formal power series and systemically investigate its implications in the study of weighted automata. In particular, we define two quotient operations for formal power series that coincide when calculated by a word. We term the first operation as (left or right) \\emph{quotient}, and the second as (left or right) \\emph{residual}. To support the definitions of quotients and residuals, the underlying semiring is restricted to complete semirings or complete c-semirings. Algebraical properties that are similar to the classical case are obtained in the formal power series case. Moreover, we show closure properties, under quotients and residuals, of regular series and weighted context-free series are similar as in formal languages. Using these operations, we define for each formal power series  two weighted automata  and . Both weighted automata accepts , and  is the minimal deterministic weighted automaton of . The universality of  is justified and, in particular, we show that  is a sub-automaton of . Last but not least, an effective method to construct the universal automaton is also presented in this paper.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1636"]}

In this paper, we further develop the approximation of fuzzy context-free grammars. In particular, we show that a fuzzy context-free grammar under max-\u2605 compositional inference can be approximated by some fuzzy context-free grammar under max\u2013min compositional inference with any given accuracy.

Using fuzzy logic systems to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions, a fuzzy adaptive observer based on filters is introduced for state estimation as well as system identification. Under the framework of the backstepping design, fuzzy adaptive output feedback control is constructed recursively. By theoretical analysis, all the closed-loop signals are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded, and the tracking errors are proved to converge to a small residual set around the origin.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1636"]}

First, we give quantum uncertainty relations for pure states in a d-dimensional quantum system by making use of the majorization technique; these uncertainty relations are then generalized to mixed states. We find that the lower bounds are always nonnegative for pure states but may be negative for some mixed states. Second, the quantum uncertainty relations for single qubit states are obtained by the analytical method. We show that the lower bounds obtained by this technique are always positive for single qubit states.

It shows that the decohering power of the amplitude damping channel on the , and z basis is equal to each other. The same phenomenon can be seen for the phase damping channel and the flip channels. The cohering power for the phase damping channel and the flip channels on the  basis also equals to that on the z basis. However, the cohering and decohering power of the depolarizing channel is independent to the reference basises.

This paper resolves this problem based on pixel feature selection algorithms at the image level. Firstly, the brain region was segmented from mouse model brain MR images. Secondly, the pixels in the segmented brain region were extracted as a feature vector (features). Thirdly, feature selection was conducted on the extracted features, and the optimal feature subset was obtained. Fourthly, the various optimal feature subsets were obtained by repeating the same processing above.

The verification of multi-valued regular safety properties and multi-valued -regular properties using lattice-valued automata are thoroughly studied. Since the law of non-contradiction (i.e., ) and the law of excluded-middle (i.e., ) do not hold in multi-valued logic, the linear-time properties introduced in this paper have the new forms compared to those in classical logic. Compared to those classical model checking methods, our methods to multi-valued model checking are more directly accordingly.

Next, we investigate and give the conditions in which such a transformation succeeds only stochastically. Different from entanglement case for two-qubit states, we find that the SLICC equivalence classes are infinite. Moreover, it's possible that there are some classes of states in multipartite entanglement can convert into each other, while, they cannot convert into each other in multipartite coherence. In order to show the difference among SLICC classes, we introduce two coherence monotones: accessible coherence and source coherence, following the logistics given in [\\emph{Phys.~Rev.~Lett. 115,~150502 (2015)}].

{"title": "Expressive power of linear-temporal logic based on generalized possibility measures\n", "abstract": " Model checking of linear-time properties based on possibility measures was developed by Li and Li (2013). However, the linear-time properties considered in the previous work were classical and qualitative, possibility information of the systems was not considered thoroughly at all. Therefore, the quantitative model checking of fuzzy linear-time properties based on generalized possibility measures was studied by Li (2016). This paper is a continuation of the above work. In this paper, we study the expressive power of possibilistic linear-temporal logic (PoLTL). Unlike possibilistic computation tree logic (PoCTL) in which the expressiveness of PoCTL is more powerful than computation tree logic (CTL), it is surprising that PoLTL is as expressive as linear-temporal logic (LTL). Furthermore, the comparison between PoLTL and generalized PoLTL (GPoLTL) is given. It is shown that the expressiveness of GPoLTL with\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1636"]}

The information splitter will safely share an state to the receiver with help of the controller. Through introducing an auxiliary system and applying several appropriate unitary transformations the information receiver can reconstruct the original state sent by the information splitter. Due to the non-maximally entangled four-qubit state, the total probability that the receiver obtains the original information is P. Furthermore, we discuss the relationship between the successful splitting probability and the concurrence of the entangled state and get a specific expression.

Further, we propose some necessary and sufficient conditions for a projection problem and its translation to have a same optimal solution set.

So how to compute the truth degree of a formula efficiently is a principal question in this subject. This paper aims at bringing an optimal method for doing this job. Firstly, characterizations of the concept of truth degree are made with concepts from soft constraint theory. Particularly, two soft constraint systems are proposed such that formulas can be taken as soft constraints over them. Then by exploiting the algebraic properties of both constraint systems and n-valued propositional systems, it is shown that different soft constraint systems plays different roles in the computation of truth degree of formulas.

Quantum automata theory has been a very active and fruitful research area, in which many meaningful results have been obtained over the past 10 years. In this paper, the authors firstly define the finite Fock space over an alphabet set, based on which, the definitions of quantum Mealy automata and quantum Moore automata are introduced. These definitions accord with quantum mechanics hypothesis. To consider a closed quantum system consisting of two kinds of automata without influence from the environments, based on the principle of quantum measurement, an investigation is made of the evolution of quantum Mealy automata and quantum Moore automata in detail. Then presented are the languages that are considered as quantum machine languages generated by quantum Mealy automata and quantum Moore automata utilizing the basic properties of density operator. It is well known that a complete measurement can always be represented as an unitary operation1and partial tracing. Considering this principle it is shown that quantum Mealy automata are equivalent to quantum Moore automata under the condition of the pure states.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1636"]}

First several formulations of lattice-valued fuzzy Turing machines, including in particular deterministic and nondeterministic lattice-valued fuzzy Turing machines (l-DTMcs and l-NTMs), are given. It is shown that l-DTMcs and l-NTMs are not equivalent as the acceptors of fuzzy languages. This contrasts sharply with classical Turing machines. Second, it is shown that lattice-valued fuzzy Turing machines can recognize n-r.e. sets in the sense of Bedregal and Figueira, the super-computing power of fuzzy Turing machines is established in the lattice-setting.
