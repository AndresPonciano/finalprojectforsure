{"title": "Towards a Framework for Continuous Software Engineering\n", "abstract": " Characteristics and demands of the modern and digital society have transformed the software development scenario and presented new challenges to software developers and engineers, such as the need for faster deliveries, frequent changes in requirements, lower tolerance to failures and the need to adapt to contemporary business models. The adoption of agile practices has allowed organizations to shorten development cycles and increase customer collaboration. However, this has not been enough. Continuous actions of planning, construction, operation, deployment and evaluation are necessary to produce products that meet customers' needs and behaviors, to make well-informed decisions and identify business opportunities. Thus, organizations should evolve from traditional to continuous and data-driven development in a continuous software engineering approach.

He is survived by his wife, Jocin\u00e9ia Luzia Peterle Falbo, and his son Pedro Peterle Falbo. Falbo was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on September 21, 1964. He studied Mechanical Engineering, with graduate studies in Information Systems (System Analysis), Industrial Engineering, and Environmental Engineering. All of these at the Federal University of Esp\u00edrito Santo (UFES), in Brazil. Despite his formal training in engineering, his professional interests soon led him to the world of software. After working as systems developer, he initiated a career as a lecturer in Computer Science. He then went to pursue a PhD in Computer Science at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), in which he addressed the problem of knowledge integration in software engineering tools [Fal98]. His engineering background has had a clear impact throughout his entire research and teaching career. Despite of his interest in theoretical work, he has always been drawn by the development of practical engineering tools that practitioners could use for problem-solving. Simplicity and usability have always driven his involvement in development efforts.During his PhD studies, he studied logics and knowledge representation, and was introduced by one of his supervisors (Credin\u00e9 Menezes) to the work of the philosopher Mario Bunge. At that time, he also came in contact with an emerging community of ontologies in Computer Science in the mid-1990s.

{"title": "GO-FOR: A Goal-Oriented Framework for Ontology Reuse\n", "abstract": " Ontologies have been successfully used to assign semantics in the Semantic Web context and to enable integration of data from different systems or different sources. However, building ontologies is not a trivial task. Ontology reuse can help in this matter. The search and selection of ontologies to be reused should consider the alignment between their scope and the scope of the ontology being developed. In this paper, we discuss how goal modeling can be helpful in this context and we propose GO-FOR, a framework in which goals are the central elements to promote ontology reuse. We introduce goal-oriented ontology patterns as a new type of pattern to be applied to develop ontologies in a goal-oriented approach. Results of the use of GO-FOR to build an ontology used to integrate water quality data are also shown in this paper.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["381"]}

However, in order to provide a suitable technical solution, it is necessary to take the organizational environment related to the software into account. Use cases have been often used to elicit requirements and represent functionalities that the software must provide to its users. However, use cases are not expressive enough to represent the organizational environment. Moreover, this is not the purpose of use cases. In this context, Enterprise Architecture (EA) emerges as a way to describe the organization's domain. EA provides architectural descriptions that support the alignment between information technology (IT) and organizational processes and, thus, helps developers to properly understand the requirements the software must meet.

{"title": "Software Testing Processes in ISO Standards: How to Harmonize Them?\n", "abstract": " Software Verification & Validation (V&V) activities intend to ensure, respectively, that a software product is being built in conformance with its specification, and that it satisfies its intended use and user needs [IEEE 2004]. Software testing is the dynamic V&V of the behavior of a program against the expected one, considering a finite set of test cases [Bourque and Fairley 2014]. It is a fundamental process for software organizations, since it allows achieving quality software products. To be effective, testing activities should be integrated into a well-defined and controlled process. The importance of testing processes is widely recognized, and there is a growing concern in how to improve the accomplishment of this process [TMMi Foundation 2012].To define and improve their testing processes, software organizations can adopt testing-related standards that support better defining the activities to be performed, artifacts to be produced, roles involved, and other elements of this process. These standards are used to guide software organizations efforts towards quality software testing processes. In this context, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has a set of standards covering the testing domain, such as ISO/IEC 12207 [ISO/IEC 2008], ISO/IEC 29110 [ISO/IEC 2011] and ISO/IEC 29119 [ISO/IEC 2013]. ISO/IEC 12207 and ISO/IEC 29110 are broader standards in the sense that they provide a comprehensive description of software life cycle processes, including recommended testing practices. On the other hand, ISO/IEC 29119 is specific for software testing.

{"title": "Finding reusable structured resources for the integration of environmental research data\n", "abstract": " Successful data integration requires careful examination of data semantics, a task that has often been approached with the use of ontologies. However, there are some barriers to build ontologies for data integration in complex domains such as the environmental one. A relevant problem is the development of new ontologies disregarding previous knowledge resources such as reference models and vocabularies. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a systematic approach (dubbed CLeAR) for the identification and selection of reusable artifacts for building ontologies with the purpose of research data integration. CLeAR follows some principles of the systematic literature reviews, supporting the search for structured resources in the scientific literature. We apply CLeAR to the environmental domain.

The use of patterns makes it easier to reuse successful solutions, speeds up the development process, and promotes the application of good practices. Related patterns can be organized in a Pattern Language (PL), which represents the patterns and their relations, and provides guidance on how to select, reuse and integrate them. Visual notations are often used to provide a graphical representation to PLs. Aiming to investigate how PLs related to software have been visually represented, we carried out a systematic mapping. We identified and analyzed 64 PLs. As a result, we noticed a lack of consensus on the elements that should be represented in a PL and the symbols used to represent them. Moreover, most PLs have ambiguous or inexpressive visual representations.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["381"]}
