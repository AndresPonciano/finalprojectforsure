Heider's (1958) balance theory. The balanced identity design is introduced as a method to test correlational predictions of the theory.

Computerized group decision support systems (GDSSs) can reduce social influences by allowing group members to contribute anonymously and in parallel. This study explores how a simple GDSS on a wireless handheld-device can augment face-to-face group decisions. Small groups of men and women brainstormed potential names for a computer game and voted for the best name using the wireless devices. The names generated were either associated with the person who produced them or not, and group member status was manipulated through the nature of the task and the proportions of men and women in the groups; men were more knowledgeable computer gamers and were always the numeric majority. We found-that men and women generated more ideas when they were anonymous, and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["1197"]}

Puget Sound Off is an online blogging and networking site focused on helping youth connect, collaborate, and take action around local community issues. We performed an evaluation study seeking lessons learned from a real world deployment. We found that a core group of youth became highly engaged with Puget Sound Off, and that both usage and identification with the community was positively correlated with civic engagement. Youth reported an appreciation for the opportunity for meaningful discussion around issues that mattered to them. We found however that growth of Puget Sound Off was slow, in part due to the constraints of deploying to youth in a real world context with concerns about inappropriate use.

We found that co-occurrence in mailing lists provided a good predictor of who works with whom. We then developed Point to Point to allow users to explore networks through an interactive map.

This newfound ease of mobile communication is creating new opportunities for meaningful social interaction, such as keeping in touch with and coordinating activities with friends and family.Cell phones have become an integral part of the feeling of connectedness that people share with one another. However, cell phones also have negative social implications because just as they allow people to reach out to the world, the world can reach back at any time, posing problems of interruptability, split-attention, and politeness in public settings (Pale, 2002).

{"title": "From implicit self-esteem to in-group favoritism\n", "abstract": " People tend to favor in-groups over out-groups, no matter how minimally the in-group is defined. Psychologists argue that such in-group favoritism is caused by either low or high self-esteem. Proponents of Social Identity Theory (Abrams & Hogg, 1988) argue that people with low self-esteem should have more in-group favoritism than people with high self-esteem, because people with low self-esteem have the greatest need to feel better about themselves. In contrast, according to Balance Theory (Heider, 1958), people with high self-esteem should have more in-group favoritism, because people maintain consistent attitudes toward the self and toward their in-groups. Psychologists have yet to find an empirical resolution of these contradictory predictions, perhaps because of their reliance on self-report measures of self-esteem. Self-report measures have limited validity because they are biased by self-presentational\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["1197"]}

In this paper, we present the results of a deployment study examining existing learning practices around search and social networking for students, and how these practices shifted when participants adopted So. cl. We found prior to using So. cl that students already heavily employed search tools and social media for learning. With the use of So. cl, we found that users engaged in lightweight, fun social sharing and learning for informal, personal topics, but not for more heavyweight collaboration around school or work. The public nature of So. cl encouraged users to post search results as much for self-expression as for searching, enabling serendipitous discovery around interests.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["1197"]}

Given the value of social interaction and weak ties for learning new knowledge, this research investigates teens' use of networked technologies with people and resources outside their immediate networks.

{"title": "Modeling youth civic engagement in a new world of networked publics\n", "abstract": " In an increasingly networked public, the Internet and social media provide rich opportunities for reconnecting youth with their civic life. In a questionnaire study of 578 14-20 year old youth, we explore the relationship between Internet technology experiences, civic efficacy, community identification, and civic engagement in their everyday lives. Contrary to prevailing stereotypes of digital youth, we found that most rely on email and text messaging to communicate with others in their local communities about civic issues. Further, those more experienced with technologies in the public sphere (such as blogs, wikis, and Twitter) had higher levels of civic engagement. Teens who strongly identified with their local community and who had higher levels of civic efficacy were especially likely to be civically engaged. These results highlight the importance of encouraging youth to emotionally connect to their local communities, and to do so online in the public sphere rather than through more personal communication channels.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1197"]}

First, through interviews and a questionnaire with 174 residents of 26 neighborhoods we explore what are indicators of neighborhood level well-being, and what are current communication practices around the use of social media to support community well-being. Second, through an analysis of neighborhood-level Twitter messages we examine the extent to which mood and social interactivity in Twitter correspond with our neighborhood well-being indicators. Overall, we found self-reported usage of social media positively correlated with community well-being. However, while smaller neighborhood communities had higher community well-being, they were lower in usage of social media for interacting with neighbors. Only in larger, more urban centers characterized by younger professionals, did Twitter message mood and social interactivity correlate with well-being.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1197"]}
