This research will produce an automated tool that can help the software manager or a maintainer to search for the coverage artifact before and after a change request. Software quality engineer can determine the test coverage from new changes which can support cost estimation, effort, and schedule estimation. Therefore, this study is intended to look at the views and consensus of the experts on the elements in the proposed model by benefitting the Fuzzy Delphi Method. Through purposive sampling, a total of 12 experts from academic and industrial have participated in the verification of items through 5-point linguistic scales of the questionnaire instrument. Outcome studies show 90% of elements in the proposed model consists of change management, traceability support, test effort estimation support, regression testing support, report and GUI meet, the value threshold (d construct) is less than 0.2 and the percentage of the expert group is above 75%. It is shown that elements of all the items contained in the venue are needed in the HyTEE Model (Hybrid Software Change Management Tool with Test Effort Estimation) based on the consensus of experts.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["2266"]}
{"title": "A Review for Improving Software Change using Traceability Model with Test Effort Estimation\n", "abstract": " Maintaining a software system includes tasks such as fixing defects, adding new features, or modifying the software (software changes) to accommodate different environments. Then, the modified software system needs to be tested, to ensure the changes will not having any adverse effects on the previously validated code. Regression testing is one of the approaches which software tester used to test the software system. The traditional regression testing strategy was to repeat all the previous tests and retesting all the features of the program even for small modifications. For programming with thousand lines of codes (LOC), the cost of retesting the entire system is expensive if attempted after every change. This practice is becoming increasingly difficult because of the demand for testing the new functionalities and correcting errors with limited resources. Numerous techniques and tools have been proposed and developed to reduce the costs of regression testing and to aid regression testing processes, such as test suite reduction, test case prioritization, and test case done on the thresholds and weightings used in regression testing. However, there is still need to study on the software traceability model of coverage analysis in software changes during regression testing and test effort estimation on regression testing. Hence, this paper describes the proposal for improving software changes with hybrid traceability model and test effort estimation during regression testing. We will explain our proposed work including the problem background, the intended research objectives, literature review and plan for future implementation.
