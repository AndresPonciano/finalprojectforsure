{"title": "A study of hierarchical clustering algorithm\n", "abstract": " Clustering is the process of grouping the data into classes or clusters, so that objects within a cluster have high similarity in comparison to one another but these objects are very dissimilar to the objects that are in other clusters. Clustering methods are mainly divided into two groups: hierarchical and partitioning methods. Hierarchical clustering combine data objects into clusters, those clusters into larger clusters, and so forth, creating a hierarchy of clusters. In partitioning clustering methods various partitions are constructed and then evaluations of these partitions are performed by some criterion. This paper presents detailed discussion on some improved hierarchical clustering algorithms. In addition to this, author have given some criteria on the basis of which one can also determine the best among these mentioned algorithms.", "num_citations": "87\n", "authors": ["2207"]}
{"title": "Optimized image steganography using discrete wavelet transform (dwt)\n", "abstract": " Steganography is a term used for covered writing. Steganography can be applied on different file formats, such as audio, video, text, image etc. In image steganography, data in the form of image is hidden under some image by using transformations such as ztransformation, integer wavelet transformation, DWT etc and then sent to the destination. At the destination, the data is extracted from the cover image using the inverse transformation. This paper presents a new approach for image steganography using DWT. The cover image is divided into higher and lower frequency sub-bands and data is embedded into higher frequency sub-bands. Arnold Transformation is used to increase the security. The proposed approach is implemented in MATLAB 7.0 and evaluated on the basis of PSNR, capacity and correlation. The proposed approach results in high capacity image steganography as compared to existing approaches.", "num_citations": "30\n", "authors": ["2207"]}
{"title": "A comparative study of iterative thinning algorithms for BMP images\n", "abstract": " Thinning is a very important preprocessing step for the analysis and recognition of different types of images. Thinning is the process of minimizing the width of a line, in an image, from many pixels wide to just one pixel (Lam et al., 1992)[3]. Thus Correct and Reliable thinning of character patterns are essential to a variety of applications in the field of document analysis and recognition systems like pattern recognition; finger print recognition etc. Iterative parallel thinning algorithms which generate one-pixel-wide skeletons generally have difficulty in preserving the connectivity of an image. In present paper, four iterative parallel thinning algorithms namely the Fast Parallel Thinning Algorithm (FPTA), Guo & Hall\u2019s parallel thinning Algorithm (GHPTA), Robust Parallel Thinning Algorithm for binary images (RPTA), and Preprocessing Thinning Algorithms for Handwritten Character Recognition (PPTA) have been implemented in C Language and evaluated. A comparison among these was made on the basis of following factors: quality of skeleton, convergence to unit width and data reduction rate. This study may help to compare or to select the best algorithm. The comparative results are included to support our findings.", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["2207"]}
{"title": "Detection of Black Hole Attack on AODV in MANET Using Fuzzy Logic\n", "abstract": " MANET is a mobile ad-hoc network which dynamically set up temporary paths between mobile nodes which acts both as router and hosts to send and receive packets. As MANET has dynamic topology, no centralized monitoring and limited physical security so it is more vulnerable to attacks and one of them is Black Hole Attack. This attack can be easily implemented in AODV during the routing discovery process. In the Black Hole attack, a malicious node impersonates as destination node either by showing highest destination sequence number or by advertising itself as having the shortest path to destination node. Once the forged route has been established the malicious node is able to become a member of the active route and intercept all communication packets across that node. In this paper an intrusion detection system is introduced to detect Black Hole Attack on AODV in MANET using fuzzy logic. This IDS uses two factors that is forward packet ratio and destination sequence number. These factors are implemented using fuzzy logic in which fidelity level is checked and compared against threshold value and detected whether there is black hole attack or not. The proposed IDS have been tested using NS2 (Network Simulator 2).", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["2207"]}
{"title": "Securing MANET against wormhole attack using neighbor node analysis\n", "abstract": " In mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) security is of major concern because of its inherent liabilities. The characteristics of MANETs like infrastructure less network with dynamic topology pose a number of challenges to security design. There is an increasing threat of attacks in MANET. Wormhole attack is one of the security attacks on mobile ad hoc networks in which a pair of colluding nodes make a tunnel using a high speed network. This paper focuses on providing a solution for secure transmission through the network and proposes a neighbor node analysis approach to identify wormhole attack and removes wormhole link in MANET. The proposed work is simulated using NS-2 and is analyzed using certain parameters such as throughput, loss rate, delay rate.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["2207"]}
{"title": "Role of link expiration time to make reliable link between the nodes in manets: A review\n", "abstract": " Link Expiration is a main problem in already existing secure and non-secure routing protocols of mobile adhoc network (MANETs) and one of the most encouraging issues of research areas. Due to non reliable link, number of packet loss and other routing overhead increased. So, the requirement is both: reliable link and security. Secure communication in mobile adhoc networks is difficult because of mobility, availability of limited resource, changing topology of nodes and limited processing power. MANETs are highly prone to attacks namely, passive attacks and active attacks. Traditional routing protocols do not provide security. So, we need to concentrate on reliability and expiration time of links (LET). Link disconnection is another problem in mobile ad hoc network. Due to mobility of nodes link expires and the node has to find another route for sending the data. So, that route must be discovered from which the link does not expire before all the packets reach the destination. In this paper we have discussed the different types of routing protocols in MANET\u2019s and their performance evaluation based on different parameters using Qualnet simulator.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["2207"]}
{"title": "Taxonomy of Distributed Consensus Algorithms\n", "abstract": " In distributed database computing transactions, group agreements of all the participating nodes is the crucial task. In such transactions, distributed algorithms are used for solving the problem of consensus. Distributed consensus algorithms are mainly of two types one is used in the case of link failures and second for process failures. For process failures, the algorithms used for solving the consensus problem are stopping, byzantine failures and commit protocols. The 2-phase commits (2-PC) and three-phase commit protocols (3-PC) are distributed algorithms that make all nodes in a distributed system agree to either commit or abort a transaction. The algorithms like FloodSet, EIGStop, EIGByz, PAXOS and E3PC are also used in last few years for solving this problem. This paper presents taxonomy of Distributed Consensus Algorithms. Different types of distributed algorithms for solving consensus problem in distributed database computing transactions are discussed here.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["2207"]}

Data mining is the process of identifying the hidden patterns and structures from massive volume of data. Data clustering is most important technique of data mining and widely used in various domains ie web, E-com, biology, machine learning. Data Clustering refers to the process in which data objects are grouped into clusters in such a way that objects within a cluster have high similarity in comparison to one another but are different from objects in different clusters. Due to large application area, we need effective and efficient clustering algorithms or methods which are scalable and can work on large databases, can handle complex shaped data. In recent years, many algorithms have been developed for solving clustering as well as numerical and combinatorial optimization problems. Swarm intelligence algorithms are most efficient in solution of such optimization problems. Swarm intelligence is an important area of Artificial intelligence. It is based on the collective or collaborative behaviour of self organized agents like ant\u2019s colony, bird\u2019s flocks, fish school, bee colony, bats, frogs, bacterium etc. Clustering using different swarm intelligence based metaheuristics is being used as an alternative to more conventional clustering techniques.
