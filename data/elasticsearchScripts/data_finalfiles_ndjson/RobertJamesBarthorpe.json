Over the course of the past several decades there has been ongoing interest in approaches to the problem of SHM. This attention has been sustained by the belief that SHM will allow substantial economic and life-safety benefits to be realised across a wide range of applications. Several numerical and laboratory implementations have been successfully demonstrated. However, despite this research effort, real-world applications of SHM as originally envisaged are somewhat rare. Numerous technical barriers to the broader application of SHM methods have been identified, namely: severe restrictions on the availability of damaged-state data in real-world scenarios; difficulties associated with the numerical modelling of physical systems; and limited understanding of the physical effect of system inputs (including environmental and operational loads). This thesis focuses on the roles of law-based and data-based modelling in current applications of.

One of the reasons for this may be that many of the common continuous-time models for hysteresis, like the Bouc-Wen model are nonlinear in the parameters and incorporate unmeasured states, and this makes a direct analytical discretisation somewhat opaque. Because NARX models are universal in the sense that they can model any input\u2013output process, they can be applied directly without consideration of the hysteretic nature; however, if the polynomial form of NARX were to be used for a Bouc-Wen system, the result would be input-dependent because of the non-polynomial (indeed discontinuous) nature of the original model.

{"title": "Aircraft parametric structural load monitoring using gaussian process regression\n", "abstract": " The work presented here demonstrates the capability of Gaussian Process (GP) regression for the prediction of aircraft structural loads based on recorded flight parameters. The objective of monitoring aircraft loads during operation is to develop a better understanding of aircraft usage and thus to provide the operator with an accurate estimate of the remaining useful life of components against their prescribed fatigue life. These loads are often difficult and expensive to measure and this motivates the use of advanced mathematical techniques to estimate them accurately based on other parameters that are typically measured during flight. Gaussian Process regression is a powerful Bayesian machine learning tool whereby predictions and their distributions can be obtained without having to specify a particular model/functional form. Data collected from a military trainer aircraft is used to demonstrate how the mapping of measured strains to basic flight parameters such as airspeed, accelerations, and control surface deflections can be performed using GP regression. It is also shown how these results can be applied in an aircraft usage monitoring context. The GP predictions for strain are compared to the actual measurements for 101 flights, and the results are presented in terms of fatigue life, correlation, and mean-squared error. The results are encouraging, with errors in fatigue life in the range of 5% to 30% in the worst cases.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["1407"]}

The main features examined here are natural frequencies and mode shapes which could be used alone or in combination with other features for the identification of different states of a structure. Two nominally identical structures, created by the separation of a full scale tail wing into two halves, are first tested.

The objectives of this article are to present the SPO for SHM problem, to provide an overview of the current state of the art in this area, and to identify promising emergent trends within the literature. The key conclusions drawn are that there remains a great deal of scope for research in a number of key areas, including the development of methods that promote robustness to modelling uncertainty, benign effects within measured data, and failures within the sensor network. There also remains a paucity of studies that demonstrate practical, experimental evaluation of developed SHM system designs.

It is often the case that there are a set of competing model structures that could potentially produce good approximations of the real system - this raises the issue of model selection.

To have adequate UQ, it is important to consider the sources of the uncertainty, which can generally be either aleatory or epistemic.

{"title": "An approach to fault detection using a unified linear gaussian framework\n", "abstract": " Presented in this paper is an approach to fault diagnosis based on a unifying review of linear Gaussian models. The unifying review draws together different algorithms such as PCA, factor analysis, hidden Markov models, Gaussian mixture models and linear dynamical systems as simple variations of a single linear Gaussian model. The focus in this work is on PCA, factor analysis and linear dynamical systems in order to compare static and dynamic data models. One of the advantages of using a unified framework for these already well known models is the quantification of uncertainty, and the ability to evaluate the probability of a dataset given a model. To highlight the applicability of such an approach to a fault diagnosis application and to establish in some way its robustness to environmental variability, a set of data collected from the suspension system of a ground vehicle is used.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1407"]}
{"title": "Comparative study of robust novelty detection techniques\n", "abstract": " The central target of this work is to provide an alternative to machine learning approaches to structural health monitoring with one of robust multivariate statistic novelty detection. Damage detection and identification is a procedure that is hierarchical in nature. At its most sophisticated, diagnosis of the damage could include localisation, classification and severity assessment and even go so far as to estimate the time-to-failure of the structure. In this paper, robust multivariate statistics were investigated focused mainly on a high level estimation of the outliers which determines only the presence or absence of novelty-something that is of fundamental interest. These methods allow a diagnosis of deviation from normality and the option of identifying the presence of masking effects caused by multiple outliers.

{"title": "The Effect of Attenuation On the Identification of Impact Damage in CFRP Laminates\n", "abstract": " The subject of this study is the identification of impact damage in composite materials on the basis of response-only measurements. Low velocity impact events can lead to barely visible damage in composite structures which if left undetected can lead to degradation of performance and, in the worst case, to catastrophic failure of the structure. The increasing use of composite materials in aerospace and renewable energy applications motivates a desire to develop methods that allow detection of impact and identification of any resulting damage using measured responses only. In previous work it has been shown that low-dimensional \u2018features\u2019 drawn from surface mounted sensors may be used to develop a statistical basis for damage identification for Carbon Fibre-Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) coupon samples subjected to impact via a drop-test machine. This work has shown that not only can such features be used to indicate the presence of damage, but also that they show promise in indicating both the nature and extent of the damage that has occurred. There are several questions outstanding with regards to this method of damage identification. Prominent among these is the question of attenuation of the signal as it passes through the structure and whether this will hinder the practical application of the methodology. Attenuation is a particular concern given the nature of the composite materials under investigation, being both moderately damped and orthotropic in nature. In the present study, the effect of attenuation is investigated through a series of experiments on extensive plates with sensors at varying locations and orientations from the point\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1407"]}
{"title": "Bayesian Sensitivity Analysis of Numerical Models for Structural Health Monitoring\n", "abstract": " The scarcity of damaged-state data is an abiding problem in practical applications of structural health monitoring. Given this scarcity, it is perhaps unsurprising that many of the techniques proposed for the SHM make use of physics-based modelling in order to \u2018fill in the blanks'. The aim of developing the model is often, but not exclusively, to act as the basis for a model-update type SHM strategy. However, it is possible to get more out of a developed numerical model. By probing the physical interactions encapsulated in the model a comprehensive picture of the relationships between inputs and outputs can be constructed. In this paper, a global sensitivity analysis approach is demonstrated for this purpose. The techniques applied reflect progress in the field of analysis of complex computational models, and make use of both code emulation and Bayesian statistical methods.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1407"]}
{"title": "Real-Time Digital Twin Updating Strategy Based on Structural Health Monitoring Systems\n", "abstract": " In structural health monitoring (SHM), model updating is concerned with identifying and updating system parameters (e.g. stiffness and mass) based on the measured response data of the monitored structure. With the increasing number of SHM systems deployed on modern structures in recent years, real-time model updating has become possible. This allows a digital twin of the monitored structure to be built, such that the structural behaviour can be monitored and predicted simultaneously throughout its life-cycle. In real applications, the structural response data are normally measured under operational conditions where the environment and loading condition cannot be directly controlled, which leads to significant identification uncertainty. The system model can also be complex, meaning that identifying system parameters directly from measured response data is challenging and time consuming.

{"title": "Health monitoring of composite structures by combining ultrasonic wave data\n", "abstract": " With the growing size of large-scale structures, composite materials are being increasingly used due to their high strength-to-weight ratio. As structures get larger, so too does the necessity for a robust health monitoring system; a well-founded and reliable method of doing so is by monitoring acoustic emissions. However, such a method encounters significant problems when employed on composite structures; such as high dispersion of extensional modes, propagation distance-dependent wave velocity and highly subjective characteristic frequencies of failure modes. Ultrasonic guided waves offer the abilities of location and severity detection to a more accurate level, whereas acoustic emission involves a more efficient passive approach. By analysis of ultrasonic waves in a carbon-fibre-reinforced-polymer (CFRP) plate, information is show here that will provide the stepping stones for the development of a robust\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1407"]}
{"title": "On an application of probabilistic risk assessment to structural health monitoring\n", "abstract": " A key motivation for implementing structural health monitoring is to facilitate decisionmaking regarding the operation of a structure throughout its life. The notion of risk has been used to inform decision-making under uncertainty in industries such as nuclear energy and aerospace-formalised in a procedure known as probabilistic risk assessment. The current paper aims to exploit methods used in probabilistic risk assessment to demonstrate a novel risk-based approach to structural health monitoring. The approach utilises a probabilistic graphical model framework in which information is passed from a probabilistic classifier to an influence diagram representing a decision-process via a Bayesian network representation of a fault tree. The risk-based approach is demonstrated on simulated data from a finite element model of a four bay truss.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1407"]}

Fairly recently, methods of parameter estimation using evolutionary optimisation have emerged as a powerful means of identifying whole classes of systems with nonlinearities which previously proved to be very difficult, e.g.\u00a0systems with unmeasured states or with equations of motion nonlinear in the parameters. This paper describes and illustrates the use of evolutionary optimisation methods (specifically the self-adaptive differential evolution (SADE) algorithm) on a class of single degree-of-freedom (SDOF) dynamical systems with hysteretic nonlinearities.

{"title": "An SHM view of a CFD model of Lillgrund wind farm\n", "abstract": " Reliability of offshore wind farms is one of the key areas for the successful implementation of these renewable power plants in the energy arena. Failure of the wind turbine (WT) in general could cause massive financial losses but especially for structures that are operating in offshore sites. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of WTs is essential in order to ensure not only structural safety but also avoidance of overdesign of components that could lead to economic and structural inefficiency. A preliminary analysis of a machine learning approach in the context of WT SHM is presented here; it is based on results from a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model of Lillgrund Wind farm. The analysis is based on neural network regression and is used to predict the measurement of each WT from the measurements of other WTs in the farm.

{"title": "Multiple-site damage location using single-site training data\n", "abstract": " The identification of multiple-site damage is a challenging problem in data-based structural health monitoring (SHM). It is generally accepted that higher level damage identification via statistical pattern recognition requires the adoption of a supervised learning approach, with the need for data to be gathered from the structure in all damaged states of interest. The number of states for which data would be required to cover all damage combinations grows exponentially with the number of locations at which damage may occur. Damage state data sets of this extent are unlikely to be available in practical applications. The objective of this paper is to explore an interesting approach to the problem of multiple-site damage location.
