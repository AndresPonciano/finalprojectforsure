{"title": "Method and system for dynamically prefetching information via a server hierarchy\n", "abstract": " A method and system for prefetching data for clients associated with a proxy server hierarchy and an enhanced content server data transfer to the clients. The method for prefetching data identifies data access patterns and prefetches select information based on a dynamic interpretation of the data access patterns. The content server or proxy server identifies data access reference patterns of clients associated with the content server or the proxy server hierarchy. The data access patterns are preferably stored in a statistics table. The content server generates prefetch hint information based on inputs from the statistics table. The prefetch hint information annotates requested information or objects requested by the clients. The prefetch hint information optimally is updated as the requested information passes through the proxy server hierarchy. The prefetch hint information annotates the requested information requested\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "413\n", "authors": ["1745"]}
{"title": "Sender-specified delivery customization\n", "abstract": " A system and method that enables a given sending user to specify a set of delivery policies and have them used for the electronic delivery of a given message, the message potentially having several heterogeneous parts (eg, text and pictures) each of which is handled differently, and delivered to multiple heterogeneous devices (eg, PCs, Smartphones, fax machines), and possibly to several distinct recipients. The factors with which a sender can qualify their delivery policies include: time/date, transmission cost; whether the transmission can be forwarded; receiving device capability; and network reliability, speed, and security transmission. Methods are also provided enabling a sender to specify that particular transmissions be redirected or copied, eg,\" send fax copy to my broker and my accountant.\" In one embodiment, the delivery policies may be specified using PICS.", "num_citations": "400\n", "authors": ["1745"]}
{"title": "Dynamic modification of multimedia content\n", "abstract": " A method and system for manipulating or modifying identifiable objects in a standard broadcast or Internet-based multimedia stream according to a control specification and a content specification. Viewers and/or organizations can independently specify acceptable levels of content on multiple dimensions to satisfy the content specification while minimizing the filtering or blocking to the viewers. A \u201cfuzz ball\u201d control specification is provided for masking some portion of a video frame. Several fuzz ball specifications can be overlaid to address multidimensional content specifications or rating systems. The manipulation of the multimedia stream can take place at the client (set-top box or computer), intermediate node, the content server or a combination thereof. Proxy servers can modify content specifications for outgoing requests, enabling organizations to specify intranet-wide policies.

{"title": "Collaborative caching of a requested object by a lower level node as a function of the caching status of the object at a higher level node\n", "abstract": " A method and system of collaboratively caching information to allow improved caching decisions by a lower level or sibling node. In a caching hierarchy, the client and/or servers may factor in the caching status at the higher level in deciding whether to cache an object and which objects are to be replaced. The PICS protocol may be used to pass the caching information of some or all the upper hierarchy down the hierarchy. Furthermore, the caching status information can also be used to direct the object request to the closest higher level proxy which has potentially cached the object, instead of blindly requesting it from the next immediate higher level proxy. A selection policy used to select objects for replacement in the cache may be prioritized not only on the size and the frequency of access of the object, but also on the access time required to get the object if it is not cached. The selection policy may also include a\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "194\n", "authors": ["1745"]}

{"title": "Method and apparatus for providing awareness-triggered push\n", "abstract": " A method and a computer program device for pushing data from at least one source entity to at least one client entity over a network, a client entity being characterized as having a particular operating state. The method and computer program device comprise the steps of: transferring data from the at least one source entity to a push proxy entity for subsequent transmission of the data to the client entity; requesting a notification regarding the particular state of the client entity; monitoring a state of the client entity until the client entity is in the particular operating state and sending a notification communicating the state to the push proxy entity; and transferring data to the client entity in response to receiving the notification. The state notification may specify push information, which may be used to determine a least expensive device to which to transfer given data. The state notification also reduces the network-polling load\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "89\n", "authors": ["1745"]}
