{"title": "Bayesian synthesis for knowledge translation in software engineering: Method and illustration\n", "abstract": " Systematic literature reviews in software engineering are necessary to synthesize evidence from multiple studies to provide knowledge and decision support. However, synthesis methods are underutilized in software engineering research. Moreover, translation of synthesized data (outcomes of a systematic review) to provide recommendations for practitioners is seldom practiced. The objective of this paper is to introduce the use of Bayesian synthesis in software engineering research, in particular to translate research evidence into practice by providing the possibility to combine contextualized expert opinions with research evidence. We adopted the Bayesian synthesis method from health research and customized it to be used in software engineering research. The proposed method is described and illustrated using an example from the literature. Bayesian synthesis provides a systematic approach to incorporate\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["2204"]}
{"title": "Reporting ethics considerations in software engineering publications\n", "abstract": " Ethical guidelines of software engineering journals require authors to provide statements related to the conflict of interest and the process of obtaining consent (if human subjects are involved). The objective of this study is to review the reporting of the ethical considerations in Empirical Software Engineering - An International Journal. The results indicate that two out of seven studies reported some ethical information however, not explicitly. The ethical discussions were focussed on anonymity and confidentiality. Ethical aspects such as competence, comprehensibility and vulnerability of the subjects were not discussed in any of the papers reviewed in this study. It is important to not only state that consent was obtained however, the procedure of obtaining consent should be reported to improve the accountability and trust.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["2204"]}
{"title": "Factors Affecting Efficiency of Agile Planning: A Case Study\n", "abstract": " Context. Planning in software projects is a difficult problem due to the uncertainty associated with it. There are many factors that cause difficulty in formulating a plan. Not many factors that influence the efficiency of planning are identified in the previous studies. The literature focuses only on technical aspects such as requirements selection and estimation in order to plan a release or iteration. Objectives. The objective of this study is to identify factors that affect planning efficiency. The context in which the objective is achieved is large scale complex projects that are distributed across multiple teams, in multiple global sites. The motivation for selecting large scale context is because most of the existing releases planning approaches discussed in the literature were investigated in small scale projects. Hence this context will allow studying the planning process in large scale industry. Methods. A case study was conducted at Siemens\u2019 Development Centre in Bangalore, India. A total of 15 interviews were conducted to investigate the planning process adopted by Siemens. To achieve triangulation, process documents such as release planning documents are studied and direct observation of the planning meeting is performed. Therefore multiple sources are used to collect evidences. Results. The identified challenges are grouped into technical and non-technical category. In total 9 technical factors and 11 non-technical factors are identified. The identified factors are also classified based on the context in which they affect the planning. In addition 6 effects of the factors are identified and improvements perceived by the participants are discussed in this\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2204"]}
