{"title": "Formal hardware verification methods: A survey\n", "abstract": " Growing advances in VLSI technology have led to an increased level of complexity in current hardware systems. Late detection of design errors typically results in higher costs due to the associated time delay as well as loss of production. Thus it is important that hardware designs be free of errors. Formal verification has become an increasingly important technique towards establishing the correctness of hardware designs. In this article we survey the research that has been done in this area, with an emphasis on more recent trends. We present a classification framework for the various methods, based on the forms of the specification, the implementation, and the proff method. This framework enables us to better highlight the relationships and interactions between seemingly different approaches.", "num_citations": "377\n", "authors": ["261"]}

It then combines the formula with constraints that describe the intended property. If the combined formula is satisfiable, there exists a stable state of the network in which the property does not hold. Otherwise, no stable state (if any) violates the property.

{"title": "Lazy self-composition for security verification\n", "abstract": " The secure information flow problem, which checks whether low-security outputs of a program are influenced by high-security inputs, has many applications in verifying security properties in programs. In this paper we present lazy self-composition, an approach for verifying secure information flow. It is based on self-composition, where two copies of a program are created on which a safety property is checked. However, rather than an eager duplication of the given program, it uses duplication lazily to reduce the cost of verification. This lazy self-composition is guided by an interplay between symbolic taint analysis on an abstract (single copy) model and safety verification on a refined (two copy) model. We propose two verification methods based on lazy self-composition. The first is a CEGAR-style procedure, where the abstract model associated with taint analysis is refined, on demand, by using a model\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["261"]}

Accelerators are controlled by software/firmware and functionality is implemented by this combination of programmable cores, firmware, and accelerators. Verification of such SoCs is challenging, especially for system-level properties maintained by a combination of firmware and hardware. Attempting to formally verify the full SoC design with both firmware and hardware is not scalable, while separate verification can miss bugs. A general technique for scalable system-level verification is to construct an abstraction of SoC hardware and verify firmware/software using it. There are two challenges in applying this technique in practice. Constructing the abstraction to capture required details and interactions is error-prone and time-consuming.

{"title": "Fast architecture-level synthesis of fault-tolerant flow-based microfluidic biochips\n", "abstract": " Microfluidic-based lab-on-a-chips have emerged as a popular technology for implementation of different biochemical test protocols used in medical diagnostics. However, in the manufacturing process or during operation of such chips, some faults may occur that leads to damage of the chip, which in turn results in wastage of expensive reagent fluids. In order to make the chip fault-tolerant, the state-of-the-art technique adopts simulated annealing (SA) based approach to synthesize a fault-tolerant architecture. However, the SA method is time consuming and non-deterministic with over-simplified model that usually derive sub-optimal results. Thus, we propose a progressive optimization procedure for the synthesis of fault-tolerant flow-based microfluidic biochips. Simulation results demonstrate that proposed method is efficient compared to the state-of-the-art techniques and can provide effective solutions in 88% (on\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["261"]}

This thesis presents a methodology for formal verification of inductively-defined hardware, based on automatic symbolic manipulation of classes of inductive Boolean functions IBFs. It combines reasoning by induction and symbolic tautology-checking in a way that incorporates the advantages of both, where the key idea is that by building an inductive argument into the IBF representations, explicit proofs by induction can be avoided. The methodology consists of identifying classes of inductive Boolean functions that are useful for representation of hardware and specifications, associating a schema with each class consisting of a canonical representation and symbolic manipulation algorithms, and appropriately manipulating these representations for performing formal verification.Descriptors:", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["261"]}

{"title": "Dynamic analysis of railway bridges under high speed trains\n", "abstract": " The interest in dynamic behavior of railway bridges has increased in recent years with the introduction of high speed trains. Higher speeds of the trains have resulted in larger and more complicated loads than earlier, producing significant dynamic effects. The dynamic aspects are of special interest and have often shown to be the governing factor in the structural design. Dynamic analysis of railway bridges is, therefore, required for high train speeds. The objective of this paper is to investigate the dynamic behavior of an existing railway bridge subjected to high speed trains. A railway bridge model has been developed to study dynamic effects such as oscillations produced by moving loads of constant magnitude and to obtain a relation between the velocity, acceleration, load position and deflection of the bridge at any instant of loading, with and without damping, with the help of MATLAB software. The simulation results indicate that the speed of the vehicle is a very important parameter influencing the dynamic response of a railway bridge. The amplitude of bridge deflection has been found to be the highest at speeds between 75 and 85 m/s. Further, the introduction of damping has been found to greatly influence of the amplitude of bridge deflection response. However, the peak deflection values appear at the same speed independent of the damping coefficients.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["261"]}

The exploration of the predictive model to check alternate interleavings of events in the execution was performed explicitly, based on stateless model checking using dynamic partial order reduction (DPOR). Although this was effective on some benchmarks, the explicit enumeration was too expensive on other examples. This motivated us to examine alternatives based on symbolic exploration using SMT solvers. In this paper, we propose an SMT-based encoding for detecting serializability violations in our predictive model.

{"title": "Using complete-1-distinguishability for FSM equivalence checking\n", "abstract": " This article introduces the notion of a Complete-1-Distinguishability (C-1-D) property for simplifying equivalence checking of finite state machines (FSMs). When a specification machine has the C-1-D property, the traversal of the product machine can be eliminated. Instead, a much simpler check suffices. The check consists of first obtaining a 1-equivalence mapping between the individually reachable states of the specification and the implementation machines, and then checking that it is a bisimulation relation. The C-1-D property can be used directly for specification machines on which it naturally holds---a condition that has not been exploited thus far in FSM verification. We also show how this property can be enforced on an arbitrary FSM by exposing some of its latch outputs as pseudo-primary outputs during synthesis and verification.

The present study was carried out with aim to find correlations between incidence of dengue fever and environmental factors from 2011 to 2016 in Delhi. No linear correlation was observed between rainfall and dengue cases, however the peaks of rain fall and the dengue cases had some lag period difference of about two months. When this lag period is adjusted the high positive correlation (r= 0.9868) was seen that both peaks perfectly matched which suggest the cases are related to rainfalls in spite of indoor breeding of mosquitoes. High correlation was observed between average rain fall with average cases (97%; r= 0.986) The study shows a clear dependency of dengue cases with climatic factors and further revealed that there is a lag phase between rains and appearance of cases which provides an opportunity to programme managers to carry out vector control measures along with source reduction.

Most of the biologically active constituents of plants are polar or water soluble molecules. However, water soluble phyto-constituents (like flavonoids, tannins, terpenoids, etc.) are poorly absorbed either due to their large molecular size which cannot absorb by passive diffusion, or due to their poor lipid solubility; severely limiting their ability to pass across the lipid-rich biological membranes, resulting poor bioavailability. These types of drugs are then classified into biopharmaceutical classification system classes: high solubility/low permeability (Class III). It has been observed that complexation with certain other clinically useful nutrients substantially improves the bioavailability of such extracts and their individual constituents. The nutrients so helpful for enhancing the absorption are the phospholipids. Phytosome is a patented technology developed by a leading manufacturer of drugs and nutraceuticals, to incorporate standardized plant extracts or water soluble phyto-constituents into phospholipids to produce lipid compatible molecular complexes, called as phytosomes and so vastly improve their absorption and bioavailability.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["261"]}

PCA is a statistical approach used for reducing the number of variables in face recognition. While extracting the most relevant information (feature) contained in the images (face). In PCA, every image in the training set can be represented as a linear combination of weighted eigenvectors called as \u201cEigenfaces\u201d. These eigenvectors are obtained from covariance matrix of a training image set called as basis function. The weights are found out after selecting a set of most relevant Eigenfaces. Recognition is performed by projecting a new image (test image) onto the subspace spanned by the eigenfaces and then classification is done by distance measure methods such as Euclidean distance. A number of experiments were done to evaluate the performance of the face recognition system.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["261"]}

Instead, we first create independent models for the different threads, and add inter-model constraints lazily, incrementally, and on-the-fly during BMC unrolling to capture the sequential consistency and synchronization semantics.

{"title": "Symmetry reduction in SAT-based model checking\n", "abstract": " The major challenge facing model checking is the state explosion problem. One technique to alleviate this is to apply symmetry reduction; this exploits the fact that many sequential systems consist of interchangeable components, and thus it may suffice to search a reduced version of the symmetric state space. Symmetry reduction has been shown to be an effective technique in both explicit and symbolic model checking with Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs). In recent years, SAT-based model checking has been shown to be a promising alternative to BDD-based model checking. In this paper, we describe a symmetry reduction algorithm for SAT-based unbounded model checking (UMC) using circuit cofactoring. Our method differs from the previous efforts in using symmetry mainly in that we do not require converting any set of states to its representative or orbit set of states except for the set of initial states\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["261"]}

Automating support is the task of automatically providing answers to these problems given a corpus of solution documents. Traditional approaches to this task rely on information retrieval and are keyword based; looking for keyword overlap between the question and solution documents and ignoring these attributes. We present an approach for semantic parsing of technical questions that uses grammatical structure to extract these attributes as a baseline, and a CRF based model that can improve performance considerably in the presence of annotated data for training.

A multi-threaded program is said to be deterministic if for a given input, different thread interleavings result in the same system state in the execution of the program.

A deterministic program is race-free but the converse may not be true. There is much work done in the static analysis of programs to detect races and nondeterminism.

The analgesic investigations were carried out against two types of noxious stimuli, chemical (formalin-induced pain and acetic acid-induced writhing) and thermal (hotplate and tail immersion tests). The effects of standard drugs, aspirin and naloxone pretreatments were also studied. For antiinflammatory activities, the carrageenan-induced oedema of the hind paw of rats was used and the paw volume measured plethysmometrically 3h after injection. This was compared to a standard drug aspirin (300 mg/kg). The results were subjected to statistical analysis. The crude plant extract significantly increased the reaction time of hotplate and immersion tests. It decreased the writhings of acetic acid-induced abdominal contractions and lickings of formalin-induced pain. Aspirin had no effect on hotplate and tail immersion tests but showed an effect on writhing test. These results showed that the plant had both central and peripheral acting effects and this was confirmed by its effect on both phases of formalin-induced pain. The extract also significantly decreased the rat paw oedema volume at 200 mg/kg and above.

{"title": "Another dimension to high level synthesis: Verification\n", "abstract": " To cope with the increasing design complexity and size, significant efforts are being made in high level synthesis methodologies, design languages and verification methodologies to leverage the expressive power of high-level models and reduce the design cycle time and cost. High level synthesis is a process of generating a concrete structure to the high level design meeting, three main design constraints: area, timing and power [1-4]. Verification, on the other hand, ensures that the design meets the specification. As of today, verification efforts take about 70% of design cycle. At structural level, the formal verification techniques are quite matured and advanced compared to those at the high level. Part of the reason is due to a general skepticism among designers in regards to the verification efforts made on the abstract model of the design instead on the structured design which is closer to the design on chip. To leverage off recent advancements made in Boolean SAT-based verification techniques [5] and to reduce the skepticism among the designers, we believe that HLS methodologies should also focus on another dimension, ie, functional verification. Though this dimension is not part of standard design constraints, but it can help to substantially reduce the verification effort. HLS, in general, does not necessarily synthesize models that are verification \u201cfriendly\u201d. On at least the following three counts, we find that verification tools perform poorly on the models synthesized by HLS.\u2022 Area optimization: Given limited hardware resources in a typical HLS problem, the structural level design synthesized will have a large number of multiplexers as\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["261"]}

In this chapter, we consider a verification language to be a language with a formal syntax, which supports expression of verification-related tasks. It is very useful for a verification language to have a precise unambiguous semantics. However, we also consider languages where ambiguity in semantics is resolved by accepted practices. Broadly speaking, we focus on the support a verification language provides for dynamic verification based on simulation, as well as static verification based on formal techniques.

Non-edible oils over edible oil hold the potential to act as sustainable sources for the production of bio-diesel. Removal of oil left behind a major part of the seed material as seed cake. The latter is generally regarded as waste because of its anti-nutritional content. In the present study, two de-oiled seed cakes, Madhuca indica (mahua) and Jatropha curcus (jatropha) were used for the growth of Paecilomyces variofii, to produce proteases and cellulases, respectively. These enzymes are already known to have considerable industrial importance. At an initial moisture content of 50% and temperature 30 C, maximum protease activity of 52.5 U/g and cellulase activity 27.3 U/g was recorded from A. nigerand P. variofii respectively. HPLC studies showed 67.9-71.5% degradation of saponins, the major anti-nutritional factors present in mahua cake. This study proved beneficial for management of oil seed cakes via solid state fermentation, producing enzymes as value added products.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["261"]}

In construction, these production strategies have been an emerging issue among lean construction researchers and practitioners alike. However, there is still room to better understand the relationship between performance and buffers in construction, in order to develop suitable buffer management approaches in projects. In this exploratory research, the relationship between productivity and buffer levels in repetitive projects is investigated by using Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) modelling. Also, a specific kind of inventory buffer is studied: work-in-process (WIP). A number of simulation scenarios with varying production parameters such as production amount, production rate, variability levels and initial WIP buffer size were tested. Results show that even though WIP buffer may not contribute to improving productivity rates, but they provide very good protection to productivity levels in case of variability conditions in projects. This effect makes WIP buffer suitable for use in large scale repetitive projects where a small disruption in production can lead to heavy losses. Also mathematical relationships between productivity and WIP buffer were analyzed, finding some good nonlinear relationships able to explain to a certain extent the impact of the WIP buffers sizes on productivity.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["261"]}

Thephotostationary-state cis/trans ratio depends on the triplet energy of the sensitizer and the pH of the medium. All sensitizers studied show a pH effect on the cis/trans ratio which varies from 2.8 to 1.2 and is independent of whether the sensitizer is negatively or positively charged. Parallel quenching studies show themajor part of this stems from a pH effect on the relative rates of energy transfer from the sensitizer to cis and trans acids. A smaller pH effect, in the opposite direction, is found with the relative rates of decay of the triplet to ground-state cis and trans isomers.

This model can help identify specific commonly-occurring interaction patterns between the HW and FW. These patterns enable pruning the verification search space as demonstrated in previous work in automating FW test generation using concolic testing. In this work, we introduce a bounded model checking (BMC)-based methodology for FW verification.

A membrane composed of 40% Schiff's base and 60% epoxy resin exhibited the best performance. The membrane showed excellent response in the concentration range of 0.15 ppm to 0.1 mol L- 1 Ni+2 ions with non-Nernstian slope of 22.0 mV/decade, had a rapid response time (less than 10 s), and can be used for three months without any considerable loss of potential. The sensor was useful within the pH range of 1.3 to 9.6, and was able to discriminate between Ni2+ and a large number of alkaline earth and transition metal ions. The practical utility of the sensor has been demonstrated by using it successfully as an indicator electrode in the potentiometric titration of Ni2+ with EDTA and oxalic acid.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["261"]}

Because of the increasing prices in the market of chemical fertilizers, struvite production is important for the recovery of nutrients. Fertilizer industries also produce Greenhouse gases while struvite, when produced at large scale these emissions from industries, will be minimized because it will reduce the burden of fertilizer industries of producing more quantity of chemical fertilizers. Production of chemical fertilizer required phosphate which is available by extracting phosphate ores resulting in exploitation of this natural resource. The struvite can be produced by chemical or electrochemical processes by using salts of magnesium or by using magnesium plates respectively with urine as a source. This review will help in understanding that why it is essential to produce struvite. The chemistry behind the precipitation of struvite, what essential nutrients it has so that it can be used as an alternative to fertilizers for plant growth, its economic value and with this many environmental problems can be reduced.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["261"]}
{"title": "Learning to learn to communicate\n", "abstract": " How can we teach artificial agents to use human language flexibly to solve problems in a real-world environment? We have one example in nature of agents being able to solve this problem: human babies eventually learn to use human language to solve problems, and they are taught with an adult human-in-the-loop. Unfortunately, current machine learning methods (eg from deep reinforcement learning) are too data inefficient to learn a language in this way (3). An outstanding goal is finding an algorithm with a suitable \u2018language learning prior\u2019that allows it to learn human language, while minimizing the number of required human interactions. In this paper, we propose to learn such a prior in simulation, leveraging the increasing amount of available compute for machine learning experiments (1). We call our approach Learning to Learn to Communicate (L2C). Specifically, in L2C we train a meta-learning agent in simulation to interact with populations of pre-trained agents, each with their own distinct communication protocol. Once the meta-learning agent is able to quickly adapt to each population of agents, it can be deployed in new populations unseen during training, including populations of humans. To show the promise of the L2C framework, we conduct some preliminary experiments in a Lewis signaling game (4), where we show that agents trained with L2C are able to learn a simple form of human language (represented by a hand-coded compositional language) in fewer iterations than randomly initialized agents.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["261"]}

This paper highlights the results of a simulation study aimed at the design of a semi-active floating raft vibration isolation system with the objective of mitigating the acoustic signature of a warship by minimising the transmission of forces, resulting from operation of onboard machinery, to the foundation. A semi-active control scheme with variable damping has been proposed for the floating raft, the variable damping being achieved by means of an electrorheological (ER) damper. A fuzzy logic controller has been designed to achieve the best isolation effect by analysing the characteristics of the frequencies in the excitation signal. The designed semi-active control system is subjected to a time-varying signal, each time-segment corresponding to a different optimal damping ratio. The MATLAB simulation results indicate that the proposed fuzzy logic control method is more effective in vibration isolation than the passive method thereby indicating the potential of the designed semi-active control system in reducing a ship\u2019s acoustic signature.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["261"]}
{"title": "Improved pos tagging for unknown words\n", "abstract": " Process of assigning a part-of-speech to each word in a text according to its definition and context, is known as POS tagging. Basically, it is a process of marking up a specific word class to each word with respect to its position in the sentence. POS tagging is very useful in information retrieval. In this paper, we have considered the problem of tagging the unknown words (words appeared less number of times in the training set) present in our text. The multi domain web based algorithm is used to tag the unknown words but these words once tagged are not saved for the future use. Thus, whenever we come across to similar word again, we have to search for the appropriate domain from the web to tag the word which creates run time overhead. To deal with this limitation of multi domain web based tagger, we have proposed a model where we will be storing all possible domains of unknown words in existing training set. Whenever the same word appears next, the tagger will retrieve its domains from the training set and apply POS tagging rules. This will improve the efficiency of our existing training set and will also improve the time complexity of the algorithm. To reduce the storage requirement we are using IGTree. It is the learning algorithm which forms the tree structure and also helps in reducing the computation cost.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["261"]}

{"title": "Different perceptions and perceptions of difference in globally distributed teams\n", "abstract": " This symposium will offer theoretical reflection and empirical evidence on the importance of perception and differences in globally distributed teams (GDTs). The use of GDTs, especially those dealing with knowledge-intensive tasks, has been constantly gaining relevance in academic and managerial literature due to recent technological advances and worldwide economic changes. When working from a distance, individuals engage in still underexplored processes of perception ofthemselves, others, and common phenomena. Leaders in fact face new challenges that can be interpreted differently in co-located and globally distributed teams. In addition, organizations assign bicultural leaders to GDTs based on somewhat inaccurate perceptions of how these individuals handle their bicultural identities. Likewise, team members try to understand how their distant coworkers may be and feel, and what the team outcomes are. In the symposium, we will specifically address the centrality of the issues of perception and differences in GDTs through thefollowing research questions: What are the challenges for leaders of co-located and globally distributed teams, and how are various types of leaders perceived by team members working in different team arrangements? How do bicultural managers assigned to offshore projects deal with their own bicultural identities, and how do others perceive them? What is the interplay between team members\u2019 different propensity to multitasking and their perception of product modularity in GDTs?

We studied this phenomenon by devising a pressure-flow model of the infant circulation into which was incorporated a model of the Mustard operation. This latter model dealt in particular with pressure coupling across the initially flexible baffle material used to repartition the atria and also with the changes in coupling which occur as the baffle material stiffens. The models were implemented on a hybrid computer system. A reasonable approximation to the unusual waveforms observed clinically was found during simulation experiments. The model has given us new insight into the physiological consequences of the Mustard operation and has yielded a reasonable hypothesis for explaining the clinical observations.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["261"]}

But the testing gauge length for loop strength has not been standardized as in the case of thread tensile strength. In this paper, effect of gauge length on thread tensile strength and elongation in loop form and straight form has been studied. 40 tex and 60 tex mercerized cotton and spun polyester threads are used for the study. It is observed that there is no significant change in the loop strength of the threads as the gauge length increases, whereas the tensile strength of all threads decreases with the increase in gauge length. Elongation % is found to change significantly in both loop and straight form during tensile testing. Therefore, it is concluded that loop strength tests can be carried out at any gauge length unlike tensile testing of straight threads.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["261"]}

When a customer experiences an issue with the functioning of a technical service or a product, an expert user helps guide the customer through a set of steps comprising a troubleshooting procedure. The objective is to identify the source of the problem through a set of diagnostic steps and observations, and arrive at a resolution. Procedures containing these set of diagnostic steps and observations in response to different problems are common artifacts in the body of technical support documentation. The ability to use machine learning and linguistics to understand and leverage these procedures for applications like intelligent chatbots or robotic process automation, is crucial. Existing research on question answering or intelligent chatbots does not look within procedures or deep-understand them. In this paper, we outline a system for mining procedures from technical support documents. We create models for solving important subproblems like extraction of procedures, identifying decision points within procedures, identifying blocks of instructions corresponding to these decision points and mapping instructions within a decision block. We also release a dataset containing our manual annotations on publicly available support documents, to promote further research on the problem.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["261"]}

Consistent with previous reports, corticosteroid induced polycythemia and its consequent hyperviscosity led to intravascular sludging and mesenteric ischemia with associated bowel wall thickening. The localized intestinal induration then served as mechanical foci for intussusception.

{"title": "A review of recent E-learning trends: implementation and cognitive styles\n", "abstract": " E-learning refers to the cognitive process of acquiring knowledge or skill where electronic media and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in education serve as a medium. E-learning does not require any physical accommodation and can be self-paced. This is known as asynchronous learning. It may also be instructor-led and the user needs to attend various sessions which are scheduled by the instructor. This is known as synchronous learning. Due to this flexibility (asynchronous) and interactive collective learning (synchronous) E-learning has evolved tremendously. Studies have proven that E-learning has the capability to provide quality environment for future education. Certain protocols need to be evolvedsuch that they enhance its quality. Although there are many standards out there but they are not widely accepted and followed. Moreover, there are some gaps in the current E-learning procedure. Work is being done to make it more practicable and systematic. While communicating through chats the non-visual cues may sometimes lead to misunderstandings. E-learners are not able to practice their interpersonal skills and develop self-confidence which can be gained through work presentations while addressing a gathering. Physical resources like libraries and research material like labs and field study are not available to students. Thus, learning in some fields like scientific research may not be possible in fully virtual environment as it may lead to loss in quality of learning. This paper focuses on the current E-learning protocols and recent developments and offers some innovative solutions to better its dissemination.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["261"]}

{"title": "An economical biodegradable polymer for novel drug delivery approaches: Gelatin\n", "abstract": " With the advent of newer technologies, in expert opinions, nanobiotechnology is expected to revolutionize or at least significantly improve the pharmaceutical and life science market within the next 15 years. The problem associated with reproducibility prevailed, a need for an economical polymer is experienced by all the researchers so as to repeat and check the reproducibility of systems. To meet all these requirements, Gelatin comes in front as the best alternate. Gelatin (or gelatin, from Latin: gelatus= stiff, frozen) is a translucent, colorless, brittle (when dry), flavorless solid, derived from collagen obtained from various animal by-products. It is commonly used as a gelling agent in food, pharmaceuticals, photography, and cosmetic manufacturing. Substances containing gelatin or functioning in a similar way are called gelatinous. Gelatin is an irreversibly hydrolyzed form of collagen. Gelatin being biodegradable in nature is a polymer of choice for the delivery of various proteins and peptides, can be an efficient and safe vaccine adjuvant, can be used for in vitro delivery of immunogenic CpG oligonucleotides, can be fabricated as nanoparticles and microspheres easily, hence Gelatin can be a very promising polymer for fulfilling the future need of nanobiotechnology.INTRODUCTION: In the development process of a nanoparticulate drug delivery system for in vivo application, biodegradability without toxic byproducts is one of the major claims, a potential matrix molecule has to fulfill. Within the past decades, a multitude of protocols described in literature used synthetic or natural base products for the preparation of biodegradable nanoparticles.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["261"]}

This skin reflection of visceral disease (ie PKDL) is characterized by hypopigmented macules and erythematous eruptions leading to formation of papules and nodules3 in skin without involvement of viscera. The pathology caused by Leishmania parasites in PKDL, is known to be confined to only dermis in the host which raises one of the possibilities for the loss of viscerotropic nature of the parasites. In India, 10% of the patients of kala-azar develop PKDL and now the frequency is declining3. The viscerotropic nature of parasite of PKDL case is poorly understood till date and WHO in its technical report series 949 has recommended that studies are needed to determine the role of PKDL\u2019s reservoir for transmission of kalaazar3.

{"title": "SDSAT: Tight integration of small domain encoding and lazy approaches in solving difference logic\n", "abstract": " Existing difference logic (DL) solvers can be broadly classified as eager or lazy, each with its own merits and de-merits. We propose a novel difference logic solver SDSAT that combines the strengths of both these approaches and provides a robust performance over a wide set of benchmarks. The solver SDSAT works in two phases: allocation and solve. In the allocation phase, it allocates non-uniform adequate ranges for variables appearing in difference predicates. This phase is similar to previous small domain encoding approaches, but uses a novel algorithm Nu-SMOD with 1-2 orders of magnitude improvement in performance and smaller ranges for variables. Furthermore, the difference logic formula is not transformed into an equi-satisfiable Boolean formula in a single step, but rather done lazily in the following phase. In the solve phase, SDSAT uses a lazy refinement approach to search for a satisfying model\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["261"]}

We present a unique case of congenital absence of the long head of biceps tendon in the presence of a Superior labrum anterior posterior (SLAP) variant lesion. Current theories regarding the aetiology of SLAP lesion consider the long head of biceps tendon to either avulse or peel-off the labrum from the glenoid rim.

{"title": "Genetics of FHB resistance in the soft red winter wheat cultivar \u201cFreedom\u201d\n", "abstract": " There is considerable resistance to Fusarium Head Blight in soft red winter wheat (SRWW) adapted to the eastern USA. Little is know of the genetics of this resistance. One source of resistance in SRWW is the moderately resistant cultivar \u201cFreedom\u201d. A mapping study in the cross Freedom x Ning 7840 suggested that Freedom has an allele for FHB resistance on chromosome 2AS, an allele with an effect similar to the well known allele on 3BS from Sumai 3 and Ning 7840. We have initiated studies to confirm this finding. In a study of continual selection for FHB resistance in a RIL population from the cross ZM10782/Freedom//30584-37-2/VA91-54-219, 19 lines were selected for excellent FHB resistance. These lines had an average FHB index of 6.1, vs 20.7 for Freedom. Of the 19 lines, 83% had Freedom marker alleles at the 2AS marker (Xgwm296) originally used to map the Freedom allele for FHB resistance. A similar skewing was noted for 3BS markers from the Chinese line ZM10782. The results indicate that 2AS from Freedom and 3BS from ZM10782 where select for during the phenotypic evaluation and selection. The 3BS marker haplotype of ZM10782 matches that of Ning 7840. We have also investigated the 2AS region in a RIL population from the cross of Freedom x OH546 (moderately susceptible).

In view of this importance, the stored product mites have received worldwide attention of the acarologists. So far as India is concerned, a reasonably good amount of work has been done on diverse aspects from different parts of India, viz., Uttar Pradesh (Girish et al.; 1971, 1973; Lal et al., 1973; Maurya & Jamil, 1981; Maurya et al., 1983), Haryana (Mathur, 1979; Mathur & Minocha, 1981; Mathur & Mathur, 1983; Kumud, 1987; Kumud & Mathur, 1989; Mathur & Minocha, 1989), Punjab (Kapil & Bhanot, 1973); Bihar (Nahar & Gupta, 1980) and South India (Pillai, 1955, 1957; Nangia & ChannaBasavanna, 1989). Unfortunately, very little effort was made so far from West Bengal either to explore the stored grain mite fauna or to study their bio-ecological aspects barring Gupta et ale (1991) who reported some mites. Hence, it was thought desirable to take up study more intensively on stored product mites of West Bengal wsr to granaires from in and around Kolkata during April 1998 to July 2001 and part of the result thereof reporting occurrence of 36 species representing 13 families, 24 genera under 3 orders infesting stored wheat and rice are presented in this paper.

The data have been discussed with respect to the effect of the coenzymes on the quaternary structure symmetry of the two enzymes and their binding isotherms. Both the (homo-tetrameric) apo-enzymes exhibit biphasic kinetics of thermal inactivation, characteristic of C2 symmetry, at lower pH values and a single exponential decay of enzyme activity, characteristic of D2 symmetry, at higher pHs. In each case, NAD+ has no effect on the biphasic kinetic pattern of thermal inactivation at lower pH values, but NADH brings about a change to single exponential decay. At higher pH values, NADH does not affect the kinetic pattern (single exponential decay) of any enzyme, but NAD+ alters it to biphasic kinetics in each case. The data suggest that NAD+ and NADH have higher affinity for the C2 and D2 symmetry conformation, respectively. With mung beans enzyme, the effect of NAD+ on the two rate constants of biphasic inactivation at pH 7.3 is consistent with a Kdiss equal to 110 microM. The NAD (+)-dependent changes in the kinetic pattern of thermal inactivation of this enzyme at pH 8.6 suggest a positive cooperativity in the coenzyme binding (nH= 3.0).

Biochemical parameters-hemoglobin, urea, creatinine, albumin, calcium, phosphorus and PTH assessed post dialysis. All patients underwent 2D echocardiography one hour after dialysis to avoid overestimation of pulmonary artery pressures. Measurement of various parameters was carried out including right atrial and ventricular dimensions, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, flow across tricuspid and pulmonary valves and tissue doppler imaging of the annular plane. PH was defined as mean right ventricular systolic pressure\u2265 25 mmHg. Variables were compared between two groups-subjects with PH and Non-PH.Results: Seventeen patients were detected to have PH. All baseline biochemical parameters did not show significant difference between two groups. On ECHO, right atrial and ventricular enlargement and pulmonary vascular resistance were significantly higher in PH group. LA vol index greater than 34ml/m2 was detected in 94.1% patients with PH as opposed to 51.5% in non PH. LVEDP was detected to be significantly higher in PH compared to Non PH (p= 0.001; 94.1% vs 39.4%). Mean values of ejection fractions were also significantly different.

Another factor of concern to the Indian earth scientists is the continuous seismic activity in the Koyna\u2013Warna region of Maharashtra located near major reservoirs. Continuous seismic activity in the Koyna\u2013Warna region has drawn the attention of many earth scientists in India and abroad especially due to its active nature since 1963. After the first known main earthquake near Koyna on 10 December 1967, the activity continued around 0.1 million earthquakes of low (M< 4) magnitude earthquakes5. A few (190) high-magnitude (M> 4) earthquakes have also been reported from the Koyna\u2013Warna region. Interestingly, these earthquakes occur in a small region of 25\u00d7 10 sq. km.

Latent prints were deposited on chosen absorbent and non-absorbent surfaces and developed using Cyanoacrylate and Ninhydrin to determine pore area reproducibility. Photomicrographs of ridged skin were captured directly by focusing under microscope and pore area reproducibility in these images was studied. Live scans were also included in the study to see if pore area can be relied upon in live scans at 500ppi (pixels per inch). Results revealing best third level detail in inked prints were achieved by deposition onto a variety of non-absorbent substrates but inter-print variation indicated that pore area in inked prints deposited onto paper substrates cannot be used reliably in personal identification. In case of latent prints, variation was greater than normal acceptable limits suggesting that pore area is not reproducible in latent prints developed using Cyanoacrylate and Ninhydrin techniques. Results of direct microscopic images also showed too great inter-image variation which has further supported the unreliability of pore area as a tool in personal identification.

The electric distribution company is responsible to manage the power distribution system safely and efficiently, which deliver electric power from Area feeder to out service drops. In India, the main drawbacks of the distribution system are poor maintenance of the installed facilities, lack of planned network, and lack of monitoring and prevent losses and manual updating of consumer records etc. Today Electric utilities are realizing the benefits of GIS technology in the management of facilities for engineering, construction operations, and maintenance and services purposes. The objective of GIS project is to sign-out suitable site locations at Pune city for transmission line. A transmission line is one of essential infrastructures of the power supply system. In the site evaluation process for those facilities, it is necessary to carefully consider not only technical issues, but also the impact on natural environment, the influence on local communities, and various regulations. However, it is getting difficult to find the preferable site for a transmission line, because of the increasing cost of constructions, the increasing concern on environmental issues and the growing consciousness of land owners. In addition, the number of experienced planners and engineers engaged in the siting process is decreasing with generational changes.

In these species only the primary vein is distinguishable, the secondaries and the further orders of venation being not distinguishable from one another. In the other two species ofTamarix and inMyricaria the major venation pattern is pinnatecamptodromous type. The intercostal venation is of random reticulate type, and the marginal ultimate venation is incomplete. The areoles are polygonal to irregular in outline and randomly oriented. They may contain one or more veinlets or none. There is no direct correlation between the size of an areole and the number of vein endings. Hence, these characters cannot be said to be taxonomically\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["261"]}

Many computational models have been proposed for the development of orientation selectivity.

In this work we propose a model for development of orientation selectivity based on spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP), which till now is considered to be the actual learning mechanism adopted by neural circuits. We could obtain elongated segregated receptive field structure thus giving simple cells the property of orientation selectivity. We also observe that input activity plays a major role in the development of orientation selectivity, too much or too less a correlation between the inputs activities do not result in the formation of segregated ON and OFF regions in the RF structure [1].

{"title": "Beyond games: Bringing exploration to robots in real-world\n", "abstract": " Exploration has been a long standing problem in both model-based and model-free learning methods for sensorimotor control. While there has been major advances over the years, most of these successes have been demonstrated in either video games or simulation environments. This is primarily because the rewards (even the intrinsic ones) are non-differentiable since they are function of the environment (which is a black-box). In this paper, we focus on the policy optimization aspect of the intrinsic reward function. Specifically, by using a local approximation, we formulate intrinsic reward as a differentiable function so as to perform policy optimization using likelihood maximization--much like supervised learning instead of reinforcement learning. This leads to a significantly sample efficient exploration policy. Our experiments clearly show that our approach outperforms both on-policy and off-policy optimization approaches like REINFORCE and DQN respectively. But most importantly, we are able to implement an exploration policy on a robot which learns to interact with objects completely from scratch just using data collected via the differentiable exploration module.

{"title": "High Dose Methotrexate in Oncological Practice: A Review and Update on Recent Trends in Administration and Management of Toxicity\n", "abstract": " In cancer chemotherapy, Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) has been practical only for Methotrexate (MTX) with its main role in high doses (HDMTX) for adjuvant therapy of osteosarcoma, intracranial lymphomas, childhood leukemia and pediatric Non-Hodgkin lymphomas. HDMTX is defined as doses of 3 g/m2 to 15 g/m2 over a period of 6 hr to 24 hr. One has to be very careful while administering HDMTX as it can have renal, haematological, skin and mucosa associated toxicities. Patients with underlying renal diseases, old age and those on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are much more predisposed to methotrexate toxicity. TDM is an effective tool in managing the toxicity profile and guiding the dosage of lecovorin, which is the most effective way of preventing any toxicity of methotrexate. Leucovorin (5-formyltetrahydrofolic acid; LV) replenishes intracellular stores of reduced folate and attenuates the toxicity secondary to HDMTX. This leucovorin has greater uptake in normal cells and less in cancerous cells and thus are selectively protective to normal cells and destroys cancerous cells. There has been lot of studies regarding the dosing and various schedules followed in various protocols.

The gold standard of Hb saturation measurement is by ABG with co-oximetry. Minute-by-minute changes are detected with pulse oximetry (SpO2). SpO2 shows good correlation to ABG co-oximetry in well patients with normal Hb. SCD patients represent a different population: previous small studies have shown discrepancies in calculated ABG and SpO2 Hb saturations. SpO2 may be falsely low due to high carboxyhaemoglobin and metahaemaglobin levels following heme catabolism, or high due to hyperbilirubinaemia. Both occur in acute and chronic haemolysis.

This study was aimed to analyze the cytomorphological features in superficial tuberculous lymphadenitis and to analyze the treatment outcome on the basis of these features.Methods: The present study was carried out in 60 patients of superficial palpable lymph nodes. All cases were subjected to fine needle aspiration of the lymphnodes.Results: Majority of patients were female and below 30 years of age. Cervical lymphnodes were most commonly involved 42 (70%). It was seen that 48 (80%), the lymphnodes had completely resolved. 9 were considered as failures. Cases were divided into 4 groups depending on cytopathological features ie group I-Abscess (15), group II-Caseous necrosis (16), group III-Epitheloid grenuloma with caseation (17) and group IV Epitheloid grenuloma without caseation (12) one patient from group I and one patient from group III defaulted. On follow\u2013up with AKT group IV patients responded best. Cases with group IV cytopatholofical features had no failures (100% cure) while group I, group II, group III had 70%, 72% and 92.3% success rate respectively. Among the necrotizing lesion the best prognosis was seen in grenuloma without caseation.Conclusion: Tuberculous lymphadenitis is more common in females with cervical lymph nodes most commonly involved. Presense of necrosis in lesions had greater chances of nonregression and failures.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["261"]}

{"title": "Study of the role of retinoic acid signaling in colon cancer\n", "abstract": " Stem cells in normal and cancer tissues have been studied using different markers developed over the past few years such as ALDH1, CD34, CD133 and many others. Other approaches to identifying stem cells are based on their nuclear morphology and chromosomal organization. Dr. Gostjeva from MIT proposed that stem cells have bell-shaped nuclei (Gostjeva et al. 2009). Cells having this nuclear morphology are called metakaryotes. They undergo amitotic cell division instead of mitosis. These metakaryotic cells are thought to have stem cell properties (stemness) and have been seen more in fetal tissues and in cancers. Fetal mouse intestine and normal and cancer tissue of colon were used in my project to study metakaryotes. A fetal human colon cell line (FHC) was also studied. Different histologic techniques were used to study the presence of this nuclear morphology. While a few cells with bell shaped nucleus could be identified using the Gostjeva protocol, no metakaryotes were detected with any other approach studied. Immunostaining showed that the stem cell marker ALDH1 is expressed in fetal mouse tissue and in the FHC cell line, but no cells were found in these tissues having bell shaped nuclear morphology. These results suggest that the identification of cells with a bell shaped nucleus is dependent on the histologic method and that Gostjeva protocol may affect nuclear morphology.

This paper investigated deep sea benthic foraminifera from 174 samples taken from the north Pacific Ocean near the Cascadia Margin. The aim of the study was to develop a better understanding of benthic foraminiferal distribution in the methane-rich environment of the Cascadia Margin. Benthic foraminifera are good indicators of paleoproductivity in areas where carbon fluxes are high. Factor and cluster analyses were used to identify 6 biofacies. Ecological data from recent deep sea benthic foraminifera were used to characterize the biofacies. A benthic faunal record was used to determine oxygenation, surface productivity, and organic food supplies. Results of the study indicated that benthic assemblages showed a major shift at 2 to 3 K yrs BP and 6 to 10.5 BP coincided with the increasing amplitude of interstadial cycles, in which methane fluxes may have played a significant role. It was concluded that the dissociation of gas hydrates and the release of methane into the atmosphere may have caused an increase in the population of highly reducing environmental species.. 55 refs., 1 tab., 3 figs.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["261"]}

{"title": "A new strategy for preparation of terephthalic acid by oxidation of p-xylene in aqueous medium\n", "abstract": " Terephthalic acid (TPA) is an important bulk chemical for fibre industry. Commercially, most of TPA is produced by the homogenous liquid-phase oxidation of p-Xylene (pX) with air or O{sub 2} in acetic acid (HAC) in the temperature range of 180-250 C and 25-35 bar in presence of cobalt acetate and manganese acetate catalyst with bromide promoters. In the quest for an ecofriendly, safe and cost effective process to produce TPA a new strategy for the preparation of TPA by oxidation of pX in liquid phase through a two step process is explored. The first step involves the aerobic oxidation of pX in aqueous medium in the presence of Cobalt based homogeneous catalyst. Effects of various reaction parameters like pressure, temperature, catalyst, concentration etc. have been studied. The product composition could be varied with respect to p-toluic acid (p-TA), TPA and 4-carboxy benzaldehyde (4-CBA) by adjusting the operating conditions. Incorporation of co-catalysts like Mn, Ce affects the composition of reaction products. Oxidation of pX at 130 C yielded a product consisting of p-TA 81%, TPA-16%, 4-CBA 3%, at 80% conversion of pX. The reaction product obtained in the first step was further oxidized at 130-150 C in acetic acid medium in the presence of Co based catalyst to give TPA as a major product. Typical product composition ex-oxidation reactor was Terephthalic acid (86%) with p-Toluic acid (12%) and 4-CBA (2%). (orig.)", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["261"]}

In the case of unirradiated YBCO thin film the magnitude of the spectral density of voltage noise, S (f) decreases with the decrease in temperature and shows a noise peak in the transition region which arise due to the flux motion. By introducing columnar defects via swift heavy ion irradiation (250 MeV Ag ions), one can suppers the flux motion in high-Tc superconductors.

In the absence of any ligand, the two enzymes show a striking similarity in the pH-dependence of the kinetics of thermal inactivation. At lower pH values both the enzymes biphasic kinetics with each phase accounting for about half of the starting activity (a C2 symmetry of the homotetrameric enzyme molecule). The kinetics change to a single exponential decay at higher pH values, a D2 symmetry [Malhotra & Srinivasan (1985) Arch. Biochem. Biphys. 236, 775-781; Malhotra & Tikoo (1991) Indian, J. Biochem. Biophys. 28, 16-21]. With each enzyme, phosphate ions are found to have no effect on the kinetic pattern at lower pH, but G-3-P brings about a change from biphasic to a single exponential decay. At higher pH values, G-3-P has no effect on the single exponential decay kinetic pattern, but phosphate ions change the same to a biphasic loss of activity with each phase accounting for about half of the starting activity. It has been concluded that with both the enzymes, G-3-P and phosphate ions have higher affinity and stabilise the D2-and C2-symmetry conformation, respectively.

Text. Res., 3 (1978), 29]. The results of work done on the identification of the sources of seed coat generation and on optimizing processing at blow room and cants in the context of the new understanding about cleaning of cottons in relation to nature of trash are presented. The high seed coat generation in Indian cottons has been attributed to unfavorable genetic and poor ginning conditions. Saw ginning generates more of seed coats than roller ginning. Shorter blow room sequences result in less neps in the yarn, particularly for fine long staple cottons. The nature and extent of cleaning at the tandem cards have been found to be nearly the same as at tile high production cards. Increase in flat speed gives higher cleaning efficiency, but changes in licker-in speed, front plate setting and crush roll pressure have negligible effect'on the cleaning efficiency of the card.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["261"]}

Seeds were treated with X-rays, delivered from a Philips X-ray machine, operated at 50 kv, 2 ma, without filter, at a dose rate of 16 kr per minute at 2 cm. distance. A sample of 500 seeds, arranged in a single layer, was exposed each time and different doses of X-rays were given by regulating the exposure time. Four treatments in diploid toria (48 kr, 64 kr, 96 kr and 128 kr) and two in tetraploid toria (96 kr and 128 kr) were given. Control and treated seeds were sown in pans. Three week old seedlings were transplanted in field rows 1\\'apart, keeping a plant to plant distance of one foot. Second generation (MJ plant progenies were grown in a trial with three replications and one 12'long row per progeny in each replication. Similarly, M3 plant progenies were grown in a replicated trial but only a part of the M2 plants from each treatment was carried forward to M3. In the M2 generation, additional progenies from M, plants were also raised, as single rows per plant. Observations were taken for flower and seed characters.

QT dispersion represents the summation of several adverse conditions in myocardium like fibrosis, hypertrophy, dilatation and autonomic dysfunction.Aim and Objective: To study QT dispersion in diabetics and non-diabetics of age group 30-60 year and compare the two according to age, gender, duration of diabetes, BMI, and other clinical determinants. Material and Methods: 100 diabetics were compared to age and sex matched 50 non diabetics. They were screened for blood sugar and QT dispersion calculated on a 12 lead ECG. Result: QTd was significantly increased in diabetics with p value-0.006. Difference of QTd between cases and controls was insignificant for different age and BMI, among gender and for dyslipidemia or presence of family history of diabetes. A positive correlation was found with longer duration of diabetes and prolonged QTd (p value-0.004).Conclusion: QTd is an indicator for impaired myocardial electrical stability and indicates a non uniform ventricular repolarization. Present study shows presence of hyperglycemia strongly associated with prolonged QTd suggesting increased risk of arrhythmia. QTd was not affected with age, gender, BMI, dyslipidemia or presence of family history of diabetes but longer duration of hyperglycemia and poor control showed prolonged QTd. It concludes QTd as significant prognostic marker for early detection of risk of cardiovascular morbidity and can be used as screening tool to prompt further investigation.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["261"]}
