When EJIS editor Ray Paul (2002, p. 174) described himself as \u2018a pragmatist, in a pragmatic rather than philosophical way\u2019I think he captured well how many IS scholars see themselves. For example, the action research methodology (Baskerville & Myers, 2004) as well as the design science research paradigm (Baskerville, 2008; Winter, 2008), two common IS research approaches, particularly in the European context, are both expressions of pragmatic ideas (Hevner et al., 2004; Lee & Nickerson, 2010).

The perspective has been made concrete through the concept of information systems actability, which is the main concept under scrutiny. The research contributions of the dissertation exist at various levels of abstraction. First of all, the dissertation contributes to the understanding of information systems from a social action perspective. Based on identified weaknesses in contemporary conceptualizations of information systems, the concept of information systems actability is developed. This contribution consists of a reconciliation of various views on information system usage quality with its roots in a linguistic tradition including elements from organizational semiotics and the language/action perspective. At a more concrete level, this understanding, and the concept as such, have consequences for the development and evaluation of information systems. Such consequences have been the foundation for a proposed information systems design method, which thus constitutes a further contribution. Another contribution is the outlining of an information systems evaluation approach based on the concept of information systems actability. As a further means of obtaining empirical experience of working with this concept, a descriptive analytic framework has been developed, which constitutes yet another contribution. These three operationalizations, the design method, the evaluation method and the analytic framework, have been developed and empirically grounded\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "72\n", "authors": ["841"]}

The design, choice, assignment, withdrawal, and replacement of identifiers are significant economic and political issues with more profound consequences than are perhaps commonly perceived. Use of identifiers can result in significant costs because they may include descriptive information, because an inappropriate identifier may be chosen for the object in question, or because there may be a lack of institutional control of the identifier. The objective of this paper is to elaborate on these problems by explaining the identifier construct from a technical, institutional, ontological, and information infrastructural perspective. Based on this understanding, we provide guidelines for how identifiers should be designed, chosen, replaced, and controlled. Accordingly, we address the practical need for improved design principles relating to the increasingly important infrastructural character of computerized information systems that stems from the importance of appropriate identifiers for information infrastructures and society as a whole. In order to understand the role, function, and meaning of identifiers, it is important to acknowledge that the identifier is fundamentally a linguistic construct used when referring to socially constructed institutional objects.

{"title": "Systems Development Method Rationale-A Conceptual Framework for Analysis\n", "abstract": " The rationale of their creators inherently influences information systems development methods. Rationale, which is always based on the creator's values and assumptions about the problem domain, motivates, implicit or explicit, the different modelling activities and primitives prescribed by a method. The method, and hence its inherited rationale, directs method users' attention toward certain kinds of phenomena and away from others. Today we see a trend towards standardizing systems development in terms of standard modelling languages and standard development processes. When using an existing (standard) method, developers are forced to rely on the rationale of that particular method. Sometimes, however, there are reasons to enhance the standard method to reflect aspects of the world held as important by the method users--but not emphasized by the method creator. Hence, there is a need to integrate the rationale of the method users with that of the existing method. In this paper, we investigate what method rationale is and how it can be modelled and analysed. The paper employs a method engineering approach in that it proposes method support for analysing, describing and integrating method rationale--an emerging essential task for method engineers in a world of standardization.", "num_citations": "45\n", "authors": ["841"]}

Specifically, we address how communicative goals are related to the criteria of effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction. We argue that, in order to understand usability, we must consider both instrumental and communicative goals, since their combination constitutes a fundamental part of the social action context\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["841"]}

{"title": "On the Need for Identity in Ontology-Based Conceptual Modelling.\n", "abstract": " Conceptual modelling is often argued to be a core technique in information systems development. An important aspect of conceptual modelling is the ontological and philosophical questions of how to conceive of object existence and identity. Despite significant interest in the topic, formal agreement on how object identity should be represented in modelling languages remains an open question. In the literature, the predominant view is that an object, or entity, is a modelling construct used to represent things. Contrary to this view, we draw on theories of language use and social ontology to understand object identity based on the notion that identity cannot be limited to the identity of physical things. The emphasis is on how language is used to create conceptual entities in a way that maintains fidelity to physical reality and ensures reliable identification of entities across domains. The theoretical implications of this work are primarily the new perspective of conceptual modelling that social ontology affords and the formal introduction and ontological grounding of institutional entities, which have so far been treated rather incidentally. Practical implications include a better foundation for designing and selecting identifiers and classes.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["841"]}

{"title": "The stolen identifier: An inquiry into the nature of identification and the ontological status of information systems\n", "abstract": " Based on real-world examples of identity theft, and particularly a recent incident in Sweden, this paper explores the nature of identification from a social ontology point of view. This is contrasted with the traditional representational view, which is shown unable to handle critical aspects related to institutional control of identifiers and identity. Specifically, the paper shows that identification and the definition and allocation of identifiers is an institutional and political rather than scientific process, and that since \u201cidentity\u201d in itself is a social construct, the process of identification depends on the institutional context in which the objects to identify exist as valid institutional facts. These institutional objects are often originally generated by the use of information systems, which means that genuine real-world institutional objects and their identifiers can be found within these information systems. This implies that the representational view of information systems with a sharp distinction between the real world outside the information system and the system itself (only seen as a model or perceived state of that real world) cannot be maintained.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["841"]}

Through the merger, the Software Engineering (SE) department at Gotland was incorporated in the Department of Informatics and Media within the Faculty of Social Sciences at uppsala University and was assigned the task to develop its two-year undergraduate diploma program in SE into a three-year IS bachelor's program.The new bachelor program at Campus Gotland was planned to start in the autumn of 2016. A market analysis, conducted early 2015, showed that an IS bachelor education was more likely to attract students than the program currently offered. The new program, however, would be designed so that students could still get a higher diploma in software engineering after two years of study, should they so desire. This way the program could be attractive to the old target group as well as to a new group of students interested in a Computer Information Systems (CIS) bachelor\u2013ie a\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["841"]}

A psychological contract reflects the written and unwritten expectations, or obligations, of collaborating parties in a transaction. This paper uncovers a set of candidate obligations that make up the psychological contract of parties collaborating in global software development efforts (the GSD psychological contract). Particular focus is applied to certain development roles: business analyst, designer, developer and development-support. A qualitative research approach is employed against various incidents that occurred in development projects performed by a global software product development organization.

As the guest editors, Ken Peffers, Tuure Tuunanen, and Bjoern Niehaves point out in their introduction (Peffers, Tuunanen, & Niehaves, 2018), design-oriented and constructive approaches have a long history in information systems (IS) research, not the least in Europe (Winter, 2008; \u00c5gerfalk & Wiberg, in press). Since EJIS prides itself on providing a distinctive European perspective for a global audience, it is not surprising that design-oriented research has a special place in our journal.

One such area of use is business, where companies have tried to establish practices and guidelines for company and employee\u201d tweeting\u201d. This paper presents a study on Twitter use by SJ, the national Swedish train operator. The aim of the study is to investigate how SJ (known on Twitter under the handle@ SJ_AB) made use of the platform at hand to communicate with customers during the tumultuous Christmas season of 2010. Specifically, the paper features analysis of an extensive data set containing approximatley 2000 tweets tagged as relevant to the study and archived during the winter of 2010/11 using the TwapperKeeper application. By reporting findings on Twitter use during the height of what is perhaps the busiest holiday season, which also featured severe weather conditions, the paper provides unique insights into the practice of Twitter use in a corporate context. Moreover, by utilizing social network analyses of a large dataset archived utilizing state-of-the-art online applications, the study contributes to the development of scientific methods to handle large-scale online empirics.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["841"]}
{"title": "Information Modeling Based on Semantic and Pragmatic Meaning\n", "abstract": " In traditional modeling approaches, such as entity-relationship modeling, the predominant information modeling problem is how to represent external reality in the system in a true way. In these approaches, semantic aspects of language are in focus. In contrast to this, the main information modeling problem could be to understand how information systems may support a meaningful use of language and information in a social action context. This chapter presents an information modeling approach based on speech act theory that takes both semantic and pragmatic aspects into consideration. With such an approach, it is possible to reconcile traditional information modeling and the pragmatic aspects of language and information use. Such reconciliation is essential to arrive at information systems that support meaningful communication between different actors within a social action context.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["841"]}
{"title": "IT artefacts as socio-pragmatic instruments\u2013towards an integration of the pragmatic, social, semiotic and technical\n", "abstract": " Development and implementation of an information system (IS) is a very demanding task, and many times the expectations from such endeavours are not met. Unexpected negative effects often arise while anticipated positive effects fail to appear. There are many attempts to explain IS failures in general terms. Some of them refer to a socio-technical gap; a gap between what is socially required and what is technically feasible (e.g. Ackerman, 2002). Such explanations tend to make a sharp differentiation between the social and the technical. For example in the socio-technical tradition represented by Mumford & Weir (1979) there are discussions about balancing the technical system and the social system. This is built upon a view that computerized Information systems are technical systems with social and organizational effects and that there exist a \u201cserving system\u201d to support a \u201csystem to be served\u201d (Champion & Stowell, 2002). There are criticisms towards such a conceptualization. For example Nurminen (1988, p 82) writes \u201cby removing the social dimension from the systems entity, we imply that the technical system is basically non-social\u201d. In the same spirit, Goldkuhl & Lyytinen (1982) suggest that the traditional view \u201ctechnical systems with social Implications\u201d should be inverted to \u201csocial systems, only technically implemented\u201d. As pointed out by Mead (1934): \u201cLanguage does not simply symbolize a situation or object which is already there in advance \u2013 it makes possible the existence or appearance of that situation or object, for it is part of the mechanism whereby that situation or object is created.\u201d Instead of a separation into a social realm\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["841"]}

Solutions may be discussed in terms of what to do and what to focus in the design process, not merely in terms of properties of the IT artefact. Besides introducing the concept, the paper proposes a way to structure socio-instrumental design patterns, and an example pattern is included to illustrate the approach. The example is grounded in empirical data from an ongoing action research project with an emphasis on socio-instrumental qualities of IT artefacts in their social context.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["841"]}

The resulting model is then contrasted with results from in-depth interviews with practicing engineers about what they want to achieve. The difference between what the principle advocates and what engineers consider beneficial holds the answer to why the principle of separating business logic from display is not maintained. The results suggest that many espoused benefits of the principle do not appeal to engineers in practice and the principle is tailored to make it more useful in particular contexts.

{"title": "CoDisclose: An Approach to Disclosing Design Rationale\n", "abstract": " In exploratory research, research questions may emerge at a late stage in designoriented research projects. In such case, researchers are faced with the complex task of reconstructing design rationale, ie retrospectively scrutinizing certain aspects of the design process. While such a task may be challenging due to the human and technical complexities in design, we propose an approach to support the disclosing of design rationale. The approach presumes an iterative design process where stakeholders are continually exposed to new releases of software. The approach is comprised of three design science artifacts: A histogram, a workflow, and a software artifact. The histogram is a quantification of both design dialogue and actual changes in the source code. The workflow suggests an iterative process of quantitative and qualitative inquiry. While the approach remains to be rigorously evaluated, we discuss its background and use in an ongoing design project in the eHealth context.

The framework is general in nature and can be used for different specific research questions.The basic principle underlying the framework is that the two primary means of communication in open source software projects, e-mail list submissions and commented source code components, can be regarded as linguistic statements. Such statements form conversations between developers, centred on different topics related to the product developed or the development process as such. These conversations, which are, in general, persistent (ie archived and retrievable) and publicly available, naturally form a solid empirical basis for developing grounded theory.
