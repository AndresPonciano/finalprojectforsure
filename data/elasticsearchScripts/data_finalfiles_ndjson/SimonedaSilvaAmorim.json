{"title": "A data exchange tool based on ontology for emergency response systems\n", "abstract": " Considering the potential of Emergency Response Systems (ERS) in combination with crowd-based information, this article presents a data integration solution within the scope of the RESCUER project: an ontology based data exchange solution to allow semantic interoperability between ERS of Command and Control Centers, referred to as Legacy Systems, and RESCUER. The solution is implemented by the Data Integration with Legacy Systems (DILS) component which can be used for the exchange of incident information by any ERS. As a result, we evaluated simulated emergency cases by sending RESCUER emergency reports to another ERS with the DILS.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["769"]}
