We assume that software development proceeds as a series of changes and model the probability that a change to software will cause a failure. We use predictors based on the properties of a change itself. Such predictors include size in lines of code added, deleted, and unmodified; diffusion of the change and its component subchanges, as reflected in the number of files, modules, and subsystems touched, or changed; several measures of developer experience; and the type of change and its subchanges (fault fixes or new code). The model is built on historic information and is used to predict the risk of new changes. In this paper we apply the model to 5ESS\u252c\u00ab software updates and find that change diffusion and developer experience are essential to predicting failures.

{"title": "Linguistically-informed self-attention for semantic role labeling\n", "abstract": " Current state-of-the-art semantic role labeling (SRL) uses a deep neural network with no explicit linguistic features. However, prior work has shown that gold syntax trees can dramatically improve SRL decoding, suggesting the possibility of increased accuracy from explicit modeling of syntax. In this work, we present linguistically-informed self-attention (LISA): a neural network model that combines multi-head self-attention with multi-task learning across dependency parsing, part-of-speech tagging, predicate detection and SRL. Unlike previous models which require significant pre-processing to prepare linguistic features, LISA can incorporate syntax using merely raw tokens as input, encoding the sequence only once to simultaneously perform parsing, predicate detection and role labeling for all predicates. Syntax is incorporated by training one attention head to attend to syntactic parents for each token. Moreover, if a high-quality syntactic parse is already available, it can be beneficially injected at test time without re-training our SRL model. In experiments on CoNLL-2005 SRL, LISA achieves new state-of-the-art performance for a model using predicted predicates and standard word embeddings, attaining 2.5 F1 absolute higher than the previous state-of-the-art on newswire and more than 3.5 F1 on out-of-domain data, nearly 10% reduction in error. On ConLL-2012 English SRL we also show an improvement of more than 2.5 F1.

We further demonstrate that the effect of CK on leaf complexity depends on proper localization of auxin signaling. Genetic analysis showed that reduction of CK levels suppresses the effect of Knotted1 like homeobox (KNOXI) proteins on leaf shape and that CK can substitute for KNOXI activity at the leaf margin, suggesting that CK mediates the activity of KNOXI proteins in the regulation of leaf shape.

To this end, we introduce a dataset of 7,413 airplanes annotated in detail with parts and their attributes, leveraging images donated by airplane spotters and crowdsourcing both the design and collection of the detailed annotations. We provide a number of insights that should help researchers interested in designing fine-grained datasets for other basic level categories. We show that the collected data can be used to study the relation between part detection and attribute prediction by diagnosing the performance of classifiers that pool information from different parts of an object. We note that the prediction of certain attributes can benefit substantially from accurate part detection. We also show that, differently from previous results in object detection, employing a large number of part templates can improve detection accuracy at the expenses of detection speed.

The construct of intelligence is without doubt the most thoroughly investigated trait in personality and psychometric research over the past century. Since Binet and Simon (1905) and Spearman (1904) published their now-classic works, intelligence research has yielded an enormous, sophisticated, and diverse spectrum of performance test batteries, most covering a broad and heterogeneous set of tasks that allow for a fine-tuned and precise assessment of individual differences in intelligence. In this research tradition, there is a long and still-open debate as to whether a general factor underlies all cognitive abilities, or whether the individual's general intellectual ability can be better represented by the set of several more or less correlated specific sub-factors of intelligence1.Survey researchers have generally\u252c\u2592and prematurely\u252c\u2592assumed that there is no good way of using cognitive performance tasks to provide valid estimation of individual differences in intellectual ability. Such reasoning is based on two considerations.

Second, large-scale surveys often suffer from enormous economic constraints that require time-efficient and ultra-short assessments of any construct or trait of interest.

It controls the increase of flavonoid enzyme levels and their corresponding mRNAs. We have used an in vitro culture system for corollas to study the regulatory role of GA3 in the expression of flavonoid genes. By determining steady-state mRNA levels, we show that the accumulation of chalcone synthase (chs) mRNA in young corollas is dependent on the presence of both sucrose and GA3 in the culture medium. Whereas sucrose had a general metabolic effect on gene expression, the stimulatory role of GA3 was specific. Analysis of nascent transcripts in isolated corolla nuclei showed that changes in steady-state chs mRNA levels correlated very well with changes in the transcription rate.

This problem is compounded by the absence of new antibiotics close to regulatory approval. Acinetobacter baumannii is a human pathogen that causes infections primarily in patients in intensive care units (ICUs) and is highly antibiotic resistant. Colistin is one of the last-line antibiotics for treating A. baumannii infections; however, colistin-resistant strains are becoming increasingly common. This cationic antibiotic attacks negatively charged bacterial membranes in a manner similar to that seen with cationic antimicrobials of the innate immune system. We therefore set out to determine if the increasing use of colistin, and emergence of colistin-resistant strains, is concomitant with the generation of cross-resistance to host cationic antimicrobials.

{"title": "CRISPR-Cas systems: new players in gene regulation and bacterial physiology\n", "abstract": " CRISPR-Cas systems are bacterial defenses against foreign nucleic acids derived from bacteriophages, plasmids or other sources. These systems are targeted in an RNA-dependent, sequence-specific manner, and are also adaptive, providing protection against previously encountered foreign elements. In addition to their canonical function in defense against foreign nucleic acid, their roles in various aspects of bacterial physiology are now being uncovered. We recently revealed a role for a Cas9-based Type II CRISPR-Cas system in the control of endogenous gene expression, a novel form of prokaryotic gene regulation. Cas9 functions in association with two small RNAs to target and alter the stability of an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial lipoprotein (BLP). Since BLPs are recognized by the host innate immune protein Toll-like Receptor 2 (TLR2), CRISPR-Cas-mediated repression of BLP expression facilitates evasion of TLR2 by the intracellular bacterial pathogen Francisella novicida, and is essential for its virulence. Here we describe the Cas9 regulatory system in detail, as well as data on its role in controlling virulence traits of Neisseria meningitidis and Campylobacter jejuni. We also discuss potential roles of CRISPR-Cas systems in the response to envelope stress and other aspects of bacterial physiology. Since ~45% of bacteria and ~83% of Archaea encode these machineries, the newly appreciated regulatory functions of CRISPR-Cas systems are likely to play broad roles in controlling the pathogenesis and physiology of diverse prokaryotes.", "num_citations": "66\n", "authors": ["29"]}

{"title": "Sidestepping intractable inference with structured ensemble cascades\n", "abstract": " For many structured prediction problems, complex models often require adopting approximate inference techniques such as variational methods or sampling, which generally provide no satisfactory accuracy guarantees. In this work, we propose sidestepping intractable inference altogether by learning ensembles of tractable sub-models as part of a structured prediction cascade. We focus in particular on problems with high-treewidth and large state-spaces, which occur in many computer vision tasks. Unlike other variational methods, our ensembles do not enforce agreement between sub-models, but filter the space of possible outputs by simply adding and thresholding the max-marginals of each constituent model. Our framework jointly estimates parameters for all models in the ensemble for each level of the cascade by minimizing a novel, convex loss function, yet requires only a linear increase in computation over learning or inference in a single tractable sub-model. We provide a generalization bound on the filtering loss of the ensemble as a theoretical justification of our approach, and we evaluate our method on both synthetic data and the task of estimating articulated human pose from challenging videos. We find that our approach significantly outperforms loopy belief propagation on the synthetic data and a state-of-the-art model on the pose estimation/tracking problem.", "num_citations": "61\n", "authors": ["29"]}

To further elucidate the roles of these virulence determinants in Francisella pathogenesis, we tested whether each gene was required for replication of the model pathogen F. novicida within macrophages, an important virulence trait. Fifty-three of the 224 genes tested were involved in intracellular replication, including many of those within the Francisella pathogenicity island (FPI), validating our results. Interestingly, over one third of the genes identified are annotated as hypothetical, indicating that F. novicida likely utilizes novel virulence factors for intracellular replication.

The duration, intensity, and spectrum of the light reaction suggest that phytochrome-mediated high-irradiance reactions are involved in the regulation of corolla development. Using the photosynthesis inhibitor 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea, we showed that photosynthesis does not significantly contribute to the leaf-mediated light responses.

The induction leads to production of specialized metabolites that protect the cells from oxidative damage. The regulation of the diverse AAA derived pathways is still not well understood. To gain insight on that regulation, we increased AAA production in red grape Vitis vinifera cv. Gamay Red cell suspension, without inducing external stress on the cells, and characterized the metabolic effect of this induction. Increased AAA production was achieved by expressing a feedback-insensitive bacterial form of 3-deoxy- D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase enzyme (AroG*) of the shikimate pathway under a constitutive promoter. The presence of AroG* protein led to elevated levels of primary metabolites in the shikimate and AAA pathways including phenylalanine and tyrosine, and to a dramatic increase in phenylpropanoids. The AroG* transformed lines accumulated up to 20 and 150 fold higher levels of resveratrol and dihydroquercetin, respectively. Quercetin, formed from dihydroquercetin, and resveratrol, are health promoting metabolites that are induced due to environmental stresses. Testing the expression level of key genes along the stilbenoids, benzenoids and phenylpropanoid pathways showed that transcription was not affected by AroG*.

These systems consist of a CRISPR array (crRNA array; composed of unique spacer sequences flanked by short repeats) and adjacently encoded Cas proteins [1]. Following transcription, the crRNA array is processed into individual CRISPR RNAs (crRNA) containing a spacer and a partial repeat [2]. The spacers hybridize to complementary nucleic acid targets, triggering their degradation by Cas proteins [1]. In addition, the Cas proteins Cas1 (a dsDNA endonuclease) and Cas2 (a dsDNA and/or ssRNA endonuclease) function to integrate new spacer sequences into the crRNA array, an adaptation phase that allows bacteria to subsequently target foreign genetic elements containing these sequences [3, 4]. There are three main types of CRISPR/Cas systems. All contain Cas1 and Cas2, but are distinguished by specific Cas proteins involved in crRNA maturation, nucleic acid targeting, and cleavage [1]. Specifically, the Type II CRISPR/Cas systems are associated with pathogenic bacteria including Neisseria meningitidis, Campylobacter jejuni, and Streptococcus pyogenes [1, 5]. These systems require a trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA) and an endogenous RNase (RNase III) for maturation of crRNAs, as well as two endonuclease domains within Cas9 for cleavage of each strand of the targeted DNA [2, 6, 7].

{"title": "Learning adaptive value of information for structured prediction\n", "abstract": " Discriminative methods for learning structured models have enabled wide-spread use of very rich feature representations. However, the computational cost of feature extraction is prohibitive for large-scale or time-sensitive applications, often dominating the cost of inference in the models. Significant efforts have been devoted to sparsity-based model selection to decrease this cost. Such feature selection methods control computation statically and miss the opportunity to finetune feature extraction to each input at run-time. We address the key challenge of learning to control fine-grained feature extraction adaptively, exploiting nonhomogeneity of the data. We propose an architecture that uses a rich feedback loop between extraction and prediction. The run-time control policy is learned using efficient value-function approximation, which adaptively determines the value of information of features at the level of individual variables for each input.

However, the flowers produced at high temperatures were approximately half the size of the latter at anthesis, owing to differences in both fresh and dry weights. Corolla pigmentation was enhanced at the lower growth temperatures, owing to higher anthocyanin content. Northern analyses revealed that both growth and pigmentation are regulated by temperature at the molecular level. In contrast to its beneficial effect on size and pigmentation, growth at lower temperatures resulted in a shorter vase life for the cut flowers, which was associated with enhanced ethylene production. Cut petunia flowers were treated with aminooxyacetic acid, silver thiosulfate or 1-aminocyclopropane\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "32\n", "authors": ["29"]}

{"title": "Dynamic structured model selection\n", "abstract": " In many cases, the predictive power of structured models for for complex vision tasks is limited by a trade-off between the expressiveness and the computational tractability of the model. However, choosing this trade-off statically a priori is suboptimal, as images and videos in different settings vary tremendously in complexity. On the other hand, choosing the trade-off dynamically requires knowledge about the accuracy of different structured models on any given example. In this work, we propose a novel two-tier architecture that provides dynamic speed/accuracy trade-offs through a simple type of introspection. Our approach, which we call dynamic structured model selection (DMS), leverages typically intractable features in structured learning problems in order to automatically determine'which of several models should be used at test-time in order to maximize accuracy under a fixed budgetary constraint.

In the preferred embodiment, the terminals are arranged in a star configuration and the hub is an Ethernet hub that forwards a data packet from a terminal to all of the remaining terminals. A data packet is stored in memory while it is transmitted to all of the other terminals in the collision domain. If a collision is detected in forwarding the data packet, the transmission is completed to the collision-free terminals, thereby isolating subsequent forwarding of the data packet to the one or more collision-inducing terminals. When a no-carrier condition is sensed, the data packet is retransmitted to the one or more collision-inducing terminals. Preferably, a back-off scheme provides priority to the hub-to-terminal transmissions over the terminal-to-hub\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["29"]}

This study aimed to characterize the innate and adaptive responses induced by two different lots of a live attenuated tularemia vaccine and compare them to other well-characterized viral vaccine immune responses. Methods: Microarray analyses were performed on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to determine changes in transcriptional activity that correlated with changes detected by cellular phenotyping, cytokine signaling, and serological assays. Transcriptional profiles after tularemia vaccination were compared with yellow fever [YF-17D], inactivated [TIV], and live attenuated [LAIV] influenza. Results: Tularemia vaccine lots produced strong innate immune responses by Day 2 after vaccination, with an increase in monocytes, NK cells, and cytokine signaling. T cell responses peaked at Day 14. Changes in gene expression, including upregulation of STAT1, GBP1, and IFIT2, predicted tularemia-specific antibody responses. Changes in CCL20 expression positively correlated with peak CD8+ T cell responses, but negatively correlated with peak CD4+ T cell activation. Tularemia vaccines elicited gene expression signatures similar to other replicating vaccines, inducing early upregulation of interferon-inducible genes. Conclusions: A systems vaccinology approach identified that tularemia vaccines induce a strong innate immune response early after vaccination, similar to the response seen after well-studied viral vaccines, and produce unique transcriptional signatures that are strongly correlated to the induction of T cell\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["29"]}

We found that long-day (LD) conditions slightly promote flowering but artificial photoperiodic illumination does not enable the manipulation of flowering time. On the other hand, treatment with the gibberellin (GA)-biosynthesis inhibitor, Uniconazol, had a dramatic promotive effect on flowering time. Application of Uniconazol in autumn or winter induced flowering in winter or early spring, respectively.

{"title": "Risky income, risky families: Marriage and divorce in a volatile labor market\n", "abstract": " There has been a striking increase in American idiosyncratic labor income volatility since 1970, with little attention paid to the effects on families. The formation and dissolution of the typical American family has changed substantially, however, with a notable decline/delay of marriage and, since 1980, declining divorce rates. Furthermore, the elderly are divorcing more. This paper demonstrates a quantitatively important link between income volatility and the changing family. Marriage typically involves children, a large, persistent cost, which causes people to dislike risk; volatility therefore causes less marriage. This effect dominates the increased insurance value of marriage that arises because shocks to income are imperfectly correlated between spouses. Once a couples has married, however, the rising insurance value of marriage also leads to a decline in divorce. On the other hand, the elderly are either retired or near retirement and have grown children, and thus are less susceptible to the effects of volatility. Elderly divorce rises as younger people delay divorce. The model qualitatively matches observed family changes over time, and quantitatively accounts for up to a third of the data.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["29"]}

The recent development of an aluminum-cerium (Al-Ce) alloy targeted toward broad market adoption in the automotive industry is one recent example. This alloy has shown exceptional mechanical properties and cost-saving potential. However, since market adoption is unknown, impacts of this alloy on Ce demand remains uncertain. We estimate Al-Ce impacts by simulating adoption in different automotive sectors using a dynamic material flow analysis model. We then project future Ce content in the recycled Al stream given current recycling practices. We also compute the required segregation given different Ce impurity tolerances of existing automotive Al alloys. Finally, once secondary supply is derived from segregation, we calculate primary Ce demand. Results showed that\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["29"]}

The younger florets in the inflorescence are able to complete their development indoors in the vase, but usually with significantly reduced color. In many cases the open florets remain almost colorless when the cut flowers are placed in the vase. These observations suggest that pigment biosynthesis in petals is controlled by light intensity. The aim of this study was to explore the significance of low light intensity, typical for interior conditions, to the observed reduction in anthocyanin levels and its consequence to the expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes in petals of lisianthus (Eustoma grandiflorum) flowers.

One approach to meeting this pressure is to organize software into families, and to invest in facilities that enable rapid production of family members. We are using a systematic process to define families, design languages for specifying members of families, and quickly develop tools for such languages. The process is known as family-oriented abstraction, specification, and translation (FAST).We have applied FAST to the task of specifying the commands and reports used by technicians to monitor the operation of a telecommunications switch. Such commands, their associated reports, and the accompanying customer documentation form a software family. A key part of the specification for a command or report is the customer documentation for using the command or understanding the report. Our specification language makes the specification of the customer documentation an integral part of the command and report specification. This approach promotes consistency between the software and the customer documentation, makes it easier for developers to write consistent and complete documentation, and allows us to generate the customer documentation from the specification.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["29"]}

Design, Mediation, and the Posthuman bears witness to the attention paid by literary theorists, digital humanists, rhetoricians, philosophers, and designers to the crafted environment, the manner in which artifacts mediate human relations, and the constitution of a world in which the boundary between humans and things has seemingly imploded. The chapters reflect on questions about the extent to which we ought to view humans and nonhuman artifacts as having equal capacity for agency and life, and the ways in which technological mediation challenges the central tenets of humanism and anthropocentrism. Contemporary theories of human-object relations presage the arrival of the posthuman, which is no longer a futuristic or science-fictional concept but rather one descriptive of the present, and indeed, the past. Discussions of the posthuman already have a long history in fields like literary theory, rhetoric, and philosophy, and as advances in design and technology result in increasingly engaging artifacts that mediate more and more aspects of everyday life, it becomes necessary to engage in a systematic, interdisciplinary, critical examination of the intersection of the domains of design, technological mediation, and the posthuman.

{"title": "Advances in the Sand Casting of Aluminium Alloys\n", "abstract": " The sand casting process is one of the oldest casting methods and has been used for aluminium alloys since they became popular at the turn of the 20th century. This process uses binder systems to hold together mineral or artificial aggregates so that metals can be poured into moulds produced from these materials. The mould is then removed and not reused. Advancements in the technology have concentrated on development of superior binder systems, new pouring technologies, and gating systems that more effectively deliver metal to the mould-free of oxides and other contaminants. The use of additively printed moulds and cores for sand casting has become common for prototypes, low-volume production and the replacement of complicated core assemblies with single cores.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["29"]}

{"title": "Is the market pronatalist? Inequality, differential fertility, and growth revisited\n", "abstract": " Recent public discussion has focused on inequality and social justice, while economists have looked at inequality's adverse effects on economic growth. One economic theory builds on the empirically negative relationship between income and fertility observed in the post demographic transition era. It argues that rising inequality leads to greater differential fertility--the fertility gap between rich and poor. In turn, greater differential fertility lowers the average education level, as the poor invest less in the education of their children. We show that the relationship between income and fertility has flattened between 1980 and 2010 in the US, a time of increasing inequality, as the rich increased their fertility. These facts challenge the standard theory. We propose that marketization of parental time costs can explain the changing relationship between income and fertility. We show this result both theoretically and quantitatively, after disciplining the model on US data. Without marketization, the impact of inequality on education through differential fertility is reversed. Policies, such as the minimum wage, that affect the cost of marketization, have a large effect on the fertility and labor supply of high income women. We apply the insights of this theory to the literatures of the economics of childlessness and marital sorting.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["29"]}

{"title": "Riboswitches for intracellular study of genes involved in\n", "abstract": " The study of many important intracellular bacterial pathogens requires an understanding of how specific virulence factors contribute to pathogenesis during the infection of host cells. This requires tools to dissect gene function, but unfortunately, there is a lack of such tools for research on many difficult-to-study, or understudied, intracellular pathogens. Riboswitches are RNA-based genetic control elements that directly modulate gene expression upon ligand binding. Here we report the application of theophylline-sensitive synthetic riboswitches to induce protein expression in the intracellular pathogen Francisella. We show that this system can be used to activate the bacterial expression of the reporter \u251c\u0192-galactosidase during growth in rich medium. Furthermore, we applied this system to control the expression of green fluorescent protein during intracellular infection by the addition of theophylline directly to infected macrophages. Importantly, we could control the expression of a novel endogenous protein required for growth under nutrient-limiting conditions and replication in macrophages, FTN_0818. Riboswitch-mediated control of FTN_0818 rescued the growth of an FTN_0818 mutant in minimal medium and during macrophage infection. This is the first demonstration of the use of a synthetic riboswitch to control an endogenous gene required for a virulence trait in an intracellular bacterium. Since this system can be adapted to diverse bacteria, the ability to use riboswitches to regulate intracellular bacterial gene expression will likely facilitate the in-depth study of the virulence mechanisms of numerous difficult-to-study intracellular pathogens such\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["29"]}

D.DegreeYear: 1991Institute: University of California, BerkeleyThe NTRC protein of enteric bacteria is an enhancer-binding protein that activates transcription in response to limitation of combined nitrogen. NTRC activates transcription by catalyzing formation of open complexes by RNA polymerase (-holoenzyme form) in an ATP-dependent reaction. To catalyze open complex formation, NTRC must be phosphorylated. In this thesis we show that phosphorylation of NTRC stimulates by at least several hundred fold an ATPase activity of that protein, and we present biochemical and genetic evidence that NTRC must hydrolyze ATP to catalyze open complex formation. The need to activate the ATPase plausibly explains why NTRC must be phosphorylated to function as a transcriptional activator.

{"title": "The atypical occurrence of two biotin protein ligases in\n", "abstract": " The physiological function of biotin requires biotin protein ligase activity in order to attach the coenzyme to its cognate proteins, which are enzymes involved in central metabolism. The model intracellular pathogen Francisella novicida is unusual in that it encodes two putative biotin protein ligases rather than the usual single enzyme. F. novicida BirA has a ligase domain as well as an N-terminal DNA-binding regulatory domain, similar to the prototypical BirA protein in E. coli. However, the second ligase, which we name BplA, lacks the N-terminal DNA binding motif. It has been unclear why a bacterium would encode these two disparate biotin protein ligases, since F. novicida contains only a single biotinylated protein. In vivo complementation and enzyme assays demonstrated that BirA and BplA are both functional biotin protein ligases, but BplA is a much more efficient enzyme. BirA, but not BplA, regulated transcription of the biotin synthetic operon. Expression of bplA (but not birA) increased significantly during F. novicida infection of macrophages. BplA (but not BirA) was required for bacterial replication within macrophages as well as in mice. These data demonstrate that F. novicida has evolved two distinct enzymes with specific roles; BplA possesses the major ligase activity, whereas BirA acts to regulate and thereby likely prevent wasteful synthesis of biotin. During infection BplA seems primarily employed to maximize the efficiency of biotin utilization without limiting the expression of biotin biosynthetic genes, representing a novel adaptation strategy that may also be used by other intracellular pathogens.IMPORTANCE Our findings show that\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["29"]}

This task is challenging for autonomous driving since agents (e.g., vehicles and pedestrians) and their associated behaviors may be diverse and influence each other. Most prior work has focused on first predicting independent futures for each agent based on all past motion, and then planning against these independent predictions. However, planning against fixed predictions can suffer from the inability to represent the future interaction possibilities between different agents, leading to sub-optimal planning. In this work, we formulate a model for predicting the behavior of all agents jointly in real-world driving environments in a unified manner. Inspired by recent language modeling approaches, we use a masking strategy as the query to our model, enabling one to invoke a single model to predict agent behavior in many ways, such as potentially conditioned on the goal or full future trajectory of the autonomous vehicle or the behavior of other agents in the environment. Our model architecture fuses heterogeneous world state in a unified Transformer architecture by employing attention across road elements, agent interactions and time steps. We evaluate our approach on autonomous driving datasets for behavior prediction, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our work demonstrates that formulating the problem of behavior prediction in a unified architecture with a masking strategy may allow us to have a single model that can perform multiple motion prediction and planning related tasks effectively.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["29"]}

Contradicting reports leave an open question of whether GA is as important for root elongation as it is for stem elongation.Here we have addressed this question focusing on tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) primary-root elongation. We used a combination of physiological, molecular and genetic approaches to tackle this question.Tomato has three GA receptors; GID1a, GID1b1 and GID1b2. The loss of all three receptors, strongly suppressed stem elongation and leaf expansion, but had a relatively minor effect on primary root elongation. The effect of GA on cell elongation and gene-expression was much weaker in roots, than in shoots, reaching saturation at lower hormone concentrations. Our results imply that this differential response to GA in shoots and roots is caused by the lower expression of the dominant GA receptor GID1a in roots.We show that the differential activity of GA between shoots and roots affects root-to-shoot ratio, and speculate that this evolved as an adaptive mechanism to changing environments.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["29"]}

The conventional wisdom has been that, given the historically negative relationship between income and fertility, increasing inequality will tend to result in relatively more children being born to poorer household, and thus receive less education. However, since 1980 there has been a stark rise in inequality with a simultaneous flattening of the relationship between fertility and income. We reconcile standard models with the empirical reality by arguing that inequality leads to the cost of childcare and home good substitutes being relatively low for high income mothers. This results in an increased ability for high income mothers to marketize home production, and thus increases their fertility. The net result is the subsequent generation having, on average, higher human capital and thus more growth.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["29"]}

{"title": "Additively manufactured single-use molds and reusable patterns for large automotive and hydroelectric components\n", "abstract": " Additive manufacturing (AM) has the potential to reduce costs in the casting industry, particularly for large parts (i.e., components with any dimension >\u0393\u00c7\u00eb12\u252c\u00e1in.). Here, pilot-scale production case studies of hydroelectric and automotive parts were used to evaluate two AM-enabled casting methods: the direct printing of sand molds by binder jet and printing of reusable cope and drag patterns for sand casting. An additional benefit was found when additively manufactured patterns were used in combination with heat-treat free aluminum alloys, to produce castings of complex hydrodynamic surfaces. These parts previously required production via subtractive machining due to part distortion induced by the quench step of heat treatments. The machine types used for the three case studies are sand-binder jet, high-resolution polymer fused deposition modeling (FDM), and big area additive manufacturing (BAAM) FDM in\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["29"]}
{"title": "Did Shakespeare Use a Manuscript of Samuel Daniel's Civil Wars to Write Richard II?\n", "abstract": " Evidence indicates that Shakespeare may have used a scribal version of Samuel Daniel\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s The Civil Wars, rather than the first printed edition, while writing Richard II. There are two extant manuscripts of portions of Daniel\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s epic poem. A never-printed stanza in one manuscript employs imagery similar to Shakespeare\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s to describe the same invented episode. To investigate possible influence, this essay assesses the dates of the manuscripts, analyzes variants from the printed edition, evaluates the shared imagery, and considers how Shakespeare\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s possible use of a manuscript impacts the dating of Richard II. It also identifies social connections between the authors that explain how the playwright could have obtained access to an early version of the poet\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s work.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["29"]}
{"title": "Learning Entity Representations for Few-Shot Reconstruction of Wikipedia Categories\n", "abstract": " Language modeling tasks, in which words are predicted on the basis of a local context, have been very effective for learning word embeddings and context dependent representations of phrases. Motivated by the observation that efforts to code world knowledge into machine readable knowledge bases tend to be entity-centric, we investigate the use of a fill-in-the-blank task to learn context independent representations of entities from the contexts in which those entities were mentioned. We show that large scale training of neural models allows us to learn extremely high fidelity entity typing information, which we demonstrate with few-shot reconstruction of Wikipedia categories.

Cerium oxide is an abundant rare earth oxide that is often discarded during the refining of more valuable rare earths such as Nd and Dy. Therefore, the economics are compelling for cerium as an alloy additive. In this paper, we report select results obtained during an investigation of the castability of aluminum-cerium alloys and determine compositional modifications that may be required to ensure the compatibility of the alloy with near net shape casting methods such as advanced sand casting, die casting, permanent mold casting and squeeze casting.

{"title": "Using testing trace for automatic user categorization\n", "abstract": " Testing has always been an indispensable part of software development. With the increasing amount of testing, the volume of data and information generated from testing grows substantially. The question arises on how to take advantage of the testing data, besides traditional coverage and debugging. In this paper, we propose an approach of using test trace data of a software application to its run-time user categorization. It collects test execution trace of programs studied by the software tool, and derives internal metrics of different categories from the trace information. During run time, we look at the user's artifacts as well as the user's behavior to categorize them into predetermined groups and serve them accordingly. Our work in-progress is to apply this method to a software product line, PolyFlow, including a web service that generates, runs, and analyzes test cases of programs under study.

{"title": "Work Your Metal Matrix\n", "abstract": " The automotive industry recognizes that weight reduction and improved engine efficiency will make the greatest contribution to improved fuel economy with current p OW ertra ins. This is evidenced by the increased use of aluminum alloys in engine and chassis components. Aluminum and magnesium castings in this sector have grown in leaps and bounds over the past five years to help engineers design and manufacture more fuel efficient cars. The low density and high specific mechanical properties of aluminum metal matrix composites (M MC) make these alloys one of the most interesting material alternatives for the manufacture of lightweight parts for many types of vehicles. With Wear resistance and strength equal to cast iron, 67% lower density and three times the thermal conductivity, aluminum MMC alloys are ideal materials for the manufacture of lightweight automotive and other commercial parts.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["29"]}
{"title": "Hormonal regulation of corolla growth and pigmentation in petunia flowers\n", "abstract": " In many cases, the economic success of plants as ornamentals depends on flower size, structure and color. These characteristics result mainly from petal growth and pigmentation, the latter being is an integral part of the former. Petunia corolla elongation is accompanied by the accumulation of the flavonoid pigment anthocyanin. We found both processes to be controlled by the developing anthers and the plant hormone gibberellic acid (GA 3). Anthers and GA 3 induce corolla pigmentation by activating the transcription of several genes encoding flavonoid enzymes such as chalcone synthase (chs), chalcone isomerase (chi), dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (dfr), anthocyanidin synthase (as), and ramnosyl transferase (rt). GA controls flavonoid gene transcription in an indirect manner and our data support a model in which the hormone induces the production of a regulatory protein.

The switch from vegetative growth to reproductive development is regulated by environmental and/or internal factors. Follow-ing floral induction the apical inflorescence initiates and flowers are formed. The transi-tion from vegetative shoot to complete flower does not occur in a single step (6). Genetic studies have defined 2 classes of genes involved in flower formation. Genes of class I control the shift from inflorescence meristem to flower meristem and class II genes control the formation and identity of the flower or-gans (4). Mutations in class I genes result in the development of an inflorescence meristem that does not form flowers. In plants requiring external stimuli for flowering, a sim-ilar phenotype can be caused by suboptimal induction conditions. These conditions lead to inflorescence initiation but the formation of the\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["29"]}
