{"title": "Strong temporal planning with uncontrollable durations\n", "abstract": " Planning in real world domains often involves modeling and reasoning about the duration of actions. Temporal planning allows such modeling and reasoning by looking for plans that specify start and end time points for each action. In many practical cases, however, the duration of actions may be uncertain and not under the full control of the executor. For example, a navigation task may take more or less time, depending on external conditions such as terrain or weather.In this paper, we tackle the problem of strong temporal planning with uncontrollable action durations (STPUD). For actions with uncontrollable durations, the planner is only allowed to choose the start of the actions, while the end is chosen, within known bounds, by the environment. A solution plan must be robust with respect to all uncontrollable action durations, and must achieve the goal on all executions, despite the choices of the environment.We\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["1606"]}

The ability to represent sets of traces by means of formulas in temporal logic has recently found important applications in various fields, such as requirements analysis, compositional verification, and contract-based design.

Several works have addressed the definition and the solving of controllability problems, and three degrees of controllability have been proposed: weak, strong, and dynamic. In this work we focus on weak controllability: we address both the decision and the strategy extraction problems. Extracting a strategy means finding a function from assignments to uncontrollable time points to assignments to controllable time points that fulfills all the temporal constraints. We address the two problems in the satisfiability modulo theory framework. We provide a clean and complete formalization of the problems, and we propose novel techniques to extract strategies.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach, based on the use of structural information. Rather than computing the abstraction as a single, monolithic quantification, we provide a structure-aware abstraction algorithm, based on two complementary steps. The first, highlevel step exploits the structure of the system, and partitions the abstraction problem into the combination of several smaller abstraction problems. This is represented as a formula with quantifiers. The second, low-level step exploits the structure of the formula, in particular the occurrence of variables within the quantifiers, and applies a set of low-level rewriting rules aiming at further reducing the scope of quantifiers.

{"title": "Software model checking with explicit scheduler and symbolic threads\n", "abstract": " In many practical application domains, the software is organized into a set of threads, whose activation is exclusive and controlled by a cooperative scheduling policy: threads execute, without any interruption, until they either terminate or yield the control explicitly to the scheduler. The formal verification of such software poses significant challenges. On the one side, each thread may have infinite state space, and might call for abstraction. On the other side, the scheduling policy is often important for correctness, and an approach based on abstracting the scheduler may result in loss of precision and false positives. Unfortunately, the translation of the problem into a purely sequential software model checking problem turns out to be highly inefficient for the available technologies. We propose a software model checking technique that exploits the intrinsic structure of these programs. Each thread is translated into a separate sequential program and explored symbolically with lazy abstraction, while the overall verification is orchestrated by the direct execution of the scheduler. The approach is optimized by filtering the exploration of the scheduler with the integration of partial-order reduction. The technique, called ESST (Explicit Scheduler, Symbolic Threads) has been implemented and experimentally evaluated on a significant set of benchmarks. The results demonstrate that ESST technique is way more effective than software model checking applied to the sequentialized programs, and that partial-order reduction can lead to further performance improvements.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["1606"]}

Previous workshops of the ERCIM working group on Formal Methods for Industrial Critical Systems wereheld in Oxford (March 1996), Cesena (July 1997), Amsterdam (May 1998), Trento (July 1999), Berlin (April 2000), Paris (July 2001), Malaga (July 2002), Trondheim (June2003), Linz (September 2004), Lisbon (September 2005), Bonn (August 2006), Berlin (July 2007), L Aquila (September 2008), and Eindhoven (November 2009). The aim of the FMICS workshop series is to provide a forum for researchers who are interested in the development and application of formal methods in industry. In particular, these workshops bring together scientists and engineers who are active in the area of formal methods and are interested in exchanging their experiences in the industrial usage of these methods. These workshops also strive to promote research and development for the improvement of formal methods and tools for industrial applications. The FMICS 2010 workshop was co-located with ASE 2010, the 25th IEEE/ACMInternationalConferenceonAutomatedSoftwareEngineering, which o? ereda choiceofeventsintheareainadditionto themainconference.

{"title": "From sequential extended regular expressions to NFA with symbolic labels\n", "abstract": " Practical property specification languages such as the IEEE standard PSL use at their core Sequential Extended Regular Expressions (SERE). In order to enable the reuse of traditional verification techniques, it is necessary to translate SEREs into automata. SERE are regular expressions built over alphabets resulting from the state variables of the design under analysis. Thus, a traditional approach to generate the automaton would suffer from the fact that the size of the alphabet is exponential in the number of symbols in the design. In this work, we tackle this problem by proposing non-deterministic finite automata with symbolic representation of transitions labels, by way of propositional formulas, while states and transitions are explicitly represented. We provide a symbolic version of the algorithms for all the major operations over non-deterministic finite automata. The approach has been implemented in the AutLib\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1606"]}

{"title": "Discovery and Identification of Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities on Bare-metal Embedded Devices\n", "abstract": " Memory corruption vulnerabilities remain a prevalent threat on low-cost bare-metal devices. Fuzzing is a popular technique for automatically discovering such vulnerabilities. However, bare-metal devices lack even basic security mechanisms such as Memory Management Unit. Consequently, fuzzing approaches encounter silent memory corruptions with no visible effects, making even discovery difficult. Once discovered, it is also essential to identify the type of observed vulnerability for applying mitigation. Both discovery and identification remain open challenges in the case of fuzzing firmware binaries. This paper addresses these problems by proposing an automated instrumentation technique that allows the observation of memory corruption vulnerabilities that are otherwise not observable and facilitates the automated identification of the observed vulnerability. Additionally, we surveyed state-of-the-art IoT fuzzers\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1606"]}
{"title": "Optimization Modulo Non-linear Arithmetic via Incremental Linearization\n", "abstract": " Incremental linearization is a conceptually simple, yet effective, technique that we have recently proposed for solving SMT problems on the theories of non-linear arithmetic over the reals and the integers. Optimization Modulo Theories (OMT) is an important extension of SMT which allows for finding models that optimize given objective functions. In this paper, we show how incremental linearization can be extended to OMT in a simple way, producing an incomplete though effective OMT procedure. We describe the main ideas and algorithms, we provide an implementation within the OptiMathSAT OMT solver, and perform an empirical evaluation. The results support the effectiveness of the approach.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1606"]}
{"title": "Planning with Global State Constraints for Urban Traffic Control\n", "abstract": " Planning with global state constraints is an extension of classical planning in which some properties of each state are derived via a set of constraints. This approach allows us to apply planning techniques in domains involving interconnected physical systems. The crucial feature of such domains is that a single discrete action affects the state of the entire system in a way that is dependent on the global state. Urban Traffic Control refers to coordinating traffic signals over an area in order to reduce congestion and delays. Here we show how this domain can be modelled as a planning problem with global state constraints.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1606"]}

Directive 128/2009/EC on sustainable use of pesticides defines the role of DTs in supporting decision making on whether and when intervene to protect the crops from harmful organisms. The Italian Action Plan assigns to Regional governments the responsibility of defining DTs suitable to the scope and making them (or their output) available for professional users. Several plant protection models exist in literature, which have been developed for different purposes, by using diverse approaches, in different climatic conditions and agricultural contexts. The criteria for comparing and selecting models for being usefully integrated in the Italian IPM schemes are discussed in this talk, including: model purpose and approach, biological mechanisms accounted for, driving variables, transparency, possibility of adaptation to local conditions, validation, evaluation of usefulness. Searching for a consensus on these criteria would be useful for developing a platform in which the suitable models can be made available for use.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1606"]}
{"title": "Planning and Scheduling in Temporally Uncertain Domains Andrea Micheli\n", "abstract": " Any form of model-based reasoning is limited by the adherence of the model to the actual reality. Scheduling is the problem of finding a suitable timing to execute a given set of activities accommodating complex temporal constraints. Planning is the problem of finding a strategy for an agent to achieve a desired goal given a formal model of the system and the environment it is immersed in. When time and temporal constraints are considered, the problem takes the name of temporal planning. A common assumption in existing techniques for planning and scheduling is controllability of activities: the agent is assumed to be able to control the timing of starting and ending of each activity. In several practical applications, however, the actual timing of actions is not under direct control of the plan executor.In this thesis, we focus on this temporal uncertainty issue in scheduling and in temporal planning: we propose to natively express temporal uncertainty in the model used for reasoning. We first analyze the state-of-the-art on the subject, presenting a rationalization of existing works. Second, we show how Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers can be exploited to quickly solve different kinds of query in the realm of scheduling under uncertainty. Finally, we address the problem of temporal planning in domains featuring real-time constraints and actions having duration that is not under the control of the planning agent.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1606"]}

{"title": "From Informal Safety-Critical Requirements to Property-Driven Formal Validation\n", "abstract": " Most of the efforts in formal methods have historically been devoted to comparing a design against a set of requirements. The validation of the requirements themselves, however, has often been disregarded, and it can be considered a largely open problem, which poses several challenges. The first challenge is given by the fact that requirements are often written in natural language, and may thus contain a high degree of ambiguity. Despite the progresses in Natural Language Processing techniques, the task of understanding a set of requirements cannot be automatized, and must be carried out by domain experts, who are typically not familiar with formal languages. Furthermore, in order to retain a direct connection with the informal requirements, the formalization cannot follow standard model-based approaches. The second challenge lies in the formal validation of requirements. On one hand, it is not even clear which are the correctness criteria or the high-level properties that the requirements must fulfill. On the other hand, the expressivity of the language used in the formalization may go beyond the theoretical and/or practical capacity of state-of-the-art formal verification. In order to solve these issues, we propose a new methodology that comprises of a chain of steps, each supported by a specific tool. The main steps are the following. First, the informal requirements are split into basic fragments, which are classified into categories, and dependency and generalization relationships among them are identified. Second, the fragments are modeled using a visual language such as UML. The UML diagrams are both syntactically restricted (in order to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1606"]}

The formal specification is provided at two different levels of abstraction. The strategic level describes the requirements of the Web service domain, in terms of the different actors participating to it, with their goals and needs and with their mutual dependencies and expectations. The process level shows how these requirements are operationalized into communicating processes running on the different Web servers. We exploit Formal Tropos (FT), a language for the formal definition of the requirements of agent-oriented systems which is based on Linear Time Logic, to model the strategic level. We operationalize the process level using Promela, a language designed to describe communicating concurrent processes and amenable to formal verification. We exploit the SPIN model checker to perform formal V&V tasks. At the strategic level, requirements are validated against queries formulated by the designer, while at the process level the Promela specifications are verified against the requirements. The implementation of these V&V tasks required the definition of a novel procedure to encode the FT requirements at the strategic level in Promela. The experiments described in the paper show that the approach is effective in revealing possible flaws both in the strategic and in the process models of the Web service domains.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1606"]}
{"title": "checking and heuristic search\n", "abstract": " In this paper we tackle the problem of Conformant Planning: find a sequence of actions that guarantees goal achievement regardless of an uncertain initial condition and of nondeterministic action effects. Our approach, set in the framework of search in the belief space, is based on two main intuitions. First, symbolic model checking techniques, Binary Decision Diagrams in particular, can be used to represent and expand the search space, and to provide an efficient computational platform. Second, driving the search solely with reachability information is not effective, and the notion of knowledge has to be taken explicitly into account. We make the following contributions. First, we thoroughly analyze reachability heuristics: we formally prove their admissibility, we show how they can be implemented by means of symbolic techniques, and experimentally evaluate them. Second, we analyze the limitations of reachability heuristics, and propose more informed, yet admissible, heuristics, based on a formal notion of knowledge. Third, we present a practical conformant planning algorithm, where the search is explicitly based on the notion of target knowledge, ie, the amount of information that has to be available in order to reach the goal. The search alternates between the \u201cAcquire Knowledge\u201d mode, where actions have the precise purpose of gathering necessary information, and the \u201cReach Goal\u201d mode, where actions are directed towards the goal. Finally, we provide a thorough experimental comparison between several conformant planners. Our approach is sometimes able to outperform the competitor systems by orders of magnitude.\u00a9 2004 Published\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1606"]}
{"title": "Towards a Framework for Supporting the Negotiation between Global and Local Business Requirements\n", "abstract": " The development of service oriented applications very often needs to address the problem of satisfying two conflicting kinds of business needs: global business requirements, ie, the regulations that dictate the rules of engagement between different organizations, and local business requirements, ie, the rules local to each involved partner which derive from its internal business needs. In this paper, we propose a development process where both global and local service requirements, as well as their behaviors, are incrementally agreed among partners and built through negotiation steps. The development process is supported by the explicit definition of both global and local requirements at different levels of abstraction. We express requirements in a language with a clear semantics, and which allows for explicit links to executable business processes, eg, written in BPEL4WS. This development process opens up the possibility to adopt a variety of supporting techniques. In particular, automated verification is used to detect design or implementation problems. Automated synthesis of executable business processes allows for a speed up in the development process and reduces development effort. Finally, execution monitoring is able to detect run-time problems with respect to specified requirements.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1606"]}

Two restricting hypothesis of classical planning have been removed. The first hypothesis consists in the determinism of the planning domain, where an action execution in a state leads to a unique state.

{"title": "Abstraction in model checking for bug hunting\n", "abstract": " . Temporal logic model checking is one of the most widely used verication techniques. It allows to automatically decide if a design satises its specication. When the specication does not hold an explanation of the oending behavior is produced. Even if it has been proved to be eective in practice this technique suers of the state explosion problem. To tackle this problem various techniques have been proposed. One of the most promising and used is abstraction. An abstraction of the design is computed and the standard model checking algorithms are applied on this abstraction. If the property is veried in the abstract model, then the property is veried in the original design too. Vice versa does not usually hold. The aim of this work is in extending the work done in abstraction and model checking using abstraction in buggy design, thus rening the counterexamples/witnesses of a given temporal property to make it possible to correct the design. 1 Research Area {Main...", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1606"]}

{"title": "PISTIS: Trusted Computing Architecture for Low-end Embedded Systems\n", "abstract": " Recently, several hardware-assisted security architectures have been proposed to mitigate the ever-growing cyber-attacks on Internet-connected devices. However, such proposals are not compatible with a large portion of the already deployed resource-constrained embedded devices due to hardware limitations. To fill this gap, we propose PISTIS, a pure-software trusted computing architecture for bare-metal low-end embedded devices. PISTIS enables several security services, such as memory isolation, remote attestation and secure code update, while fully supporting critical features such as Direct Memory Access (DMA) and interrupts. PISTIS targets a wide range of embedded devices including those that lack any hardware protection mechanisms, while only requiring a few kilobytes of Flash memory to store its root of trust (RoT) software. The entire architecture of PISTIS is built from the ground up by leveraging memory protection-enabling techniques such as assembly-level code verification and selective software virtualisation. Most importantly, PISTIS achieves strong security guarantees supported by a formally verified design. We implement and evaluate PISTIS on MSP430 architecture, showing a reasonable overhead in terms of runtime, memory footprint, and power consumption.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1606"]}

The peripherals in the field are powered by battery and thanks to the low power consumption have a guaranteed duration of 5 years. Peripheral devices can be operated and managed automatically or manually through authentication with an iButton key. Depending on the location, type of cultivation, environmental data and weather forecasts, the central system computes the optimal irrigation value updated in real time leveraging on an expert system. The user see the quantity proposed by the central expert system and decides whether to apply it directly or make corrections. Everything is controlled by a web interface that allows both the user to view all the information related to the irrigated areas and the administrator to manage the entire system. The central system stores all the data that contribute to the functioning of the system, including weather and forecast data, allowing analysis according to the optimization of the process and of the irrigation network and the search for leaks.

A central step in the approach is the generation of linearization lemmas, constraints that are added during search to the SMT problem and that form a piecewise-linear approximation of the nonlinear functions in the input problem. It is crucial for both the soundness and the effectiveness of the technique that these constraints are valid (to not remove solutions) and as general as possible (to improve their pruning power). In this extended abstract, we provide more details about how linearization lemmas are generated for transcendental functions, including proofs of their soundness. Such details, which were missing in previous publications, are necessary for an independent reimplementation of the method.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1606"]}
{"title": "A Framework for Integrating Business Processes and Business Requirements\n", "abstract": " Service-oriented architectures and Web service infrastructure provide the ideal framework for interconnecting organizations and for defining distributed business applications. The possibility to exploit business process definition and execution languages is particularly relevant for capturing the process-oriented nature of these applications. However, business processes by themselves are not enough to manage the changes and to allow an organization to continuously adapt its business model to the typical needs of distributed applications. To achieve this flexibility, it is of uttermost importance to link the business processes to the organizational strategy and to the business goals that motivate the need of these processes. In this paper we propose a framework for representing strategies and goals of an organization in terms of business requirements. The framework allows to describe how an organizational strategy is operationalized into activities and implemented by business processes. It also allows to represent the assumptions on the interactions between the different business applications. Finally, this framework allows for the usage of formal analysis techniques, in particular Model Checking, to pinpoint problems and to identify possible solutions in this domain.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1606"]}
