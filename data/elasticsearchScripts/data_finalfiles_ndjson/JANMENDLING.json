{"title": "Seven process modeling guidelines (7pmg)\n", "abstract": " Business process modeling is heavily applied in practice, but important quality issues have not been addressed thoroughly by research. A notorious problem is the low level of modeling competence that many casual modelers in process documentation projects have. Existing approaches towards model quality might be of benefit, but they suffer from at least one of the following problems. On the one hand, frameworks like SEQUAL and the Guidelines of Modeling are too abstract to be applicable for novices and non-experts in practice. On the other hand, there are collections of pragmatic hints that lack a sound research foundation. In this paper, we analyze existing research on relationships between model structure on the one hand and error probability and understanding on the other hand. As a synthesis we propose a set of seven process modeling guidelines (7PMG). Each of these guidelines builds on strong\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "860\n", "authors": ["39"]}

In this paper we address this challenge in a novel way. We use causal footprints as an abstract representation of the behavior captured by a process model, since they allow us to compare models defined in both formal modeling languages like Petri nets and informal ones like EPCs. Based on the causal footprint derived from two models we calculate their similarity based on the established vector space model from information retrieval.

Recently, significant efforts have been made to overcome the disintegration of process models by providing complementary language standards for process design (BPMN) and execution (BPEL), based on the claim that these languages are semantically integrated. However, the conceptual mapping between both languages remains unclear, thus it is undecided whether any BPMN diagram can be transformed to BPEL. In this paper we argue that there is conceptual mismatch between BPMN and BPEL that needs to be identified in order to guide the language integration process semantically. In our analysis we take into account the various perspectives of the Business Process Management life cycle, in particular business and technical analyst perspectives.

This doctoral thesis provides a fourfold contribution to the understanding of such errors in business process models with a particular focus on Event-driven Process Chains (EPCs), a business process modeling language that is frequently used in practice. Firstly, we formalize the operational semantics of EPCs in a novel way so that matching OR-splits and OR-joins never deadlock. Secondly, and based on these semantics, we introduce a soundness criterion for EPCs that offers a precise identification of those models which have errors. For the verification of this soundness notion in practice, we present two analysis tools, a ProM plug-in for a verification based on the reachability graph, and a batch program called xoEPC for a verification based on reduction rules. Thirdly, we define a set of business process model metrics that are supposed to serve as predictors for error probability of an individual EPC. Fourthly, we use statistical methods and a sample of about 2000 EPCs from practice to derive a regression function for the prediction of error probability. This function is validated against a holdout set of 113 EPCs from textbooks showing that 90% of the EPCs could be classified correctly as having errors or not.

The framework enables the creation of matchers from the re-usable components and, if desired, newly developed components.

Inspired by semantic Web service approaches such as OWL-S and WSMO, we consider process models in which the individual activities are annotated with logical preconditions and effects, specified relative to an ontology that axiomatizes the underlying business domain. Verification then addresses the overall process behavior, arising from the interaction between control-flow and behavior of individual activities. To this end, we combine notions from the workflow community with notions from the AI actions and change literature. We introduce a formal execution semantics for annotated business processes.

We address this shortcoming in this paper by building an analogy between database schema design by view integration on the one hand and process modeling on the other hand. In particular, we specify a method for business process design by view integration starting from two views of a process as input. We identify formal semantic relationships between elements of the two process views which are then used to calculate the integrated process model applying the merge operator. Finally, the integrated model is optimized using reduction rules.

As many large process model collections contain more than thousand models, each including several activity labels, there is a strong need for an automatic detection of labels that might be of bad quality. Recent research has shown that different grammatical styles correlate with potential ambiguity of a label. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for recognition of activity labeling styles. The developed algorithm exploits natural language processing techniques, eg, part of speech tagging and analysis of the grammatical structure. We also study how ontologies, like WordNet, can support the solution. We conduct a thorough evaluation of the developed techniques utilising about 6,000 activity labels from the SAP Reference Model. The evaluation of this algorithm shows that spurious labels can be identified with a significant level of precision and recall. In this way, our approach can be used as a means of quality assurance for process repository management by listing bad quality labels, which a human modeler should correct.", "num_citations": "52\n", "authors": ["39"]}

Yet, as BPEL is also very much related to business logic, BPEL process definitions have to be communicated to business analysts, whether for approval or for process re-engineering. As BPEL does not offer a graphical notation, an automatic transformation to a graphical language like Event-Driven Process Chains (EPCs) is required. In this paper, we present a transformation of BPEL to EPCs. We first define a conceptual mapping from BPEL to EPCs which provides the foundation for a transformation program from BPEL to EPML. Furthermore, we present the concepts used in our transformation program which are also applicable for transformations from block-oriented BPEL to other graph-based process languages.", "num_citations": "52\n", "authors": ["39"]}

Therefore, it is important that such models can be easily and properly understood. Previous research has mainly focused on two types of factors that are important in this context: (i) properties of the model itself, and (ii) properties of the model reader. The work in this paper aims at determining how the performance of subjects varies across different types of comprehension tasks, which is a new angle. To reason about the complexity of comprehension tasks we take a theoretical perspective that is grounded in visual cognition. We test our hypotheses using a free-simulation experiment that incorporates eye-tracking technology. We find that model-related and person-related factors are fully mediated by variables of visual cognition.

This calls for a means to detect diversions that just requires publicly available data, thus being independent of the communication between different parties.The dependence on public data results in a challenge to detect anomalous behavior without knowing the planned flight trajectory.Our work addresses this challenge by introducing a prediction model that just requires information on an airplane's position, velocity, and intended destination.

Processes are specifically discussed from the angle of simplicity, ie, how compact and easy to understand they can be represented. In most cases, organizations rely on imperative models which, however, become complex and cluttered when it comes to flexibility and optionality. As an alternative, declarative modeling reveals to be effective under such circumstances. While both approaches are well known for themselves, there is still not a deep understanding of their semantic interoperability. With this work, we examine the latter and show how to obtain an imperative model out of a set of declarative constraints. To this aim, we devise an approach leading from a Declare model to a behaviorally equivalent Petri net. Furthermore, we demonstrate that any declarative control flow can be represented by means of a Petri net for which the property of safety always holds true.", "num_citations": "50\n", "authors": ["39"]}

As a consequence, companies typically have different process models for the same process, which differ in terms of granularity. In this context, business process model abstraction serves as a technique that takes a process model as an input and derives a high-level model with coarse-grained activities and the corresponding control flow between them. In this way, business process model abstraction reduces the number of models capturing the same business process on different abstraction levels. In this article, we provide a solution to the problem of deriving the control flow of an abstract process model for the case that an arbitrary grouping of activities is permitted.

This assumption, however, does not necessarily hold, and any required compensatory action may be delayed until a new round in the BPM life-cycle completes. Current approaches to process redesign face this problem in one way or another, which makes rapid process improvement a central research problem of BPM today. In this paper, we address this problem by integrating concepts from process execution with ideas from DevOps. More specifically, we develop a methodology called AB-BPM that offers process improvement validation in two phases: simulation and AB tests.

The quality of process models, both conceptual and data-driven, heavily depends on the inputs and parameters that shape these models, such as domain expertise of the modelers and the quality of execution data. The mentioned quality issues are specifically a challenge for conformance checking. Conformance checking is the process mining task that aims at coping with low model or log quality by comparing the model against the corresponding log, or vice versa.

Using a four-phase approach tokens and statuses are propagated thus yielding a new kind of semantics which overcomes some of the wellknown problems related to OR-joins in EPCs.", "num_citations": "37\n", "authors": ["39"]}

Methodological guidance is needed in order to consolidate concurrent schema proposals especially in the BPM ares. This paper discusses the applicability of schema integration for this purpose. We use the case of integrating XPDL 2.0 and BPEL 2.0 to highlight that schema integration is not able to cope with heterogeneous control flow representation of BPM schemas.

However, these prior works hardly consider the variety of configurations in terms of diverging objectives and actions how companies approach BPM. In this paper, we emphasize this point by addressing the challenge of developing a theoretical framework in which individual cases of success and failure can be studied. We propose a BPM implementation framework which comprises ten elements that are interlinked with each other. We conducted in-depth interviews with two companies and used the BPM implementation framework to assess the success of both BPM initiatives.

Before deploying such a model, it is important to verify control-flow correctness. A process is sound if its control-flow guarantees proper completion and there are no deadlocks. However, a sound control flow is not sufficient to ensure that an executable process model indeed behaves as expected. This is due to business functions requiring certain preconditions to be fulfilled for execution and having an effect on the process (postconditions). Semantic annotations provide a means for taking such further aspects into account. Inspired by OWL-S and WSMO, we consider process models in which the individual activities are annotated with logical preconditions and postconditions specified relative to an ontology that axiomatizes the\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "28\n", "authors": ["39"]}

While the proposed Configurable EPCs (C-EPCs) provide adequate conceptual support towards reference model configuration, the issue of translating the configured models towards executable process specifications has not been approached yet. A first step in this direction is the definition of a machine-readable format for C-EPCs that can be used as an interchange format and as an input format for transformations.

We take the formal C-EPC syntax definition as a starting point to define the requirements for a respective extension to EPML and introduce a C-EPC representation in EPML. Furthermore, we introduce the C-EPC Validator, a program that generates validity reports for C-EPCs represented in EPML.

It can be used to discover those LTL-based business rules that are valid in the log, by checking against the log a (user-defined) class of rules.

Process mining algorithms can extend established theorizing in a number of ways and in relation to different research agendas and phenomena. We illustrate our argument in relation to two types of change: endogenous change that evolves over time and exogenous change that follows a purposeful intervention.

This, ultimately, may lead to the coexistence of several PAISs within an organization. In addition, the use of PAISs and PAIS development tools has been extended to automate business processes beyond organizational boundaries. With an increasing number of trading partners using PAISs, the individual negotiation of system-to-system interoperability aspects becomes cumbersome as the number of interfaces in the network increases geometrically. Accordingly, the use of general standards for process integration purposes becomes economically desirable. Standardization groups in the area of workflow have two purposes. First, the standardization of integration interfaces promises reduced implementation effort and better reuse of workflow components when PAISs have to be integrated with the existing information system infrastructure of an organization. Second, in the field of cross-organizational processes (eg, in supply chain scenarios), the standardization of invocation interfaces and messaging formats improves the development of plug-and-play solutions and reduces the risk of using proprietary technology for participants in such process chains.

While formal control flow analysis has been extensively studied in prior research, there is a little work on how the textual content of a process model and its activity labels can be systematically analyzed. It is a major challenge to classify labels according to their quality and consequently assure high label quality. As a starting point we take a recent research on the activity labeling style, which establishes superiority of a so-called verb-object labeling style. Together with the labeling style, the length of an activity label is related to its quality. In this paper, we investigate how various natural language processing techniques, eg, part of speech tagging and analysis of phrase grammatical structure, can be used to detect an activity labeling style in an automatic fashion. We also study how ontologies, like WordNet, can support the solution. We conduct a thorough evaluation of the developed techniques utilizing about 20,000 activity labels from the SAP Reference Model.", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["39"]}

Quality of modeling is an important field of research in which, however, a comprehensive and gen-erally acknowledged understanding is still outstanding. Notions of \"model\", \"adequacy\" and \"quality\" often remain vague and focus on single aspects such as \"syntax\" or \"semantics\" rather than a comprehensive perspective. In this paper we review existing measures and proposals for process model quality as a surrogate for modeling adequacy. Forthcoming from this review we argue that it is foremost the question of modeling pragmatics that is of pertinence when trying to ascertain the adequacy of process modeling. We illustrate how prag-matic concerns mediate traditional conceptions of model quality. The paper ends with a proposed research agenda in the area of process model quality that stipulates an adequacy perspective with a closer focus on the socio-organizational context in which process modeling occurs.", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["39"]}

As a result, there are little experiences with the use of process mining in supply chains. To address this problem, we consider Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) for identifying the movements of the business objects.

BPMN promises to bridge business and IT, and brings process design and implementation closer together. BPMN 2012 was the fourth workshop of the series. It took place September 12\u0393\u00c7\u00f413, 2012, at WU Vienna, Austria. This volume contains six contributed research papers that were selected from 22 submissions. There was a thorough reviewing process, with each paper being reviewed by, on average, three Program Committee members.

{"title": "On the suitability of aggregated and configurable business process models\n", "abstract": " Reference models play an important role for specifying knowledge about a certain business domain that is general enough to be applicable for a wide set of companies. Still, it is understood that reference models need to be adapted in order to also reflect individual characteristics of a company. This adaptation turns out to be quite labor-intense. Concepts such as configurable process modeling languages have been proposed to simplify this adaptation. Competing languages have been designed to facilitate the actual act of adapting reference models, namely configurable EPCs (C-EPCs) and aggregated EPCs (aEPCs). In this paper we discuss the ease of use of these languages from an analytical perspective. Based on a mapping from C-EPCs to aEPCs we identify complexity issues and comparative advantages. It turns out that C-EPCs appear to be better suited to capture complex configuration options\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["39"]}

The measures allow quantifying classical non-deterministic and stochastic precision and recall quality criteria for process models automatically discovered from traces executed by IT-systems and recorded in their event logs. A process model has \"good\" precision with respect to the log it was discovered from if it does not encode many traces that are not part of the log, and has \"good\" recall if it encodes most of the traces from the log. By definition, the measures possess useful properties and can often be computed quickly.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["39"]}

On the one hand, multinational companies try to realize returns of scale by standardization. On the other hand, markets require businesses to adapt to local needs and government regulations. As of today, there is no framework available to measure the degree of process standardization. This is both a problem for companies that want to assess their degree of standardization as well as for research that aims to investigate standardization and its connection with other concepts. In this paper, we address this research gap from the perspective of scale development. We utilize a well-acknowledged method for devising a measurement instrument to specifically and directly measure the degree of standardization in business processes.

However, the usefulness of process models is highly dependent on their quality. Recognizing this, researches have proposed various techniques for the automated quality assurance of process models. A considerable shortcoming of these techniques is the assumption that each activity label consistently refers to a single stream of action. If, however, activities textually describe control flow related aspects such as decisions or conditions, the analysis results of these tools are distorted. Due to the ambiguity that is associated with this misuse of natural language, also humans struggle with drawing valid conclusions from such inconsistently specified activities.

Therefore, this paper presents a service oriented architecture that analyzes a process description written in natural language to generate a sound process description.

A method refers to a welldefined sequences of activities that, if carried out proficiently, yield predictable results. Research methods provide guidance for conducting IS research projects, while practical methods address real-world problems. Often the same method is applied differently in different settings and new methods are constantly being proposed, although methods with the same purpose already exist. Therefore, it is increasingly challenging to understand the spectrum of available methods and how they are used. The questions we aim to answer are: How can we describe similarities and differences of methods that share the same purpose? and Why are there differences in the way how methods are used? To address these, we propose a method mining procedure which uses the technique of process mining, and use the procedure to investigate process improvement methods.

Using classical schema integration and the upward inheritance principle yields an integrated schema that still can be further simplified. Basically, further research is needed in three areas. Firstly, the schema integration process has to be adapted or an integration process has to be defined building on a behavior-specific common data model.

They are specifically interesting for process mining because they allow capturing complex behavior in a compact way. A key research challenge for the proliferation of mixed-paradigm models for process mining is the lack of corresponding conformance checking techniques. In this paper, we address this problem by devising the first approach that works with intertwined state spaces of mixed-paradigm models. More specifically, our approach uses an alignment-based replay to explore the state space and compute trace fitness in a procedural way. In every state, the declarative constraints are separately updated, such that violations disable the corresponding activities. Our technique provides for an efficient replay towards an optimal alignment by respecting all orthogonal Declare constraints\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["39"]}
{"title": "The Connection between Process Complexity of Event Sequences and Models discovered by Process Mining\n", "abstract": " Process mining is a research area focusing on the design of algorithms that can automatically provide insights into business processes by analysing historic process execution data, known as event logs. Among the most popular algorithms are those for automated process discovery, whose ultimate goal is to generate the best process model that summarizes the behaviour recorded in the input event log. Over the past decade, several process discovery algorithms have been proposed but, until now, this research was driven by the implicit assumption that a better algorithm would discover better process models, no matter the characteristics of the input event log. In this paper, we take a step back and question that assumption. Specifically, we investigate what are the relations between measures capturing characteristics of the input event log and the quality of the discovered process models. To this end, we review the state-of-the-art process complexity measures, propose a new process complexity measure based on graph entropy, and analyze this set of complexity measures on an extensive collection of event logs and corresponding automatically discovered process models. Our analysis shows that many process complexity measures correlate with the quality of the discovered process models, demonstrating the potential of using complexity measures as predictors for the quality of process models discovered with state-of-the-art process discovery algorithms. This finding is important for process mining research, as it highlights that not only algorithms, but also connections between input data and output quality should be studied.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["39"]}

In this way, these formats extend the discussions of the last century on how we can effectively use radio, television, computers and eventually the Internet for education purposes [1].One of the most recent formats is the MOOC\u0393\u00c7\u00f4an abbreviation for Massive Open Online Course. The essential idea of a MOOC is that people can openly register and participate in a focused learning experience via the Internet. In this way, Web technology transcends the boundaries of classroom teaching and lifts it towards a potentially unlimited number of participants [2]. MOOCs also aim to make the best use of what Web technology has to offer. Therefore, teaching is typically organized in short video segments with complementary reading material, quizzes and problem solving tasks. MOOC students can interact with co-students, teaching assistants and professors via user forums.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["39"]}
{"title": "Business Process Models for Risk Analysis: Expert View.\n", "abstract": " The recent financial turbulences raise questions on how risk analysis is conducted. Regulatory requirements and professional standards have been introduced in the last decade in order to obtain a more reliable internal control on financial reporting process with a new emphasis on business processes. However, there are no standards yet available on how business processes should be captured for facilitating risk analysis in audit assignments. Representations of business processes have been investigated in the field of business process modeling. There exists a broad spectrum of notations and formalisms with relative strengths and weaknesses. Many of the popular notations build on a graph-based representation where activities of a process are connected with directed arcs defining the control flow. Such notations have been widely adopted for redesigning business processes. But also text-based formats have been defined. Corresponding process specifications define the activities of a process as lists with additional free text information. This raises the question whether the tools and methods for analyzing business process risks in auditing practice is appropriate for its objective. This paper reveals the benefits of adopting business process models for auditors toward understanding a companies business processes and the issues need to be considered for further development. The analysis also shows that practitioners use process models rather for risk elicitation and less in risk assessment.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["39"]}

{"title": "Soundness of EPC Process Models with Objects and Roles\n", "abstract": " The verification of business process models is an important step in the design phase of process-aware information systems. While a process model often describes different perspectives like control flow, object flow, and role assignment, most of the contributions in the areas of verification consider only the control flow. Hardly any work considers these three perspectives in a combined verification approach. In this paper we address this gap and introduce Integrated EPCs (iEPCs), a business process modeling language that extends EPCs with a concept of object flow and role assignment. By abstracting from the subtle differences of recent EPC semantics definitions, we show how any of these formalizations can be enhanced with transition rules that consider object existence and role availability as part of the state concept. Furthermore, we define three theorems that relate soundness of EPCs to soundness of iEPCs with different initial role and object set. These theorems provide the basis for a systematic verification approach of iEPCs that first identifies control-flow problems, then object-flow problems, and finally suitable role subsets. This way, our work contributes to a better identification of correctness issues already in conceptual process models in the early design phases.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["39"]}

{"title": "Theory and practice of algorithm engineering\n", "abstract": " There is an ongoing debate in computer science how algorithms should best be studied. Some scholars have argued that experimental evaluations should be conducted, others emphasize the benefits of formal analysis. We believe that this debate less of a question of either-or, because both views can be integrated into an overarching framework. It is the ambition of this paper to develop such a framework of algorithm engineering with a theoretical foundation in the philosophy of science. We take the empirical nature of algorithm engineering as a starting point. Our theoretical framework builds on three areas discussed in the philosophy of science: ontology, epistemology and methodology. In essence, ontology describes algorithm engineering as being concerned with algorithmic problems, algorithmic tasks, algorithm designs and algorithm implementations. Epistemology describes the body of knowledge of algorithm engineering as a collection of prescriptive and descriptive knowledge, residing in World 3 of Popper's Three Worlds model. Methodology refers to the steps how we can systematically enhance our knowledge of specific algorithms. In this context, we identified seven validity concerns and discuss how researchers can respond to falsification. Our framework has important implications for researching algorithms in various areas of computer science.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["39"]}

In this paper, we use digital trace data to investigate variations in complexity of two routines of two subsidiaries of a global manufacturing company. We measure complexity in two ways. Absolute complexity depicts the total number of available ways to enact the routine, whereas relative complexity measures the number of ways in relation to the number of enactments. Our research provides empirical evidence of how routine complexity develops in real-world organizational routines over time. We find steady fluctuations of complexity, and observe that the Covid-19 crisis had an impact on relative routine complexity.

To this aim, we show how smallest correction sets, i.e., the smallest sets of constraints that need to be deleted in order to resolve inconsistencies, can be computed via an application of Reiter\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s hitting set theorem. In this context, as deleting certain constraints might be highly sensitive or not plausible in a real-life sense, we extend our approach with functionalities for enabling a close human-in-the-loop interaction, such as prioritizing constraints, as well as metrics that offer modelers insights into the impact of deleting constraints. Furthermore, we implement our approach and show that our inconsistency resolution approach outperforms existing approaches in terms of runtime and information loss in experiments with real-life data sets.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["39"]}
{"title": "The Effect of Risk Representation Using Colors and Symbols in Business Process Models on Operational Risk Management Performance\n", "abstract": " The operational management of risk and internal controls (RIC) makes increasing use of visual representations to support tasks such as risk assessment and control activity definition. The strengths and weaknesses of different representations are typically assessed by cognitive theories that assume an analytical and an intuitive mode of information processing. Previous research has focused mainly on the analytical risk assessment while intuitive information processing has largely been neglected. We develop a theoretical argument based on dual-process theory, which explains why RIC representational alternatives influence different levels of information processing. We test our hypotheses with the help of an online experiment using accountants and operation managers recruited via MTurk (N= 166). Our results suggest that highlighting risk and controls in business process modeling and notation (BPMN) by using color improves risk understanding, control understanding, and the identification of control improvements, which help reduce the risk in a given process. Furthermore, we do not find evidence that the inclusion of color leads to perception biases. This has implications for information systems research, which has primarily addressed the analytical processing of conceptual models. Our findings extend cognitive research on such models by adding an intuitive processing path that can improve the user\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s risk management performance. For practitioners, our findings are particularly relevant because colors can be easily added as a secondary notation element without disguising the factual risk situation in processes.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["39"]}

It offers insights into process problems but leaves analysts barehanded to translate these problems into concrete solutions. Research on business process management discusses both process mining and improvement patterns in isolation. In this paper, we address this research gap. More specifically, we identify six categories of process problems that can be identified with process mining and map them to applicable best practices of business processes. We analyze the relevance of our approach using a thematic analysis of reports that were handed in to the Business Process Intelligence Challenges over recent years, and observe the dire need for better guidance to translate process problems identified by process mining into suitable process designs. Conceptually, we position process mining into the problem and solution space of process redesign and thereby offer a language to describe potentials and limitations of the technique.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["39"]}
{"title": "Rule Mining in Action: The RuM Toolkit\n", "abstract": " Procedural process modeling languages can be difficult to use for process mining in cases where the process recorded in the event log is unpredictable and has a high number of different branches and exceptions. In these cases, declarative process modeling languages such as DECLARE are more suitable. Declarative languages do not aim at modeling the end-to-end process step by step, but constrain the behavior of the process using rules thus allowing for more variability in the process model yet keeping it compact. Although there are several commercial and academic process mining tools available based on procedural models, there are currently no comparable tools for working with declarative models. In this paper, we present RuM, an accessible and easy-to-use rule mining toolkit integrating multiple DECLARE-based process mining methods into a single unified application. RuM implements process mining techniques based on Multi-Perspective DECLARE, namely the extension of DECLARE supporting data constraints together with controlflow constraints. In particular, RuM includes support for process discovery, conformance checking, log generation and monitoring as well as a model editor. The application has been evaluated by conducting a qualitative user evaluation with eight process analysts.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["39"]}
