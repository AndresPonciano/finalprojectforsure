{"title": "Extending transfer entropy improves identification of effective connectivity in a spiking cortical network model\n", "abstract": " Transfer entropy (TE) is an information-theoretic measure which has received recent attention in neuroscience for its potential to identify effective connectivity between neurons. Calculating TE for large ensembles of spiking neurons is computationally intensive, and has caused most investigators to probe neural interactions at only a single time delay and at a message length of only a single time bin. This is problematic, as synaptic delays between cortical neurons, for example, range from one to tens of milliseconds. In addition, neurons produce bursts of spikes spanning multiple time bins. To address these issues, here we introduce a free software package that allows TE to be measured at multiple delays and message lengths. To assess performance, we applied these extensions of TE to a spiking cortical network model (Izhikevich, 2006) with known connectivity and a range of synaptic delays. For comparison, we also investigated single-delay TE, at a message length of one bin (D1TE), and cross-correlation (CC) methods. We found that D1TE could identify 36% of true connections when evaluated at a false positive rate of 1%. For extended versions of TE, this dramatically improved to 73% of true connections. In addition, the connections correctly identified by extended versions of TE accounted for 85% of the total synaptic weight in the network. Cross correlation methods generally performed more poorly than extended TE, but were useful when data length was short. A computational performance analysis demonstrated that the algorithm for extended TE, when used on currently available desktop computers, could extract effective connectivity\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "209\n", "authors": ["2162"]}
{"title": "Cognitive architectures: A way forward for the psychology of programming\n", "abstract": " Programming language and library designers often debate the usability of particular design choices. These choices may impact many developers, yet scientific evidence for them is rarely provided. Cognitive models of program comprehension have existed for over thirty years, but the lack of quantitative (operational) validations for their internal components limits their utility for usability studies. To ease the burden of quantifying these existing models, we recommend using the ACT-R cognitive architecture-a simulation framework for psychological models. In this paper, we review the history of cognitive modeling in the psychology of programming. We provide an overview of the ACT-R cognitive architecture, and show how it could be used to fill in the gaps of an existing, yet incomplete, quantitative model (the Cognitive Complexity Metric). Lastly, we discuss the potential benefits and challenges associated with building\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "29\n", "authors": ["2162"]}

{"title": "Detecting covert communication on Android\n", "abstract": " Using covert channels, malicious applications on Android-based smartphones are able to subvert the permission system and share data in a potentially untraceable manner. These channels are easy to exploit today, and have enough bandwidth to transmit sensitive information in real-time between collaborating applications. In this paper, we define and implement an application layer covert communications detector that does not require special permission from the user. We quantify the effect our detector has on channel capacities for malicious applications that wish to remain stealthy. Lastly, we evaluate the robustness of the volume and vibration channels on the Android emulator, HTC G1, and Motorola Droid, as well as characterize the effects of background noise on data loss and transfer rates.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["2162"]}
{"title": "Courses of action display for multi-unmanned vehicle control: a multi-disciplinary approach\n", "abstract": " Operational concepts in which a single operator teams with multiple autonomous vehicles are now considered feasible due to advances in automation technology. This will require that an operator be able to express a high-level intent, or goal, to the vehicle team rather than direct the actions of individual assets. Successful operator-autonomy collaboration must quickly capture the operator's intent and then portray the autonomy's trade-offs between different courses of action in an intuitive interface. This paper describes how a multi-disciplinary effort was employed in the design of a display that highlights the trade-off of autonomy-generated plans and supports the efficient allocation of assets to surveillance tasks. Our novel control station approach combines domain modeling and multi-objective optimization with innovative interfaces to enable a single operator to effectively command a team of unmanned vehicles.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["2162"]}
{"title": "Quantifying and classifying covert communications on Android\n", "abstract": " By exploiting known covert channels, Android applications today are able to bypass the built-in permission system and share data in a potentially untraceable manner. These channels have sufficient bandwidth to transmit sensitive information, such as GPS locations, in real-time to collaborating applications with Internet access. In this paper, we extend previous work involving an application layer covert communications detector. We measure the stability of the volume and vibration channels on the Android emulator, HTC G1, and Motorola Droid. In addition, we quantify the effect that our detector has on channel capacities for stealthy malicious applications using a theoretical model.
