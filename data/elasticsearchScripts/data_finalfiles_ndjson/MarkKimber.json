These techniques are commonly used in numerous applications ranging from large displacements in wind tunnel experiments to displacement measurements on the submicron scale. Projection Moir\u00e9 Interferometry (PMI) is an out-of-plane displacement measurement technique, and consists of capturing reference and deformed images of a grid pattern projected on the test object. By differencing the reference and deformed images of the projected grid pattern, a fringe pattern is generated from which the displacement field can be extracted. This computation requires calibration procedures that analyze a number of fringe patterns from known displacements to compute the fringe sensitivity constant (FSC) values. This process can be time consuming and for large-scale applications, very costly. In addition, due to the projection-oriented nature of this technique, measuring displacements in applications with non-viewable, hidden, or inaccessible reference surfaces excludes the use of PMI. In this thesis, a technique is developed which eliminates calibration procedures through implementation of virtual calibration methods, and typical PMI measurement processes are extended to include digital reference images in determining displacements from inaccessible surfaces.

{"title": "Qualitative Approaches to Understanding Coherent Structures in Turbulence\n", "abstract": " A review of several techniques is presented, with emphasis on recent developments in the mathematical treatment of the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) as applied to experimental particle image velocimetry data. The experiment in question is the classical flow past a cylinder with three distinct shapes: round, square, and hexagonal at a Reynolds number of 16000. The purpose of the study is to analyze the identification of basic structures and estimation of energy content via filtering methods. Reynolds decomposition is the method of separating the flow field into its mean and fluctuating components. Galilean decomposition uses the bulk velocity to identify small-scale vortices within the flow field. LES decomposition is analogous to a low pass filter that reveals small length scales.

{"title": "Large Eddy simulation of non-isothermal turbulent flow past a circular cylinder\n", "abstract": " Understanding the thermal mixing of coolant jets in the lower plenum of High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactors (HTGR) is very important to address certain design and safety issues. As a step towards developing an experimentally validated computational model for the lower plenum flow, turbulent flow and heat transfer around a circular cylinder is computed using large eddy simulation (LES) at three different Reynolds numbers (3000, 5900, 7400). In the range of the Reynolds number considered in this study, flow undergoes a rapid structural change with Reynolds number which significantly affects the heat transfer characteristics. The major difficulty of predicting turbulent heat transfer around a circular cylinder comes from turbulence modeling. To overcome this issue, a finite-volume solver with compressible flow formulations are used for the simulation. A sub-grid stress (SGS) model is chosen in such a way that LES can predict the physical characteristics of the flow and heat transfer. The LES results are found to be in good agreement with well-known experimental studies available in the literature. The main features of turbulent heat transfer in the subcritical regime are closely captured by LES, namely the thermal boundary layer and the sharp increase in both the mean and the rms Nusselt number in separation region. The dependence of these quantities on Reynolds number is also captured. The numerical results also confirm that the heat transfer characteristics is closely consistent with the structural change in the flow and is dependent on the Reynolds number. This research lays the groundwork needed to develop a high-fidelity\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1409"]}

The local heat transfer coefficients induced by multiple piezoelectric fans operating simultaneously in close proximity are determined experimentally. The fans vibrate close to an electrically heated stainless steel foil, and the entire temperature field is observed by means of an infrared camera. A vibration amplitude of 10 mm is considered, with the distance from the heat source to the fan tip chosen to vary from 0.01 to 2.0 times the amplitude, and the distance between the fans, or pitch, varying from 0.5 to 4.0 times the amplitude. The two-dimensional contours of the local heat transfer coefficient are compared to those observed for a single fan under similar conditions.

In conventional PMI, a tedious process of computing the fringe sensitivity coefficient (FSC), which requires moving the test object or the reference plane to known displacements, is used. We present a new technique for computing the FSC values that is called virtually calibrated projection moire interferometry (VCPMI). VCPMI is based on computer simulations of the conventional PMI process and does not require moving the actual test object or reference plane. We validate the VCPMI approach by comparing results for a flat plate and an airfoil with those made by use of other measurement methods.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1409"]}

{"title": "Towards Reconstruction of Complex Flow Fields Using Unit Flows\n", "abstract": " Many complex turbulent flows in nature and engineering can be qualitatively regarded as being constituted of multiple simpler unit flows. The objective of this work is to characterize the coherent structures in such complex flows as a combination of constituent unitary flow structures for the purpose of reduced-order representation. While turbulence is clearly a non-linear phenomenon, we aim to establish the degree to which the optimally weighted superposition of unitary flow structures can represent the complex flow structures. The rationale for investigating such superposition stems from the fact that the large-scale coherent structures are generated by underlying flow instabilities that may be reasonably described using linear analysis. Clearly, the degree of validity of superposition will depend on the flow under consideration. In this work, we take the first step toward establishing a procedure for investigating superposition. Experimental data of single and triple tandem jets in crossflow are used to demonstrate the procedure. A composite triple tandem jet flow field is generated from optimal superposition of single jet data and compared against \u2018true\u2019 triple jet data. Direct comparisons between the true and composite fields are made for spatial, temporal, and kinetic energy content. The large-scale features (obtained from proper orthogonal decomposition or POD) of true and composite tandem jet wakes exhibit nearly 70% agreement in terms of modal eigenvector correlation. Corresponding eigenvalues reveal that the kinetic energy of the flow is also emulated with only a slight overprediction.

The index matching is achieved by recirculating Drakeol\u00ae 5 oil through a closed loop system via a centrifugal pump whose heat generation does not adversely affect the refraction. Quartz is used as the solid material inside the test section to enable the index matching. Design of the system is discussed, followed by preliminary results for three rectangular slot flows that coalesce into a single channel. Particle Image Velocimetry was employed to capture the velocities in the mixing region. This configuration allows for simultaneous measurement of the flow 0.35 hydraulic diameters upstream and 3.9 diameters downstream of the outlets. The Reynolds numbers of the three channels are in the range of 1800-20000, spanning multiple flow regimes and promoting different flow physics. Results in the turbulent regime closely resembled the interaction of three confined slot jets. The non-turbulent regime shows the fluid stalling to approximately half of its inlet velocity, prompting recirculation zones near the outlet. The dominant energy contributions and momentum dissipation in the stalling region come from shear and spanwise stresses, whereas streamwise stresses dominate in other locations. It was also observed that the shear stresses decrease with increasing bulk velocities, while the spanwise stresses remained relatively constant.

LES is then performed in a small cylindrical domain around the jet, with initial and boundary conditions provided by the validated RANS results. After comparing six Sub-Filter Stress (SFS) models, the SFS model chosen for the LES simulation is a variant of the dynamic Smagorinsky model.
