{"title": "An investigation of participatory design with children-informant, balanced and facilitated design\n", "abstract": " This paper describes WeDD (Web Site Design Day), a project which brought university staff, parent helpers and school children together to design a school web site. The design process, which was modelled on participatory design, is described with reference to other work that has used a similar approach. The methods that were used to evaluate the process are described, and some general conclusions about the efficacy of the approach are presented. Difficulties with trying to work in a participatory way with children are examined. A participatory design model-the IBF model-is proposed; this defines terms for the different balances of participation. This is followed by a discussion of the variables that affect, both before and during the participatory process, the level of participation of the various categories of participant. The project environment and the skills of the participants are identified as being important in the initial positioning of a design project on the IBF model. Subject knowledge and personal security are considered to cause fluctuations within the project. The importance of controlling and monitoring these variables is discussed and further work in this area is described.", "num_citations": "169\n", "authors": ["2233"]}

This paper highlights five challenges around the ethics of the value of design and the ethics of the children's participation and presents a new tool, CHECk that deals with three of these challenges by virtue of two checklists that are designed to challenge researchers in CCI and HCI to critically consider the reasons for involving children in design projects and to examine how best to describe design activities in order that children can better consent to participate.", "num_citations": "61\n", "authors": ["2233"]}
{"title": "Requirements for the design of a handwriting recognition based writing interface for children\n", "abstract": " This paper describes how the design of a novel writing interface for children was informed by requirements gathering. The derivation of a set of system requirements from observations of children using early prototypes of the interface and from modelling the system is described, and then two methods of gathering further requirements by surveying children are outlined. The relative advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed. The children were not able to contribute to the full range of requirements necessary for a complete system, but they contributed fun requirements that the observational work failed to identify. A model of the child's relationship to interactive systems is used to discuss why this is the case.", "num_citations": "46\n", "authors": ["2233"]}
{"title": "Integrating user-centred design in agile development\n", "abstract": " Integrating user-centered design (UCD) into software development methodologies has always been a challenge. In the first two decades of UCD, structured methodologies provided a process where UCD methods could be clearly integrated, at least in principle, and thus integration challenges were not primarily due to process structures. This changed with the spread of agile software development approaches, which differ substantially from structured development. While there has been progress in combining UCD and agile approaches, many problems remain. In response to this, at NordiCHI 2014, a workshop on Integrating User Centred Design in Agile Development brought together researchers and practitioners at the leading edge of combining these two potentially complementary approaches to software development.

This paper reports on an expert review of the CHECk tool and a validating case study. Four main challenges to the CHECk tool are identified:(1) how to inform children on the research and their role herein,(2) distinguishing between project values and designer or researcher's personal values,(3) accounting for the dynamic nature and social constructedness of values in design, and (4) the emergence of values in all stakeholders including child design partners. We advocate complementing CHECk with interactive storytelling and show how this narrative can be used to not only inform participation and achieve ethical symmetry, but also to negotiate values with child design partners.", "num_citations": "30\n", "authors": ["2233"]}

It is not clear how these practices can be successfully used together in an organisation. Aims: We investigate practitioners' mitigation strategies related to the challenge of doing Agile in a non-Agile environment. Method: Strategies were collected during two studies, an online survey and an interactive workshop run at an Agile meetup and analysed thematically. Results: Strategies related to the wider organisation and not just software development. Two perspectives emerged from the data: an organisational and a change perspective. Five organisational themes were identified with Management and decision-making and Culture the two biggest themes.

Despite significant focus on distributed Agile working, remote working, when only one or two individuals are not co-located with the rest of the team, remains largely unexplored. We focus on one organisation with several such teams and investigate one in detail using distributed cognition \u2013 a theoretical framework for studying collaborative work. We present the results of a group retrospective, and a comparative analysis of collaboration in the team, taking the contrasting perspectives of the remote worker and his co-located teammates. The analysis shows substantial differences in three aspects: virtual artefacts; information flow; and the primacy of structure and facilities provided by collaborative platforms. Platforms that support meaningful collaboration and engagement for the remote worker, and create parity between all members of the team are crucial to integrating capability.", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["2233"]}

Fifty children, from a UK primary school, participated in a design activity to specify a serious game for children in Uganda. The children\u2019s designs were analyzed and were shown to have effectively incorporated learning and gaming aspects. Based on these designs a serious game was developed. This new serious game and the commercial game Angry Birds were both evaluated for fun with 25 children in Uganda, using the Fun Toolkit and the This or That method.

{"title": "Children designing serious games\n", "abstract": " It has long been a tradition in interaction design to involve users in order to better capture user needs and preferences. The involvement of children as informants and design partners is well documented for interaction design but its use in serious games design is much less reported. Where children are contributing to the design of learning materials their knowledge may be incomplete. This paper reports on the organisation of, and the deliverables from, a participatory design activity with children in which they were charged with designing a game for children in another continent. The study found that children predominantly focussed on the learning aspects of the serious game during their design activities but they were also able to consider some of the game aspects. They demonstrated understanding of instruction but were less aware of some of the other aspects of learning including feedback on understanding. Involving children in the design of the serious game lead to some nice insights that were included in the game that was subsequently built and shipped. Taking M\u00fcller\u2019s third place in HCI as inspiration, the paper concludes with some reflection for how to involve children in serious game design.", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["2233"]}

Our results are that interpretivist research and the use of qualitative methods have increased significantly and that only 22 percent of included papers generate theory or concepts according to a narrow definition of theory based on Walsham\u2019s classification; the majority of WG 8.2 researchers thus appear reluctant to generalize to theory from their findings, particularly when undertaking interpretivist research.

At UCLAN discrete mathematics is taught as part of a module called \u201cProblem Solving\u201d. This module is delivered to all the first year undergraduates whether they are doing degree, foundation degree or HND courses.The experience of the lecturers teaching on this module is that every year a fair number of first year students express dismay at having to study maths \u201cagain\u201d. The reasons for this negative response vary, but are often that students feel maths is not core to their learning experience, that they came to university to study computing not maths, that they haven\u2019t done maths for ages and have (happily) forgotten much of it, and anyway, how is it relevant to computing?", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["2233"]}

However, adoption is not the end of the story. Agile requires on-going change and commitment in order to become sustainable and embedded within teams and organisations. This study explores current perceptions of post-adoptive agility. We asked 50 practitioners 'what does agile sustainability mean to you?'. Analysis of practitioner comments identified four themes: being completely agile, independent, focused on business value and need, and consistent across time. Post-adoptive agile is an under-researched area, there is inconsistent use of terminology, and there is a gap between practitioners' and researchers' perceptions about what is important for sustaining agile.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["2233"]}
{"title": "Motivating computing students\n", "abstract": " Motivation is an important part of success in higher education (HE). For students it is vital to maintain personal motivation in order to make the effort of studying worthwhile. For lecturers it is important to take account of diverse student motivations in order to run successful courses. Factors that are increasingly having an impact on student motivation are: the large numbers of students studying computing; the diversity of intake; the changing requirements of employers in the computing industry; and students\u2019 need to earn money to support themselves. All these factors have an impact on the way students approach their studies. According to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) there were 60,605 computing undergraduates in the academic year 1995/6. By the year 2000/1 that figure had risen to 89,070, an increase of nearly 47 per cent (www. hesa. ac. uk). The two major factors influencing this growth in numbers have been the general trend of widening participation in HE and the growth of the computing industry. One consequence ofthis dramatic growth in student numbers has been that the first-year undergraduates encountered in the classroom are an increasingly diverse group of individuals who have embarked on computing degrees with widely differing backgrounds, interests and motivations. Dealing with diversity affects almost every aspect of teaching, from designing syllabi to choosing assessments and running tutorials. Understanding and addressing student diversity is therefore a vital part of successfully managing the increasing numbers of students coming into the subject.

Until recently, it was predicted that, despite current patterns of climate change, and the increasing world population, there would be several decades with food surplus and low prices ahead (2). At the same time, there was an expectation that, as knowledge about what constitutes a healthy diet for different individuals increased, dietary patterns would shift to \u201coptimal nutrition\u201d, which could potentially take account of individual differences. Nevertheless, food and nutrition insecurity continue to be important issues globally.A key challenge is to develop food production systems which are able to support the sustainable increase of the global supply of nutritious and safe food to meet the needs of a world population expected to reach 9 billion or more people by 2050, while preserving a safe living space for humanity by avoiding dangerous environmental change (3). Climate change is negatively impacting food production (4, 5), and may also have negative impacts on the nutritional quality of food and on food safety. Moreover, the agriculture, land use and the forestry sectors contribute almost one quarter of total greenhouse gas emissions, but also have a high potential for mitigation of emissions and for biological carbon storage in soils (2).

{"title": "Crossing Boundaries: Patients\u2019 Experiences of using a Diabetes eHealth System\n", "abstract": " This thesis is concerned with exploring patients\u2019 experiences of using a diabetes eHealth system. The context of the study is the growth of interest in eHealth systems that focus on patient needs, alongside increasing home computer use and the rising incidence of chronic diseases, such as diabetes.  I aim in this thesis to make a novel contribution to knowledge about how eHealth technology is experienced by patients with diabetes. The study takes the form of a qualitative enquiry into the use of a diabetes eHealth system by a group of patients and their healthcare practitioners at a primary care general practice in Northern England. Using symbolic interactionism as a methodological perspective and taking elements from grounded theory the study produces a theoretical framework based on a thematic analysis of participants\u2019 descriptions of their experiences of using the eHealth system.  A diabetes eHealth system was designed and built for the study, and 38 patients were recruited from a single GP practice using purposive sampling. Participants used the system for six months and were interviewed at the beginning, middle and end of the study period. Issues of surveillance, automation, endorsement and interaction influenced use and experiences of the system. Results from the study indicate that participants use and perceive the eHealth system as part of their diabetes management experience.  My thesis is that the eHealth system is a boundary structure through which boundary objects, such as electronically formatted blood glucose readings, are created and shared across different social worlds. The eHealth system crosses the boundary\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["2233"]}

Leman [1] has shown that if computing students can be encouraged to improve their mathematical skills a positive effect is seen in other subject areas. At UCLAN we have noticed that many students who perceive themselves to have weak maths skills are reluctant to spend as much time as necessary to improve, and consequently often score poorly in the end of year tests.
