A critical examination and comparison of past times\u2019\u2018traditional\u2019 and present\u2010day \u2018web\u2010based\u2019 development shows that contemporary ISD can be seen as an accentuated evolution \u2013 rather than a revolution \u2013 of well\u2010known challenges and solutions. On this basis, (1) diversity; (2) knowledge; and (3) structure are identified as inherent and interrelated problems, while the practices for coping with these three challenges are (a) organization and specialization; (b) constant verbal communication and negotiation; and (c) pragmatic application of certain development methods and methodical concepts.

SPI initiatives often experience difficulties and problems when the improvements are going to be implemented and institutionalized in the organization's daily practices. In this paper we discuss the learning processes that take place in SPI based on an analysis of three industrial SPI projects. A finding of the study is that an SPI project needs to pay attention to the creation of both tacit and explicit knowledge in order to improve practices. A second finding suggests that implementing and institutionalizing improvements should take its starting point at the group level and involve the development projects.

They require considerable investments in personnel, time and money and impact just about every aspect of software firms. The group charged with conducting an SPI project has, however, little formal authority to influence or force software professionals to engage in SPI work or to define and implement changes. The SPI literature suggests that successful SPI initiatives depend on strong commitment from top management. But what should the SPI group do if management support is weak? In this paper, we present an analysis of how an SPI group can use alliances to obtain influence and succeed when management support is weak. Our study is based on a 3-year longitudinal field study of SPI change initiatives at Denmark Electronics.

We examine how informal organizational issues interact with the formal specification and construction process to affect the way software systems are actually made. We maintain that the software development process and its result are determined not only by the quality of the requirements definition process or the systematic application of best software engineering practices, but also by the formal and informal relations between user and developer organizations, management structures and work practices in software development, and so on; in short, by the organizational context of software work.", "num_citations": "34\n", "authors": ["1369"]}

In this paper World Wide Web technologies and web-based systems are used as an example of this problem. Many researchers see these technologies and systems as so different from traditional information technologies and systems that they require new approaches to systems development. We critically examine these claims in the light of the historical evolution of the practice and research of information systems and show that characteristics frequently associated with web-based systems, such as changing skill needs and more complex organization of development projects as well as a broader and more diverse user population aren\u2019t radically new developments, but extensions and variations of fundamental dynamics which have characterized IS since the inception of the discipline. We thus argue that current research ought to look at past experiences for advice on how to cope with present problems. And we urge IS researchers to be concerned with the underlying, persistent, problems in information systems development instead of the surface problems manifest in the fad or technology \u2018of the day\u2019.", "num_citations": "27\n", "authors": ["1369"]}

Furthermore, we demonstrate-for the first time-Python booted on NXT using an embedded Python project. Lego Mindstorms NXT is based on an ARM7 micro processor, and it comes with open source C code. There now exists a number of firmware replacements which permit programming NXT with different languages. One of these possibilities are Java, and we combine that solution with an Eclipse plugin for team programming in Java. We demonstrate the system and provide reasons why it is worthwhile to do this in computer science classes. Python is a popular scripting language. It is often used in relation to a larger operating system, and rarely as an operating system itself.

This, however, may jeopardize process visibility and manageability as well as product quality. Therefore, modern software development organizations need to find ways to install flexible development processes without sacrificing project overview and control. This paper reports experiences from a real life project that used timeboxing as the basic organizing principle in an incremental and iterative design and construction process. The project\u2019s experiences show that such a process is indeed both flexible and manageable but that it requires periodic planning and replanning, explicit concern for coordination and synchronization activities, high process discipline and organizational readiness\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1369"]}

One approach to balance these paradoxical demands is the adoption of twofold organizational structures often referred to as bimodal IT. While the IS literature has made recent advances in the description and analysis of bimodal organization structures, we still lack a deeper understanding of the inner workings within bimodal IT organizations and the potential tensions between traditional and agile IT. To address this research gap, we adopt IT governance mechanisms as an analytical framework to study two bimodal IT organization cases, one at a law enforcement agency and the other at an automotive company. We analyze data collected through fourteen semi-structured interviews using grounded theory techniques. We first identify challenges associated with the implementation of and the coordination within organization\u2019s bimodal IT organizations. We then identify the structural, procedural, and relational governance mechanisms used within these organizations and elucidate how they relate to the categories of challenges. Finally, we identify and describe five novel governance paradoxes of bimodal IT organizations that emerged as core concepts from this research.

Thus, we use contemporary literature on Web development as an example of research that argues a need for new concepts, methodologies and tools as a result of fundamental changes in ISD.
