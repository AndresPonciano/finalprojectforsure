When designing new distributed software systems, the above broad requi-ments and their translation into implementations are typically addressed by partial complementarities and overlapping technologies and this situation gives rise to significant software engineering challenges. Some of the challenges that may arise are: determining the components that the distributed applications should contain, organizing the application components, and determining the assumptions that one needs to make in order to implement distributed scalable and flexible applications, etc.", "num_citations": "320\n", "authors": ["1470"]}

While its capabilities to describe patterns existing (or hidden) in data have been well studied, its capabilities to prescribe new patterns in response to specific requirements have not been much explored. The latter, prescriptive capabilities help planners address a class of spatial problems called \u201ccartographic allocation\u201d (Tomlin, 1990), which concerns allocation of subsets (or zones) of a cartographic space to certain uses according to one or more criteria.

Given the nature of SPL, the importance of requirements engineering (RE), a core stage in software development lifecycle, is trickier as SPLs pose more complex challenges than development of a \u2018single\u2019product. Goal models in RE represent requirements and intentions of a software system-to-be. They play an important role in the development process of SPL. Indeed, in the domain engineering phase, goal models guide the development of SPL variability by providing the rationale, while they are used for the SPL configuration in the application engineering phase. Feature Modeling can be used as a crucial technique to identify commonalities and variabilities in an SPL. However, the specific perspective shown by Feature Models (FM) is not sufficient to express all the characteristics and constraints of an SPL. Thus, using a goal-oriented approach, such as i*, to complement (and help defining) feature models would improve such models enhancing the meaning and justification of features. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature, to generate feature models from goal models.

With a set of US following the templates of this previous model, the link between the US and SA concepts is systematically studied and a transformation process is proposed. The SA can decline agent behaviors aligned with requirements and organizational beh aviors. Moreover, requirements (thus US) are subject to evolution through agile iterations; the SA can evolve with these changes in a semi-automatic manner.

Many parameters might be changed until the obtention of a satisfactory visualization. The visualization process is a very complex exploration activity and, even for skilled users, it can be difficult to arrive at an effective visualization. We propose the construction of a visualization prototype to assist users and designers throughout the stages of the visualization process, and the integration of such process with a reasoning procedure that allows the configuration of the visualization, based on the entailed conclusions. We are working on a formal representation of the Visualization field. We aim to establish a common visualization vocabulary, include the underlying semantics, and enable the definition of visualization specifications that can be executed by a visualization engine with ontological support. An ontological description of a visualization should be enough to specify the visualization and, thus, to generate a runtime environment that is able to bring that visualization to life. The visualization ontology defines the vocabulary. With the addition of inference rules to the system, we can derive conclusions about visualization properties that allow to enhance the visualization, and guide the user throughout the entire process toward an effective result.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1470"]}

It is based on a Markov-chain model of random walk through the graph. This method is applied on the architecture of a Multi Agent System (MAS), in which each agent can be considered as a node and each interaction between two agents as a link. The model assigns transition probabilities to the links between agents, so that a random walker can jump from agent to agent. A quantity, called the average first-passage time, computes the average number of steps needed by a random walker for reaching agent k for the first time, when starting from agent i. A closely related quantity, called the average commute time, provides a distance measure between any pair of agents. Yet another quantity of interest, closely related to the average commute time, is the pseudoinverse of the Laplacian matrix of the graph, which represents a similarity measure between the nodes of the graph. These quantities, representing dissimilarities (similarities) between any two agents, have the nice property of decreasing (increasing) when the number of paths connecting two agents increases and when the\" length\" of any path decreases. The model is applied on a collaborative filtering task where suggestions are made about which movies people should watch based upon what they watched in the past.

To consolidate both perspectives, this paper proposes a process framework called GI-Tropos to extend I-Tropos allowing to align requirements-driven software processes with IT governance.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1470"]}
{"title": "Quality-aware agent-oriented information-system development\n", "abstract": " In the modern world, where most activities are computerized, ill-built software could result in disasters. Major flaws keep being spotted in software for space rockets, train schedulers, bank transactions, internet services, etc. In many cases, integrated information systems, although built with a \u201ccomplete\u201d set of required functions, still do not work adequately in certain circumstances. Such reality forces software developers to widen their focus beyond just functionality and to more effectively take into account quality concerns like security, availability, accuracy, etc. Many research results as well as practical techniques have been introduced, but there are still many areas where existing solutions are not effective enough. This thesis addresses issues about improving the treatment of quality concerns in the context of multiagent systems and of goal-based requirements engineering. The originality of our approach relies on a new definition of quality requirements that are presented as constraints bearing on the classical concepts of hard-goals and soft-goals. We extend the goal decomposition tree with a new node type for quality requirement and three new link types: elicitation, qualification, and contribution. High-level business goals (hard-goals and soft-goals) at root nodes are decomposed into lower-lever system hard-goals, at leaf nodes, possibly constrained by some elicited quality requirements. Quality requirements that have not been taken care of in this decomposition process can be controlled at system runtime through a catalogue of design patterns for...", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1470"]}
{"title": "Semantics-based color assignment in visualization\n", "abstract": " The active use and manipulation of visual representations makes many complex and intensive cognitive tasks feasible. A visual representation is able to convey relationships among many elements in parallel and it provides an individual with directly observable memory. A successful visualization allows the user to gain insight into the data, that is, to communicate different aspects of the data in an effective way. Even with today's visualization systems that give the user a considerable control over the visualization process, it can be difficult to produce an effective visualization. To obtain useful results, a user has to interrogate the visualization very precisely. A strategy to improve this situation is to guide the user with the selection of the parameters involved in the visualization. This paper presents the initial effort dedicated to achieve a visualization system that assists the user in the configuration and preparation of the visualization by considering both the semantic of the data and the semantic of the stages through all the visualization process. In this article we present a visualization system for file hierarchies where color assignment is made by a reasoning process through the use of an ontology. This work sets the way forward to integrate the visualization process with a reasoning process and configure a visualization based on the reasoner s results.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1470"]}

Software development also follows this trend and, as a consequence, new techniques are appearing over the years. Among those we find services oriented computing and component based development. The first gives the adequate structure and flexibility required in the development of large industrial software developments, the second allows recycling of generically developed code. This paper is at the borders of these paradigms and constitutes an attempt to integrate components into service-oriented modelling. Indeed, when developing huge multi-actor application packages, solutions to specific problems should be custom developed while others can be found in third party offers.

The only conditions are that the source language is declarative, representable as a tree and that the control flow of the source code is straightforward. Therefore, this notation could be reused for other types of UI not analyzed in this thesis, such as XUL or cHTML.

{"title": "An Intentional Perspective on Partial Agile Adoption.\n", "abstract": " Nowadays, the agile paradigm is one of the most important approaches used for software development besides structured and traditional life cycles. To facilitate its adoption and minimize the risks, different meta-models have been proposed trying to unify it. Yet, very few of them have focused on one fundamental question: How to partially adopt agile methods? Intuitively, choosing which practices to adopt from agile methods should be made based on their most prioritized goals in the software development process. To answer this issue, this paper proposes a model for partial agile methods adoption based on intentional (ie, goal) perspectives. Hence, adoption can be considered as defining the goals in the model, corresponding to the intentions of the software development team. Next, by mapping with our goal-based model, suitable practices for adoption could be easily found. Moreover, the relationship between roles and their dependencies to achieve a specific goal can also be visualized. This will help the software development team to easily identify the vulnerabilities associated with each goal and, in turn, help to minimize risks.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1470"]}

{"title": "A Methodological Framework for Multi-Fidelity Sketching of User Interfaces.\n", "abstract": " Designing the right User Interface (UI) of an Information System the first time is very unlikely to occur. Instead, UI design is recognized as a process that remains intrinsically open, iterative, and incomplete. Most designers consider hand sketches on paper as one of the most effective means to represent the first drafts of a future UI. This kind of unconstrained approach presents many advantages: sketches can be drawn at anytime, it is fast to learn and quick to produce, it lets the sketcher focus on basic structural issues instead of unimportant details, and it encourages creativity. The idea of developing a computer-based tool for sketching UIs naturally emerged from these observations. Such a tool would extend the advantages provided by sketching techniques by: easy creating, deleting, updating or moving of UI elements, thus encouraging typical activities in the design process such as exploratory design, checking and revision. In this thesis, we introduce SketchiXML, a multi-platform interactive application that enable designers and end users to sketch user interfaces with different levels of fidelity and support for different contexts of use. The results of the sketching are analyzed to produce interface specifications independently of any context. These specifications are exploited to progressively produce one or several interfaces, for several contexts of use. Moreover, this tool is integrated in a complete prototyping solution that can provide effective support to most software development methodologies.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1470"]}

{"title": "Linking goals to aspects\n", "abstract": " In RE models such as goal-oriented models, a complex system is directly described in terms of its purposes, which makes its functionality much easier to understand and to reason as compared to code-level implementations. Part of the difficulty in maintaining a stronger correspondence between requirements and code is possibly due to the sufficient modularization capabilities of traditional architectures where many functionalities do not exist in distinct modular entities. This paper reports on an investigation of how and where some distinct design requirements lead to crosscutting concerns when decomposed into code in goal models such as KAOS. We begin by matching our past experience in aspect discovery at the code level with a detailed requirements modeling of the same architecture in KAOS. The discovered patterns are validated in an independent project where the requirements modeling and the aspect identification are separately conducted. We observe that satisfying OR-decomposed subgoals in the KAOS model typically leads to tangled implementations, and agents responsible for multiple OR-refined goals should be implemented in the aspect-oriented manner.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1470"]}

{"title": "Towards a goal-oriented framework for partial agile adoption\n", "abstract": " The agile paradigm is used today for software development and project as an alternative to structured and traditional heavier life cycles. Different meta-models have been proposed trying to unify agile methods. Yet, very few of them focus on agile partial method adoption. Intuitively, choosing which practices to adopt from agile methods should be made based on their most prioritized goals in the software development process. The paper answers this issue by building a goal-oriented meta-model where each agile concept is seen as a goal to achieve and explaining how goal modeling can help the software team to partially adopt agile methods. This will also make it easier to identify vulnerabilities associated with each goal and minimize risks.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1470"]}

{"title": "A Usage-Based Unified Resource Model.\n", "abstract": " Most of the time engineering methodologies focus on the modeling of functional and non-functional requirements of the system-to-be with no or poor representation of resource elements. Resources are nevertheless central in most industrial domains and do have an important impact onto the performance and feasability of software requirements. That is why we propose, in this paper, an ontology for resource representation centered on its Usage ie, the concepts of functionality for Resource Objects and competency for Resource Agents. This ontology does not tackle the particular problem of service level agreement which is a complementary dimension but rather focuses on how resources can be represented and handled at runtime. Heterogeneous resources can thus be represented in a unified manner within the context of \u201cresource-intensive\u201d domains where information systems are developed. Moreover, it could also be used to develop a specific heterogeneous monitoring system with, for instance, the agent technology so that it acts for interoperability purposes. The ontology proposal is applied on a case study in the industrial context of a steel industry, namely CARSID where lots of resources are collaborating to achieve defined services. The purpose is to show the applicability of the ontology in an industrial context where resources play a central role for the information system.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1470"]}

The KES conferences attract a wide range of interest. The broad focus of the c-ference series is the theory and applications of computational intelligence and em-gent technologies. Once purely a research field, intelligent systems have advanced to the point where their abilities have been incorporated into many conventional appli-tion areas. The quest to encapsulate human knowledge and capabilities in domains such as reasoning, problem solving, sensory analysis, and other complex areas has been avidly pursued. This is because it has been demonstrated that these abilities have definite practical applications. The techniques long ago reached the point where they are being exploited to provide commercial advantages for companies and real beneficial effects on profits. KES 2004 provided a valuable mechanism for delegates to obtain a profound view of the latest intelligent systems research into a range of-gorithms, tools and techniques. KES 2004 also gave delegates the chance to come into contact with those applying intelligent systems in diverse commercial areas.

{"title": "Fhorganization; New Organization Model for Multi-Agent Systems\n", "abstract": " Nowadays, multi-agent systems are frequently used to control big components of IT systems. Since this systems are big and use and produce big data, the control of multi-agents systems by people is not beneficial anymore. So, self-organization, in which agents can organize themselves, is proposed as a resolution. In a self-organizing multi-agent system, the desired behavior of system is emerged based on local behavior of agents. But, emergence is not always as we desired and can result in a manner that we do not want the system to have it. On the other hand, self-adaptation is a centralized and top-down process, in which a central control loop can monitor, analyze, plan and execute decisions on a controlled element. Therefore, a combination of self-organization and self-adaptation can help the system stay self-organized while the bad results of emergence are controlled by self-adaptation features. Recently, combining selforganization and self-adaptation features is becoming a trend. In this paper, we tried to propose an organization model for self-organizing multi-agent system based on self-adaptation features to control emergence.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1470"]}

{"title": "Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation Methodology using Social-Level Characteristics: A Case Study on Self-Adaptive Smart Grid and Military Domain Systems using Tropos\n", "abstract": " Agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) is used to model of market and social phenomena by utilizing agents' fine-grained behaviors and interactions that cannot be implemented in a conventional simulation. However, ABMS represents irrational agents and hinders the achievement of individual or overall goals since ABMS is based on agent-based software, which follows the principle of rationality at the knowledge level [1]. This problem was solved in the agent-based software engineering (ABSE) field by using behavior laws for the social level [2]. However, they still do not propose the specific development methodology for how to develop the social level in a systematic way. Therefore, in order to propose agent-based modeling and simulation methods that reflect the behavior laws of social level characteristics, our study used the Tropos that can combine ABSE and social behavior laws for the presentation of concrete tasks and deliverables for each development step by step. In addition, the proposed method will be specified through experiments with specific application examples and case studies on the self-adaptive smart grid and the military domain system.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1470"]}

The overall motivating problem that drove to, and that unites the various contributions presented in this thesis is how to better inform decision making and guide it towards decisions that will increase the quality (as evaluated both by the engineer and the stakeholders) of the information system being engineered.Topics in two key related areas are therefore addressed. First, boundedly rational individuals cannot take engineering decisions by accounting for all information that may be, or actually is available to them. As their information processing abilities are limited and their perception biased, it is necessary to filter the available information to a manageable level, and to bring it to a format that facilitates the rigorous reasoning invested in decision making.

Requirements-driven software processes, such as (I-) Tropos, are development processes using high-level social-oriented models to drive the software life cycle both in terms of project management and forward engineering techniques. To consolidate both perspectives, this paper proposes a process framework called GI-Tropos including meta-model formalization to extend I-Tropos allowing to align requirements-driven software processes with IT governance.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1470"]}
{"title": "Building a rationale diagram for evaluating user story sets\n", "abstract": " In agile methods, requirements are often represented on the basis of User Stories (US) which are short sentences relating a WHO, WHAT and (possibly) WHY dimension. They are by nature very operational and simple to understand thus very efficient. Previous research allowed building a unified model for US templates associating semantics to a set of keywords based on templates collected over the web and scientific literature. Since the semantic associated to these keywords is mostly issued from the i* framework we overview in this paper how to build a custom rationale diagram on the basis of a US set tagged using that unified template. The rationale diagram is not an i* strategic rationale diagram strictly speaking but it uses parts of its constructs and visual notation to build various trees of relating US elements in a single project. Indeed, the benefits of editing such a rationale diagram are to identify the EPIC stories in a set of US and group them around common themes. The paper shows the feasibility of building the rationale diagram, then points to the use of these consistent sets of US for iteration content planning. To ensure the US set and the rationale diagram constitute a consistent and not concurrent whole, an integrated Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tool supports the approach.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1470"]}

Towards an OSLC\u2010based approach to support Model\u2010Driven Requirements Engineering\n", "abstract": " The present paper debates the concept of requirement in the contexts of software and systems engineering. Requirements are usually extracted from documents, stakeholders and existing systems generating a natural language specification. On the other hand system models are designed to define system behavior and to validate and verify the system against a specification. That is why requirements, as a basic unit of specification, must be aligned and linked to a model with the aim of supporting the whole development lifecycle of any product or service. Although some Model\u2010based systems engineering (MBSE) methodologies have tried to bridge the gap between natural language and models moving from document\u2010centric to model or requirement\u2010based approaches, there is still a lack of interoperability and integration between requirements and models that prevent a proper (re) use of requirements in the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1470"]}

The modern intelligent service mobile robot (ISMR), viewed as an every day life \u201cpartner\u201d, has entered a critical period of industrialization. It not only takes place of people to do dirty, dull and dangerous (3D) work, but also becomes people\u2019s friend and chummy assistant in the future. But how to design robot system scientifically and efficiently is a hot issue in robotics because the design of robotic system is often so complex that it is difficult to seek underlying problem-solving approach. The lack of integrated methods with reuse approaches leads robotic developers to reinvent the wheel each time a new project starts (Chella et al., 2010). Until today, the methods for designing intelligent robot may be concluded two approaches which are \u201cTrial and error \u201cand \u201cRepeated optimization\u201d(Nehmzow, 2003). So many researches have begun to study in this area from both robotic science and engineering. To sum up, there are mainly two research ideas which are \u201cseek for systematic and scientific methodology\u201d and \u201cseek for general system architecture\u201d for striving to achieve \u201cmethods reuse\u201d and \u201carchitecture reuse\u201d. As for seeking for systematic and scientific methodology, there are many arguments in robotics. In the same time, there are two research thoughts for designing intelligent robot (Joseph et al., 2004), one is \u201ctop-down\u201d which is based on symbolic processing; and the other is \u201cbottom-up\u201d which is based on principles from biology.

{"title": "A multi-agent architectural pattern for wrapping off-the-shelf components\n", "abstract": " The benefits of off-the-shelf component-based software development are essentially lower cost and shorter development time. Nevertheless, the integration of components is seldom trivial. Indeed, developers can face black boxes or products that are poorly documented and specified. Mismatches between components functionality and system requirements are then difficult to address. To deal with such issues, this paper proposes to use an architectural pattern for wrapping software components. To that extend, we develop a multi-agent system architecture \u2013 the wrapper \u2013 that offers an abstraction layer over the components. The architecture is in charge of the functional decomposition, coordination and delegation of the client requests to the components at disposal.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1470"]}

Such an approach is nevertheless always driven by milestones rules on requirements or design models while it could be applied onto the evolution of a Multi-Agent System (MAS) among the software project. We propose in this paper to define a MAS acting as a wrapper for COTS-based software development and to monitor its evolution through an iterative template. Rules are evaluated by project managers so that the MAS evolves on the bases of agents decisions with human monitoring. The paper formalizes some relevant concepts in the perspective of a component-based MAS development, it defines what happens at transaction level as well as a series of constraints to properly monitor the project evolution.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1470"]}

Most of these focus on a functional and non-functional evaluation to select one or more products needing to be customized for specific requirements. Developing on the basis of components is however constraining for the software users as well as for software developers willing to provide tailored solutions. In this paper we propose a component-based development process using a two level components selection procedure with feedback loops. Analysts select one or more components to fulfill the identified goals and soft goals then a multi-agent system (MAS) managing the business logic delegates them the functional execution. Runtime feedback allows analysts to take decisions for component customization, abandonment or the inclusion of new ones so that equilibrium is found by round tripping between the analysis\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1470"]}

{"title": "Y frame: a modular and declarative framework for software engineering\n", "abstract": " This paper describes Yframe, a modular and customizable framework supporting the process of both object-oriented method engineering and OO software engineering. We show how a declarative language like Prolog can be used to design such a tool including a sophisticated Graphical User Interface. We explain the essential role of a declarative programming approach in developing this framework, illustrating its advantages and facilities.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1470"]}
{"title": "Endoscopic management of injured bowel using the automatic stapler\n", "abstract": " Bowel injury is a rare but potentially fatal complication of laparoscopy if it is unrecognized at the time of the procedure. Once a bowel injury is identified, it must be repaired by either laparoscopy or laparotomy. The Endo GIA 30 stapler is effective for achieving large-vessel hemostasis and facilitating laparoscopic procedures, and is reported safe for laparoscopic hysterectomy. It was used successfully in two women to repair extensive bowel injuries.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1470"]}

{"title": "ER+ to Relational Mapping and its Prolog implementation for Case Shell\n", "abstract": " This paper develops a method that maps an enhanced Entity-Relationship (ER+) schema into a relational schema and normalizes the latter into inclusion normal form (IN-NF). Unlike classical normalization that characterizes individual relations only, IN-NF takes interrelational redundancies into account. We describe a Prolog implementation of the method, developped in the context of a CASE shell for software development.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1470"]}
{"title": "Laparoscopic treatment of ectopic pregnancies\n", "abstract": " The incidence of ectopic pregnancies has increased fourfold since 1970.1 Early diagnosis and treatment has reduced mortality and morbidity, and probably improved subsequent fertility. Advances in ultrasound, particularly transvaginal imaging, and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) detection have considerably improved our diagnostic capability. Laparoscopy is an integral part of the diagnostic scheme and recently has become the preferred surgical therapeutic method. Depending on the patient\u2019s desire for future fertility and extent of disease, conservative as well as radical surgery may be performed laparoscopically.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1470"]}
{"title": "Contracts and Contract Analogs in Organizational Contexts\n", "abstract": " According to a composite of several well-esteemed English dictionary definitions, the word context has two primary meanings. Most basically, it is defined from a linguistic viewpoint as \u201ca group of words of interest that either precede or follow another word or passage, usually influencing its meaning or effect.\u201d(Aside: In linguistic semantics, the phenomenon that the interpretation of an expression depends on the context in which it is used, is quite evident in the case of deictic pronouns (eg, this, that, those, etc.), but other expressions can also be context dependent, such as many or big, because what counts as many or big always depends on the context in which these words are used (a big mouse may be a small animal)[DKR1996].) Additionally, from a nonlinguistic viewpoint context is defined as \u201ca set of circumstances, situation, domain, setting, or facts that surround or include some entity, event, subject, topic of interest, and so forth.\u201d In [B1998] Mario Bunge, the learned philosopher, defines context as \u201cany domain or universe of discourse in which a given item belongs, or in which it is embedded.\u201d Bunge continues,\u201cMore precisely it may be characterized by an ordered triple: C=< Statements, Predicates occurring in these statements, Domain of such predicates>. Further, a context is a system proper only if its component propositions have one common referent\u2014for in this case they are related by the equivalence of sharing a nonempty reference class. This relation is said to be the structure of a context.\u201d Thus, context is a conceptual system\u2014one that is a composition of concepts and constructs. In our opinion it\u2019s not a bad idea at all to consult [B1998\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1470"]}
{"title": "Generic Approach for Goal driven Software Requirement Risk Management\n", "abstract": " An analysis of many software program assignments in between 2011, as well as 2014, shows an interesting pattern. Author identified areas which may lead to project failure which are weak requirement analysis and management, weak cost calculating, weak handling of requirement change requests, weak milestone monitoring and requirement gold plating habit. By comparison, prosperous local software program assignments tended to be much better than onsite software development and management. Maybe the most interesting part of most of these many problem areas can be that each is regarding project managing instead of using technical personnel. We focused over the impact of software requirement change requests and requirement gold plating while dealing with onsite project assignments. Author also evaluated new model to avoid global software engineering requirement failure, which in turn curtails the estimated time and budget with client satisfaction. In this paper, Author discuss the ideas that support requirements reflection as a means to articulate some of the outstanding research challenges.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1470"]}
