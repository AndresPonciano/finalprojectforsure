{"title": "Loneliness, depression and sociability in old age\n", "abstract": " Background:The elderly population is large in general and growing due to advancement of health care education. These people are faced with numerous physical, psychological and social role changes that challenge their sense of self and capacity to live happily. Many people experience loneliness and depression in old age, either as a result of living alone or due to lack of close family ties and reduced connections with their culture of origin, which results in an inability to actively participate in the community activities. With advancing age, it is inevitable that people lose connection with their friendship networks and that they find it more difficult to initiate new friendships and to belong to new networks. The present study was conducted to investigate the relationships among depression, loneliness and sociability in elderly people.Materials and Methods:This study was carried out on 55 elderly people (both men and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "514\n", "authors": ["448"]}

Borate glasses contain planar BO3 groups as structural units, rather than tetrahedral SiO4 groups. The oxygen atoms are, as in SiO2, again connected to two network-forming atoms, in case of boron. The radial distribution analysis describes the B2O3 glass structure as consisting of boroxol rings, that is, planar rings containing three boron atoms and three oxygen atoms. The network forming of the B2O3 and the SiO4 is affected with the addition of some metal cation additives Pb, Zn, Cd, and so forth. These additives also work as a network modifier and a nucleating agent for crystallization of glass. Therefore, the optical properties of the borate glasses have been changed significantly.", "num_citations": "262\n", "authors": ["448"]}

But today's VQA models can not read! Our paper takes a first step towards addressing this problem. First, we introduce a new\" TextVQA\" dataset to facilitate progress on this important problem. Existing datasets either have a small proportion of questions about text (eg, the VQA dataset) or are too small (eg, the VizWiz dataset). TextVQA contains 45,336 questions on 28,408 images that require reasoning about text to answer. Second, we introduce a novel model architecture that reads text in the image, reasons about it in the context of the image and the question, and predicts an answer which might be a deduction based on the text and the image or composed of the strings found in the image. Consequently, we call our approach Look, Read, Reason & Answer (LoRRA). We show that LoRRA outperforms existing state-of-the-art VQA models on our TextVQA dataset. We find that the gap between human performance and machine performance is significantly larger on TextVQA than on VQA 2.0, suggesting that TextVQA is well-suited to benchmark progress along directions complementary to VQA 2.0.", "num_citations": "151\n", "authors": ["448"]}

Low levels of ROS inside the cells are required for normal functioning of the cell, which regulate signaling mechanisms involved in mitosis and apoptosis; excess of ROS production may cause oxidative stress leading to damage in vital cellular molecules, namely cytosolic lipids, proteins, and DNA. In the situation of intracellular redox imbalance, molecules of cells are altered by ROS leading to pathogenic state. It is to be noted that ROS is not only known to be involved in tumor induction and progression processes but also enhances tumor cell radiosensitivity. The level of ROS-mediated oxidative stress is linked to cellular radiosensitivity.

Some scientific evidence also supports its pro-male fertility properties; however, the mechanism of its action is not yet clear. The present study aimed at demonstrating spermatogenic restorative efficacy of MP and its major constituent L-DOPA (LD), and finding the possible mechanism of action thereof in a rat model.   Methodology/Findings Ethinyl estradiol (EE) was administered at a rate of 3 mg/kg body weight (BW)/day for a period of 14 days to generate a rat model with compromised spermatogenesis. MP and LD were administered in two separate groups of these animals starting 15th day for a period of 56 days, and the results were compared with an auto-recovery (AR) group. Sperm count and motility, testis histo-architecture, level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), apoptosis, peripheral hormone levels and testicular germ cell populations were analysed, in all experimental groups. We observed efficient and quick recovery of spermatogenesis in MP and LD groups in comparison to the auto-recovery group. The treatment regulated ROS level, apoptosis, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), recovered the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and the number of testicular germ cells, ultimately leading to increased sperm count and motility.   Conclusion/Significance M. pruriens efficiently recovers the spermatogenic loss induced due to EE administration.

Remodelling of muscle extracellular matrix is pivotal in these processes. This turnover is mediated via members of the family of enzymes known as matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and inhibited by the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP). The aim here was to investigate the in vivo pattern of expression and distribution of MMPs and TIMPs in masseter muscle of humans with both normal and abnormal facial forms. Masseter muscle biopsies were taken from 10 patients, four with long-face syndrome and six normal controls as confirmed by cephalometry.

Pythia is built with a plug-&-play strategy at its core, which enables researchers to quickly build, reproduce and benchmark novel models for vision & language tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA), Visual Dialog and Image Captioning. Built on top of PyTorch, Pythia features (i) high level abstractions for operations commonly used in vision & language tasks (ii) a modular and easily extensible framework for rapid prototyping and (iii) a flexible trainer API that can handle tasks seamlessly. Pythia is the first framework to support multi-tasking in the vision & language domain. Pythia also includes reference implementations of several recent state-of-the-art models for benchmarking, along with utilities such as smart configuration, multiple metrics, checkpointing, reporting, logging, etc. Our hope is that by providing a research platform focusing on flexibility, reproducibility and efficiency, we can help researchers push state-of-the-art for vision & language tasks.Over the last few years, we have seen impressive progress in vision & language tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Image Captioning powered by deep learning. Most of the state-ofthe-art networks build upon the same techniques for generating the representations of text and images and for the network\u2019s layers. However, the devil lies in the details, hence reproducing results from the state-of-the-art models has often been non-trivial. This in-turn hinders faster experimentation and progress in research.

{"title": "Speed-Breaker Early Warning System.\n", "abstract": " There is evidence to support the claim that speed-breakers can cause accidents and injury. When a vehicle approaches a speed-breaker at a speed greater than some threshold velocity, the risk of accident or injury is substantial. Speed-breakers are inconspicuous in low visibility conditions, like at night, or when there is fog, rain or snow. This problem is particularly acute in developing countries where speed-breakers don\u2019t always accompany warning signs. We propose an early warning system that uses a smartphone based application to alert the driver in advance when the vehicle is approaching a speed-breaker. In addition, the application constantly monitors the smartphone accelerometer to detect previously unknown speed-breakers. The proposed detection algorithm is easy to implement because it does not require accelerometer reorientation. This is one of the main contributions of our work since previous approaches have used expensive computations to reorient the accelerometer. The algorithm was evaluated using 678 Km of drive data, which involved 22 different drivers, 5 different types of vehicles (bus, auto rickshaw, cycle rickshaw, motorcycle, and car), and 4 smartphones. The results are very promising and can be further improved by aggregating detection reports from multiple smartphones.", "num_citations": "42\n", "authors": ["448"]}

Therefore, performance characteristics of the new indigenous ParaHIT f test (Span diagnostic Ltd, Surat, India) was determined among ethnic tribal population in four districts of different transmission potential in central India to assess whether this rapid diagnostic test (RDT) could be widely applied as a diagnostic tool to control malaria. Beyond diagnosis, the logical utilization of RDTs is to monitor treatment outcome. A finger prick blood sample was collected from each clinically suspected case of malaria to prepare blood smear and for testing with the RDT after taking informed consent. The blood smears were read by an experienced technician blinded to the RDT results and clinical status of the subjects. The figures\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "38\n", "authors": ["448"]}

Petri nets (PNs) have been widely used for verification and validation of real-time systems. However, the existing approaches do not consider the critical aspects of reliability and safety that include nonliveness, deadlock, stability, and throughput. In this paper, we introduce these as metrics of reliability and safety for safety critical real-time systems. This paper also proposes an innovative methodology for analysis of nonliveness, deadlock, stability, and throughput metrics by linear programming using PN modeling. The application of the proposed techniques has been validated by applying it on four different safety critical systems, running in six nuclear power plants and shown for reactor protection system.", "num_citations": "37\n", "authors": ["448"]}

Variabilities in toxicity of these oils, which seem to be related to their aromatic and asphaltic contents, were observed. Diesel and furnace oil, due to greater concentrations of aromatics, were more toxic than other oils. The toxic effects of asphaltic fractions were similar to those of aromatics. The study showed that the effects of a particular fraction vary from oil to oil. Therefore, toxicity of an oil cannot be correctly predicted by mere estimation of its various fractions. Lower concentrations of Assam crude stimulated photosynthesis and respiration of blue-green algae (cyanobacteria); however, green algae did not show such a response.

This debate has recently taken a fresh turn with the apparent emergence of the \u201cNew Economy\u201d in the U.S.  The U.S. has not only experienced fast growth of ICT industries but there has also evidently been widespread successful adoption of ICT technology in many areas of the economy.  It is suggested that a major reason for the U.S. lead in this area, and the apparent European and Japanese lag, has been the very important enabling and stimulating role of the stock market.", "num_citations": "27\n", "authors": ["448"]}

Grid scheduling is a technique by which resources are efficiently utilized to meet user demands. On the user perspective minimization of job turnaround time is the main challenge. Most of the minimization algorithms are implemented in homogeneous resource environment. In this paper a scheduling algorithm is presented to minimize average turnaround time in heterogeneous resource environment. This algorithm is based on greedy method which is used for totally dynamic grid environment where the jobs arrive at different time interval. The turnaround time of each job is minimized individually to minimize the average turnaround time of all submitted jobs in a time slot.", "num_citations": "26\n", "authors": ["448"]}
{"title": "Massive hydraulic fracturing unlocks deep tight gas reserves in India\n", "abstract": " Tight gas fracturing was pioneered in North America in the 1970's and 1980's, and also has a relatively long history in Germany. In the rest of the world, however, massive fracturing for production from tight gas formations (ie k< 0.1 mD) has been very rare, due mainly to poor economics, rather than lack of opportunities. A massive oil field was recently discovered in Rajasthan (northwest India). The field development would require significant amounts of natural gas for heating and processing of the waxy oil to be produced. The most economical solution to provide sufficient gas in this remote desert location was to produce it from a deeper formation discovered in the same area. The majority of the gas is contained in a volcanic section of basalts and felsics. A fracturing campaign was performed in 2006 on three deep gas wells to evaluate the post-stimulation production increase from a number of different horizons, with\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "26\n", "authors": ["448"]}

However, availability of such data is not always possible for specific tasks such as speaker recognition where collection of large amount of data is not possible in practical scenarios. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to identify speakers by learning from only a few training examples. To achieve this, we use a deep neural network with prototypical loss where the input to the network is a spectrogram. For output, we project the class feature vectors into a common embedding space, followed by classification. Further, we show the effectiveness of capsule net in a few shot learning setting. To this end, we utilize an auto-encoder to learn generalized feature embeddings from class-specific embeddings obtained from capsule network. We provide exhaustive experiments on publicly available datasets and competitive baselines, demonstrating the superiority and generalization ability of the proposed few shot learning pipelines.", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["448"]}

{"title": "Sequential enhancer sequestration dysregulates recombination center formation at the IgH locus\n", "abstract": " Immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) genes are assembled by DNA rearrangements that juxtapose a variable (VH), a diversity (DH), and a joining (JH) gene segment. Here, we report that in the absence of intergenic control region 1 (IGCR1), the intronic enhancer (E\u03bc) associates with the next available CTCF binding site located close to VH81X via putative heterotypic interactions involving YY1 and CTCF. The alternate E\u03bc/VH81X loop leads to formation of a distorted recombination center and altered DH rearrangements and disrupts chromosome conformation that favors distal VH recombination. Cumulatively, these features drive highly skewed, E\u03bc-dependent recombination of VH81X. Sequential deletion of CTCF binding regions on IGCR1-deleted alleles suggests that they influence recombination of single proximal VH gene segments.

During the rainy season, photosynthesis is generally impaired because of the reduction in light intensity and duration brought about by the excessively cloudy weather. This constitutes a major constraint to rice productivity and production in the tropics (Yoshida 1981, Singh 2000). The solar radiation requirements of a rice crop differ at various growth phases (Yoshida and Parao 1976). Shading during the vegetative growth phase slightly affects rice growth and yield, while shading during the reproductive phase has a pronounced effect on sink capacity (spikelet number per panicle and per unit land area). During ripening, shading markedly reduces grain yield because of a spurt in spikelet sterility (Yoshida 1981).", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["448"]}

In micro- and nano-scale systems, non-Fourier effects involving coupled diffusion and wavelike propagation of heat can become important. An extension of Fourier's law to account for such effects leads to a Jeffreys-type model for heat transfer with two relaxation times. We propose a new Thermal Parameter Identification (TPI) method for obtaining the Jeffreys-type thermal parameters from molecular dynamics simulations. The TPI method makes use of a nonlinear regression-based approach for obtaining the coefficients in analytical expressions for cosine and sine-weighted averages of temperature and heat flux over the length of the system.

When donor plants age were 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old, they were coppiced and maintained in the dark for etiolation, while a parallel set was kept in normal light in an open environment. After 20 days, coppice shoots were made into SNCs which were cultured under intermittent mist for rooting. Stock-plant etiolation significantly increased percent rooting, shoot and root length, and number of roots per SNC, but callusing at the base of SNCs decreased. Etiolated SNCs have shown 71.7% rooting, whereas for controls (non-etiolated), the response was 41.7%. The effect of aging on callusing, rooting and sprouting of etiolated and non-etiolated coppice shoots cuttings varied widely. Aging of donor plants decreased rooting and sprouting capability in SNCs and increased callusing at the base of etiolated cuttings.

Higher protective efficacy of MIP against TB as compared to BCG provoked the efforts to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying MIP mediated protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb). Autophagy, initially described as a cell survival mechanism during starvation, also plays a key role in host resistance to M.tb. Virulent mycobacteria like M.tb, suppresses host autophagy response to increase its survival in macrophages. Since mycobacterial species have been shown to vary widely in their autophagy-inducing properties, in the present study, we examined the autophagy inducing efficacy of MIP and its role in MIP-mediated protection against M.tb. MIP was found to be potent inducer of autophagy in macrophages. Induced autophagy was responsible for reversal of the phagosome maturation block and phagolysosome fusion inhibition in M.tb infected macrophages, which ultimately lead to significantly enhanced clearance of M.tb from the macrophages. This is an important study which further delineated the underlying mechanisms for significant immunotherapeutic activity observed in TB patients / animal models of tuberculosis, given MIP therapy along with chemotherapy.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["448"]}

{"title": "Growth and instability in sugarcane production in Uttar Pradesh: a regional study\n", "abstract": " Uttar Pradesh commands the maximum area under sugarcane. The state ranks first having 47.6 per cent of the total sugarcane acreage (1999-2000) though it contributes only 38.5 per cent of total production. The yield too is lower, ie, 57.4 tonnes per hectare compared to the national average of 70.9 tonnes per hectare. A knowledge of the past trends in area, production and productivity, both aggregated at the state level and disaggregated at the regional level, helps the planner in deciding the growth rate for different regions and for the state as a whole and in devising suitable strategies such as the kind and degree of incentives to be offered to the growers to achieve the targeted growth rate. Further, besides the growth rate the problem of instability in sugarcane production has engaged the attention of scientists and planners in the recent past. The production of sugar too in Uttar Pradesh recorded sharp fluctuations over time. The primary reason for the instability in sugar production is the uncertainty in supply of raw material, ie, sugarcane which has itself recorded wide fluctuations. In view of the above observation, it is felt necessary to carry out empirical investigation that can reveal the growth rate and instabilities in sugarcane production in different regions of Uttar Pradesh.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["448"]}

Concentrations of 10 and 20% were repeated after 10 days (10th May) on the respective cvs. The effect of urea was apparent within two days by leaf scorching followed by abscission. Single application of 25 and 30% urea virtually eliminated all the summer flower and flower buds within 12 days. This resulted in drastic reduction of rainy season fruit yield. Among the treatments, trees which received single treatment with 25% urea produced higher yield (115.5 kg/tree) as compared to control (34.3 kg/tree) in cv. Sardar, while in cv. Allahabad Safeda, two applications of 10% urea had the highest fruit yield (111.45 kg/tree) closely followed by single treatment with 20 percent urea (109.2 kg/tree). Urea\u2013N concentrations in the leaves increased rapidly after foliar application. The maximum concentration was obtained at 4 days after application (except additional spraying of 10 and 20% urea) and after that concentration in the tissues declined to its original value within 32 days.

In this study, P22 phage tail spike proteins (TSPs) have been immobilized on Si surfaces for optimized capture of host Salmonella enteric serovar Typhimurium. It was then demonstrated that roughening of the Si surface before the TSP immobilization improves the bacterial capture 2-fold compared to a flat Si surface. Coarse, medium, fine and superfine size ridges were patterned on the Si surface using block copolymer layer and plasma etching and each surface was functionalized by TSPs for bacterial capture. The capture density increased with decreasing size of the ridge until it reached an optimum for fine ridges; the capture density decreased when the surface ridges were superfine and deep. This method shows a 22-fold and 3-fold increase in bacterial capture density compared to a Cys-and a His6-tag based oriented TSP immobilization, respectively. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a surface protective layer to prevent non-specific binding of bacteria and E. coli cells were used as control to demonstrate the specificity of recognition.

{"title": "Lipid peroxidation in leukaemia.\n", "abstract": " OBJECTIVE: Free radicals have been implicated in the pathogenesis of leukaemias, so the degree of lipid peroxidation was studied as a marker of disease activity in patients of leukaemia. METHODS: Lipid peroxidation product malonyldialdehyde (MDA) was estimated in serum from 30 patients of leukaemia by thio-barbituric acid reaction before and after chemotherapy. There were 10 patients of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), 5 with acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL), 15 with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) of which 10 were in chronic stable phase and 5 in blast crisis. Twenty healthy age and sex matched individuals served as control. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in MDA levels in AML and ALL patients and serum MDA levels were higher in the active phase of disease than in remission. We observed a direct correlation between peripheral leucocyte counts and MDA levels. In CML, MDA levels were higher, more so in the patients who were in blast crisis. Patients of CML blast crisis who achieved remission showed a significant decrease in MDA levels as compared to those without remission. CONCLUSION: We observed a significant increase in MDA levels in active phase of acute as well as chronic leukaemia than those in remission. The proposed mechanism for high MDA is that myeloid cells are a major source of superoxide and other oxygen metabolites which lead to lipid peroxidation. MDA estimation in leukaemia can be of help in detecting type of leukaemia, response of therapy, and to predict the chances of relapse.", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["448"]}

The fruit extract of H. isora have been reported to exhibit free radical scavenging activities, ability to induce toxicity in tumor cells and protection to normal cells. However, most of the reports are limited to in vitro systems. Therefore, comprehensive laboratory studies and clinical trials are warranted to ratify the indigenous medicinal claims on H. isora plant. This paper is aimed to contribute to better understanding and in establishing a base for the development of H. isora related herbal formulation (s) that may enable us fight against many diseases including cancer.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["448"]}

{"title": "Automatic filling management system for industries\n", "abstract": " In this era of industrialization, technological revolution/automation is fast shrinking the need of humans to assist machinery. Looking at the current industrial scenario, birth of new products and private brands is sharply raising the competition among industries. In order to hold out the promise of timely delivery of product, high tech automated production is essential. The concept of automation is so versatile that it can bring radical development in almost every field. Keeping view of present requirements, this paper proposes a filling management system for industries which is a complete application of automation. The notable thing about this project is its high degree of flexibility and its remote control. A prototype of commercial bottle filling system, controlled using programmable logic controller (PLC) is proposed and the whole process is monitored using supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA). This system provides the provision of mixing any number of liquids in any proportion.

Each case of tubercular meningitis was matched by age and neighbourhood with 2 controls from the community. Thirty-seven cases of tubercular meningitis were matched with 74 controls and thus 37 triplets were analysed. ODDS RATIO between BCG vaccinated and non vaccinated individuals for acquisition of tubercular meningitis was 11.3. This gives 84 per cent efficacy of BCG vaccine in the prevention of TB meningitis under the field conditions prevailing in Delhi. Paired matched analysis of tubercular meningitis with the control group 1 and 2 separately revealed the ODDS RATIO to be 9.5 and 15 respectively. The corresponding BCG vaccine efficacy worked out were 90 and 93 per cent respectively. Authors suggest that this method of evaluating BCG vaccine efficacy is fairly reliable and cost effective. This methodology could be further simplified by using hospital patients as control and be introduced to evaluate BCG vaccine efficacy in different areas with reference to its role in preventing tubercular meningitis under the programme of immunisation.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["448"]}

Rib stability has been assessed here by way of assessing factor of safety (FOS), a ratio of the strength of rib to stress on it. Earlier formulations for rib stability when applied to case studies gave very low FOS value suggesting significant ground control problems, which were contrary to the field observations. This has necessitated the need to revisit the concept of rib stability. The stress coming on the rib is estimated with the use of numerical modeling technique using the FLAC3D software. The methodology of assessing rib-stability with the help of suggested rib-strength formulation has been validated at eight Indian coal mines. The outcome of this study finds relevance and importance in ensuring underground coal liquidation with improved safety and conservation.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["448"]}

The layer structure and HEMT device has been irradiated cumulatively with \u03b3-ray dose of the order of 16 kGy. The x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of irradiated sample shows a lowering in full width at half maximum (FWHM) values along (102) and (002) planes in comparison to the pristine sample due to partial annealing effect. A decrease in the in-plane biaxial stress from 1.20 GPa to 0.75 GPa has been observed. Raman spectrum analysis also corroborates the reduction in stress post \u03b3-ray irradiation. Edge dislocation density is reduced from 2.7\u00d7 10 8 cm\u2212 2 to 1.75\u00d7 10 8 cm\u2212 2 whereas the screw dislocation density remains almost unaffected.

{"title": "Virtual machining\n", "abstract": " CNC machines. While the graphic simulation available in most CAM packages show only motions, the VM systems can depict the material removal as well. In a VM system, one starts with the virtual model of the work piece and as machining progresses, the geometry of the work piece gets updated by subtracting the volume swept by the cutter during each motion. It is possible to model even the machine tool and fixture elements so that even collisions can be detected.Since the user gets a realistic visual feel of the machining process in a VM system, it helps in predicting errors on the computer screen itself. This system can automatically do the verification both to ascertain the safety of machining (detection of collision etc.) and geometric conformance to design. It is also possible to optimise the technological parameters (spindle speed and feed rate) from the geometric characteristics of the material removal process.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["448"]}

Some attempts have been made to assess the impact of oils and hydrocarbons on algae which are primary producers in aquatic habitats (O'Brien and Dixon 1976; Vandermeulen and Ahern 1976). Although a majority of petroleum oils are toxic to algae, some are not (Coffey et ai. 1977; Fabregas et al. 1984). This difference is mainly due to great variability in chemical composition of test oils. This fact may be linked with the observation of Singh and Gaur (1990) that certain oils, or similar fractions of different oils, differ in their toxicity. Therefore for the proper management of aquatic ecosystems, it becomes necessary to explore the toxicity and mechanisms of commonly used petroleums such as diesel.

The delay can occur at various levels. Delay in initiation of treatment after diagnosis is mostly due to health system failure and has immense programmatic implications. It has not been studied extensively in the Indian setting.Methods: The authors did a cohort analysis of all TB patients initiated on treatment from two primary health centres (PHCs) at Ballabgarh Health and Demographic Surveillance System between January 2007 and December 2014. Diagnosis and treatment of TB in the study area was done as per the protocol envisaged in the national program. Information related to demography, details of diagnosis and treatment of TB and outcome of treatment were extracted from the TB register. Delay in initiation of treatment after diagnosis was considered if the gap between diagnosis and treatment was greater than 7 days. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were done to find the association of various factors with delay in initiation of treatment after diagnosis.Results: Out of 885 patients, 662 patients started treatment for pulmonary TB. Mean time interval between diagnosis and initiation of treatment was 8.95 days. Only 57.7% of pulmonary TB patients were started on treatment within 7 days of diagnosis, and an additional 24.5% were started on treatment 8-14 days after diagnosis.

Additionally, we observe that dx genetically interacts with eiger during wing development, and these two proteins, Dx and Eiger, colocalize in the cytoplasm. Our analysis reveals that Dx is involved in the cytoplasmic relocalization of Eiger from the cell membrane, thereby influencing Eiger-mediated JNK\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["448"]}

Motivated by the same, we propose a philosophy to recognize speakers. Inside of our investigation, obtaining speech signal, analysis of spectrogram, neutralization, extraction of speaker specific features for recognition, mapping of speech using Novel Vector Quantization (NFVQ) is presented. NFVQ is particularly suitable for colossal arrangement of information and yield discourse mapping. Furthermore Speaker Recognition by utilizing NFVQ Model additionally will be exhibited in this paper. During feature extraction, traditional triangular shaped bins have been replaced by Gaussian shaped filter (GF) and Tukey filter (TF) to calculate Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). This work performs an experimental evaluation of three simple modelling techniques namely, Fuzzy c-means, FVQ2 and NFVQ. Among these NFVQ shows significant improved performance compared to Fuzzy c-means and FVQ2. For about 10 s of training and testing speech data of speakers the efficiency for NFVQ, FVQ2 and Fuzzy c-means are 98.8%, 73.33, and 8, respectively, for a set of 630 speakers taken from the TIMIT database.

Infection typically spreads through contaminated food and water and leads to severe, watery diarrhea. EPEC attaches to the intestinal epithelial cells and directly injects virulence factors which modulate multiple signaling pathways leading to host cell dysfunction. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the onset of diarrhea are poorly defined. A major target of EPEC is the host cell tight junction complex which acts as a barrier and regulates the passage of water and solutes through the paracellular space. In this review, we focus on the EPEC effectors that target the epithelial barrier, alter its functions and contribute to leakage through the tight junctions.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["448"]}

Shareholder activists and their proponents claim they function as a disciplinary mechanism to monitor management and are instrumental in mitigating the agency conflict between managers and shareholders. We find statistically meaningful empirical evidence to reject the anecdotal conventional wisdom that hedge fund activism is detrimental to the long term interests of companies and their long term shareholders. Moreover, our findings suggest that hedge funds generate substantial long term value for target firms and its long term shareholders when they function as a shareholder advocate to monitor management through active board engagement.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["448"]}

There are number of keypoints detection algorithms available such as SIFT, SURF, GLOH etc., in this paper we are using SIFT and SURF for the purpose of feature extraction and forgery detection. We also compare the performance of the two approaches in terms of speed and accuracy. Multiple cloning of region is also taken care of using iterative method in matching.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["448"]}
{"title": "A NEW METHOD IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF NOISE AND VIBRATION CHARACTERISTICS OF AUTOMOTIVE DISK BRAKES IN THE LOW FREQUENCY DOMAIN.\n", "abstract": " Noise and vibration characterization is an important benchmark to reduce brake noise. Brake noise and vibration measurement is commonly done on an actual vehicle or on a brake dynamometer. A full scale brake dynamometer takes into account the attached mass which resembles the mass of a quarter scale vehicle. This paper proposes a testing method which eliminates the need for attached masses. This is achieved through the scaling of the brake system parameters to accommodate the loss of mass and produce similar conditions to those in actual braking. The measurement of noise and vibration is measured simultaneously and an FFT is performed to identify the frequencies of noise and vibration. An experimental modal analysis (EMA) is done to obtain the frequencies which the brake system tends to produce as a validation to the proposed method. It is shown that through this method the noise and vibration characteristics of the brake system and the unstable frequencies can be identified.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["448"]}
{"title": "Glycogenomics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n", "abstract": " Glycogen is an important energy store of almost all living organisms. It is an alpha linked polymer comprised of thousands of glucose units. In bacteria it is usually synthesized when carbon ions are in excess in the growth medium and its synthesis helps for the survival of the bacteria under such nutritional conditions. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis), accumulates glycogen during the adverse condition such as reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates, low pH, nutrients and other vital element starvation for their survival in the host. Glycogen also plays a very important role in the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis. The biosynthesis of glycogens is mediated by glycosyltransferases enzyme which can be divided into two families; glycogen transferase (GT) 3 and glycosyltransferases GT 5. Regulation of glycogen metabolism in bacteria involves a complex mechanism, involving several synthase enzymes such as glycogen synthase A (glgA), glycogen branching enzyme (glgB), and catalytic enzyme (glgC). Another enzyme known as glycogen phosphorylase (glgP), removes extra units of glucose from the non-reducing ends of the glycogen molecule. Several works have recognized role of glycogen in mycobacterial pathogenesis, in the recent years. Trehalose-dimycolate (TDM) and trehalose-monomycolate (TMM) present in the cell wall are indeed a precursor of mycolic acid of mycobacteria, which plays an important role in its invasion and pathogenesis. This review focuses on various cycles and mechanisms involved in the glycogen synthesis in M. tuberculosis and its role in pathogenesis.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["448"]}

{"title": "Acute pancreatitis and acute respiratory distress syndrome complicating Plasmodium vivax malaria\n", "abstract": " DISCUSSIONIt is well-known fact that P. falciparum malaria is associated with grave complications such as hypoglycemia, acidosis, cerebral malaria, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute pancreatitis. The severe malaria is caused by erythrocyte sequestration leading to organ failure. Plasmodium vivax malaria most of the time presents only as acute febrile syndrome. It is also called as benign tertian malaria, but now it seems to be no longer benign1. There are few case reports of P. vivax malaria presenting as ARDS2\u20134, pulmonary edema5, and bronchiolitis obliterans6. The sequestration and cytoadherance was a characteristic feature of P. falciparum malaria but now there is evidence that the same phenomenon also occur in P. vivax infection7, 8. Small airway obstruction, gas exchange alteration, increased phagocytic activity and accumulation of pulmonary monocytes are the suggested mechanisms3. Clinical data from patients strongly indicate that P. vivax can cause sequestration related and non-sequestration related complications as result of accumulation of pulmonary monocytes and intravascular inflammatory responses9. These factors are, thus, also responsible for ARDS in the cases of P. vivax malaria. In our institute we have noticed an increasing trend of complicated infection by vivax malaria against the conventional view that complicated malaria is mostly caused by P. falciparum malaria. The total number of P. vivax malaria cases diagnosed by microscopy and antigen testing were 906 during the year 2011\u201312 and according to our hospital register, out of these cases complicated by thrombocytopenia were only\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["448"]}

The chapter begins with a discussion of the origin, evolution, and phylogeny of the Ganges River dolphin as well as river dolphins in general. Also included are descriptions of past and present distribution patterns of the Ganges River Dolphin along with its anatomical structure, including primitive characters and morphological characters of interest. In the second section of the chapter we elaborate on Ganges River dolphin population surveys we conducted within a 500 km section of the Ganges River in the state of Bihar during 2005 to 2007. Both upstream and downstream surveys were performed three times per year. A significantly greater number of Ganges dolphins were observed per kilometer upstream compared to downstream surveys (1.28 versus 1.0 respectively) and the mean number of dolphins observed per upstream survey ranged from 559 to 808. Our results also support spatial and temporal variation of the Ganges dolphin population with for example a greater number of animals in confluence areas. These survey results are similar to those obtained from other Ganges River surveys that used similar methods. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the Ganges River dolphin's conservation status and major threats to its existence.

Radiolabelling of hIgG (> 98%) was achieved instantly when mixed with 99Tcm-pertechnetate. The preparation was sufficiently stable in serum at 37 degrees C. The competitive binding assay and gel electrophoresis of the native and reduced hIgG did not show any measurable loss in immunoreactivity and intactness due to its reduction. There was no significant decrease in the radiolabel of labelled hIgG when incubated with diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (DTPA)(50-fold), in contrast with about 9% loss of the radiolabel by treating it with a similar concentration of cysteine. Blood clearance of labelled hIgG in rabbits was biphasic with about 78 min and 8 h as T1/2 of the fast and slow phases. Biodistribution of the radiotracer in mice at 4 h showed its uptake by liver (10.2%), kidneys (5.39%), intestines (7.33%) and muscles (3.9%), which altered to 5.63, 3.20, 4.03 and 6.73%, respectively, at 24 h.

Evolution of membrane potential for considered models is studied in terms of stationary state probability distribution (SPD). Stationary state probability distribution of membrane potential (SPDV) for considered neuron models are found asymptotically similar which is Gaussian distributed. In order to investigate the effect of membrane potential delay, rate code scheme for neuronal information processing is applied. Firing rate and Fano-factor for considered neuron models are calculated and standard LIF model is used for comparative study. It is noticed that distributed delay increases the spiking activity of a neuron. Increase in spiking activity of neuron in DDF is larger for hypo-exponential distributed delay function than gamma distributed delay function. Moreover, in case of hypo-exponential delay function, a LIF neuron generates spikes with Fano-factor less than 1.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["448"]}

{"title": "Speed control of 3-phase Induction motor fed through direct matrix converter using GSPWM technique with unity input power factor\n", "abstract": " This paper illustrates the method of speed control of three phase Induction motor using V/F control method which is fed through the direct matrix converter. To make the input power factor unity, the rectifier side of the direct matrix converter is controlled through GSPWM technique. The main advantage of using the direct matrix converter is that the dc-link storage is removed in the proposed one which makes the system rugged, robust and maintenance free. Apart from that, the use of GSPWM technique has drastically reduced the switching losses as explained. The controlling is also efficiently improved and hence the phase current waveform obtained is sinusoidal as desired with less harmonic content. Also, the input power factor obtained with the proposed technique comes out to be unity which definitely improves the power quality fed to the Induction motor.

Estimates of population mean utilising auxiliary characters have been discussed in one stage successive sampling by J. A. Sastri (1970). In this paper an attempt has been made to provide minimum variance unbiased linear estimates of (i) the population mean on the most recent occasion (ii) the change in the population mean from one occasion to another and (iii) an overall estimate of population mean overall occassions, for a two stage design in which primary stage units are partially replaced and the second stage units in the retained primaries have been kept fixed.

Numerous and wider range of possible methods with better nutritional emphasis and enhanced functionality of dairy foods were emerging. Super Critical Fluid Extraction (SCFE) is one amongst the processes which is currently becoming popular in modifying different food products to produce new ones. This SCFE gained prominence as an alternative to green technology in the food processing industry. It is a fluid phase extraction processing method which operates in between a gas and liquid and induces solubilization of solutes in a base food material. In this method, supercritical fluids most commonly CO\u2082 is used as a solvent to separate one selective component from the base food material. SCFE can be varied for different foods upon altering the two factors, ie, pressure and temperature or both. The products obtained in milk and dairy processing with use of SCFE had a higher shelf life and acceptable sensorial properties with minimal loss of quality attributes. In this review, some studies related to the potential of SCFE and its microbial inactivation, milk fat analysis, milk fat fractionation and fat solubility, extraction of cholesterol, vitamins, flavours, fat and applications of SCFE technology in dairy products and by-products more specifically in butter, cheese, whey cream and buttermilk were discussed briefly.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["448"]}

De-trapping of charge carriers is one of the prominent reasons behind the kink effect. The commonly observed non-monotonic behavior of kink pattern is analyzed under two different device operating conditions and it is found that two different de-trapping mechanisms are responsible for a particular kink behavior. These different de-trapping mechanisms are investigated through a time delay analysis which shows the presence of traps with different time constants.

The Chanavada micro-watershed is part of Jhakham, Gomti catchment covering an area of 1475 ha in Girwa block of Udaipur district in southern Rajasthan. The morphometric analysis of the watershed reveals that the watershed is 4th order, elongated in shape having mixed drainage pattern. The value of mean stream length (Lsm) varies from 0.59 to 8.67 may be due to variation in slope and topography. The stream length ratio showed an increasing trend in the length ratio from lower order to higher order indicating their mature geomorphic stage.

In vitro germination of the seeds of Patwa was achieved successfully after incubation for 10 -15 days and plantlets up to a height of 5 -7 cm with profuse rooting were observed after incubation for 7 weeks in hormone free MS medium. This in vitro germination totally reduced contamination that used to occur in the explant taken from the field. Callus induction and proliferation were observed in leaf explants after 15 -20 days of incubation in MS medium containing 2 -4, D (9.06 \u03bcM) alone or in combination with 2 -4, D (9.06 \u03bcM) + 2-iP (7.38 \u03bcM). Shoot regeneration was achieved from 2 months old callus explant in MS medium supplemented with BA (17.6 \u03bcM) + GA3 (1.0 \u03bcM). Shoot multiplication was also achieved from cotyledonary node of M. pellita in MS medium supplemented with Kinetin + GA3 (4.6 \u03bcM + 1.0 \u03bcM) or BA (13.2, 17.6 \u03bcM) + GA3 (1.0 \u03bcM) after 30 -45 days of incubation. IBA (4.9 \u03bcM) was more effective in root regeneration from micro shoots. The plantlets after acclimatization over a period of 1 month were further hardened in a polyhouse for two months. On the basis of available literature this is the first and significant study regarding the comparative effect of different PGRs on in-vitro propagation of Meizotropis pellita by using different explants and their subsequent effect on rooting.

{"title": "Modelling cored wire injection in steel melts\n", "abstract": " Cored wire injection is an essential feature of liquid steel processing. An estimation of the time for melting of the wire sheath (casing) and the subsequent release of the filling material cannot be done without resorting to an elaborate mathematical model due to the complexity of the heat transfer from the bath to the wire. In particular, the formation of a solid shell around the wire and the consequent lowering of the heat transfer needs to be addressed accurately. A mathematical model developed for calculating the melting time of the casing at the Research & Development Division of Tata Steel describes the freezing and melting process during the travel of the cored wire in the steel bath. The model has been validated against both published information as well as plant data. However, owing to the complexity of obtaining a direct validation in the operating plant, a novel indirect method has been adopted. Several new findings with respect to the casing thickness, wire diameter and the speed of injection have been obtained. It has been shown that the impact of different grades of liquid steel on the melting behaviour of the cored wire both on account of different superheat as well as the melting temperatures of the solidifying shells, is significant. In order to ensure that the wire releases powder at the same depth, the casing thickness of the wire used for injection into low carbon grade steel needs to be twice as much compared to that required for a high-carbon grade steel. Apart from providing deeper insight into the melting behaviour of cored wire, the model has also helped in formulating new specification of cored wire for Tata Steel.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["448"]}

Such devices harvest energy from ambient sources such as solar energy or vibration energy (from machines) and use it for sensing the environmental parameters and further processing them. Given that the rate of energy consumption is more than the rate of energy production, it is necessary to frequently halt the processor and accumulate energy from the environment. During this period it is mandatory to take a checkpoint to avoid the loss of data. State of the art algorithms use software based methods that extensively rely on compiler analyses. In this paper, we provide the first formal model for such systems, and show that we can arrive at an optimal check-pointing schedule using a quadratically constrained linear program (QCLP) solver.

{"title": "Matrix games with interval-valued 2-tuple linguistic information\n", "abstract": " In this paper, a two-player constant-sum interval-valued 2-tuple linguistic matrix game is construed. The value of a linguistic matrix game is proven as a non-decreasing function of the linguistic values in the payoffs, and, hence, a pair of auxiliary linguistic linear programming (LLP) problems is formulated to obtain the linguistic lower bound and the linguistic upper bound of the interval-valued linguistic value of such class of games. The duality theorem of LLP is also adopted to establish the equality of values of the interval linguistic matrix game for players I and II. A flowchart to summarize the proposed algorithm is also given. The methodology is then illustrated via a hypothetical example to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed theory in the real world. The designed algorithm demonstrates acceptable results in the two-player constant-sum game problems with interval-valued 2-tuple linguistic payoffs.

During islanding the distribution generator gets disconnected from the grid while still being energized. It should be detected as fast as possible in order to prevent the distribution generator from getting damaged or to ensure the safety of the personnel working. The islanding detection makes use of system parameter to detect islanding at the time of occurrence. In this paper a passive islanding detection method based on ripple content of voltage at the point of common coupling is being used to differentiate between islanding and non-islanding conditions. A threshold level is set upon the ripple content of voltage at the point of common coupling and islanding is detected whenever the threshold level is exceeded for some certain period of time.

Against this background, this study explores some of the perceptions of Hindu and Muslim graduate students on the conflict between freedom of expression and religious intolerance in India. Conceptually, the author approaches the tussle between freedom of expression and religion by applying a contextual approach of secular-multiculturalism. This study applies qualitative research methods; specifically in-depth interviews, desk research, and narrative analysis. The findings of this study help demonstrate how to manage conflict between freedom of expression and religion in Indian society, while exploring concepts of Western secularism and the need to contextualize the right to freedom of expression.

Researchers have proposed several methods and tools that have an ability to give a prognosis for the failure of a computer-based system. These tools and methods are classified into three main approaches: model-based, data-driven, and experience-based prognostics. Wherever sufficient real data is available, the data-driven approach is appropriate, which can be transformed into behavior models using Hidden Markov Models, which fall in a subclass of Bayesian networks. In a Bayesian framework, the estimates of reliabilities of components of a computer-based system are updated using operational profile data as new information of reliability of one or more node becomes available for the identification of robustness of a system.

Several mechanisms underlie this equation, but endothelial dysfunction has been implicated as the final common pathway by several studies. Endogenous nitric oxide (NO) is one of the principal molecules mediating normal endothelial vasodilation. This study was aimed at ascertaining the effects of smoke and non-smoke tobacco, both of which are commonly used by Indians, on the serum NO levels. Materials and Methods: A total of 208 type 2 diabetic patients attending the diabetes clinic were enrolled in this study. Data on age, gender, smoking, and tobacco chewing were collected, and the serum levels of NO determined using nitrate reductase and Griess Reagent which converts nitrite to a deep purple azo compound. The amount of the azochromophore accurately reflected the amount of NO in the samples. Results: The mean value of serum NO in smokers was 54.92 \u03bcmol/L, as compared to 60.60 \u03bcmol/L in non-smokers. The mean value of serum NO in tobacco chewers was 57.32 \u03bcmol/L and in tobacco non-chewers was 60.61 \u03bcmol/L. In this study, a near-significant association was found between the low serum levels of NO in smokers as compared to nonsmokers. But there was no significant association of serum NO levels in tobacco chewers and non-tobacco chewers. Conclusion: In this study, the difference in effects of different forms of nicotine usage on the NO levels was assessed, as it provides an insight into the mechanism of the effects of oral versus inhaled forms of nicotine use.

The Drosophila compound eye shows two-tier dorsoventral (DV) planar polarity. At the individual ommatidium level, the eight photoreceptors in each unit eye form a dorsoventrally asymmetric cluster. At the level of eye field, hundreds of ommatidia in the upper and lower halves of an eye are uniformly polarized dorsally or ventrally, respectively. This results in DV mirror symmetries about the equator. The uniform orientations of photoreceptor clusters over long distance in the eye field provide an excellent model for studying the genetic basis of long-range planar polarity. Ommatidial DV polarity can be detected in third instar eye imaginal disc during the early stage of retinal differentiation.

Objective: To study the prevalence and predictors of medication non-adherence in patients of CKD and outcomes of nonadherence prospectively over 2 years. Material and Methods: In this multi-centric, prospective observational study a total of 510 patients were included after obtaining consent. A validated scale of medication adherence, Morisky 8-item Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8) was used to calculate adherence. The primary outcome of the study was all-cause mortality and secondary outcome was composite of all-cause mortality and progression of CKD or occurrence of ESRD (end-stage renal disease). Results: Longitudinal evaluation showed increase in non-adherence over time, from 58% at baseline to 82% at two years. Overall, 18% patients were taking alternative medicines. The rate of all-cause death in low adherence population was numerically double as compared to patients with high adherence (1.4 vs 0.7 per 100 patient-years), though the difference was statistically non-significant. The secondary outcome in low adherence population was 5.5 per 100 patient-years compared to 9.9 per 100 patient-years in high adherence population (hazard ratio [HR]= 1.53, 95% confidence interval [CI]= 1.21-1.74). Conclusion: Non adherence to medication is very prevalent among CKD patients in India, which further increases with duration of treatment.

Lactation is a physiological state associated with dramatic metabolic adaptations and changes in energy balance. During early lactation (first 10 days in milk) the connection between nutrient supply and milk production appears uncoupled as milk yield is increasing at a steep slope while calculated energy balance is simultaneously decreasing towards its nadir. The major criterion for improvement in production is to optimize the efficiency of utilization of the available fodder resource, which can be achieved by adopting basic concepts; like making the digestive system of the cow efficient, balancing nutrients, achieving high levels of dry matter intake throughout the transition period through excellent feeding management and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["448"]}

Layer-by-layer addition of material empowers LAM in selective deposition of pre-defined composition of material shaping the engineering components making it a feature based design and manufacturing technology. The LAM built components largely depends on LAM processing parameters and the quality of single deposited layer. Hence selection of appropriate processing parameters is one of the mandatory requirements for achieving superior mechanical properties LAM built components. This paper reports the LAM of aluminium/grapheme (Al-G) composite on Al and SS substrate. 2 kW fibre laser based additive manufacturing with 2 mm laser beam diameter at substrate was used to deposit Al-G layers (Al+ 1% wt G) at different combinations of laser scanning speed and laser power. Effect of laser power and scanning speed on the quality of deposited layers was investigated oand optimum parametric window was identified. The Optimum range of energy intensity is 50 to 400 J/mm which favours material deposition (< 50P/v-< 400 J/mm). Thus prepared samples were subjected to optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and microhardness measurements.

{"title": "Identification of aerosol sources and its characterization at Varanasi: an air mass based study\n", "abstract": " A continuous aerosol measurement were carried out at Varanasi, during 2011 using ground based hand-held sunphotometer. A discrimination of aerosol characteristics was made over the station based on their possible sources, identified from air mass back trajectory analyses at 1000m altitude above mean sea level. Four different types of source sectors were identified, viz. Type I (mainly from north-east India), Type II (mainly from north-west India like Haryana and Punjab), Type III (mainly from Middle East and Thar Desert region due to the long range transportation mixed with anthropogenic aerosol), and Type IV (mainly from the central and south India and also from oceanic region (from the Bay of Bengal), with annual contributions of nearly 9%, 32%, 36%, and 23%, respectively to the total aerosol loading. These aerosol types show a strong seasonal heterogeneity in contributions depending on their emission sources. Type II aerosols are dominated in post-monsoon (~ 61%) and winter (~ 46%) seasons while Type III aerosols are dominated in pre-monsoon (~ 40%) and winter (~ 48%) seasons. We found that local/anthropogenic aerosols are more dominant than long range transported aerosols and play crucial role in suitable meteorological condition. The measured aerosol optical properties such as aerosol optical depth (AOD) and \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m exponent (AE) were analyzed for the identified sectors of aerosol sources to understand their detailed characteristics over the station. The annual mean value of AOD (AE) for Type I, Type II, Type III, Type IV aerosols are 0.98\u00b10.31 (0.93\u00b10.26), 0.89\u00b10.30 (1.06\u00b10.22), 0.76\u00b10.30 (0.92\u00b10.25), 0.76\u00b10.32 (0\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["448"]}

An understanding of the reproductive biology, including the relationship between litter size and teat functionality is crucial for conservation management of this animal. In precocial mammals, as the red-rumped agouti, maintaining maternal contact to learn foraging patterns may be more important than the energy demands and nutritional constraints during lactation and suckling may not play important roles when compared to altricial mammals. Therefore, in this study we evaluated the relationship between mammary functionality with litter size, litter birth weight, and parturition number in captive red-rumped agouti. Functionality was assessed by manual palpation of teats from un-sedated females (N=43). We compared the average birth weight of all newborns, male newborns and female newborns among agoutis with different litter sizes and different parturitions by one way ANOVA\u2019s, while Pearson\u2019s Chi-squared tests were used to detect relationships between teat functionality, litter size, and parturition number.

We found (i) no significant correlations (P > 0.05) between teat functionality and litter size and (ii) no significant correlations (P > 0.05) between teat functionality and parturition number.

Different in vitro cell assays were conducted to evaluate the cell death caused by the ethanolic extract of the fruits. Results: Results showed that MCF7 cells with wild type p53 were more sensitive towards the fruit extract than HT29 cells with mutated p53. On the other hand, the extract exhibited insignificant or low toxicity to normal cell lines (MCF10). The cytotoxic effect of the fruit extract was found dependent on dose, time and type of the cell lines.Conclusion: It is concluded that the fruit extract induced selective toxicity in cancer cells but normal cells showed low sensitivity. It is suggested that differential response of tumor and normal cells was associated with their differences in cytosolic redox status acted upon by antioxidants in the extract under study.

One of the technologies developed by using nano forms is vesicular drug delivery system. Such advancement in nano-vesicular drug delivery is niosomes and proniosomes. Proniosomes are dry formulation of water-soluble carrier particles that are coated with surfactant and can be hydrated to form niosomal dispersion immediately before use on brief agitation in hot aqueous media within minutes. Provesicular systems, such as proniosomes which is one of the advancement in nanotechnology minimize problems of vesicular systems such as aggregation, fusion and leakage of drug and provide additional convenience in transportation, distribution, storage and dosing. Conventional vesicular systems such as liposomes and niosomes face stability related difficulty. This new emerging concept has demonstrated the potential in improving the oral bioavailability, targeting drugs to the specific site and also permeation of drugs across the stratum corneum.

{"title": "The integumentary system\n", "abstract": " The skin has greater total mass than any other organ in the body. It consists of two structural units, namely epidermis and dermis, which are strongly attached to each other. The outer epidermis consists of stratified squamous epithelium, superficial layer of which are cornified (keratinized). Epidermis is an avascular structure and derives its nutrition by diffusion of nutrients from the dermis, the second and deeper layer of skin. The dermis is composed of vascularized and irregularly arranged fibroelastic connective tissue. The dermis forms the supporting base for the epidermis, and is separated from it by a well defined basement membrane. The dermis consists of two layers: the superficial papillary layer and the deeper reticular layer. The papillary layer is made up of loose connective tissue. This layer projects as finger like processes known as papillae into the epidermis. Some papillae have nerve endings and are known as tactile papillae and other papillae have capillary plexus and are known as vascular papillae. The distribution of these papillae shows regional differences that are possibly sequelae of mechanical demands. A basement membrane separates the dermis from the epidermis.The cells of the basal layer of epidermis are attached to the basement membrane and they proliferate throughout life. The progeny cells become displaced further away from their source of nutrients in the dermis. Slowly, these cells die and they are converted into superficial layer of dead keratin, the stratum corneum. Based on the relative thickness of stratum corneum, the skin is classified into two types, namely thick and thin skin.

In India, 40-50% of the adult population is infected, although only 5% of these may develop active disease during first year or two and another 2-5% will develop disease later on in life. The estimated incidence of tuberculosis in India is 1.96 million new cases annually and the estimated prevalence is 3.8 million cases. Certain medical conditions increase the risk of latent TB infection progressing to active disease eg HIV infection, injection drug use, history of organ transplant, immunosuppressive therapy (including steroids and anti-TNF alpha drugs), diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal failure. The progression from latent infection to active disease depends on a number of factors, of which the most important is immunodeficient state. 1Cirrhosis of liver is also a relatively common condition. Although the exact prevalence in India is unknown, the autopsy studies in USA showed a prevalence of 5-10%. In addition to Hepatitis B and C, there has been a massive increase in alcoholism In India contributing to an increase in chronic liver disease including cirrhosis. This leads to an immunodeficient state and along with malnutrition which is commonly present in such patients, may increase the risk of tuberculosis.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["448"]}

This article seeks to examine the recent trends in government expenditures and private R&D investments for agriculture; along with sectoral and regional priorities. Our study clearly showed that the expenditure on agricultural research which grew with an impressive rate of 6 per cent during the 1980s, slowed down to 3 per cent since the 1990s seem to be a concern especially in view of increasingly capital intensive nature of agril R&D. Apart from government direct interventions, the role of private sector in many facets of agri-input services and agribiotechnology has expanded. With a growing size of agri-biotech market in the country, private investments in R & D has expanded, though selectively; hence a revamping of the public research portfolio is called for to fill the research gaps. Given the right incentives and regulatory framework, the private sector can provide an effective and sustainable investments and innovations in input and output markets, and thereby contribute to the higher growth.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["448"]}

{"title": "Urbanisation and migration trends in India\n", "abstract": " The study presents a concurrent scenario of migration that is ongoing in India. Post independent India witnessed several transformations in various sectors. Due to unequal development and the indifferent attitude of development agencies and the Government, a considerable proportion of the rural population has immigrated to the urban places in search of better opportunities resulting in many problems such as unidentifiable population groups and slum formation. Migration from rural to urban has changed the nature and proportion of population and its supportive systems. The paper is based on Indian Census data from 1901-2001. It has been found that there is a strong association between industrialization and in-migration. Haryana state has emerged as a new and popular choice for the immigration, and Maharashtra state is the second most favorite destination by the out-migrants. By looking at the trend of the population growth it can be projected that the future population of Mumbai will be about 20 million in year 2011, while Delhi will have approximately more than 15 million inhabitants in the same year. Apart from these, many other newly emerged cities, because of industries and other comparatively better human sustainable facilities are witnessing rapid population growth.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["448"]}

However, in India, an informal workforce, lack of structured training facilities and non-implementation of farriery regulations pose challenges for quality farriery. Brooke India, an equine welfare organisation, has undertaken many initiatives aiming to improve farriery services, including technical training and engagement with equid-owning communities. However, this has met with varying success. The study aimed to identify factors that prevent farriers providing quality farriery services. Focus-group discussions were conducted with farriers from two districts of Uttar Pradesh with varying programme outcomes. Within each area, farriers were grouped according to previous level of engagement with Brooke programmes. Demand for services, farrier status, the external environment and technical training and knowledge were identified as key elements that affected farriery work. These factors were very context specific: in areas where brick kilns provided the majority of customers, recent closures had resulted in an increase in those farriers\u2019 feeling of insecurity. A systems approach to improving farriery services, taking these factors into account, is advised. Mentoring-based capacity building, which is closely aligned to farrier needs and expectations, is expected to have positive results in terms of technical skill and farrier engagement.

In this study, we evaluated the effect of age on clinical outcomes in patients with ACS undergoing PCI because it is a well-known fact that the ages of patients influence clinical outcomes in ACS. Aims and Objectives: The aim of the study was to find out the effect of age on outcome of angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients. Materials and Methods: It is a cross-sectional, selfcontrol, interventional study. In this study, cardiac output (CO) of 52 patients of AMI was measured by echocardiography before and after angioplasty. CO is calculated with the help of end diastolic volume, end systolic volume, and left ventricular outflow tract diameter. Statistical software IBM SPSS version 16 was used for analysis of data. Results: A negative and statistically significant coefficient of correlation (r=\u2212 0.384 and P= 0.005) was found between age of patients and the value of CO after coronary angioplasty. Linear regression analysis was also done taking CO after coronary angioplasty as dependent variable and age of the patient as the independent variable. It can be hypothesized that as the age advances, CO after angioplasty deteriorates.

Staging of osteoarthritis of knee was done using Kellgren-Lawrence scoring system and then we performed magnetic resonance imaging of the knee. All these patients were then interviewed about their clinical symptoms and osteoarthritis of knee was graded by WOMAC scale.Results: Osteoarthritis has a positive correlation with age, female sex and BMI. However occupation of the patient was not associated with any statistical significance. No association was seen between cartilage defects, bone marrow edema, sub chondral cysts, subchondral sclerosis, Baker\u2019s cysts subluxations of tibia and synovitis with clinical features. The patellofemoral compartment of knee joint mostly contributed to the clinical symptoms of the patients in our study population though not being statistically significant (P> 0. 05). In tibiofemoral compartment a statistically significant correlation was seen between most of the MRI findings and KL score, however in patellofemoral compartment this correlation is poor.Conclusions: Clinical findings and plain radiographs are still important in evaluating osteoarthritis of knee, MRI plays an important role in imaging the bony and soft tissues of knee as a whole organ, thereby helping in better management and outcome of the disease.

The standard solution of Levofloxacin in 0.1 N HCl showed maximum absorption at 293 nm. Beer-Lambert\u2019s law obeyed in the concentration range of 2-12 \u00b5g/ml, with regression, slope and intercept 0.9997, 0.058 and 0.086 respectively. The percentage recovery is between 100\u00b12 which reflect that the method is free from interference of the impurities and other additives during the estimation of drug in formulation. The proposed method can be successfully used for analysis of Levofloxacin in marketed preparations (Livaquin). The results of analysis have been validated statistically and by recovery studies.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["448"]}

The proliferation of voltage sag load equipment used in industrial plants may cause tremendous economic and financial losses up to millions of dollars attributed to a single disruption. Therefore, it is very important to mitigate the impact of voltage sags on sensitive equipment. In this paper, Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR) is used to mitigate the voltage sag during fault condition. DVR is considered to be the most efficient and effective mitigation device. The method to calculate the DVR devices for the fault calculation, were consider in this paper, as well as the control strategy. The mitigation technique was applied to an IEEE 30-buses electrical network to illustrate its application. The results show that the mitigation technique is able to mitigate voltage sag.

{"title": "Implementation and Applications of Various Feeding Techniques Using CST Microwave Studio\n", "abstract": " The study of microstrip patch antennas has made great progress in recent years. Compared with conventional antennas, microstrip patch antennas have more advantages and better prospects. The main concern is to study the bandwidth improvement of the microstrip antenna using different slots. The construction of different microstrip antennas on a dielectric substrate operating on 1.8 GHz is proposed. The article presents four models of single layer microstrip antenna operating on the same 1.8 GHz frequency. Each of antennas was fed in other ways. Each of the antenna models are designed using parameters such as VSWR, input resistance, input reactance and radiation pattern. Bandwidth of the patch antenna is increased by using multiple layer dielectric substrates. Some effect of disadvantages can be minimized. Lower gain and low power handling capacity can be overcome through an array configuration.

They were also very high near an inland lake. Concentration of As were found to be moderate to low in the interior flood plains between these two basins. Groundwater As in these districts showed that intermediate aquifers have more As compared to deep and shallow aquifers. It was observed that As concentrations in groundwater were comparatively low in most places, expect for few locations in Ghazipur, where it exceeded 200 \u03bcg/l. The correlation between Fe and As was low, and sulfate concentrations in groundwater were relatively low. The shallow aquifers seem to be particularly at risk, due to the prevailing geochemical conditions in which oxidized and reduced waters mix, where the amount of sulfate, available for microbial reduction, seems to be\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["448"]}

GA3 also increased to no. of fresh flowers at a time, yield of spikes/ha and size and yield of corms. Application of ethrel significantly delayed the sprouting of mother corm, spike emergence, reduced the thickness of spike and size of floret, increased the compactness of florets and yield of spikes and daughter corms per unit area.

For instance, India depends  largely on coal for its power generation. The problem with Indian coal is that it  carries a lot of dust  with  it. Hence, dust  carried along with  the  flue  gases  has  to be separated before sending the gases for further treatment. Cyclone separa-tor, bag filter and electrostatic precipitator have found applications  in  technological  use.

However, cyclone separators have less temperature and pressure limitations and requires low pressure  drop.

Early changes in the degenerative process include thickening and stiffening of the leaflets, reflected in altered rates of opening and closing. Methods have been proposed to measure this in vivo and relate it to the rate of disease progression. In this in vitro study, we tested the hypothesis that changes in ambient hemodynamics that might contribute to the wear and tear process that mediates the degenerative process affect valve mechanics, and that this is reflected in the rates of valve opening and closing. Evidence supporting this hypothesis is presented and an alternative method to account for these effects is proposed.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["448"]}

The growth rate of a continuous lamellar crystal is independent of the length of the crystal and (in the absence of crosslinks) depends only upon temperature and the chemical composition of the polymer. The temperature dependence is closely similar to that observed for bulk crystallization and spherulite growth, with a maximum crystallization rate around \u201424\u00b0 C. The growth rate at a given temperature is extremely sensitive to the chemical composition of the poly(isoprene), being for a polymer containing 10 per cent trans-poly(isoprene) one thousandth of that for pure cis-poly(isoprene).

{"title": "Corona product of signed graphs and its application to signed network modelling\n", "abstract": " The notion of corona of two graphs was introduced by Frucht and Harary in 1970. In this paper we generalize their definition of corona product of two graphs and introduce corona product of two signed graphs by utilizing the framework of marked graphs, which was introduced by Beineke and Harary in 1978. We study the structural and spectral properties of corona product of signed graphs. Further we define signed corona graphs by considering corona product of a fixed small signed graph with itself iteratively, and we call the small graph as the seed graph for the corresponding corona graphs. Signed corona graphs can be employed as a signed network generative model for large growing signed networks. We study structural properties of corona graphs that include statistics of signed links, all types of signed triads and degree distribution. Besides we analyze algebraic conflict of signed corona graphs generated by specially structured seed graphs. Finally we show that a suitable choice of a seed graph can produce corona graphs which preserve properties of real signed networks.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["448"]}

The major contribution of the proposed work is the development of modified objective function which incorporates values of the degree of criticality of buses. The problem is formulated as maximization of the aggregate degree of criticality of the system.

The ratio of the in-plane stretching and the bending energies of the shell, called as the F\u00f6ppl von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n (FvK) number, is an important dimensionless number that characterizes the key features of these shells. Through two new models of shells, we replace the continuum description by their discrete counterparts in incremental steps. The first model is a hybrid discrete-continuum description. It shows the presence of competing symmetries at low FvK numbers which are not detected in the continuum model. The second model shows that the FvK number controls the thermal response of these shells. Shells can be melted only at low FvK numbers.

Available experiences of TTTCSSL find difficulties for LTCC in Indian coalfields, mainly due to competency of the coal/rock mass. Inherent geological and rock mechanics challenges of TTTCSSL become even more prominent for Gondwana coal, mainly, due to competent coal/rock mass. Here, it becomes important to introduce an appropriate fracturing technique to alleviate the problems of coal under-winning during LTCC. Considerable dilution in pillar strength due to the increased height of extraction demands increase in pillar width, specially for barrier between two panels. However, the stress controlled mining environment at higher depth provides an opportunity to relook of the existing design norms of the barrier pillars. Presence of squat (non-destructible) barrier pillars becomes a potential source of energy accumulation, increasing the chance of coal bump/rock bursts. These pillars also provide a passage for air circulation inside the goaf, which brings a threat of spontaneous heating too. The relevance of the squat barrier pillars to isolate two panels gets diluted at higher depth also due to, relatively, high compactness of the caved material inside the goaf. Therefore, the conventional approach of keeping squat barrier pillars between two panels is replaced by, relatively, smaller and yieldable pillar (slender) in most of the deep coal mining practices around the Globe. Any such field experimentation is yet to happen in our coalfields\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["448"]}

But the issue here is to know that whether users are utilizing all the varied features of their Smartphones or are they just sticking to entertainment and social networking rather than playing on the complete package that the Smartphone has to offer. What users actually utilize their Smartphone for? How much are they using it?: Duration, frequency? & for what all purposes? This curiosity led the investigators through the development and completion of this study. There is a need to re-conceptualize learning for the mobile age, to recognize the essential role of mobility and communication in the process of learning, and also to indicate the importance of context in establishing meaning, and the transformative effect of digital networks in supporting virtual communities that transcend barriers of age and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["448"]}

{"title": "Current understanding on venous leg ulcer\n", "abstract": " Venous leg ulcer (VLU) or stasis ulcer is a relatively common, chronic and recurring problem. Besides being costly to the health-care system, it significantly impairs the quality of life of the patients. Nearly 1% of adults and 3.6% of older patients are reported to suffer from this chronic condition. Chronic venous insufficiency is considered to be the predominant cause of VLU. The most recent theories associate the pathogenesis of venous ulcer with microcirculatory abnormalities and generation of an inflammatory response. The pharmacological treatment for VLU is based on the pathogenesis and often includes diosmin, pentoxifylline, diuretics as well as antibiotics and the non-pharmacological treatment like compression and skin grafting. VLU has a high rate of recurrence and requires self-care to avoid relapse. Treatment of VLU should always focus for complete treatment, and improve quality of life for patients along with minimum relapse. In recent years novel therapeutic approaches for venous ulcers have offered valuable tools for the management of patients with this disorder.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["448"]}
{"title": "Influence of seminal plasma proteins in semen fertility\n", "abstract": " The seminal plasma is a highly complex biological fluid comprising of proteins, enzymes, lipids, vitamins, minerals, hormones, fatty acids, amino acids and trace elements. There are variety of proteins in the semen viz. inhibin, plasmin, androgen binding protein, transferrin, immobilin, calsemine, heparin binding protein, heat shock protein, cellular retinol binding protein, acrosome reaction potentiating protein and forward motility protein (Kulkarni 2003). Few of these proteins may be exploited as potential markers of male fertility. Many proteins have been studied to predict the bull fertility (Dejarnette et al. 2004). The presence of 21, 25, 44 and 239 kDa proteins in seminal plasma have been identified as the potential markers for bull fertility (Roncoletta et al. 2006). The current manuscript is an update of characteristics of different seminal plasma proteins (SPP) that play an important role in governing the fertility potential of semen.Seminal proteins of reproductive organ origin: A major part of the proteins originate from the tests, epididymis, vas deferens, ampullae, vesicular glands, prostrate and Cowper\u2019s glands (Gupta et al. 2002). The biosynthesis and secretion of these proteins is regulated by blood testosterone.

{"title": "Heating Mechanism of Microwave\n", "abstract": " Conduction and dipolar polarization may both give rise to heating under microwave irradiation. Microwave heating is quite distinct from microwave spectroscopy. The photon of a quantum phenomenon excites the rotation levels of gas phase molecules while the absorption of microwave in solid and liquid samples is frequency dependent. The phase difference causes energy to be lost from the dipole in random collision and to give rise to dielectric heating. Heating in metals and metal powders depends heavily upon conduction losses. Magnetic polarization may also contribute to the heating effect.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["448"]}

Among various crops, apple, walnut and pear represent major crops of temperate fruits covering about 54, 22 and 6.9% of the total area and accounting for 82.3, 1.1 and 5.6% of temperate fruit production respectively, while rest of the production comes from other fruits like peach, plum, almond, apricot, cherries etc. But in the last one decade, the export of temperate fruits have increased from rupees 132 (1960) to 204 (2010) crore. Although manifold increase in area, production and productivity recorded but compared to average world productivity (8.80 t/ha) as well as productivity of advanced countries, our position is far behind the advance countries whose productivity has gone upto 40.5 (apple) and 3 t/ha (almond, walnut) as against 9.73, 0.70 and 1.63 t/ha in India for apple, almond and walnut respectively (Table 1). Out of the total production, nearly about 0.053 tonnes of apple and walnuts is exported worth 204 crore rupees which is very insignificant when compared to world trade of about 179 billion US $ during 2009-10 (NHB, 2010).The Good Agricultural Practice for temperate fruits is a set of consolidated safety and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["448"]}

The resulting impacts inversely depend on the capacity of the population or the system to resist a disaster through hazard control, avoidance, and tolerance mechanisms, whereas\u2019 resilience\u2019is understood as the ability to bounce back after the stress is over. Drought is an insidious hazard of nature and it ranks first among natural disasters throughout the world in terms of the number of persons directly affected (Hagman, 1984; Hewitt, 1997). It is considered to be one of the most complexes and least understood among all natural disasters due to wider range of environmental inputs and influences over the occurrences, impacts and mitigation strategies\u2013near impossible for a single discipline or two to be capable of complete understanding. It is interesting to mention that contrary to other natural hazards like floods, earthquakes, and hurricanes, the impacts caused by drought are usually non-structural but spread over larger geographical areas. Its effect accumulates slowly over a considerable period of time and lingers on for years.Drought means differently to different people depending on their specific interests.

{"title": "Studies On Falling Ball Viscometry\n", "abstract": " A new method of accurate calculation of the coefficient of viscosity of a test liquid from experimentally measured terminal velocity of a ball falling in the test liquid contained in a narrow tube is described. The calculation requires the value of a multiplicative correction factor to the apparent coefficient of viscosity calculated by substitution of terminal velocity of the falling ball in Stokes formula. This correction factor, the so-called viscosity ratio, a measure of deviation from Stokes limit, arises from non-vanishing values of the Reynolds number and the ball/tube radius ratio. The method, valid over a very wide range of Reynolds number, is based on the recognition of a relationship between two measures of wall effect, the more widely investigated velocity ratio, defined as the ratio of terminal velocity in a confined medium to that in a boundless medium and viscosity ratio. The calculation uses two recently published correlation formulae based on extensive experimental results on terminal velocity of a falling ball. The first formula relates velocity ratio to Reynolds number and ball-tube radius ratio. The second formula gives an expression of the ratio of the drag force actually sensed by the ball falling in an infinite medium to that in the Stokes limit as a function of Reynolds number alone. It is shown that appropriate use of this correction factor extends the utility of the technique of falling ball viscometry beyond the very low Reynolds number 'creepy flow' regime, to which its application is presently restricted. Issues related to accuracy are examined by use of our own measurements of the terminal velocity of a falling ball in a narrow tube and that of published\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["448"]}

{"title": "Intermodulation suppression in a broad band TWT\n", "abstract": " We examine methods for reducing two-tone intermodulation products in the custom-made XWING broadband traveling wave tube. Harmonic suppression and difference frequency techniques are used to demonstrate intermodulation suppression techniques and the spatial variation of their spectral evolution. Harmonic and difference frequency optimum drive levels and phase are determined which suppress the third order intermodulation product by more than 21 dB in the 2-6 GHz band. The variation of the suppression with drive level near saturation and two-tone difference frequency are examined.IM3 reduction using the harmonic injection technique is experimentally demonstrated in a broadband TWT distributed amplifier. A recent study by Aitchison et al.[1] has demonstrated the effectiveness of this technique in narrowband, solid-state amplifiers at 835 and 880 MHz. They obtain substantial reduction in IM3 levels by both second harmonic and difference-frequency (1 MHz) injection techniques. Work by Datta et al.[2] and Wohlbier [3] describe theoretical models that predict similar behavior in TWTs. This behavior has been observed by Armstrong et al.[4] but not published nor studied in detail.

{"title": "Generation of toxic fumes from permitted explosives\u2014a critical study\n", "abstract": " \u6b63 Explosives invariably generate toxic gases, mostly carbon monoxide (CD) and oxides of nitrogen (NOX), during their use even when they are oxygen balanced. These gases generated by explosives during blasting in underground mines may sometimes accumulate in physiologically harmful concentration. The mine regulatory agency in India has stipulated norms for working personnel to enter at the underground blasted face. Moreover, explosives meant for use in underground coal mines are statutorily required to meet stipulated criteria vis-a-vis their toxic fume quality for being designated as permitted explosives. A long term research programme was undertaken in India, studying toxic fumes generation from 58 different explosives (P1, P3 P5) of all three categories viz. NG-based (22 nos.), Slurry (21 nos.) and Emulsion (15 nos.). Mean of the total fumes (CD+ NOX) generated by permitted emulsion, slurry and NO based explosives under standard laboratory conditions are found to be 26.95, 32.09 and 45.139 litre per kg of the explosives respectively. Analysis of variance was carried out on CD and NOX generated by different explosives. This exercise was performed to check whether they are statistically different. On analysis of the results, it indicated that non-NG permitted explosives are superior to the conventional NG-based permitted explosives in fume quality. The result also revealed that P5 permitted explosives generate more toxic fumes compared to P1 and P3 permitted explosives but the difference in their mean values are not statistically significant.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["448"]}

The twenty first century is the most rapidly of changing century of all time. Rapidity of changes created unusual demands on individuals and on system of education. Today education must not only include the body and knowledge, but also to develop inquiring minds that will enable them to comprehend and accept what is to come tomorrow. As Jacks, the british philosopher, put it, living becomes an art only,  When work and play, labour and leisure, mind and body, education and recreation are governed by single vision of excellence and a continuous passion for achieving it. The developing tendencies in international sports, especially in team games are identified as the increase in game tempo, tougher body game and greater variability in technique and tactics. An increased performance level can only be achieved by working and training of all major components i.e. technique, coordination, tactics, physical fitness, physiological qualities and psychological qualities. The theory of motor coordination is the basis for understanding the motor of coordination abilities. Motor coordination is part and parcel of actions regulation. Coordination abilities have also important and strong links with the motor skills as the motor coordination focus the basis\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["448"]}

{"title": "Changes in carbohydrate fraction and ascorbic acid content of groundnut under the influence of sulphur and phosphorus fertilizers\n", "abstract": " A field experiment was carried out to study the effect of P and S fertilization on carbohydrate and ascorbic acid contents of groundnut kernels. Treatments comprised of four levels each of S (0, 20, 40 and 60 kg S/ha) and P (0, 25. SO and 75 kg P/ha) and their all possible combinations. It was observed that almost all the treatments caused a significant dec rease in all forms of carbohydrate ie, reducing and non-reducing sugars and starch. This could possibly be explained on the basis of higher conversion of carbohydrates to oil and protein under the influence of increasing levels of S and P. Ascorbic acid content was found to increase significantly with increasing levels of P application whereas, the effect of S was nonsignificant in this regard.Sulphur and phosphorus are found to be effective on carbohydrate metabolism of oil crops. Sulphur deficiency causes formation of less oil and promotes accumulation of carbohydrates in plants (Eaton, 1935). Chopra and Kanwar (1966) reported that in the absence of sulphur. the carbohydrates are not fully utilized. Thus, it is most likely that sulphur and phosphorus catalyse the metabolism of carbohydrate. It was, therefore, felt desirable to investigate the effects of Sand P levels on the carbohydrate fraction and ascorbic acid content of groundnut and thereby having an idea of accumulation or possible conversion of carbohydrate to oil or protein.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["448"]}

Smith's law was a good fit to the underlying relationship between average SE% and plot size. With fixed experimental resources, the smallest plot was the most efficient. For achieving a level of accuracy of 3% SE of mean, a plot of 15 m2 with 3 replications was found suitable. For a given size and shape of plot, block efficiency generally decreased with an increase in block size, but the shape of the block had no consistent effect", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["448"]}

{"title": "Fusion of SFS-SVM feature selection methods using robust rank aggregation for optimal feature subset selection for mammogram classification\n", "abstract": " Feature selection and classification plays an important role in the design and development of a computer aided detection and diagnostics (CAD) tool for breast cancer detection from mammograms. In literature, the various feature selection methods exists such as filter based, wrapper based, and hybrid methods whose aim is to select the most relevant and minimum redundant features from the extracted feature set. The various feature selection methods are based on various basis criteria on which they are designed; and they produce different feature sets even for the same dataset with varying performance measures for a chosen classifier. Therefore, the basic question arises that which one is better and if all of them performs better with slight variations in their performance measures then what should be the robust method to select the optimal feature subset associated with constant and better performance for a chosen dataset? Hence, in this paper, the above mentioned issues are addressed by proposing a wrapper based feature selection method based on sequential forward selection (SFS) and support vector machine (SVM) for optimal feature subset selection. The proposed method is derived from the fusion of SFS-SVM feature selection methods for various kernel spaces of SVM ie the feature sets obtained from SFS-SVM-Linear, SFS-SVM-RBF, SFS-SVM-Quadratic, SFS-SVM-Polynomial, and SFS-SVM-MLP wrapper based feature selection methods are fused using robust rank aggregation method. Finally, an optimal feature subset is obtained from the fused feature set by evaluating the minimum misclassification error of a chosen classifier.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["448"]}
