{"title": "Healthcare data breaches: Insights and implications\n", "abstract": " The Internet of Medical Things, Smart Devices, Information Systems, and Cloud Services have led to a digital transformation of the healthcare industry. Digital healthcare services have paved the way for easier and more accessible treatment, thus making our lives far more comfortable. However, the present day healthcare industry has also become the main victim of external as well as internal attacks. Data breaches are not just a concern and complication for security experts; they also affect clients, stakeholders, organizations, and businesses. Though the data breaches are of different types, their impact is almost always the same. This study provides insights into the various categories of data breaches faced by different organizations. The main objective is to do an in-depth analysis of healthcare data breaches and draw inferences from them, thereby using the findings to improve healthcare data confidentiality. The study found that hacking/IT incidents are the most prevalent forms of attack behind healthcare data breaches, followed by unauthorized internal disclosures. The frequency of healthcare data breaches, magnitude of exposed records, and financial losses due to breached records are increasing rapidly. Data from the healthcare industry is regarded as being highly valuable. This has become a major lure for the misappropriation and pilferage of healthcare data. Addressing this anomaly, the present study employs the simple moving average method and the simple exponential soothing method of time series analysis to examine the trend of healthcare data breaches and their cost. Of the two methods, the simple moving average method\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "48\n", "authors": ["251"]}

As security and usability are two growing concerns for online banking users, banks have invested heavily in improving their web portals security and user experience and trust in them. Despite considerable efforts to evaluate particular security and usability features in online banking, a dedicated security and usability evaluation framework that can be used as a guide in online banking development remains much less explored. In this work, we first extract security and usability evaluation metrics from the conducted literature review. We then include several other evaluation metrics that were not previously identified in the literature. We argue that the proposed online banking security and usability evaluation frameworks in the literature in addition to the existing standards of security best practices (eg, NIST and ISO) are by no means comprehensive and lack some essential and key evaluation metrics that are of particular interest to online banking portals. In order to demonstrate the inadequacy of existing frameworks, we use some frameworks to evaluate five major banks. The evaluation reveals several shortcomings in identifying both missing or incorrectly implemented security and privacy features.

{"title": "On the relationship between software complexity and security\n", "abstract": " This work aims at discussing the complexity aspect of software while demonstrating its relationship with security. Complexity is an essential part of software; however, numerous studies indicate that they increase the vulnerability of the software systems and introduce bugs in the program. Many developers face difficulty when trying to understand the complex components of software. Complexity in software increases when objects in the software are used to design a more complex object while creating a hierarchical complexity in the system. However, it is necessary for the developers to strive for minimum complexity, as increased complexity introduces security risks in the software, which can cause severe monetary and reputational damage to a government or a private organization. It even causes bodily harm to human beings with various examples found in previous years where security breaches led to severe consequences. Hence it is vital to maintain low complexity and simple design of structure. Various developers tend to introduce deliberate complexities in the system so that they do not have to write the same program twice; however, it is getting problematic for the software organizations as the demands of security are continually increasing.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["251"]}

Few studies are concerned in detecting vulnerabilities during the software design phase before implementing the solution. Most of the research in the literature is interested in studying software vulnerabilities at the code level. Less research work has considered the architectural metrics to predict security vulnerabilities. Hence, in this paper, we try to consider the main metrics of software architecture in conjunction with the popular code level metrics to study software vulnerabilities and the relationship among these metrics. The literature has been reviewed to identify various security metrics to be used in studying nine common Java libraries. Understand and SonarCube tools are used to collect metrics of the specified libraries, The WEKA tool is used to apply the ReliefF algorithm, a feature selection algorithm, to decide which of the specified metrics are good predictors of software vulnerability.We investigated whether software design metrics can be used in predicting vulnerable classes, and guide actions for code improvement, hence can help development team to prioritize validation and verification efforts.

These approaches use the textual contents of bug reports to build recommendation models. The textual contents of bug reports are usually of high dimension and noisy source of information. These approaches suffer from low accuracy and high computational needs. In this paper, we investigate whether using categorical fields of bug reports, such as component to which the bug belongs, are appropriate to represent bug reports instead of textual description. We build a classification model by utilizing the categorical features, as a representation, for the bug report. The experimental evaluation is conducted using three projects namely NetBeans, Freedesktop, and Firefox. We compared this approach with two machine learning based bug assignment approaches. The evaluation shows that using the textual contents of bug reports is important.

Several contextual attributes characterize a learner, but considering all of them is costly for a ubiquitous learning system. In this paper, a set of optimal intrinsic and extrinsic contexts of a learner are identified for learner modeling. A total of 208 students are surveyed. DEMATEL (Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) technique is used to establish the validity and importance of the identified contexts and find the interdependency among them. The acquiring methods of these contexts are also defined. On the basis of these contexts, the learner model is designed. A layered architecture is presented for interfacing the learner model with a query-based personalized learning recommendation system.
