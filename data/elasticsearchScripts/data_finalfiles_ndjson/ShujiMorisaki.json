It would be expected to make the safety of a system easier to explain to third parties and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2000"]}
{"title": "An Approach for Requirements Elicitation using Goal, Question, and Answer\n", "abstract": " Requirements elicitation is the first step in software development, methods such as data collection, questionnaire, interview, field observation are used in requirements elicitation, either way, the requirements from customer need to be properly extracted. For the interview, the accuracy of requirements elicitation depends on the dialog ability of software engineer (extractor) and customer (respondent). Among software engineers, there is a difference in the ability of requirements elicitation. Besides, it is difficult for experienced software engineers to extract customer requirements without fail. In this paper, in order to extract requirements without omission, the scope of the requirements is determined in advance, and a tree-like requirements decomposition structure is proposed for constructing the requirement questions. At last, a comparative experiment was carried out, and the effectiveness of the approach was positively\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2000"]}
{"title": "Proposal of Application Method of O-DA Template\n", "abstract": " O-DA (Open Dependability through Assuredness) is standardized by The Open Group as the dependable Enterprise Architecture framework for assuring open systems which evolve continuously after launching. Although an O-DA template was proposed to support O-DA application, it has not been introduced for industry sectors. This paper proposes an application method of O-DA template. It also evaluates the effectiveness of the O-DA template for an actual automotive software design project. The result shows 93.6% of the O-DA template can be reused for the application.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2000"]}
{"title": "An Approach for Validating Assurance Case by Using Component Evidence Matrix\n", "abstract": " This paper proposes an approach for validating relationships between sub-goal nodes and evidence nodes in assurance case created with the architecture decomposition pattern. Our approach, obtain component evidence matrix (CEM) from components and evidence from target software or system. Then, CEM enables to clarify the relationships between sub-goal nodes and evidence nodes and to validate whether target assurance case has appropriate relationships between sub-goal nodes and evidence nodes. We conducted an evaluation with five practitioners of software development as subjects to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Also, the evaluation compares which is more effective validation after creating assurance case or validation during creating assurance case. The subjects decreased the number of inconsistent relationships between sub-goal nodes and evidence nodes with our approach. Also, the subjects decrease larger numbers of inconsistent relationships after creating entire assurance case than during creating assurance case.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2000"]}
{"title": "An empirical evaluation of detecting omissions by comparing words between requirement and architectural documents\n", "abstract": " This paper presents the result of the empirical evaluation of detection of omitted requirements that are not described by using words appearance and words senses appearance. The evaluation investigated whether omitted requirements can be detected by difference between a set of words in software requirement document and a set of words in software architectural design document. The evaluation also investigated whether omitted requirements can be detected by difference between a set of words senses. First, the evaluation extracted a set of words that appear in a software requirement document and do not appear in the corresponding software architectural design document. The evaluation extracted a set of words senses that appear in a requirement document and do not appear in software architectural design document. Then, an analyst checked whether corresponding design description with each\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2000"]}
{"title": "The evaluation knowledge of standard software asset using The Seven Samurai framework\n", "abstract": " The knowledge which is needed on automotive software development, increases significantly according to large-scale, complexity of automotive software. Therefore, it is very difficult for an engineer to understand the whole software development. This paper introduces a way of constructing a meta-model, which visualizes the knowledge of expert engineers, based on The Seven Samurai framework. It can solve issues of system development by considering the seven types of elements which are defined in this framework. And then, its name was defined based on the famous Japanese cinema. Additionally, this paper shows the evaluation results of applying the meta-model to the evaluation of actual standard software assets in the product line, and then the effectiveness of the proposed approach is confirmed based on the results.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2000"]}
{"title": "Effect of Grain Growth Control by Atmospheric Micro-Thermal-Plasma-Jet Crystallization of Amorphous Silicon Strips on TFT Characteristics\n", "abstract": " High performance thin film transistors (TFTs) are fabricated on quarts substrate based on zone-melting-recrystallization (ZMR) of amorphous silicon (a-Si) strips induced by micro-thermal-plasma-jet (\u00b5-TPJ) irradiation. The grain boundaries (GBs) in strip pattern were almost excluded and most of the strips consist of\u2211 3 coincidence site lattices (CSLs) or in some cases single grains. Strip pattern was quite effective even in the case of short channel TFTs. N-and p-channel TFTs with typical field effect mobility (\u00b5 FE) of 380 and 140 cm 2/Vs, respectively, are successfully fabricated with significantly reduced characteristics variability. These high \u00b5 FE and low variation of threshold voltage (V th) by strip pattern showed significantly stable output characteristics regardless of the size of TFTs.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2000"]}
{"title": "A support system for software function discovery using histories of function executions\n", "abstract": " The majority of current application software packages have an extremely large number of functions because of the many different users envisioned for the software. This means that it is not easy for users to find useful functions. In this paper, the authors propose a system that supports the discovery of useful functions for users by allowing for shared referencing of function execution histories among users with similar uses for the software. The proposed system gathers a wide range of function execution histories over a long period of time, efficiently processes them, and then displays in a format that is easy to understand candidate functions that are unknown and useful to the user. The results of evaluation experiments using Microsoft Word 2000 and PowerPoint 2000 showed that an average of 63.7 functions were displayed as useful candidate functions to a total of nine subjects, with an average of 16.1 of them being\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2000"]}
{"title": "CLAS: an approach for full use of application software\n", "abstract": " Many of the latest application software provide users with a large number of functions; however, the full set of functions is too large for diverse users. Most of users usually use only 10% of the full set of functions provided by application software. This paper describes an approach \u201cCommunity-based Learning for application software (CLAS)\u201d to let users learn useful functions at low cost for the purpose of improving the users' productivity in using application software. In the CLAS, community members mutually compare their own histories of software function executions, which can be collected automatically, in order to identify a set of candidate functions that should be learned. It is based on the assumption that among the functions that each member of a community uses, some differences in the software usage experiences of each member are observed and the function belonging to the difference is useful for the member to perform his/her current task. The experimental results with a prototype system show both novice and experienced members can more easily obtain usage knowledge of the new functions by the CLAS than a conventional online help system. More than half of functions learned by using the CLAS are new functions whose existences were unknown to the members and cannot be found by the conventional online help system. In the CLAS, users can share the knowledge of software usage in a systematic and effective way.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2000"]}
