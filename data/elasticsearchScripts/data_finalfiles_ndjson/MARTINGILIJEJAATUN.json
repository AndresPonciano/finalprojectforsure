{"title": "Beyond lightning: A survey on security challenges in cloud computing\n", "abstract": " Cloud computing is a model to provide convenient, on-demand access to a shared pool configurable computing resources. In cloud computing, IT-related capabilities are provided as services, accessible without requiring detailed knowledge of the underlying technologies, and with minimal management effort. The great savings promised by the cloud are however offset by the perceived security threats feared by users. This paper gives an overview of cloud computing, and discusses related security challenges. We emphasize that although there are many technological approaches that can improve cloud security, there are currently no one-size-fits-all solutions, and future work has to tackle challenges such as service level agreements for security, as well as holistic mechanisms for ensuring accountability in the cloud.", "num_citations": "446\n", "authors": ["365"]}

Although the new web has experienced slow deployment, the advent of Cloud Computing is assumed to boost the rate of deployment by providing means to conduct resource intensive analysis, tracing and querying of semantically annotated and linked data with minimal investment cost for suppliers. However, the threat of information aggregation poses a severe threat to privacy protection, business-critical information and some aspects of national security. The lack of security mechanisms to restrict access to and usage of information after it has been distributed, further contributes to the risk of aggregation since redistribution cannot be controlled. In this paper we propose a probabilistic approach to information control based on trust management systems. Our solution provides the user with a view of the amount of information that any given entity probably has received through redistribution (from others), in order to determine the level of aggregation the entity can perform.

Several recent results have pointed to problems related to how security research is conducted or reported in a way that is not advancing the area scientifically. Science of Security (SoS) is an area of research that seeks to apply a scientific approach to the study and design of secure and trustworthy information systems [16, 17]. The core purpose of science is to develop fundamental laws that let us make accurate predictions. Currently, the only prediction we can usually make confidently in secure software engineering is that a system will eventually fail when faced with sufficiently motivated attackers. However, there is a need and an opportunity to develop fundamental research to guide the development and understand the security and robustness of the complex systems on which we depend.Secure software engineering research is a long way from establishing a scientific approach based on the understanding of empirical evaluation and theoretical foundations as developed in other sciences, and even from software engineering in general. Many of our security and privacy best practices are derived from anecdote, not from careful, evidence-based research [23]. The area suffers from a lack of credible empirical evaluation, a split between industry practice and academic research, and a huge number of methods and method variants, with differences little understood and artificially magnified [17].

Telecom operators have concentrated on 2G and 3G public networks that operate in licensed frequency bands. On the other hand, the unlicensed frequencies in wireless local area networks (WLANs) have been applied successfully as home and last mile technology in the increasingly pervasive computing environments where mobile users access Internet services. The integration of WLAN in 3G devices and the convergence of various access network technologies indicate that WLAN is no competitor for 3G and that the unlicensed WLAN spectra may become an important and cost effective supplement to offer network access.In residential areas, WLAN is often positioned as the primary means of broadband access, widely deployed in many countries by access lines based on Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), fibre, and cable.

The assembly model of the whole machine was developed in UG software utilizing the multi-body dynamics theory and imported into ADAMS that is the integrated mechanical system simulation software. The simulation model was created including tire and road model and was simulated dynamically in ADAMS under different working conditions. By simulation, the horizontal impact load is acquired which acted on the traction vehicle. The simulation results are compared with the testing data, which validates the correctness of the dynamic simulation model. It is simulated and analyzed how the model parameters influence the traction load. The results suggest that the dynamic model and road model can simulate working conditions of the impact roller and help engineering\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["365"]}
{"title": "Securing the IaaS Service Model of Cloud Computing Against Compromised Components\n", "abstract": " Cloud Computing is a new computing model, and its security aspects require special considerations. New characteristics of the cloud model have introduced new security challenges, and made some of the existing security techniques incompatible. Moreover, existing cloud environments are closed, operated by commercial providers, and their security mechanisms are proprietary as well as confidential. In other words, there is not much chance of observing how a real cloud environment is working, and how their providers adapt security measures to the new model.Therefore, we have chosen an open source cloud platform to build our own cloud environment. The OpenStack cloud software met our requirements, but it was not mature enough. We have done a deep analysis of this platform, identified potential attack targets in it, and discuss impacts of a successful attack.In order to secure our environment, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) incident handling guideline has been applied to the cloud model, and corresponding actions for each phase has been performed. To complete our study, we have proposed a set of cloud specific approaches that fulfill the incident handling requirements. These approaches address challenges identified in the guideline adaptation process. Additionally, we have studied the feasibility and compatibility of each approach against our deployed environment.Additionally, we also have submitted a paper to IEEE CloudCom 2011 conference, based on my thesis.

{"title": "A lightweight approach to secure software engineering\n", "abstract": " Secure software engineering1 is much more than developing critical software. History has shown us that software bugs and design flaws also represent exploitable security vulnerabilities in seemingly innocuous applications such as web browsers and PDF document viewers. This implies that there is a need for a well-balanced amount of security awareness in all software development projects right from the beginning.Most software developers are not primarily interested in (or knowledgeable about) security; for decades, the focus has been on implementing as much functionality as possible before the deadline, and then patch whatever bugs there may be when it\u2019s time for the next release or hotfix. However, it is slowly beginning to dawn on the software engineering community that security is important also for software whose primary function is not related to security. There are clear indications that significant cost savings and other advantages are achieved when security analysis and secure engineering practices are introduced early in the development cycle, and that the number of serious security defects can be significantly reduced with a minimum of extra costs. However, having a clear security focus is not easy, and today there are very few people that master both the art of software and security engineering.

{"title": "A Security Architecture for an Open Broadband Access Network\n", "abstract": " Europe is experiencing a rapid growth in residential broadband coverage, but due to usage patterns and cost structures, only a fraction of the available bandwidth is actually being consumed. This implies that most residential broadband subscribers have excess capacity, and the idea of the Open Broadband Access Network (OBAN) project is that this capacity can be shared with passers-by. In order for the residential broadband subscribers to open up their networks, and for the potential wireless customers to sign up for OBAN service, the security of both parties must be ensured. OBAN needs to solve the problems posed by the fact that a visiting OBAN user and a residential access point operator have no pre-existing trust relationship. This paper describes an architecture that achieves this. In addition, the architecture ensures that all participating parties are able to prove the amount of traffic transferred in any given OBAN session. This enables a broader range of business models with respect to charging of visiting OBAN users, remuneration of residential subscribers, and cooperation between service providers. This may in turn result in new business opportunities.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["365"]}
