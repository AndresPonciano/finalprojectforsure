{"title": "Agile portfolio management: An empirical perspective on the practice in use\n", "abstract": " Agile project management methods revolutionized the way how software projects are executed and organized. The question, however, on how to enable agility outside of individual projects and help larger organizations to compete with small entrepreneurial companies requires further attention. As a possible perspective, project portfolio management provides a global view on resources and their distribution across individual projects according to strategic choices. Based on 30 interviews conducted in 14 large European organizations this study contributes to the understanding of agile project management methods applied in IT project portfolios. First, we empirically identify the domains of practice. Then, guided by literature and our data we discuss the characteristics and implications of the agile portfolio management practice in our case organizations.", "num_citations": "218\n", "authors": ["1380"]}
{"title": "Necessary and neglected? An empirical study of internal documentation in agile software development teams\n", "abstract": " When compared to traditional development methods, agile development practices are associated with more direct communication and less documentation. However, few empirical studies exist that investigate the role of documentation in agile development teams. We thus employed a questionnaire to measure the perceptions of a group of agile practitioners with regard to the documentation in their projects. We obtained responses from 79 agile software development professionals and 8 teams in 13 different countries. Our findings include that over half of developers in our data set find documentation important or even very important but that too little documentation is available in their projects. Agile practitioners do not seem to agree with the agile principle that\" The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.\" We were able to validate\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "103\n", "authors": ["1380"]}

Based upon the qualitative model of Moe et al. [11], we contribute a quantitative questionnaire organized along five dimensions of agile teamwork analogous to the \u201cFive Factor Model\u201d in contemporary psychology. To test this survey tool and its alignment with existing studies, we have executed an empirical validation of the tool with 79 individuals and 8 international Scrum teams. We find that inter-team agreement on the factors is high and that the survey tool is found very useful. The instrument offers a comparable measure to agile teams and gives recommendations for each of the factors helping to understand individual as well as organizational level barriers.", "num_citations": "51\n", "authors": ["1380"]}
{"title": "Documentation work in agile teams: The role of documentation formalism in achieving a sustainable practice\n", "abstract": " As its second guiding principle, agile software development promotes working software over comprehensive documentation. In this paper we investigate alignment between two different documentation practices and agile development. We report upon an experiment conducted to explore the impact of formalism and media type on various dimensions of documentation practice in agile teams. 28 students in 8 teams were divided into two groups: SAD and UML. Group SAD was to update and deliver their high-level software architecture in form of a textual description defined by RUP templates. Group UML was instructed to update and deliver their low-level software design in form of UML models. Our results show that iterative documentation practices led to more extensive and more detailed textual documentation.

In this paper we address this issue by discussing our experiences with teaching software engineering practices and their continuous improvement. By designing a graduate course we embed an intensive coaching routine based upon agile practices with research activities to leverage knowledge of students and coaches. As a concrete example of an embedded research project we conduct an experiment on the impact of two different meeting routines on the teams satisfaction with information exchange. Our results show that the intensive coaching in individual teams is shorter in nature and more appealing to the students.

During project handovers, for example, loss of knowledge has been indicated and critics of agile methods point at a lack of documentation. In this paper we take the perspective of patterns of human action, looking at the actions the teams take and the artifacts they use during a software project handover. Our results from 30 teams in small to large size projects cover the perceptions of a variety of roles and indicate that the adoption is a learning process in three interdependent phases: Environment, System and Architecture. The participants in our study perceived the biggest gaps in the usefulness of available design and requirements documentation.

However, acquiring the necessary skills and spirit is troublesome for many organizations as they rely heavily on a distinct mindset and experience that can only be acquired in the process. Literature indicates that serious games can help to bridge that gap. In this paper we take the example of agile project management methods to understand how games are applied to support the acquisition of agile and entrepreneurial capabilities. In an explorative study, we conducted qualitative interviews with game developers, business consultants, and agile coaches from nine different companies, and conducted desk research on available open source serious games.

{"title": "Managing weak ties in collaborative work\n", "abstract": " Information and communication technology, ICT, has introduced new styles of working. Based on ICT, these styles have a strong virtual flavour, ranging from flexwork, hot-desking and telework to virtual teams and virtual organizations. The virtuality of the styles has impacts on how employees within an organization perform their task and how they interact with colleagues, clients and supervisors, but the impact is not yet well understood. 24 board level executives from 18 Swiss knowledge firms have been interviewed about virtual work arrangements and the change these bring in networking dynamics within their organization. The contribution of the paper is that new networking dynamics can be related to complement the theory on weak, strong and absent ties. More in particular, virtual networks can be located in weak ties, thereby making strong ties less important.

{"title": "Evolution of scrum transcending business domains and the future of agile project management\n", "abstract": " The growing popularity of Agile management methods has led to their application to a number of areas inside, but also outside, the software development domain. However, despite many practitioner reports, research exploring whether and how Agile practices have been applied in domains beyond software development has been rather patchy with little empirical evidence. What is there behind the hype and how can other domains learn from it? To address this gap in the research, we present the findings of our study on the application of Agile management practices in other domains, including an outlook towards a potential expansion enabling Business Agility. To practitioners, this study presents examples of Scrum applied outside the software development domain including concrete practices applied. To researchers, it presents an empirical starting point for further exploration.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1380"]}

While original Scrum caters to co-located teams working on a single project, multi-project Scrum teams are a day-to-day reality, especially in small organizations. Multitasking across projects is frequently associated with loss of effectiveness, but this assumption is not sufficiently supported by empirical evidence. In order to better understand the phenomenon, we review existing literature across scientific domains and execute an action research project.

{"title": "Innovation Labs: A Taxonomy of Four Different Types\n", "abstract": " Today's increasing pace of change and intense competition places demands on organizations to use a different approach to innovation, going beyond the incremental innovation that is typically developed within the core of the organization. As an option to escape the existing beliefs of the core organization, innovation labs are used to develop more discontinuous innovation. Despite the abundance of these so-called innovation labs in practice, researchers have devoted little effort to scrutinizing the concept and to provide managers with a framework for exploiting this form of innovation. In this paper, we aim to perform an empirical investigation and to create a consensus around the concept of innovation labs. To do so, we conducted a multiple case study in large international organizations with a total of 31 interviews of an average length of 70 minutes.
