If the logical architecture represents an ambient assisted living (AAL) ecosystem, such representation is a complex task due to the existence of interrelated multidomains, which, most of the time, results in incomplete and incoherent user requirements. In this chapter, we present the results obtained when applying process-level modeling techniques to the derivation of the logical architecture for a real industrial AAL project. We adopt a V-Model\u2013based approach that expresses the AAL requirements in a process-level perspective, instead of the traditional product-level view.

{"title": "On the transformation of UML models for service-oriented software\n", "abstract": " The main aim of this paper is to present how to trans-form user requirements models into a software architecture for mobile applications. The technique (called \u201c4SRS\u201d) is essentially based on the mapping of UML use case dia-grams into UML object diagrams. UML sequence, activity, and state diagrams and other artifacts can also be consid-ered within the transformation decisions. The applicability of this technique is illustrated by presenting some results from an e-government mobile application. The development of mobile applications typically follow a service-oriented approach. A service is a software entity running on one or more machines and providing a particu-lar type of function to a priori unknown clients. These ser-vices must communicate with each other, whose combina-tion makes up a service-oriented architecture. The commu-nication can involve either simple data passing or it could involve two or more services coordinating some activity. Some means of connecting services to each other is needed, so workflow is a critical part of making services effective. When those services react to changes on user context, ap-plication are context-aware. For mobile applications, the definition of the underly-ing service-oriented software architecture must consider the services themselves as user requirements, as well as the mo-bile operators entry-points and the final clients interfaces, and use them to characterize the platform. 1.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1147"]}

A common challenge is to have a proper balance between the project's agility and architecture. This shared understanding gains more importance in large-scale contexts composed by multiple agile teams. Teams must clearly define their work scope and interactions with other teams, and architects must design a proper amount of design.

A greenhouse experiment with four Eucalyptus clones was installed, and after initial growth exposed to N omission for 21 d, followed by N resupply in nutrient solution for 14 d. Nitrogen omission decreased the total N and photosynthetic pigments, net photosynthesis and photochemical dissipation, and increased enzyme activity especially in leaves and the gene expression in leaves and roots. Nitrogen resupply decreased these variations, indicating recovery. The total N concentration was highly and significantly correlated with net photosynthesis, enzyme activity, expression of genes GS2;1 and Gln1;3 in the leaves and AMT1;2 in the roots, contents of chlorophyll a and b, and photochemical energy dissipation.

Along with the focus and use of models, software development processes are fundamental to efficient development efforts of successful software systems.

{"title": "Anonymization of Burned-in Annotations in Ultrasound Imaging\n", "abstract": " Most of the mcdical imaging modalities compliant with the Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) standard are currently conveying patient information and other study related information as visual overlay objects on top of the proper imaging contents. Making these image data publicly available for teaching platforms, clinical trials or maintenance support requires some degree of anonymization. In these cases, identity attributes in a given Service-Object Pair (SOP) instance may be simply removed, encrypted or even replaced by dummy values. All these action will take place at the header of the associated DICOM files by changing the proper tag-value data structures and ensuring the overall file integrity. These procedures alone don't ensure full anonymization in some imaging modalities like ultrasound because identifying annotations are sill conveyed in a burned in manner.

{"title": "Introduction to special issue: model-based development methodologies\n", "abstract": " Developing software solutions is not an easy task. Brown [1] names the following difficulties arising in the development of software solutions:(1) understanding highly complex business domains and management of the huge development effort;(2) time-to-market pressures;(3) complexity of target software platforms involving not only new hot technologies, but also a diverse and complex assortment of legacy technology infrastructure frequently kept with poor documentation. The effective development of today\u2019s software applications requires consistent effort to research better approaches, languages, techniques and tools that allow us to face the continuously increasing of complexity. Today, when building large software systems, the main challenge for software developers is to \u201chandle complexity and to adapt quickly to changes\u201d[2]. Model-based development methodologies can be a response to this challenge, as they can \u201cincrease productivity and reduce time-to-market\u201d, by developing concepts closer to the problem domain than \u201cthose offered by programming languages\u201d[3].", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1147"]}
{"title": "From Model-Driven Design to Resource Management for Distributed Embedded Systems: IFIP TC 10 Working Conference on Distributed and Parallel Embedded Systems (DIPES 2006\u00a0\u2026\n", "abstract": " Embedded computing systems have started to carry out the key control functions in diverse domains such as telecommunications, automotive electronics, avionics and even complete industrial manufacturing lines. Traditionally, such embedded control systems have been implemented in a monolithic, centralized manner. However, distributed and parallel solutions have been steadily gaining popularity. In a distributed setup, the control task is carried out by a number of controllers distributed over the entire system and interconnected as a network by communication components such as field buses. More demanding local control applications require controllers based on parallel architectures or processors with dedicated co-processors. Distribution and parallelism in embedded system design increase the engineering challenges and demand new development methods and tools. From Model-Driven Design to Resource Management for Distributed Embedded Systems contains 16 original contributions as well as 12 invited papers by distinguished invited speakers. These papers were presented at the Working Conference on Distributed and Parallel Embedded Systems (DIPES 2006), which was held in October 2006 in Braga, Portugal, and sponsored by the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP). This volume covers the following very timely topics: model-driven design, test and evolution of embedded systems, timing analysis and predictability, scheduling, allocation, communication and resource management in distributed real-time systems.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1147"]}

{"title": "A Multi-Level Design Pattern for Embedded Software\n", "abstract": " It is a common practice amongst programmers to construct parts of software programs by imitating parts of programs constructed by more experienced professionals. This \u201clearn by example\u201d approach can be applied at the design level by using patterns as sets of rules and recommendations to solve well-defined tasks within the development of computer-based systems. This paper describes the multi-level ICIS pattern, to be used at various design levels of industrial control-based information systems, where embedded devices are networked to interact with the industrial processes and equipment. The proposed pattern is described using several UML diagrams.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1147"]}
