However, there is a concern as to whether or not these websites are usable and meet the expectations of their intended users. This study measured the usability level of university websites from the perspective of students, using a WEBUSE questionnaire based on research model of measuring website usability based on factors of content, organization and readability, navigation and links, user interface design, performance and effectiveness. The results identified the strengths and weaknesses associated with each website. Therefore, this model can serve as a guideline for evaluating website usability in order to know if a particular website has met the need of its intended users and also assist the web designers in building more usable university websites.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["2013"]}
{"title": "Survey on Requirement Elicitation Techniques: It\u2019s Effect on Software Engineering\n", "abstract": " Requirement Elicitation is one of the important factors in developing any new application. Most of systems fail just because of wrong elicitation practice. A requirement may be defined as a demand or need. In software engineering, a requirement is a description of what a system should do. System may have dozen to thousands of requirements. Without the elicitation techniques it is impossible to find out requirements and the needs of the developing system. It provides base for the developer to construct a structure of proposed system keeping in view the wish list of stake holders. This paper is based on understanding elicitation techniques and their usage in real time applications, by implementing the Elicitation techniques for knowing the needs of stakeholder so that system developer can get clear view of requirement for the developing system. Furthermore this paper provide the flexibility to requirements engineers to know the characteristics and effectiveness of every techniques, it will serve as a guideline in selecting a particular elicitation technique in respect to the type of application and situation.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["2013"]}
{"title": "Immediate/batch mode scheduling algorithms for grid computing: A review\n", "abstract": " Immediate/on-line and Batch mode heuristics are two methods used for scheduling in the computational grid environment. In the former, task is mapped onto a resource as soon as it arrives at the scheduler, while the later, tasks are not mapped onto resource as they arrive, instead they are collected into a set that is examined for mapping at prescheduled times called mapping events. This paper reviews the literature concerning Minimum Execution Time (MET) along with Minimum Completion Time (MCT) algorithms of online mode heuristics and more emphasis on Min-Min along with Max-Min algorithms of batch mode heuristics, while focusing on the details of their basic concepts, approaches, techniques, and open problems.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["2013"]}

{"title": "Staff Monitoring System Using Biometric\n", "abstract": " Millions of naira is been lost annually in organizations across Nigeria as a result of poor services been rendered to various clients in organizations, this is due to the facts that proper attendance management system is not in place in various organizations across the country. The management of staff's attendance record daily has become a difficult challenge. The effort required in generating monthly report and also knowing the cumulative numbers of staffs has become a major task as manual assessment produces errors, and also it is time consuming. For the stated reason, an effective electronic staff attendance system using fingerprint is introduced in this work. This system will take attendance electronically with the aid of a fingerprint scanner (fingerprint device) and the attendance records are stored in the application storage unit (database). Attendance is marked after staff identification. For identification of staff, a fingerprint scanner is used. This process eradicates the need for stationary materials for record keeping; this will eliminate the issues of impersonation. This paper proposes the use of fingerprint biometric system to eliminate the problem being faced by traditional paper and pencil attendance register being provided in organizations.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["2013"]}

{"title": "An Extended Min-Min Scheduling Algorithm in Cloud Computing\n", "abstract": " Cloudlet scheduling seems to be the most fundamental problem of cloud computing as per Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Proper scheduling in cloud lead to load balancing, minimization of makespan, and adequate resources utilization. To meet consumers\u2019 expectations, the execution of cloudlet simultaneously is required. Many algorithms have been implemented to solve the cloud scheduling problem. This include Min-Min which gave priority to cloudlet with minimum completion time. Min-Min scheduling algorithm has two clear weaknesses; a high value of makespan being generated and low resource utilization. To address these problems, this research proposes an Extended Min-Min Algorithm which assign cloudlet base on the differences between maximum and minimum execution time of cloudlets. Cloudsim was used to implement and compare the performances of the proposed algorithm with the benchmarks. The results of the extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm is able to performed better in terms of makespan minimization in compare to the existing heuristics.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["2013"]}
{"title": "Geographical Information System (GIS) Based Electrical Energy Theft Detector Device\n", "abstract": " The paper is a response to the urgency needed to checkmate commercial losses in electrical distribution system in Nigeria. Root causes of electrical commercial losses were investigated by field work carried out on sampled customers of 33kV Keteregi feeder in Minna, Niger State of Nigeria. Questioners were administered by interviewing customers. GIS coordinates of customers\u2019 building were carefully taken using GPS receiver, and other information such as customer\u2019s name, building type and meter inspection were collated. The results of the field survey revealed that most electrical energy theft is by meter bypass. A further step was taken by designing and simulating theft detector circuitry using Proteus electrical design software. The design was implemented using microcontroller for multifunction. Microcontroller checks for difference in the input and output to a prototype prepaid meter. The difference in the input and output voltage of the prototype prepaid meter indicates meter by-pass which means electrical energy theft detected. The data such as customer\u2019s names, physical address and GIS coordinates were encoded in the memory of the microcontroller. The design implementation was tested by bypassing a prototype prepaid meter. The result obtained from bypass was noticed as Short Message Sent (SMS) through the Global System of Mobile Telephoning (GSM) interfacing the microcontroller. This shows that the GIS based electrical theft detector device designed and implemented was able to detect electrical energy loss through meter bypass.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["2013"]}
