{"title": "Systemic management of architectural decisions in enterprise architecture planning. four dimensions and three abstraction levels\n", "abstract": " This paper presents a process model for the management of architectural decisions in enterprise architecture planning. First, decisions are made at the enterprise level, with strategic business considerations on the enterprise information, systems and technology strategy and governance issues. The next step is to define the domains, to then go on with domain architecture decisions. At the systems level, the enterprise and domain architecture decisions are collected and converted into architecture descriptions accurate in precision, form and detail to be given as input to the information systems development process, following the architectural planning. The model is derived from previous work and empirical findings in three large organizations, where the enterprise architecture and enterprise systems have been developed. This case study contributes with considerations on the domains, their definition, and produces\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "150\n", "authors": ["1378"]}

Several EA process models have been put forward, which have in common the idea of comprehensive EA management and development that is generic, cyclic and ongoing in a user organization. The suggested models are of varying level of abstraction. It is not simple to select the right issues from them for a restricted development effort. An ICT services provider needs a process model to follow in EA consulting and development projects. This approach is also needed for incremental EA development by user organizations. Starting with the suggested EA process models and with findings in IS literature, we create a generic process model for EA management. Based on this model, and supported with a case study, we then develop a process model for discrete EA development\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "105\n", "authors": ["1378"]}

{"title": "Towards a contingency framework for engineering an enterprise architecture planning method\n", "abstract": " Enterprise architecture (EA) has a key role in managing and relating business strategies and processes, information systems, and IC technologies. EA planning devises an EA plan with development steps to make necessary enhancements to the current state of the affairs in EA. Accomplishing EA planning in a systematic and efficient manner requires the availability of frameworks and methods suitable to the situation at hand. The selection and adaptation of these methodical artifacts for the use of EA planning is often quite challenging in practice. We argue that the contingency approach can help in these activities of method engineering (ME), and present a contingency framework (named here EACon, EA Contingencies) for engineering an EA planning method. The framework is composed of three layers: the topmost layer pertains to a method engineering context, the next lower layer corresponds to an EA planning context, and the lowest layer stands for an EA development context. Due to the largeness of the framework, this paper focuses on the topmost layer. The contingency framework has been derived from ISD contingency factors, conceptualizations of the ME domain, EA critical success factors, and experience obtained from a large national project of engineering an EA planning method for state administration.", "num_citations": "39\n", "authors": ["1378"]}

Management, planning and development of the organizational ICT are no more a task for the ICT experts only. The expertise of both business and ICT specialists is needed to align ICT deployment with organizational goals, ensuring appropriateness of related investments with respect to the enterprise resources. However, collaboration between the business and ICT communities of practice is perceived as a challenge. Enterprise architecture (EA) proposes a holistic approach to the management of organizational ICT systems and infrastructure.By structuring the collaboration, it interlinks the contributions from different communities of practice to the decision making process. From both IS and EA literature, a common framework of reference is derived and validated through practitioner experience. Distinct levels of abstraction in the framework accommodate the concerns of different decision makers: managerial overview for the whole enterprise, business operations management at the level of the activity domains, and the systems design and development concerns for the implementers. An understanding of the ICT management and planning in the context of a deploying organization is deduced as a prerequisite for an eligible EA methodology.

{"title": "Key issues in enterprise architecture adoption in the public sector\n", "abstract": " This paper examines the challenges of enterprise architecture (EA) adoption in public sector organisations. So far, demonstrating the benefits of EA has appeared difficult in this context, and the results in transforming public sector remain modest: Both the penetration and the maturity of EA appear rather low. In the academia, however, the adoption of EA has gained less interest than the EA development and methodologies. Hence, there is a need for research on what are the challenges of EA adoption, and how to overcome them. This paper presents the results of an expert survey on the challenges of EA adoption in the Finnish public sector. The analysis of quantitative data, supported with a qualitative data, reveals three interrelated factors: Resistance towards EA, Relevant EA goals, and the EA practices in use. Managing the identified key issues classified in these three broad concepts would be the prerequisite for institutionalising EA and making it a legitimate practice. The findings extend the current knowledge of the public sector EA with practicable ideas how to increase the level of penetration and maturity.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["1378"]}

A number of prior studies have noticed this gap in the EA field of research, and called for a strengthening of the theory of EA. Variegated systems approaches have been suggested as a theory base.

{"title": "Selection criteria for enterprise architecture methods\n", "abstract": " This study proposes key selection criteria for enterprise architecture methods based on a case study of the Finnish National Enterprise Architecture (NEA). Enterprise Architecture (EA) planning is increasingly important as ICT is today a strategic business enabler. Enterprise Architecture is a managerial tool to align ICT with business development and a communication tool to ensure commitment and to prepare for organizational change. A multitude of EA methods have been proposed and some of them have also been adopted in practice. However, no market leaders or standard EA methods have emerged. The approaches of different EA methods vary, and their support for EA planning varies accordingly. Therefore, the EA method selection has substantial consequences for the organization. Evaluating and selecting the best suitable method is the highly important first step in EA planning initiatives. This case study collects evidence from a large EA method development project within a government ICT management program for the entire organization of the Finnish Government. The conducted requirements analysis for the EA method in this project as well as previous studies in EA and method development indicate that the most important criteria for EA method selection are related to the fundamental role of EA as a communication tool. Complexity and abstraction level of an EA method should strongly correlate with the EA experience of the future EA method users. We assume that these key requirements are common to most organizations, because they are related to the main purpose of the EA method and framework: communication.

The aim of this work was to draw a picture on how learners think of their own learning needs, and how learning opportunity designers see themselves as providing for learners' learning needs. Requirements for good practice on connecting learning needs and opportunities are discussed and the main requirement is that the overall process clearly needs to involve both the learner and the provider. The overall patterns visible in the responses suggested that there were two separate kinds of relevant learning opportunities, each with a different way of relating to differing learning needs. The first kind of learning is where a specific qualification is necessary in order for the learner to pursue his or her chosen career path. The second kind is where it is not a specific qualification, but a specific skill, competence, or set of skills that are perceived to be needed by the learner. In the first kind of learning, participants, made it explicit that the detailed learning outcomes were not significant, and did not play a part in the selection of the learning opportunity.
