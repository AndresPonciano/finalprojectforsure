{"title": "Principles of computer-assisted imaging in autoradiographic densitometry\n", "abstract": " [en] Computer-assisted image analyzers are becoming common tools in neuroscience laboratories. Two categories of image analyzer can be distinguished by the types of information made available to the computer. One class of device digitizes postional information while an operator traces features of a microscope image or photomicrograph. The resulting data are used by the computer to provide morphometric descriptions of the features. A second category of image analyzer, the computer-assisted imaging device (CID), does not require operator interaction during the digitizing process. Rather, a scanning digitizer transforms the image into numbers containing one intensity (z) and two positional (chi, y) image dimensions. These are stored in a dedicated image memory from which the image can be accessed for display or processing. As computing power decreases in cost, CIDs are finding increasing application to cytometry, stereology, morphometry, and autoradiographic densitometry. This chapter discusses some principles involved in CID densitometry.

{"title": "N-tuple compression: A novel method for compression of branch instruction traces\n", "abstract": " Branch predictors and processor front-ends have been the focus of a number of computer architecture studies. Typically they are evaluated separately from other components using trace-driven simulation based on instruction traces. To offer a faithful representation of processor\u2019s workload the traces are very large, and hence difficult to manage if kept in uncompressed form. In order to reduce simulation overhead due to the processing of non-branch instructions, we propose a new form of instruction trace, the Branch Instruction Trace (BIT), suitable for simulation of dynamic branch prediction mechanisms, fetch engines, and trace caches. A novel method for lossless trace compression, which can be applied to both ASCII and binary BIT traces, is also introduced. The proposed method relies on the trace record table (TRT) consisting of unique trace records. The trace size can be reduced by replacing each trace record by its ID in the TRT, since the number of unique trace records is much less than the trace length. We further extend this idea and replace an entire N-tuple of BIT records with its ID from the N-Tuple Record Table (N-TRT). The analysis shows that for a subset of SPEC CPU2000 benchmarks 8-tuple replacement yields significant compression ratio (40 for binary traces and 32-43 for ASCII traces), while keeping N-TRT size reasonable. When combined with the common compression tools such as gzip the compression ratio is 195-3888 for binary, and 306-4604 for ASCII traces, while gzipped-only traces achieve compression ratio 20-201 for binary, and 20-216 for ASCII traces.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["1484"]}

{"title": "Video Processing for Motion Tracking of Safety Critical Systems\n", "abstract": " The authors have been developing a laboratory for teaching safety critical software development. The laboratory currently utilizes an HO model train system, which provides for easy understanding of the operational and safety requirements. In earlier years, mechanical, magnetic and optical sensors have been used to provide location data to the scheduling and safety software. However, this approach has grown to the level that over 1000 wire segments need to be maintained for correct operation. This paper discusses the use of video tracking software to significantly reduce the number of electrical contacts subject to failure, and to provide more flexibility to the system as the track layout changes.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1484"]}

While useful this information lacks the \u2018depth\u2019 available from qualitative examination. In this first of three papers it is suggested that automatic methods can be developed to capture and describe image structure in the descriptive terminology of a metallographer. The goal of such work is to permit quantification of formerly descriptive parameters. A preliminary stage in image analysis is the segmentation of an image into homogeneous regions in preparation for further processing. It is demonstrated that metallographic images (in this case binary eutectic alloys of aluminium) can be segmented using measures of the spatial organization, or texture, present in an image. A weighted average of the Hadamard transform of an image is shown to give a local\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1484"]}

UAH OnTrack mimics capabilities of the congressional mandated Positive Train Control system, which will allow centralized analysis and control of US trains in case of imminent danger. The system provides location and velocity information to model trains in GPS challenged environments such as real trains might find in tunnels, urban environments and underground rail yards and stations. It also provides an opportunity to develop advanced scheduling algorithms mimicking the properties of the US airspace Required Navigation Performance capabilities by allowing trains to follow more closely than the traditional block scheduling system. It also provides a platform for development and verification of robust algorithms for monitoring of system safety and security.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1484"]}

The utility of simulators in software verification is limited in terms of their level of fidelity to real-world hardware and driving conditions.

{"title": "Agile systems integration process\n", "abstract": " This paper presents an adaptation of an Agile development process specifically tailored towards software systems integration projects. The proposed Agile Systems Integration Process has been piloted in a senior-level software engineering studio course using an HO gauge model of a Positive Train Control system as the cyber-physical target hardware. The software developed by the students included five components: train scheduling, interactive display control, walk-about tablet manual controller, track geometry and connectivity input and safety monitoring software. Approximately 30 students were divided into ten teams with two teams competing to build each of the five components. This paper discusses what aspects of the proposed Agile systems integration process worked successfully and several important lessons learned to improve future performance.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1484"]}
{"title": "Positive Train Control: Concepts, Implementations, and Challenges\n", "abstract": " For over a hundred years train control has been largely distributed. To prevent collisions, railway track systems were divided into a series blocks ranging in length from a few miles to tens of miles, and a signaling system was developed to constrain movement of trains between blocks. The imprecise nature of position information afforded by the block-oriented system required as a general rule that no two trains were allowed to occupy the same block. The advent of centralized Positive Train Control (PTC) coupled with precision navigation and remotely controllable switches and signals allow for the development of more optimal scheduling algorithms for improved safety and railway throughput. This paper outlines key aspects of PTC deployment, describes some of the new rules and conditions that must be formulated, potential control systems for implementing these rules, and a PTC test bed currently in development\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1484"]}
{"title": "ICVision real-time autostereoscopic stereogram display\n", "abstract": " This paper describes in detail the historical development of the ICVision system which is based on the partial pixel architecture. The partial pixel architecture allows the realization of three-dimensional (3-D) displays that are functionally equivalent to realtime holographic stereograms. As such, this architecture permits the simultaneous presentation of multiple stereoscopic images so that motion parallax is discernible in the resultant 3-D scene. The key innovation of the architecture is that each pixel is subdivided into partial pixels, which in turn can be implemented as individual diffraction gratings.    In addition to describing the partial pixel architecture, this paper presents the details of several demonstration devices including a static device developed for image evaluation, and two dynamic systems based on liquid crystal devices.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1484"]}
{"title": "Evaluation and performance analysis of the process cache: a partitioned multi-process secondary cache\n", "abstract": " This paper describes an advance in multiprocess cache system design called the process cache in which the secondary cache has segments dedicated to each process. This approach is in contrast to a monolithic secondary cache in which every process' data can be distributed throughout the secondary cache. The process cache system is equally applicable to instruction and data caches, however, its performance is evaluated only for an instruction cache in this paper. The goal of the process cache architecture is to improve program performance in environments which have high context switch rates and long tertiary memory access times.This paper presents an instruction only trace-driven simulation that demonstrates that for long tertiary memory latencies (10 \u03bcs) and short context switch intervals (1 ms) the process cache architecture significantly (11\u201314%) outperforms monolithic secondary cache architectures\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1484"]}
