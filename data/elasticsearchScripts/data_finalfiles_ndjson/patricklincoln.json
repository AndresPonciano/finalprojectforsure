{"title": "All About Maude-A High-Performance Logical Framework: How to Specify, Program, and Verify Systems in Rewriting Logic\n", "abstract": " This book gives a comprehensive account of Maude, a language and system based on rewriting logic. Many examples are used throughout the book to illustrate the main ideas and features of Maude, and its many possible uses. Maude modules are rewrite theories. Computation with such modules is-cient deduction by rewriting. Because of its logical basis and its initial model semantics, aMaudemodulede? nesaprecisemathematicalmodel. Thismeans that Maude and its formal tool environment can be used in three, mutually reinforcing ways:\u2022 as a declarative programming language;\u2022 as an executable formal speci? cation language; and\u2022 as a formal veri? cation system. Maude\u2019s rewriting logic is simple, yet very expressive. This gives Maude good representational capabilities as a semantic framework to formally represent a wide range of systems, including models of concurrency, distributed al-rithms, network protocols, semantics of programming languages, and models of cell biology. Rewriting logic is also an expressive universal logic, making Maude a? exible logical framework in which many di? erent logics and-ference systems can be represented and mechanized. This makes Maude a useful metatool to build many other tools, including those in its own formal tool environment. Thanks to the logic\u2019s simplicity and the use of advanced semi-compilation techniques, Maude has a high-performance implementation, making it competitive with other declarative programming languages.", "num_citations": "1445\n", "authors": ["500"]}
{"title": "Architectural support for copy and tamper resistant software\n", "abstract": " Although there have been attempts to develop code transformations that yield tamper-resistant software, no reliable software-only methods are known. This paper studies the hardware implementation of a form of execute-only memory (XOM) that allows instructions stored in memory to be executed but not otherwise manipulated. To support XOM code we use a machine that supports internal compartments---a process in one compartment cannot read data from another compartment. All data that leaves the machine is encrypted, since we assume external memory is not secure. The design of this machine poses some interesting trade-offs between security, efficiency, and flexibility. We explore some of the potential security issues as one pushes the machine to become more efficient and flexible. Although security carries a performance penalty, our analysis indicates that it is possible to create a normal multi-tasking\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "973\n", "authors": ["500"]}
{"title": "Principles of maude\n", "abstract": " This paper introduces the basic concepts of the rewriting logic language Maude and discusses its implementation. Maude is a wide-spectrum language supporting formal specification, rapid prototyping, and parallel programming. Maude's rewriting logic paradigm includes the functional and object-oriented paradigms as sublanguages. The fact that rewriting logic is reflective leads to novel metaprogramming capabilities that can greatly increase software reusability and adaptability. Control of the rewriting computation is achieved through internal strategy languages defined inside the logic. Maude's rewrite engine is designed with the explicit goal of being highly extensible and of supporting rapid prototyping and formal methods applications, but its semi-compilation techniques allow it to meet those goals with good performance.", "num_citations": "375\n", "authors": ["500"]}

We present a general technique for the efficient implementation of such operations based on an encoding method. The effect of the encoding is to plunge the given ordering into a boolean lattice of binary words, leading to an almost constant time complexity of the lattice operations. A first method is described based on a transitive closure approach. Then a more space-efficient method minimizing code-word length is described. Finally a powerful grouping technique called modulation is presented, which drastically reduces code space while keeping all three lattice operations highly efficient.

This allows a clear distinction between functional evaluation and logical deduction. The former is based on the \u03bb-calculus, and the latter on Horn clause resolution. In clear contrast with equation-solving approaches, our model supports higher-order function evaluation and efficient compilation of both functional and logic programming expressions, without being plagued by non-deterministic term-rewriting. In addition, residuation lends itself naturally to process synchronization and constrained search. Besides unification (equations), other residuations may be any ground-decidable goal, such as mutual exclusion (inequations), and comparisons (inequalities).

{"title": "Operational aspects of linear lambda calculus\n", "abstract": " Linear logic is a resource-aware logic that is based on an analysis of the classical proof rules of contraction (copying) and weakening (throwing away). Several previous researchers have studied functional programming languages derived from linear logic according to the\\formulas-as-types\" correspondence. In languages with linear logic types, one may hope that traditional implementation problems in functional languages such as update in place could be simpli ed by careful use of the type system. In this paper, we prove that the standard sequent calculus proof system of linear logic is equivalent to a natural deduction style proof system. Using the natural deduction system, we investigate the pragmatic problems of type inference and type safety for a linear lambda calculus. Although terms do not have a single most-general type (for either the standard sequent presentation or our natural deduction formulation), there is a set of most-general types that may be computed using unication. The natural deduction system also facilitates the proof that the type of an expression is preserved by any evaluation step. We also describe an execution model and implementation, using a variant of the\\three-instruction machine\"(tim). A novel feature of the implementation is that we distinguish garbagecollected\\non-linear\" memory from\\linear\" memory, which does not require garbage collection and where it is possible to do secure update in place.", "num_citations": "91\n", "authors": ["500"]}

Together, these features provide a convenient and versatile power of abstraction for very high-level expression of constrained data structures.

Therefore, obvious convenience is offered by LIFE for experimentation to the computational linguist, who becomes relieved from burdensome yet extrinsic programming complications.

{"title": "Low-density parity check codes for error correction in nanoscale memory\n", "abstract": " The continued scaling of photolithographic fabrication techniques down to 32 nanometers and beyond faces enormous technology and economic barriers. Selfassembled devices such as silicon nanowires or carbon nanotubes show promise to not only achieve aggressive dimensions, but to help address power and other gating issues in system architecture, while potentially helping contain rampant increases in fabrication capital costs. However, assembling high-quality, largescale nanoelectronic circuits (eg, with Langmuir-Blodgett or related methods) has proven challenging. Among the major challenges are extremely high defect and fault rates in assembled devices. Apart from fabrication errors, nanoscale devices are also more prone to soft errors than microscale devices. Current-day microscale devices (eg, gates, PLAs, memories) constructed using top-down lithographic techniques have error rates of less than 1%[10].

{"title": "Algorithmic aspects of type inference with subtypes\n", "abstract": " We study the complexity of type inference for programming languages with subtypes. There are three language variations that effect the problem:(i) basic functions may have polymorphic or more limited types,(ii) the subtype hierarchy may be fixed or vary as a result of subtype declarations within a program, and (iii) the subtype hierarchy may be an arbitrary partial order or may have a more restricted form, such as a tree or lattice. The naive algorithm for infering a most general polymorphic type, undervariable subtype hypotheses, requires deterministic exponential time. If we fix the subtype ordering, this upper bound grows to nondeterministic exponential time. We show that it is NP-hard to decide whether a lambda term has a type with respect to a fixed subtype hierarchy (involving only atomic type names).

Earlier work by Kanovich showed that propositional multiplicative linear logic is NP-complete. With Natarajan Shankar, the first author developed a simplified proof for the propositional case. The structure of this simplified proof is utilized here with a new encoding which uses only constants. The end product is the somewhat surprising result that simply evaluating expressions in true, false, and, and or in multiplicative linear logic (1, \u22a5 \u2297 ) is NP-complete.

{"title": "Specification, transformation, and programming of concurrent systems in rewriting logic\n", "abstract": " This paper proposes a declarative paradigm in which parallelism is implicit and machine-independent, and the programs so developed are intrinsically parallel. This paradigm is obtained by generalizing the notion of rewriting to make it more widely applicable and capable of expressing not only functional computations but also a wide variety of parallel computations that are highly nonfunctional in nature. The generalization in question is provided by rewriting logic, a logic of change in which the states of a system are understood as algebraically axiomatized data structures, and the basic local changes that can concurrently occur in a system are axiomatized as rewrite rules that correspond to local patterns that, when present in the state of a system, can change into other patterns. Simple Maude, a carefully designed sublanguage of rewriting logic supporting three types of rewriting| term, graph, and object-oriented|, is then proposed as a machine-independent parallel programming language that can be e ciently implemented in parallel on many di erent machines. The adequacy of term, graph, and object-oriented rewriting to naturally express many di erent parallel programming problems is illustrated with examples. Several program transformation techniques mapping rewriting logic speci cations into Simple Maude programs are discussed using representative examples. The incorporation of modules containing conventional code or special subsystems or devices within Simple Maude is also discussed.

To detect exposures to the various pathogens more rapidly, especially during these early stages, we evaluated a suite of host responses to biological threat agents using global gene expression profiling on complementary DNA arrays. We found that certain gene expression patterns were unique to each pathogen and that other gene changes occurred in response to multiple agents, perhaps relating to the eventual course of illness. Nonhuman primates were exposed to some pathogens and the in vitro and in vivo findings were compared. We found major gene expression changes at the earliest times tested post exposure to aerosolized B. anthracis spores and 30 min post exposure to a bacterial toxin.

Maude\u2019s language design and implementation make systematic use of the fact that rewriting logic is reflective [66, 56, 67, 68]. This makes the metatheory of rewriting logic accessible to the user in a clear and principled way. However, since a naive implementation of reflection can be computationally expensive, a good implementation must provide efficient ways of performing reflective computations. This chapter explains how this is achieved in Maude through its predefined META-LEVEL module, that can be found in the prelude.maude file.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["500"]}

Our approach does not rely on complete trust in the analysts to use the data appropriately, nor does it rely on incorruptible escrow agents. Instead, we propose conditional data escrow where the data generators, not the analysts, hold the keys to the data, but analysts can verify that the prenegotiated queries are enabled.

Such a correspondence thus establishes a (concurrent) computational interpretation of the logic, and a logical interpretation of the programming language.

When simulating in parallel, our approach has the important benefit of testing the robustness of a simulated design by not hiding the asynchronous nature of the system being studied (our simulation model preserves the nondeterministic behavior of certain parallel executions). Unlike other distributed simulation methodologies, our execution model does not rely on a global view of virtual time to maintain coherent distributed event causality relations. The simulator correctly executes a given parallel application that observes a particular synchronization model of choice without a notion of virtual time. We then estimate a global virtual time in which the execution could have been carried out.

Mobile code and mobile agents [186, 181] are emerging technologies that promise to make much easier the design, implementation, and maintenance of distributed systems. Mobile agents may reduce the network traffic, provide an effective means of overcoming network latency, and, perhaps more importantly, help us to construct more robust and fault-tolerant systems, thanks to their ability to operate asynchronously and autonomously.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["500"]}
{"title": "Functional modules\n", "abstract": " Functional modules define data types and operations on them by means of equational theories. The data types consist of elements that can be named by ground terms. Two ground terms denote the same element if and only if they belong to the same equivalence class as determined by the equations. That is, the mathematical semantics of a functional module is its initial algebra. Maude\u2019s functional modules are assumed to have the nice property that equations, considered as simplification rules by using them only in the left to right direction, are Church-Rosser and terminating (see Section 4.7). This means that repeated application of the equations as simplification rules eventually reaches a term to which no further equations apply, and the result, called the canonical form, is the same regardless of the order of application of the equations. Thus each equivalence class has a natural representative, its\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["500"]}
{"title": "Predefined data modules\n", "abstract": " Maude has a standard library of predefined modules that, by default, are entered into the system at the beginning of each session, so that any of these predefined modules can be imported by any other module defined by the user. Also, by default, the predefined functional module BOOL is automatically imported (in including mode) as a submodule of any user-defined module, unless such importation is explicitly disabled. These modules can be found in the file prelude.maude that is part of the Maude distribution.               We describe below those predefined modules that provide commonly used data types, including Booleans, numbers, strings, and quoted identifiers. The relationships among these modules are shown in the importation graph in Figure 9.1, where all the importations are in protecting mode.               We also describe typical parameterized collections of data types such as lists and sets, and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["500"]}
{"title": "Global infrastructure protection system 1\n", "abstract": " The development of new classes of distributed applications such as telephony, remote video, and virtual reality introduces new quality requirements that make inadequate even the current best-effort service model provided by international networks. Recent research activity has proposed new approaches to accommodate these new application requirements. While exploiting the resource needs of different applications to use the network resources efficiently, these approaches require the maintenance of a considerable amount of state information at the network nodes. Correctness and availability of such information are the basic requirements for the proper working of the network.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["500"]}
{"title": "Strategic reflection\n", "abstract": " The Maude system incorporates re ective capabilities that enable quite sophisticated strategies to be expressed very conveniently. Maude's strategy languages have been used to control the execution of large and small rewriting systems, in several areas of application. Strategies have been used to encode winning strategies for games, and can also be used for more serious purposes, such as theorem-proving strategies, and strategies taking the place of model checkers or nite-state exploration tools in the analysis of nite-state systems. In particular, niteor in nite-state systems, such as secure communication protocols, can be speci ed in rewriting logic and can be subjected to formal analysis through strategies at the metalevel. Communication protocols can be speci ed as concurrent object-oriented systems communicating through message passing, and can be executed as Maude programs. Nondeterministic behavior such as the order of messages arrival in such protocols can be controlled via strategies at the metalevel so that all possible behaviors of a system are explored. Previously-known and previously-unknown attacks or aws in cryptographic and multicast protocols have been discovered through the use of Maude's strategy mechanisms. In this paper several examples of the successful use of this and other kinds of strategies are pointed out.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["500"]}
