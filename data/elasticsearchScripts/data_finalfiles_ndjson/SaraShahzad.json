CBSD emphasizes the design and development of software systems using preexisting components. Software component reusability is an indispensable part of component based software development life cycle (CBSDLC), which consumes a significant amount of organization\u2019s resources, that is, time and effort. It is convenient in component based software system (CBSS) to select the most suitable and appropriate software components that provide all the required functionalities. Selecting the most appropriate components is crucial for the success of the entire system. However, decisions regarding software component reusability are often made in an ad hoc manner, which ultimately results in schedule delay and lowers the entire quality system. In this paper, we have discussed the analytic network process (ANP) method for software component selection. The methodology is explained and assessed using a real life case study.", "num_citations": "36\n", "authors": ["2243"]}

This metric although widely cited has many limitations. Many authors criticized cyclomatic complexity in many ways but still it is the most widely accepted idea regarding software complexity. One of the problems in cyclomatic complexity is the nesting problem. A nested construct is more complex than a simple construct, but cyclomatic complexity calculates same complexity for both types of constructs. Many authors addressed this problem but their solutions also has limitations. One of the limitations is that same solutions cannot be applied over nested-loop.

Comparing birthmarks of software can tell us whether a program or software is a copy of another. Software theft and piracy are rapidly increasing problems of copying, stealing, and misusing the software without proper permission, as mentioned in the desired license agreement. The estimation of birthmark can play a key role in understanding the effectiveness of a birthmark. In this paper, a new technique is presented to evaluate and estimate software birthmark based on the two most sought-after properties of birthmarks, that is, credibility and resilience. For this purpose, the concept of soft computing such as probabilistic and fuzzy computing has been taken into account and fuzzy logic is used to estimate properties of birthmark. The proposed fuzzy rule based technique is validated through a case study and the results show that the technique is successful in assessing the specified properties of the birthmark, its resilience and credibility.

Dendrograms represent clusters in a nested manner, where at each step an entity makes a new cluster or merges into an existing cluster.

An approach that has received attention is based on combining clustering results, since different hierarchical clustering algorithms produce different dendrograms and their combination has produced more promising results as compared to individual hierarchical clustering. This paper proposes the hierarchical clustering combination (HCC) approach which uses the different types of structural features present in the dendrogram.

Critics of cyclomatic complexity argue that complexity changes with modularization of code.

The cyclomatic complexity was for the first time introduced by TJ McCabe as metric for the measurement of complexity of a piece of code. McCabe calculated the complexity of a sample code written in fortran language. Fortran is a linear programming language and there are no functions and classes in this language. Hence at the time of introducing cyclomatic complexity there was no concept of structured languages and object oriented languages. This is ignored in McCabes's cyclomatic complexity due to which it is not enough to measure complexity for advance programming architectures like OOP and SOA\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["2243"]}
