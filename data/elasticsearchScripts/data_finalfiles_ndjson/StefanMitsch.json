{"title": "Towards a reference model for social user profiles: Concept & implementation\n", "abstract": " Despite the recent spreading of social networks, which leads to scattered social user profile information, current user models hardly incorporate social aspects. In addition, user models are often heterogenous with respect to focus and coverage. A comprehensive view on social user profiles, however, would be required, for instance, for building sophisticated recommender systems, or to provide users with means to control disclosure and usage of their integrated profile data. Therefore, we encountered the need for a reference model, which can serve as a basis for developing more specialized models and facilitate communication among stakeholders. In this paper we present such a reference model for social user profiles, which is extensible as well as comprehensive. The proposed model provides a generic core for extensions, and a comprehensive set of concrete concepts from existing social networks and user models, as well as concepts to represent meta information. In addition, a first prototypical implementation in terms of an ontology in owl is discussed.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["595"]}
{"title": "A first step towards a conceptual reference model for comparing social user profiles\n", "abstract": " Moti ation. The proliferation of user models for various application areas (eg, adaptive hypermedia [6], or ubiquitous Web applications [12]) within the last twenty years, as well as the more recent spreading of social networks, serving different purposes and communities (eg, professional networks in LinkedIn), is impressive. Interestingly, as a recent survey [7] revealed, user modeling approaches have not yet particularly focused on modeling social aspects of users, although several proposals for representing these social aspects emerged (eg,[1]). Whether or not a unified expressive representation of these different kinds of user profiles can be achieved is still disputed [7]. In particular, disagreement concerns feasibility of a pre-defined common representation in an open environment like the Web [7], especially in the presence of domain-specific user model features [16] and heterogenous application needs [2]. As a consequence, approaches on the basis of pairwise translations between concrete user models (eg,[5]), and such utilizing a completely generic structure (eg,[2]) have been proposed, both waiving expressive ontologies as shared conceptualizations of a domain [9].Our approach. In this paper we therefore propose a first sketch of a conceptual reference model for social user profiles, trying to balance between generality and expressiveness. Being generic in structure, this reference model can be extended towards different application domains, while still capturing essential aspects of social user profiles for enhancing expressiveness, admittingly not yet universally covering the social user domain.

Just like discrete invariants are used to reason about correctness in discrete systems without having to unroll their loops, continuous invariants are used to reason about differential equations without having to solve them. Automatic generation of continuous invariants remains one of the biggest practical challenges to the automation of formal proofs of safety for hybrid systems. There are at present many disparate methods available for generating continuous invariants; however, this wealth of diverse techniques presents a number of challenges, with different methods having different strengths and weaknesses.

{"title": "Verified runtime validation for partially observable hybrid systems\n", "abstract": " Formal verification provides strong safety guarantees but only for models of cyber-physical systems. Hybrid system models describe the required interplay of computation and physical dynamics, which is crucial to guarantee what computations lead to safe physical behavior (e.g., cars should not collide). Control computations that affect physical dynamics must act in advance to avoid possibly unsafe future circumstances. Formal verification then ensures that the controllers correctly identify and provably avoid unsafe future situations under a certain model of physics. But any model of physics necessarily deviates from reality and, moreover, any observation with real sensors and manipulation with real actuators is subject to uncertainty. This makes runtime validation a crucial step to monitor whether the model assumptions hold for the real system implementation. The key question is what property needs to be runtime-monitored and what a satisfied runtime monitor entails about the safety of the system: the observations of a runtime monitor only relate back to the safety of the system if they are themselves accompanied by a proof of correctness! For an unbroken chain of correctness guarantees, we, thus, synthesize runtime monitors in a provably correct way from provably safe hybrid system models. This paper addresses the inevitable challenge of making the synthesized monitoring conditions robust to partial observability of sensor uncertainty and partial controllability due to actuator disturbance. We show that the monitoring conditions result in provable safety guarantees with fallback controllers that react to monitor violation at runtime.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["595"]}

To meet the high safety demands of CPS, verification of their behavior is crucial, which has led to a wide range of tools for modeling and verification of hybrid systems. These tools are often used in combination, because they employ a wide range of different formalisms for modeling, and aim at distinct verification goals and techniques. To manage and exchange knowledge in the verification process and to overcome a lack of a common classification, we unify different terminologies and concepts of a variety of modeling and verification tools in a conceptual reference model (CRM).

Formal methods provide ways of proving such correctness properties, but have the habit of only saying \u201cyes\u201d when the answer is \u201cyes\u201d (soundness). More often than not, formal methods say \u201cno\u201d: They find out that the system is neither safe nor live, because there are \u201cunexpected\u201d circumstances in which the robot just cannot do what we expect it to. Inspecting those unexpected circumstances is informative, and identifies constraints on reasonable behavior of the environment.

{"title": "Towards modeling dynamic behavior with integrated qualitative spatial relations\n", "abstract": " Situation awareness and geographic information systems in dynamic spatial systems such as road traffic management (RTM) aim to detect and predict critical situations on the basis of relations between entities.

We argue, that a taxonomy\u2014containing a plethora of special cases of inter-calculi dependencies\u2014can only be defined in a consistent manner, if evolution of entities and the relations of calculi are grounded in a unified model. In this paper, we define such a unified model, which is used to derive a taxonomy of inter-calculi dependency constraints contained in an ontology utilizing various spatial calculi.

The trustworthiness of proofs rests on the soundness of the proof calculus and its correct implementation in a theorem prover. Correctness is easier to achieve with a soundness-critical core that is stripped to the bare minimum, but, as a consequence, proof convenience has to be regained outside the soundness-critical core with proof management techniques. We present modeling and proof management techniques that are built on top of the soundness-critical core of KeYmaera X to enable expanding definitions, parametric proofs, lemmas, and other useful proof techniques in hybrid systems proofs. Our techniques steer the uniform substitution implementation of the differential dynamic logic proof calculus in KeYmaera X to allow users choose when and how in a proof abstract formulas, terms, or programs become expanded to their concrete definitions, and when and how lemmas and sub-proofs are combined to a full proof. The same techniques are exploited in implicit sub-proofs (without making such sub-proofs explicit to the user) to provide proof features, such as temporarily hiding formulas, which are notoriously difficult to get right when implemented in the prover core, but become trustworthy as proof management techniques outside the core. We illustrate our approach with several useful proof techniques and discuss their presentation on the KeYmaera X user interface.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["595"]}
