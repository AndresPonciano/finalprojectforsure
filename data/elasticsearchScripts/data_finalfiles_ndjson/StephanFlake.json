Our approach addresses this problem and in particular the state explosion problem for the software controlling mechatronic systems, as we provide a domain specific formal semantic definition for a subset of the UML 2.0 component model and an integrated sequence of design steps. These steps prescribe how to compose complex software systems from domain-specific patterns which model a particular part of the system behavior in a well-defined context. The correctness of these patterns can be verified individually because they have only simple communication behavior and have only a fixed number of participating roles.

Complementary to UML diagrams, modelers can make use of the textual Object Constraint Language (OCL) to specify additional constraints for their models. OCL is particularly used to formulate constraints over a given UML model in form of class invariants and operation pre-and postconditions. However, the semantics of OCL is still incomplete, even in the latest OCL 2.0 proposal that has recently been adopted by the Object Management Group. While it is allowed to make use of states from State Diagrams in OCL expressions to reason about their activations, there is currently no corresponding semantics defined in the adopted OCL 2.0 specification. As a first goal, this thesis closes that gap and provides a formal notion of state configurations over UML State Diagrams that is integrated into the formal semantics of the adopted OCL 2.0 specification. The second major goal of this thesis is to extend OCL to support specification and analysis of temporal state-oriented constraints for UML models of time-critical software-controlled systems. In order to demonstrate the applicability of this extension, the thesis focuses on early stages of the software development process and applies time-bounded state-oriented OCL constraints to specify requirements in the domain of modeling time-constrained manufacturing systems.

The goal is to develop a platform which enables a user to create, discover and consume mobile services anywhere and at any time on the mobile device. uRun is an application scenario of the project in the field of mobile health and fitness. The uRun framework provides a mobile assistance system particularly for runners, which combines Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 technologies and personalized and situation-aware recommendation mechanisms. The ability to create individual and mobile health and fitness services as well as a personalized and situation-aware assistance system based on a semantic knowledge base are considered to provide an edge over existing consumer-centric health care systems.

Our multi agent system CASA focuses on the specification of complex plans that describe the behavior of agents. The design of CASA is based on concepts from concurrent logic programming that were used to extend the well known BDI agent approach AgentSpeak(L) [2]. Rao\u2019s AgentSpeak(L) is a specification language similar to horn clauses and can be viewed as an abstraction of an implemented BDI system. Our work is based on the assumption that AgentSpeak(L) demonstrates a successful reengineering approach of an implemented multi agent system that is now given a formal specification. By extending this specification with new features for complex plans it was possible to derive an efficient implementation that supports these new features.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["2234"]}

{"title": "Towards the Integration of Trusted Personal Devices into Mobile DRM Systems\n", "abstract": " Trusted Personal Devices (TPDs) are small, portable devices with tamper-resistant hardware currently being specified within the scope of the IST FP6 project InspireD. The vision is that the TPD serves as a common soft-and hardware platform for the next generation of Smart Cards and other secure devices. Among other usage scenarios, the TPD shall be employed within Mobile Digital Rights Management (Mobile DRM) systems. In particular, a dedicated application called TPD DRM Agent shall run on the TPD to securely manage digital usage rights.Whereas the TPD concepts have already been defined, mature development tools for the particular TPD hardware and software are not yet available. For the integration of the TPD in a corresponding Mobile DRM system, we were therefore forced to assemble different soft-and hardware configurations for testing and evaluation purposes, resulting in a development framework that is described in this article. Based on a general system architecture, we consecutively deployed our DRM components on different platforms (emulators, simulators) and devices (PCs, laptops, mobile phones) while making use of different wired and wireless communication channels (cellular network, Internet, and Bluetooth).", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2234"]}

The advanced profile management architecture features security (authentication, authorization, privacy, data protection) especially with respect to mobile and dynamic environments.
