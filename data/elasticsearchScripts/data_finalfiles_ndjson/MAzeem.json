{"title": "Influence of ultrasonic radiation on the dyeing of cotton fabric using reactive yellow 145 dye\n", "abstract": " Ultrasonic (US) radiation has a promising effect in textile processing due to its eco-friendly nature, rapid, cost and time effective tool. For the present study, the cellulosic fabric and dye solution were irradiated with ultrasonic (US) radiation for different times (10\u201360\u00a0min.). Dyeing was performed using nonradiated and irradiated cellulosic with nonradiated and irradiated Reactive Yellow 145 dye. Different dyeing parameters such as temperature, pH, material to liquor ratio and time were optimized using irradiated dye and irradiated cotton. It is found that US treatment of dye solution for 20\u00a0minutes gives good color strength by dyeing un-irradiated fabric at 70 \u00b0C, for 35\u00a0min using dye bath of pH 9 in the presence of 5\u00a0g/100\u00a0mL of salt as exhausting agent keeping 40\u00a0mL of dye volume. Colorfastness properties of fabrics dyed at optimum condition of various shades show that US treatment has improved the grading of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["1284"]}
{"title": "Decentralized mechanism for hiring the smart autonomous vehicles using blockchain\n", "abstract": " Nowadays, technologies like Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are influencing the ways of our traveling. This paper inspects closely the development of a decentralized blockchain-based mechanism for providing secure, reliable and real-time availability of AVs for the customers who want to do the ride. The AVs have many advanced control systems and sensors to detect a number of hurdles (unsafe design of vehicles, negligence of civilians, etc.) in the environment. Blockchain is a decentralized temper proof business protocol used to facilitate the users with transparent, reliable, secure and cost-effective solutions. The consensus mechanisms are used in blockchain for validation purposes. This paper uses the Proof of Work consensus algorithm for the validation of Demand Response (DR) events. It provides the mechanism for real-time monitoring and real-time supervision to the ride of the end-user. Furthermore\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1284"]}
{"title": "Data sharing system integrating access control based on smart contracts for IoT\n", "abstract": " Development of Internet of Things (IoT) network brings new concept of Internet. The dramatic growth of IoT increased its usage. IoT network facilitates in several manners, more specifically, in access control and data sharing among IoT devices. However, it has many challenges, such as: security risks, data protection and privacy, single point of failure through centralization, trust and data integrity issues, etc. This work presented a blockchain based access control and sharing system. The main aim of this work is to overcome the issues in access control and sharing system in IoT network and to achieve authentication and trustworthiness. Blockchain technology is integrated with IoT, which simplifies the access control and sharing. Multiple smart contracts: Access Control Contract (ACC), Register Contract (RC), Judge Contract (JC), are used that provide efficient access management.

{"title": "Smart contracts for research lab sharing scholars data rights management over the Ethereum blockchain network\n", "abstract": " The data sharing is the claim of actual scholars datasets to share and reuse in the future from any domain. The rise of blockchain technology has to increase universally and enhancement in share and reuse of scholars datasets. Despite there are numbers of security management frameworks for share data securely. However, those frameworks is a centralize based to make data share digitally. Its has restriction and owned by third party authority. The access and reuse of research datasets have a variety of issues it misinterpretation. In this aspect, the researcher or publisher has not to share data publicly due to reuse and perceive the risk in a data sharing environment. Preparing and storing data is difficult in contents sharing. To overcome the limitation and restriction, we proposed distributed data sharing management based on blockchain network (peer to peer P2P network).

{"title": "Microwave assisted investigation of golden duranta (Duranta repnes L.) Leaves as a natural colorant for surface oxidised cellulosic dye\n", "abstract": " The present study was aimed to get extraction of natural colorants from golden duranta (Duranta repnes) leaves powder and its characterisation under microwave treatment. Dyeing powder and cotton fabrics, both were exposed to microwaves for 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 min. Aqueous, alkaline and methanol solubilised extracts were obtained from non-irradiated and irradiated golden duranta leaves powders. Chromium, tannic acid and pomegranate peel were applied to enhance colour strength of extracted dye. Golden duranta leaves powder and cotton fabrics treated with radiation significantly enhanced the extraction and dyeing process by reducing salt concentration. Microwave treatments also had significant affect on colour strength and fastness characteristics of cotton fabricss dyed with golden duranta. Microwave treatment of 1 min was the most affective dose for colorant extraction. The result from mordanting\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1284"]}
{"title": "Energy Trading Between Prosumer and Consumer in P2P Network Using Blockchain\n", "abstract": " Nowaday\u2019s energy demand and energy production are increasing. Renewable energy resources will play an important role in managing future production of electricity due to an increase in the development of societies. The centralized energy trading system faces a challenge in terms of fair energy distribution. Centralized existing energy trading system totally relies on a central system or third party, because the third party has many drawbacks in the form of record tampering or record altering. The fair transaction is the main issue in the energy trading sector. When the bitcoin is introduced in the market, the trust of Blockchain technology is increased. We proposed a Blockchain based energy trading system in peer to peer networks. Blockchain technology provides trust, security, and transparency for energy trading. In Blockchain technology, there is no necessary need of the third party in the energy supply\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1284"]}
