Large-scale rearrangements in genomes are often mediated by recombination events involving new or existing copies of mobile genetic elements, recently duplicated genes, or other repetitive sequences. Most current software programs for predicting structural variation from short-read DNA resequencing data are intended primarily for use on human genomes. They typically disregard information in reads mapping to repeat sequences, and significant post-processing and manual examination of their output is often required to rule out false-positive predictions and precisely describe mutational events.

An important goal of these studies is discerning which evolutionary pressures favour the formation of swarms. One hypothesis is that swarms arise because the presence of multiple moving prey in swarms causes confusion for attacking predators, but it remains unclear how important this selective force is. Using an evolutionary model of a predator\u2013prey system, we show that predator confusion provides a sufficient selection pressure to evolve swarming behaviour in prey. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the evolutionary effect of predator confusion on prey could in turn exert pressure on the structure of the predator's visual field, favouring the frontally oriented, high-resolution visual systems commonly observed in predators that feed on swarming\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "150\n", "authors": ["1910"]}

In this paper, we use digital evolution to evolve groups of clonal organisms that exhibit division of labor.

Bacteria use QS to trigger secretion of digestive enzymes, formation and destruction of biofilms, and, in the case of pathogenic organisms, expression of virulence factors that cause disease. Investigations of mechanisms that prevent or disrupt QS, referred to as quorum quenching, are of interest because they provide a new alternative to antibiotics for treating bacterial infections. Traditional antibiotics either kill bacteria or inhibit their growth, producing selective pressures that promote resistant strains. In contrast, quorum quenching and other so-called anti-infective strategies focus on altering behavior.

{"title": "The effect of conflicting pressures on the evolution of division of labor\n", "abstract": " Within nature, many groups exhibit division of labor. Individuals in these groups are under seemingly antagonistic pressures to perform the task most directly beneficial to themselves and to potentially perform a less desirable task to ensure the success of the group. Performing experiments to study how these pressures interact in an evolutionary context is challenging with organic systems because of long generation times and difficulties related to group propagation and fine-grained control of within-group and between-group pressures. Here, we use groups of digital organisms (i.e., self-replicating computer programs) to explore how populations respond to antagonistic multilevel selection pressures. Specifically, we impose a within-group pressure to perform a highly-rewarded role and a between-group pressure to perform a diverse suite of roles. Thus, individuals specializing on highly-rewarded roles will have a within-group advantage, but groups of such specialists have a between-group disadvantage. We find that digital groups could evolve to be either single-lineage or multi-lineage, depending on experimental parameters. These group compositions are reminiscent of different kinds of major evolutionary transitions that occur within nature, where either relatives divide labor (fraternal transitions) or multiple different organisms coordinate activities to form a higher-level individual (egalitarian transitions). Regardless of group composition, organisms embraced phenotypic plasticity as a means for genetically similar individuals to perform different roles.

Cellular automata (CA) are a well-studied approach to exploring the principles underlying self-organization. A CA comprises a lattice of cells whose states change over time based on a discrete update function. One challenge to developing CA is that the relationship of an update function, which describes the local behavior of each cell, to the global behavior of the entire CA is often unclear. As a result, many researchers have used stochastic search techniques, such as evolutionary algorithms, to automatically discover update functions that produce a desired global behavior. However, these update functions are typically defined in a way that does not provide for self-adaptation. Here we describe an approach to discovering CA update functions that are both self-adaptive and self-organizing. Specifically, we use a novel evolutionary algorithm-based approach to discover finite state machines (FSMs) that implement update functions for CA. We show how this approach is able to evolve FSM-based update functions that perform well on the density classification task for 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional CA. Moreover, we show that these FSMs are self-adaptive, self-organizing, and highly scalable, often performing well on CA that are orders of magnitude larger than those used to evaluate performance during the evolutionary search.
