Since code clones are believed to reduce the maintainability of software, several code clone detection techniques and tools have been proposed. This paper proposes a new clone detection technique, which consists of the transformation of input source text and a token-by-token comparison. For its implementation with several useful optimization techniques, we have developed a tool, named CCFinder (Code Clone Finder), which extracts code clones in C, C++, Java, COBOL and other source files. In addition, metrics for the code clones have been developed. In order to evaluate the usefulness of CCFinder and metrics, we conducted several case studies where we applied the new tool to the source code of JDK, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Linux, and many other systems.

However, the estimation of the fault-proneness should be done in the early phase so as to effectively allocate effort for fixing the faults.

The model is defined by a set of tasks assigned over the developers and performed by them concurrently. A task is defined by a sequence of primitive activities, and it may involve communication primitives which establish coordination with other tasks. Based on this model, a prototype system for supporting and monitoring the process, named Hakoniwa, has been implemented. The Hakoniwa system is composed of multiple developers' navigators and a manager's monitor. A navigator leads a single developer by showing possible succeeding activities on menus and automatically activates appropriate development tools. The monitor reports the advances in activity sequences of developers, with various data, such as the initiation-termination times and the number of activity repetitions.< >", "num_citations": "33\n", "authors": ["189"]}

Examples of such usage are large scale data and web mining, grid computing, and multimedia environments. We propose that such rich hardware can also catapult software engineering to the next level. Huge amounts of software engineering data can be systematically collected and organized from tens of thousands of projects inside organizations, or from outside an organization through the Internet. The collected data can be analyzed extensively to extract and correlate multi-project knowledge for improving organization-wide productivity and quality.

For example, SourceForge currently has about fifty-five thousand software systems registered, twenty-two thousand of which were added in the past twelve months. With such a large number of software projects, locating the right project for a given purpose can obviously be quite challenging. We propose to use automatic software categorization to address this challenge. At present, we leave open the issue of the nature of the categorization, and explore several known approaches like code clones-based similarity metric, decision trees, and latent semantic analysis. The results from applying each of the approaches gives us some insights into the problem space, and sets some directions for further work.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["189"]}

To reduce the efforts required, Li et al. developed CP-Miner, a code clone detection tool that detects identifier naming inconsistencies between code clones as bug candidates. However, reviewers using CP-Miner still have to assess many inconsistencies, since the tool also reports many false-positive candidates. To reduce the false-positive candidates, we propose a criterion for filtering the candidates. In our experiments, filtering with the proposed criterion removed 30% of the false-positive candidates and no true-positive candidates. This result shows that the proposed criterion helps the review task by effectively reducing the number of bug candidates.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["189"]}

In this paper, we propose a two-way merge algorithm for source code that exploit the tree structure of modern programming language grammar: the source code is transformed in an intermediate XML representation and the merge operation is conducted on the transformed version.

The new simulation model is based on the former proposed simulation model [3] and developer\u2019s knowledge structure. The knowledge structure changes dynamically during a project because he/she can acquire new knowledge by executing activities. The knowledge structure is described in a cognitive map that consists of nodes and links. The node means knowledge element, the link shows the prerequisite relationships among the knowledge elements.) The former model is allocated to the knowledge element in the cognitive map, respectively. By adding two attributes; quantity of developer\u2019s knowledge and quantity of the activity, to the knowledge element, the simulation model can calculate the changes of the knowledge structure and the variation of productivity. In addition, the ability of the simulation model is made clear in some case studies. The simulation results are useful to make project plans that contain technical reviews. A technical review is an efficient technique of acquiring new knowledge. The simulation model can predict when a developer can not acquire any new knowledge by himself/herself, what knowledge a developer can not acquire.)

Detailed logging allows developers to collect information in situations where they cannot use an interactive debugger, such as continuous integration and web application server cases. However, extensive logging leads to larger execution traces because few instructions could be repeated many times. To record detailed program behavior within limited storage space constraints, we propose Near-Omniscient Debugging, a methodology that records an execution trace using fixed size buffers for each observed instruction. Our tool monitors a Java program's execution and annotates source code with observed values in an HTML format. Developers can easily investigate the execution and share the report on a web server.

{"title": "Causal role of neural signals transmitted from the frontal eye field to the superior colliculus in saccade generation\n", "abstract": " The frontal eye field (FEF) and superior colliculus (SC) are major and well-studied components of the oculomotor system. The FEF sends strong projections to the SC directly, and neurons in these brain regions transmit a variety of signals related to saccadic eye movements. Electrical microstimulation and pharmacological manipulation targeting the FEF or SC affect saccadic eye movements. These data suggest the causal contribution of each region to saccade generation. To understand how the brain generates behavior, however, it is critical not only to identify the structures and functions of individual regions, but also to elucidate how they interact with each other. In this review, we first survey previous works that aimed at investigating whether and how the FEF and SC interact to regulate saccadic eye movements using electrophysiological and pharmacological techniques. These works have reported what signals FEF neurons transmit to the SC and what roles such signals play in regulating oculomotor behavior. We then highlight a recent attempt of our own that has applied an optogenetic approach to stimulate the neural pathway from the FEF to the SC in nonhuman primates. This study has shown that optogenetic stimulation of the FEF-SC pathway is sufficiently effective not only to modulate SC neuron activity, but also to evoke saccadic eye movements. Although the oculomotor system is a complex neural network composed of numbers of cortical and subcortical regions, the optogenetic approach will provide a powerful strategy for elucidating the role of each neural pathway constituting this network.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["189"]}

Association of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of hyperplastic type II epithelial cells with the fibrotic events of pulmonary fibrosis has been suggested in in vitro silica-exposed cultured cell models, patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and bleomycin-induced experimental models. Histological features of EMT, however, are not fully described in silicotic lungs in in vivo. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate EMT of hyperplastic type II epithelial cells in the developmental process of progressive massive pulmonary fibrosis in the lungs of rats exposed to silica.

However, these parameters require time-consuming tuning processes to avoid problems such as premature convergence. Unlike many GAs, the Parameter-less Population Pyramid (P3) is an optimization model that avoids premature convergence due to the pyramid-like structure of populations, and thus P3 can be applied to a wide range of problems without parameter tuning. P3 approaches to search would be useful for constructing a novel theory for optimal search using GAs. In this study, we propose a novel technique\" analysis based on the Distribution of Inferior Individuals in the local neighborhood\"(DII analysis).

Median follow-up was 34.6 months (range 8.7\u223c 39.2) and median age at diagnosis was 72 years old (range 65\u223c 73). In all three cases, the diagnosis was definitively established not by splenectomy but by ultrasonically guided percutaneous splenic tissue core biopsy. Using the Hans classifier, one of the cases was subclassified as the germinal center B-cell like (GCB) subtype and two as non-GCB subtype. One case was CD5-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Two patients were in Ann Arbor stage II and one was in stage III. Using the International Prognostic Index, one was categorized as Low/intermediate risk, one as high/intermediate risk, and one as high risk.

{"title": "Larval-cleaning technique for increasing the survival rate of giant clam Tridacna crocea during the planktonic stage\n", "abstract": " Giant clams are important species in tropical aquaculture. The larvae artificially hatched are often cleaned by running seawater containing the larvae through a coarse mesh, designed to catch contaminants larger than the larvae (eg fouling materials detached from adult clams); and then through a fine mesh, designed to catch the larvae and wash away smaller contaminants (eg bacteria). Such larval cleaning is assumed to improve the larval survival rate. We conducted experiments on how the cleaning improves the survival rate of larvae of the giant clam Tridacna crocea during the planktonic stage. The experiments revealed that larval cleaning improves the survival rate for larval densities of 0.3 to 9.8 indiv. mL 1. The experiments suggested that the survival rate at 0.5 indiv. mL 1, a typical larval density in hatcheries, would be 16.6% for the cleaned larvae, much higher than 1.4% for those not cleaned. Through larval cleaning, both bacteria and small T. crocea embryos showing maldevelopment were found to decrease in the water containing T. crocea larvae, which can explain in part the improved survival rate.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["189"]}

TL spectroscopy can optically detect temperature and carrier changes induced in a photo-pumped GaN layer, and the observed temperature change is closely associated with non-radiative recombination processes that create heat. Then numerically solving diffusion equations, which represent the diffusion processes of the photo-generated heat and carriers, provide the spatiotemporal distributions. These distributions are subsequently converted into the refractive index distributions, which act as transient convex or concave lenses. Finally, ray-tracing simulations predict the TL signals. Comparing the experimentally obtained and simulated TL signals quantifies the generated heat and the IQE without the often-adopted assumption that non-radiative recombination processes are\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["189"]}

Generally speaking, catalytic reactions take place on a metal oxide layer. In this study, therefore, the oxidation states of the Ni (111) surface, which were made by irradiation with a supersonic O 2 molecular beam, were analyzed by soft x-ray photoemission spectroscopy with synchrotron radiation. The oxygen uptake curve and initial sticking rate were found to show remarkably strong dependence on the O 2 incident energy for energies of up to 2.3 eV. The intermediate plateau seen in the oxygen uptake curve for low incident energies was found to disappear with increasing incident energy due to a change of the dissociative adsorption mechanism from a two-dimensional island growth model to a direct activated adsorption model.

The authors have reported that (1) copper-sulfide (Cu2S)-dispersed bronze is obtained by adding molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) to molten bronze,(2) the dispersion of Cu2S reduces the coefficient of friction on the rake surface and increases the shear angle, resulting in a reduction in cutting force,(3) Cu2S-dispersed bronze has a good chip disposability because Cu2S acts as a chip breaker,(4) Cu2S has no influence on the finished surface roughness, and (5) Cu2S-dispersed bronze has an excellent machinability equivalent to those of CAC406 and CAC902. 4) In order to use Cu2S-dispersed bronze for water faucets, the estimation of its mechanical properties is of importance.

Second, the results of SDG-based program slicing are difficult to visualize, as they contain many vertices. In this research, we proposed variable data-flow graphs (VDFG) for use in program slicing techniques.

In total, 484 clams were reared; four groups of 87 specimens were reared outdoors under relative light intensities of 4.8, 23.1, 51.5 and 100% for 739 days, and four groups of 34 specimens were reared indoors under fluorescent lighting on a 12 h light and 12 h dark cycle for 520 days with an underwater photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 126, 169, 330 and 458\u03bcmol/m2/s. As a result, specimens reared under 23.1% and 51.5% relative light intensity in the outdoor experiment showed faster growth (80.6\u00b16.2 mm and 76.1\u00b15.9 mm, respectively; mean\u00b1SD) than control specimens reared under a non-shaded condition (71.7\u00b16.9 mm). There was no difference in survival rate except for the specimens reared under the weakest light intensity (4.8% relative light intensity). In the indoor fluorescent light experiment, the specimens in the slightly weak PPFD group (330\u03bcmol/m2/s) grew to 71.0\u00b15.3 mm and had a faster growth than those in the strongest PPFD group (458\u03bcmol/m2/s), which grew to only 65.9\u00b15.8 mm. All PPFD groups had a survival rate of 100%.

Some of the detection techniques use occurrence frequency of program entities to detect concerns; however, the detected concerns include generic idioms such as a loop using iterator. The generic idioms are less interesting than application- or domain-specific concerns in many cases. Therefore, some techniques use heuristics to filter the concerns, where developers should adjust the filter carefully or actual concerns may be accidentally filtered out. In this paper, we propose a metric named universality that represents how widely a class is used in applications. Using the universality, we filter concerns comprising only universallyused classes.

Diagnosis and treatment of hemorrhagic small intestinal disease is clinically problematic due to its anatomic aspect, especially after multiple laparotomies. The case that we present here was a 79-year-old man who was initially diagnosed with suspected T2N2M0 lung cancer. After non-diagnostic results on two bronchoscopic biopsies and computed tomography-guided needle biopsy, he was admitted for thoracoscopic biopsy and possible curative operation. The patient had a history of multiple laparotomies for gastric ulcer and had no abdominal symptoms. A fecal occult blood test was positive; this was thought to be because of persistent bloody sputum. During the preoperative evaluation period, massive intestinal hemorrhage occurred. Intestinal tumor was identified by double-balloon enteroscopy and emergency laparotomy was performed to control the bleeding. The histopathological diagnosis was metastatic adenocarcinoma. However, intestinal bleeding started again. His systemic status deteriorated progressively, resulting in death. Autopsy revealed a large polypoid tumor with hemorrhagic necrosis in the jejunum that was histologically and immunohistochemically diagnosed as primary poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma in the small intestine. Multiple small submucosal tumors with central ulceration were confirmed as intramural metastases. A lung mass in the right lower lobe was diagnosed as a metastatic lesion.

{"title": "A program slicing approach for locating functional concerns\n", "abstract": " A functional concern\u2013code that helps fulfill a functional requirement\u2013is typically implemented by collaborative software modules. When a developer modifies or reuses the implementation of a functional concern, he must find the modules contributing to the concern and understand how the units collaborate with one another. In this paper, we describe an approach for locating the code contributing to a functional concern that is based on program slicing. Our approach uses heuristics to bound the size of the slice determined to represent the functional concern, thereby overcoming the large slice sizes that often limit the usefulness of program slicing based approaches. Our approach outputs a description of the functional concern\u2019s implementation as a concern graph, which summarizes the interactions between the program elements in the slice. We report on an evaluation in which we compared the size and content of concern graphs produced by our approach with concern graphs made by hand by two developers.

We aimed to assess the additive benefit of enprostil in combination with cimetidine for treating gastric ulcer in a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial. METHODOLOGY: In 43 hospitals 171 intention-to-treat (ITT) patients, diagnosed as having gastric ulcer by endoscopy, were randomly allocated to receive either enprostil 25microg bid and cimetidine 400mg bid (Group E= 85), or cimetidine 400mg bid alone (Group C= 86) for 8 weeks. Healing was examined by endoscopy at 4 and 8 weeks. RESULTS: Per protocol (PP) analysis comprised 166 patients (E= 82, C= 84). Despite no significant advantage at 4 weeks (E= 55.3%, C= 42.2%), the combination yielded higher healing rates at 8 weeks by ITT (E= 89.4%, C= 68.6%; p< 0.001) and PP analysis (E= 92.7%, C= 70.2%; p< 0.001).

Since such crosscutting aspects are usually distributed among objects in Object-Oriented Programming, it is difficult to maintain them consistently. In AOP, they can be written in a single aspect and thus easy to maintain. One useful application of AOP is to modularize collecting program\u2019s dynamic information for program analysis. Since collection of dynamic information affects over all target program, this functionality becomes typical crosscutting concerns.

For CO2 laser welding of large output, it is generally known that porosity may occur in the weld bead when a deep penetration welding in single pass is performed in the ambient atmosphere. Welding defects mainly including porosity also occur more frequently with increase of plate thickness even though in the case of using proper welding condition.In order to spread laser welding generally, porosity is one of the most important problems to be solved. It is thought that formation mechanism of porosity is expressed as follows. Bubbles are generated mainly at the bottom of keyhole, which are trapped in molten metal during floating up and remain as porosity in metal.In this context, to reduce welding defects in welded bead, the authors paid attention to the following two\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["189"]}

By means of this technique, we are able to detect the difference between the local work functions of the overlayer and the substrate in both Cu (111)-Au and Pt (111)-Ag cases. Our results show that the local work function of the Au overlayer is between those of Au (111) and Cu (111) surfaces, supporting the results obtained with other techniques. In the case of the Pt (111)-Ag surface the local work function depends on the local thickness of the Ag overlayer.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["189"]}

However, it is reported that spinach grown hydroponically contains a lower amount of vitamin C (Fujishiro et al., 1991) and Fe (Kojima et al., 1992) in comparison with that grown in soil. Commercial plant factories cultivating mainly leaf vegetables using hydroponics will become popular in future. Therefore it is important to prevent the deterioration of the nutritional value of leaf vegetables. On the contrary, high nutritional value vegetables may be produced using hydroponics because of the control of the conditions around the roots.We are studying how to produce iron-enriched leaf vegetables using hydroponics. In the beginning, we tried to increase the foliar Fe content during the cultivation period by adding Fe-salt (EDTA-Fe) to the nutrient solution, but the foliar Fe content scarcely increased: Fe merely accumulated in the roots or deposited on the root surface (Inoue et al., 1991).

In this research, as one of the step for predicting the complete contact of residual void, the purpose is to establish a model where change in void spacing is taken into consideration in old prediction model. However, in case of velocity equation of each mechanism of old model, the calculation will be possible only when void spacing 2L of bonding interface and percentage bonded area S are applied. Accordingly, it is necessary to estimate the change in void spacing beforehand. In this research, considering this point, firstly algorithm to predict the void spacing during bonding is proposed and its adequacy was studied. Result of application of average value as a void spacing showed that prediction upto S=90% was possible.

Reports appeared later on patients with similar features but with onset during adult life, or with inheritance compatible with autosomal dominant or sex-linked recessive factors.Now the Kugelberg-Welander (KW) syndrome may indicate chronic proximal spinal muscular atrophy with the onset at any age. Here we will subdivide proximal spinal muscular atrophy into 4 types: 1) the infantile type, that is Werdnig-Hoffmann (WH) disease, 2) the intermediate type, 3) the juvenile type, that is, KW disease and 4) the adult type according to Emery's classification (Emery, 1971). Besides proximal spinal muscular atro-phy, there are some other spinal muscular atrophies including scapuloperoneal spinal muscular atrophy and facioscapulohumeral spinal muscular atrophy (Table 1).", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["189"]}
{"title": "Blanker: A Refactor-Oriented Cloned Source Code Normalizer\n", "abstract": " Refactoring is widely practiced by developers and has become a key factor in order to increase the maintainability of software. However, code clones pose a threat in any refactor process due to the fact that a developer should edit identical portions of code more than once. Despite the numerous researches in this topic, most of the results are focused on discovering type-3 and type-4 clones, that require an higher effort to be refactored and removed. In this paper we present our tool, Blanker, that searches and unifies equivalent statements available in the language before feeding the source to an existing code clone detector limited to type-2 clones. This step acts as a normalization step and produces refactorable results without the error introduced by potentially unrelated added statements (like in type-3 clones), that would be unsuitable for refactoring purposes, and with added flexibility compared to checking for\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["189"]}

Instead, Xist-2kb sequesters RNA produced from adjacent genes on chromatin.

To analyze the robustness of such models, local sensitivity analysis has been implemented. However, such analysis primarily focuses on only a certain parameter set, even though diverse parameter sets that can recapitulate experiments may exist. In this study, we performed sensitivity analysis that investigates the features in a system considering the reproducible and multiple candidate values of the model parameters to experiments. The results showed that although different reproducible model parameter values have absolute differences with respect to sensitivity strengths, specific trends of some relative sensitivity strengths exist between reactions regardless of parameter values. It is suggested that (i) network structure considerably influences the relative sensitivity strength and (ii) one might be able to predict relative sensitivity strengths specified in the parameter sets employing only one of the reproducible parameter sets.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["189"]}
{"title": "Evaluation of interfacial strength of multilayer thin films polymer by nanoindentation technique\n", "abstract": " Multilayer thin films polymer have been commonly used in a wide range of electronics applications, such as solar cells, photoconductors, semiconductors, and light-emitting diodes, in which failure due to delamination can occur. For evaluating and improving the quality of a multilayer thin-film product, the interfacial strength between its layers must be measured correctly and accurately. In this work, the interfacial strength of a multilayer thin-film polymer was quantified by measuring the interfacial energy release rate (interfacial fracture toughness), Gi, using the nanoindentation test technique. Three specimens of four-layer thin films were fabricated on a glass substrate. The top layer of each specimen was prepared with different thicknesses. The unloading curve technique introduced by Kozuki and Kishimoto (2010) was implemented to quantify the Gi of each specimen. Then, crosssectional observation of the specimens was performed to confirm the layer thicknesses and to identify the delamination condition after the test. The measured Gi tended to increase as the range between the two unloading curves used to calculate the delamination energy widened. This phenomenon is believed to be caused by the plastic energy of the deformed films during the indentation process. Finally, an empirical method for eliminating the effect of the plastic energy on the measured Gi was proposed. Using this method, a pure Gi value can be effectively extracted; thus, the interfacial strength of multilayer thin-film polymers can be measured correctly and accurately.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["189"]}

In this study of data deposited into Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under GSE71111, we analyzed the expression profile of peritoneal macrophages isolated from mice pre-administrated with toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, mimicking pathogen infection. In these macrophages, increased expression of a group of innate immunity-related genes was sustained over a long period of time, and these genes overlapped with ATF7-regulated genes.

The appearance of broad phonon modes at~ 1150\u20131250 cm-1 in p-polarized light and their disappearance in s-polarized light confirmed that the phonon modes at~ 1150\u20131250 cm-1 originated from surface polaritons (SPPs).

This suggested that the thin SiO 2 film (8-nm thick) is under compressive stresses at the interface between the SiO 2 film and SiC substrate. On the other hand, for the thick SiO 2 films (85 and 130-nm thick), the TO phonon peak frequency tended to shift toward lower frequencies with increasing oxide layer\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["189"]}

METHODS: The recent literature on TRD was selected regarding the use of CBT, with both\" classical\" and\" new generation\" CBT being included. The Japanese algorithm for the treatment of TRD was revised to propose CBT as a first-step treatment option. RESULTS: The efficacy of\" classical\" CBT for TRD varied across clinical trials: in one study CBT was comparable to pharmacotherapy when used in either augmentation or switch strategies; in another study, the combination of CBT and a switch to another antidepressant led to a more favorable clinical response than medication switch alone; and, in a third study, the concomitant administration of an atypical antipsychotic to CBT was found to be useful. One recent Japanese study showed positive acute and sustained effects on depressive symptoms and social functioning in TRD patients when group CBT was added to antidepressant medication. In recent years\" new generation\" CBT, such as the cognitive behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy (CBASP), dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), have been studied. A switch from antidepressant medication to CBASP was efficacious for non-responders to pharmacotherapy; participants in a DBT-based skills training group showed greater improvement in depressive symptoms compared with waiting-list controls; and, in two preliminary studies, MBCT was effective and acceptable for TRD patients.

RESULTS: PEF improved, daily (circadian) variation was minimized and FVC and FEV1. 0 testing showed slight improvement. V25/height also revealed significant improvement. The more peripheral the airways are, the greater improvement was observed. The annual emergency admission rate of 4.6 times per patient decreased to 2.1 times after the addition of BDP-HFA 400 microg/day.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the meibomian gland changes in CL wearers using this meibography.Methods:: We observed 121 eyes of 121 CL wearers whose mean\u00b1SD of age were 31.8\u00b18.0 (47 males and 74 females), and 137 eyes of 137 age-matched non-CL-wearers as a control. In 121 CL wearers, 39 were using gas permeable lenses, 82 were using hydrogel lenses. After a clinical questionnaire, following tests were performed: manifest refraction, a slit-lamp examination of eyelids, corneal and conjunctival staining by fluorescein, measurement of tear film\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["189"]}

{"title": "Token Comparison Approach to Detect Code Clone-Related Bugs\n", "abstract": " Large software tends to have a significant amount of similar code, commonly known as code clones. Often the code clones are introduced through copy-and-paste process for code reuse purpose where the pasted code usually will go through some modifications such as renaming of identifiers and changing of parameters. In this paper, we propose a method using token comparison approach to detect bugs caused by abovementioned modifications. Our method tokenizas detected clones and performs a comparison to find out inconsistencies between them. The inconsistencies are then ranked based on predefined metrics to produce a bug candidate list. We implemented our method and tested on open source software. Our tool has found real bugs from the test subject. We believe our tool is suitable to serve the purpose of detecting code clone-related bugs in large software.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["189"]}

{"title": "Estimation of the total nitrogen and allantoin in the daily urine excretion using the daytime urine samples in lactating dairy cows\n", "abstract": " This experiment was designed to examine the feasibility of estimating the daily excretion of total nitrogen (N) and allantoin in the urine from the 4-h daytime urine excretion (between 08: 00 and 12: 00 or 12: 00 and 16: 00) collected from lactating dairy cows. The samples were collected over 3 experimental days from seven lactating dairy cows and analyzed for the concentration of creatinine, total N, and allantoin. The total N/creatinine concentration ratio, and allantoin/creatinine concentration ratio were nearly constant over 24 h. The daily excretion of urinary creatinine was 107.2 mg/kgsup (0.75). Based on this, we derived the following formula:[daily excretion of urinary total N (or allantoin)(mg)= concentration of total N (or allantoin) in the 4-h urine sample (mg/dL)/concentration of creatinine in the 4-h urine sample (mg/dL) x 107.2 x metabolic body weight (kgsup (0.75))]. A significant correlation was observed between the actual and estimated values by the formula (r 0.750, P0. 001), and the actual and estimated values were equal. Thus, it was concluded that the daily excretion of total N and allantoin in the urine could be estimated from the 4-h daytime urine excretion by using the derived formula.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["189"]}
{"title": "Towards maintenance support for idiom-based code using sequential pattern mining\n", "abstract": " Developers often use an idiom to implement a concern. When a fault is found in an idiom, developers have to find all source code fragments derived from the original. While code-clone detection tools can detect copy-andpasted code, such tools cannot detect code fragments modified after pasted. We are investigating a sequential pattern mining approach to capture idiom-based code that spread across modules.

However, recently cases due to contamination of thermal-bath water have been reported in Japan. In this investigation, we examined the supervision of baths and the presence of Legionella spp. in thermal-bath water of homes for the elderly in Toyohashi city. METHODS: The research was conducted through questionnaires on bathing facilities at 50 sites. Thermal baths were found to be installed at 14 of the sites. We then tested 22 samples from the 14 sites for Legionella spp. and other materials. RESULTS: From the genus Legionella, only Legionella pneumophila was detected, in 8 samples from 4 sites. Coliforms were also detected. Moreover, disinfectant was not detected in any of the Legionella positive samples of bath water. Legionella positive sites had, however, been replacing their water once a day. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the use of disinfectant and the proper supervision of bathing facilities are important in controlling Legionella spp. Legionnaires disease can be averted in homes for the elderly through appropriate measures.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["189"]}
{"title": "Isotropic Etching of n-Si (110) in KOH solution under Applied Voltage\n", "abstract": " Isotropic chemical wet etching of n-Si (110) was investigated in KOH solution under applied voltage. It was shown that isotropic etching was achieved in 32wt% KOH at 110 C when applied voltage to the Si wafer was greater than 0.6 V (vs. Pt electrode), while the Si wafer was etched anisotropically without applying voltage. This result shows that the etching property, isotropic or anisotropic, is varied by applying voltage. The etching rate of Si (110) for isotropic and the anisotropic etching were 0.1\u03bcm/min and 9\u03bcm/min, respectively at 110 C. In addition, the etching rate of the isotropic etching did not dependent on the applied voltage when using n-Si. The cause of the isotropic etching in KOH solution originated from etching through the anodic oxide layer formed on the Si surface due to XPS-analysis and the temperature dependence of the etching rate.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["189"]}

{"title": "Effective testing and debugging methods and its supporting system with program deltas\n", "abstract": " In the maintenance phase of software development, it is necessary to check that all features still perform correctly after some changes have been applied to existing software. However, it is not easy to debug the software when a defect is found in those features which have not changed during the modification, even using a regression test. Existing approaches employ program deltas to specify defects; they have the limitation of it being hard to enact them, and they don't support any actual debugging activities. Moreover, such a system is hard to introduce into an actual environment. In this paper, we propose DMET (Debugging METhod) to solve such problems. DMET supports debugging activities when a defect is found by regression tests through detection, indication and reflection procedures. We also implement DSUS (Debugging SUpporting System) based on DMET. DSUS executes DMET procedures\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["189"]}

This paper proposes a communication model which can represent a wide variety of communication states between the project manager and developers discussing how to implement process change requests.

{"title": "Mechanical properties of spring wire drawn and tempered at lower bainite region\n", "abstract": " Medium carbon spring steel containing Si (SWOSC-V) was aus-drawn and temperd at 543\u2022573K(lower bainite region) to obtain the wire with ausformed bainite structure. Aus-forming refined bainitic ferrite. Especially near surface, bainitic ferrite tended to align in one direction because of a large amount of redundant shear strain in drawing. The redundant shear strain also resulted in larger hardness near the surface especially in the cases of low drawing velocities and large die-cone angles. At center regions, the aus-formed bainite wires showed smaller hardness than that of a conventional oil quenched and tempered wire with tempered martensite structure possibly due to higher transformation temperature by heat generation during drawing. The aus-formed bainite wires had large amount of retained austenite up to 25%. The retained austenite transformed to martensite during shot-peening or fatigue testing, so that the aus-formed bainite wires showed good mechanical properties and fatigue strength comparable to those of the conventional wires. These results indicate that the present new and simple process(aus-drawing+ tempering) could be applicable to practical use for spring wire production.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["189"]}
{"title": "Development of Aus-drawing process in medium carbon spring steel for coil springs\n", "abstract": " In order to improve the fatigue strength and the sag resistance in medium carbon spring steels, a novel thermomechanical processing,\" aus-drawing\", was developed. Aus-drawing is an aus-forming using wire drawing. The aus-drawing process was applied to two kinds of mediumcarbon spring steels containing Si, SWOSC-V, and SAE9254 (JIS SUP12). Three kinds of typical microstructures appeared in the aus-drawn wires depending on the drawing conditions: fully martensite structure, surface bainite structure, and fully bainite structure. It was clarified that mainly the acceleration of bainitic transformation kinetics by increase in plastic strain and additionally the heat generation during drawing cause the appearance of bainite. The preferential formation of bainite near the surface could be explained by the relatively large equivalent strain near the surface due to redundant shear strain during drawing. The aus-drawn wires with fully martensite structure showed superior fatigue strength and sag resistance to those of the conventional oil-tempered wires after tempering and shot peening. On the contrary, the aus-drawn wires with bainite showed inferior properties to that of the conventional wires. Therfore, it is quite important to decrease the redundant shear strain near surface to inhibit the bainitic transformation, in order to succeed the aus-drawing process.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["189"]}
{"title": "Combination of two Nd: YAG laser beams and their welding characteristics\n", "abstract": " Nd:YAG laser oscillators of two different types were used simultaneously in order to enhance welding ability. A pulse beam emitted from a pulse pumped oscillator was irradiated onto stainless steel (304) together with a rectangularly modulated pulse beam emitted from a cw pumped laser oscillator. The deepest penetration of 7.3 mm was obtained at the total average power of 2.9 kW at a welding speed of 5 mm/s in a bead-on-plate test. It is nearly equal to the penetration depth of 7.7 mm produced by two modulated pulse beams at a total average power of 4 kW. From these results, it can be certified that the pulse beam of high peak power is effective in increasing the penetration depth in two laser beam welding. The plume is extinct after the pulse beam irradiation, although the modulated pulse beam is still irradiated. This phenomenon suggests that the pulse beam effectively enlarges a keyhole, and consequently\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["189"]}

PCD usually affects patients before the cancer is evident. The disorder evolves subacutely, and causes severe pancerebellar dysfunction. In this paper, we report a case of PCD associated with SCLC. A 65-year-old man presenting with 2 weeks of progressive vertigo, gait ataxia, and speech disturbance, was readmitted to our hospital. He had earlier been given a diagnosis of SCLC, oat cell carcinoma, and had undergone high-dose chemotherapy with peripheral blood stem cell transplantation during his first admission. Following that treatment regimen, the tumor disappeared completely and the patient had been in remission. Based on neurological findings and the presence of anti-neuronal antibodies a diagnosis of PCD was made. Although cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) was administered, the patient experienced no relief of his cerebellar ataxia. Six months afer readmission, he died of cardiac tamponade due to malignant pericarditis.

The results also show that 100ppb-level Cu reduces the etching rate since the hillocks consist of slowly etched {311} planes", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["189"]}
{"title": "An EFSM-based specification language for composite application services\n", "abstract": " Computer communication services (e.g., E-mail, FTP, Teleconferencing, WWW) provide their own functions which don't interact with each other. Network users' requirements are often satisfied by using multiple services sequentially or in parallel. This paper proposes an EFSM-based service specification language which enables users to flexibly construct a composite service such as composed of multiple services (we call them sub-services). In addition, service specifications written in the proposed language can be easily decomposed into sub-services which are reusable enough to reconstruct new composite services with those sub-services. Namely, the language ensures the reusability of specifications. Using a simple example of a composite service, this paper shows the reusability of specifications. The user programmability is also discussed by comparison with of Estelle.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["189"]}

A nitrogen-10% hydrogen mixture gas was used. The specimen was an austenitic stainless steel (SUS304), settled as the cathode. Current, voltage and gas pressure were mainly changed as plasma paraneters. The spectral intensities are influenced by these parameters. N2 and N3\" exited state were strongly detected. The intensity ratio N3\"/N3 depends on the gas pressure which was changed from 267 to 933 Pa. This dependence can be explained in terms of mean free path of particles. It was found that the ion nitriding process is largely controlled by ion density and cathode fall voltage. Also, the nitriding rate is the fastest at gas pressures from 533 Pa (4 torr) to 666 Pa (5 torr) which can be explained by taking into account the glow discharge behaviours.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["189"]}

{"title": "Research on General Instability of Cylindrical Shells Reinforced by Ring Stiffeners under Uniform Pressure (2nd Report)\n", "abstract": " General instability is one of the most important subjects of cylindrical shells reinforced by ring stiffeners under uniform pressure. Recently, based on the application of nonlinear analysis using the finite element method, and more reliable collapse tests using models manufactured with high fabrication technique and of uniform material characteristics, the study to review the design procedure, which were based on the experimental works of collapse tests using a number of scale models, has been carried out.Since pressure hulls of deep diving submersibles are usually welded structures, the welding distortion is inevitable, which might have a large influence on collapse strength. The authors have presented the elasto-plastic analysis using three dimensional finite element in the first report to estimate collapse pressure reduction of general instability by initial imperfection. To investigate the infuence of initial imperfection of complex mode and that on the overall structure, however, more effective mothod is required instead of the three dimensional analysis. In the present paper, the authors propose the elasto-plastic analysis using the quasiaxisymmetric finite element, which represents the deformation of stiffened shells by Fourier series. The analytical results compared with those obtained from the current full three-dimensional analysis show a good agreement. Futhermore, the authors investigate the influence of initial imperfection on the collapse strength of scale models, which are machined or welded, by comparing the results of the theoretical analysis and those of experimental test.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["189"]}

The critical layer thickness determined by the change of electrical properties in these systems were in good agreement with those calculated by People and Bean's energy balance model. The SD-DH structures were found to offer not only higher electron concentration, but also higher electron mobility than SD-SH structures, probably due to the higher confinement efficiency of electrons in the InGaAs quantum well.

TEI-5103 (5 mg/kg iv) increased GMBF, measured by hydrogen gas clearance method, in anesthetized rats. At 1-10 mg/kg iv it also increased GMBF, measured by cross-thermocouple method, in anesthetized rabbits and dogs. The increasing effect of TEI-5103 was more potent than that of cetraxate. By the intragastric route, TEI-5103 (400 mg/kg) increased the GMBF 1 h after the administration in anesthetized and pylorus-ligated rats. Anti-ulcer doses of TEI-5103 prevented the decrease in the GMBF induced by serotonin or indomethacin in anesthetized rats. The drug also prevented the decrease in gastric mucosal blood volume induced by serotonin. The increase in dog femoral arterial blood flow by TEI-5103 (1-10 mg ia) was not affected by propranolol, atropine, diphenhydramine, or aminophylline, nor was it attenuated by pretreatment with indomethacin. TEI-5103, like papaverine, inhibited Ca2+-, PGF2 alpha-and norepinephrine-induced contractions of isolated rabbit coeliac artery. The results indicate that TEI-5103 increases GMBF by acting directly on the gastric microcirculation and that this increasing effect may contribute to the anti-ulcer activity of TEI-5103.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["189"]}

Similar strategies have been suggested for corporate software development, through notions like Corporate Source and Progressive Open Source [6, 7]When used in a corporate setting, infrastructures for project information sharing present new opportunities. For example, one would like to know all projects that have something in common, so that the project groups can collaborate and share their work.

The blue shift of the TO mode is considerd to be caused by interfacial compressive stresses in the oxide-layer. On the other hand, the TO phonon mode was found to dramatically decrease as the oxide-layer thickness decreased from 10 nm to 1.7 nm. The CL measurement indicates that the intensity of the CL peaks at about 460 and 490 nm attributed to oxygen vacancy centers (OVCs) for No. 2 become stronger than that for No. 1.

On postoperative day 2, thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) was performed for stent graft stenosis. The blood pressure of the lower extremities promptly recovered after the procedure, and the patient was extubated without any neurologic deficits on the next day. Postoperative CT demonstrated that the stent graft stenosis had been effectively alleviated. The patient's subsequent course was uneventful and he was discharged on postoperative day 24.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["189"]}

{"title": "Yuragi-based Approach with Delay Profile for Virtual Network Embedding in Software Defined Infrastructure\n", "abstract": " Abstract SDI (Software Defined Infrastructure) provides virtualized infrastructures to customers by slicing computing resources and network resources. One of the important problems for deploying SDI framework is to control the assignment of physical resources to a virtual network against changes of traffic demand and service demand. For this problem, VNE (Virtual Network Embedding) problem that maps a virtual network to physical resources has been addressed, but a centralized calculation was assumed. It is difficult to adopt the centralized approaches as a size of infrastructure increases and a number of VN requests increases. This is because the identification of current situation becomes more complicated. In this paper, we present a VNE method that works with a little information for the large, complicated, and uncertain SDI frameworks. To achieve this, the proposed method applies biological \u201cYuragi\u201d principle. Yuragi, which is a Japanese word, represents a small perturbation to the system. Yuragi is a mechanism of adaptability of organisms and is often expressed as attractor selection model. This paper develops Yuragi-based VNE method that deals with node attribute and has a generality of a performance objective and runs in multi-slice environments. Simulation results show that the Yuragi-based method decreases VN migrations by about 45% than a heuristic method to adapt the fluctuations in resource requirements.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["189"]}

To realize a charging energy larger than the thermal energy, very small islands are necessary on a carbon nanotube channel. In this article, we review two recent challenges in fabricating room-temperature-operating CNT-SETs/SHTs. One is the introduction of defects into the carbon nanotube channel surface, and the other is the realization of a CNT-FET with an extremely small channel length. All the devices described here clearly show Coulomb oscillations even at room temperature.

In this work, we prepared La123 thin films by conventional pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method and novel low temperature growth (LTG) technique and we compared Tc of the La123 thin films. As a result, La123 thin films grown at a relative low temperature by using LTG technique showed higher Tc than those of films grown by PLD method. From an evaluation of orthorhombicity by using in-plane X-ray diffraction system, the orthorhombicity became larger with decreasing the substrate temperature and Tc of LTG-La123 thin films also increased up to 83\u00a0K. Those facts indicate that the formation of low-Tc solid solutions is suppressed by low temperature growth.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["189"]}

Prevention of future exacerbations is extremely important, especially for elderly patients. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of influenza vaccine for acute exacerbation of COPD in elderly patients. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted among 289 patients over 65 years of age with COPD (FEV1/FCV< 0.70) during the 2001-2002 influenza season. Background data, outpatient visits for wheezing and hospitalizations were compared between the vaccinated group (n= 189) and the unvaccinated group (n= 100). RESULTS: The number of patients who visited hospital for wheezing was 11 of 189 (5.8%) in the vaccinated group and 23 of 100 (23%) in the unvaccinated group (RRR: relative risk reduction 74.7%, 95% CI: confidence interval 0.51-0.87).

We compared the time dependences of the drain current for direct current (DC) measurement and alternating current (AC) measurement with a lock-in amplifier. Drain-current fluctuations were highly suppressed by the AC with lock-in method in the small gate voltage regime. On the other hand, the current fluctuations for DC measurements were not so suppressed even if the integration time was increased from 80 mus to 10 ms.

{"title": "Extraction of vocal tract area function from three-dimensional magnetic resonance images using digital waveguide mesh\n", "abstract": " The articulatory synthesis is a speech synthesis technique based on the human vocal tract and articulation models. It digitally simulates the glottal excitation and the wave propagation in the vocal tract which is controlled by the articulators such as tongue and lips. In the recent years, improvements are made on the techniques to produce the 3D shapes of the human vocal tract during the speech production using the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)[5, 8]. Some industrial applications, such as the simulation of the speech synthesis based on the 3D vocal tract shape, are, however, difficult in the modern computers to be carried out in real-time due to the computational complexity introduced by the 3D model. One of the solutions to the problem is to use an approximated 1D model estimated from the 3D vocal tract shape. The vocal tract area function is a well developed model for such a 1D vocal tract model. It is represented as a series of area values (typically expressed in the magnitude of cm2), each value representing a dimension of a cylindrical tube. The cylindrical tubes are assumed to be connected in cascade to consist an approximated human vocal tract. No bend and other fine components of the vocal tract shape are included in the model. In the simulation of the speech production or the computation of the transfer function using the area function, only the planar wave is considered to be propagated through the tube.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["189"]}

However, since software had to be created from source programs for each test, an extremely long test time had been required. Also, since the emphasis had only been on the testing tasks and no consideration was given to debugging tasks, these methods were not practical. Therefore, in the current research, the authors propose the DMET debugging technique, which can be used for actual software maintenance.

When lettuce was cultivated in nutrient solutions with combinations of the three elements at various concentrations, the concentrations of these elements in the top of lettuce were increased with increase in the concentration of each element in nutrient solutions without absorption interference of these elements with each other. These element concentrations in tops were statistically evaluated by canonical discriminant analysis, then eight treatments prepared using combinations of these elements at various concentrations in nutrient solutions were obviously distinguished from each other: ie, the probability of miss judgment was zero and the rate of correctness of judgment was 100%. Therefore, eight different labels can be incorporated into lettuce using combinations of these elements. Amounts of the three elements contained in 470 g (the value to be consumed daily recommended by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan) of fresh plants grown thus manner were lower than those of Acceptable Daily Intake or Tolerated Daily Intake for the respective elements.

{"title": "Reusability Evaluation Method Using Relations among Source Code Files\n", "abstract": " Reusing the software components that have high reusability improve the software productivity, quality and cost. A lot of reusability metrics have been proposed. Most of them are based on the calculation of the static attributes of the software component. However, in practice, it is necessary to show quantitatively that the components with high reusability have actually reused in many software systems. There may exist such software component that have low reusability based on the conventional metrics but actually have reused in many software systems. This paper proposes the new reusability measurement method based on the following principles:(1) There exists use relationship among software components,(2) Generally, the use relationships are changing as time goes by and some components are reused in many software developments,(3) With the passing of enough time, the components that have been reused by many other components have high reusability and ones that are reused by the components with high reusability also have high reusability. Base on the proposed method, we have developed reusability measurement system for Java programs and applied it to several Java programs.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["189"]}

An equivalent circuit was introduced to combine the dynamic electricai resistance of workpieces, the welding power source and the control characteristics of the system.

A 32-bit UNIX-based OS manages time information as a 32-bit signed integer, and it is known that an overflow of time information occurs in 2038. There are not many reports of practical approach for this problem. In this paper, we report our experience of successful modification of a 32-bit FreeBSD embedded system by changing the starting point of the UNIX time (epoch time).

{"title": "Lightweight Semi-Dynamic Methods for Efficient and Eective Program Slicing\n", "abstract": " When we try to debug a large program effectively, it is very important to separate a suspicious program portion from the overall source program. Program slicing is a promising technique to extract a program portion; however, it remains difficult issues. Static slicing sometimes produces a large portion of the source program, especially for a program with arrays and pointers. Dynamic slicing requires unacceptably huge run-time overhead. In this paper, we discuss intermediate semi-dynamic methods between static and dynamic slicing. We propose two slicing methods named call-mark slicing and dependence-cache slicing. These algorithms have been implemented in our experimental slicing system, and execution data for several sample programs have been collected. The result shows that call-mark slicing reduces the slice size by about 10-20% from the static slice size, with very little overhead increase. Also, dependence-cache slice reduces by about 30-90%, even for programs using arrays, with aordable run-time overhead increase. These slicing methods will be important features for effective debugging environments.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["189"]}

Experimental group: Global ischemia was induced at the same time course as the control group and during reperfusion, halothane administered at the concentration of 1%, 2%, 3%. Cardiac function (heart rate, coronary flow, Vmax of the left ventricule) and intracelluar calcium level was measured during pre-ischemia, ischemia and reperfusion period. Recovery of cardiac function after ischemia was better in the 1% halothane group than in the control group but suppression on cardiac function inclined to increase concentration dependently.

{"title": "Web-based Process Management System with Object-Centered Process Modeling\n", "abstract": " Most of process-centered software engineering environments and those description languages tend to focus on the way of producing the software product; they describe mainly how software is developed. However, recent software development such as distributed and networked development tends to focus on the software product itself; we are interested in software component, development tool, and so on. These are because of emergence of various types of software development approaches, eg, object-oriented software development, software re-use, and so on. To fill up the gap between the current process-centered software engineering environments and the emerging software development, we discuss a new process modeling method for describing the emerging software development method, and design a web-based software development environment based on the model. Our model consists of a set of objects, which represent the artifacts and the resources in the real software development environment. We have developed a prototype system of the web-based environments, and we have enacted ISPW-6 software process example with this system. Our system can illustrate software development environment very naturally, and provides an environment for software process execution, management, and improvement.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["189"]}
{"title": "Adaptive Traffic Control Model with Neural Network Analogy\n", "abstract": " We propose here an autonomous traffic signal control model based on analogy with neural networks. In this model, the duration of blue (green) and red traffic light display at each signal is autonomously adapted. We find a self--organizing collective behavior of such a model through simulation on a two--dimensional lattice model road: traffic congestion is greatly diffused when traffic signals have such autonomous adaptability with suitably tuned parameters. We also find that effectiveness of the system emerges through interactions between units and shows a non--linear response of saturation shape as a function of proportion of adaptive signals in the model. 1 1 In the Proceedings of the 1997 International Conference on Neural Information Processing and Intelligent Information Systems (ICONIP'97, Novermber, Dunedin, New Zealand) pp. 939942. 1 Introduction The problem of traffic control is one of the major issues of our society on motorways as well as computer networks.

The coatings were heated at 1333-1473K in Ar or N sub 2 atmosphere, and the penetration behavior of liquid Cu-Mn alloy into the porous zirconia coating and the sintering of zirconia coating were studied. It was found that liquid Cu-Mn alloy with compositions of 50 wt.% Mn and 70 wt.% Mn rapidly penetrated into the zirconia coating and reached the interface between the zirconia coating and substrate. The zirconia coating densified by liquid sintering mechanism. It was revealed that the hardness of zirconia coating increased greatly after this heat-treatment compared with that of the as-sprayed zirconia coating.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["189"]}

However, for the superconductive magnets for magnetic resonance spectroscopy, insertion of single superconducting solenoidal coil is required in response to the demand of highly accurate homogeneous magnetic field. Highly strengthened Bi-2212 multifilamentary superconducting wires with low aspect ratio have been developed, which show the same critical current density as pure Ag-sheathed wires and can be applied to solenoidal coils. These wires are octagonal and round wires. Their strength is enhanced by the outer Ag-alloy layer added by slight amount of Ni and Mg through heat treatment. Pure Ag-barrier layer is placed between Bi-2212 core and Ag-alloy layer to avoid the crystal incompatible reaction due to mutual diffusion between the added Ni and Mg and the core elements. This also contributes to the enhanced orientation. These double-sheathed wires showed the same critical current density as Bi-2212 wire in which Ag-alloy is replaced by Ag. These wires have high proof strength over 200 MPa. Flux densities up to 0.18 T can be stably generated in a back-up one of 21 T.

Software metrics are quantitative measures of software products and process. For example, complexity metrics are used to evaluate maintenance difficulty of a program. In order to evaluate the complexity of object-oriented program, several complexity metrics have been proposed. Among them, Chidamber and Kemerer's metrics are the most well-known metrics for object-oriented programs. Also, their effectiveness for estimating the number of faults in a program has been evaluated empirically. However, from the viewpoint of the management, it is more important to estimate the cost to fix the faults in the program rather than the number of ones. This paper empirically evaluates the usefulness of Chidamber's metrics by examining the relationship between the value of the metrics and the cost to fix the faults in the program by using the data collected from actual software development processes. This paper also examines how to apply the metrics to the programs most of which is developed by reusing the classes in the class-library (framework).", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["189"]}
{"title": "A Computational Model for Thin Film Formation during Ion Beam Mixing (Physics, Processes, Instruments & Measurements)\n", "abstract": " A computational model for thin film formation during ion beam mixing is described in detail on the basis of the binary collision approximation (BCA). A new approach for the effect of residual gas on the growing thin film is also presented. This model has been applied for simulating AlN thin film formation under the condition of nitrogen ion energies of 0.25-1.5 ke V and Al/N transport ratios of 0.5-2.0. The calculated results show that ion energy plays an important role on the composition of the bulk filin and the formation of the interface between the film and the substrate. The calculated results are also compared with experimental ones to demonstrate the abilities of the model. A fine agreement is shown for the transport ratio Al/N= 1. On the other hand, a discrepancy exists in the range of the transport ratio Al/N< 1, the reason for which is discussed.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["189"]}

{"title": "Myocardial protective effect of rapid cooling shock at reperfusion\n", "abstract": " Hypothermia in a heart in which coronary circulation is sustained produces positive inotropism of the myocardium. The effects on cardiac function and intracellular Ca profile of rapid cooling shock (RCS) immediately after reperfusion were evaluated in terms of their ability to inhibit the onset of myocardial stunning and to rapidly improve function. RCS administered to isolated hearts of Langendorff perfusion rats for 3 minutes induced positive inotropism after 32+/-4 seconds, with LV Developed Pressure (LVDP) increased a normal 120+/-10%(mean+/-SE, n= 16). Based on the result in which the positive inotropism was confirmed, an experiment using rats was performed as follows: after 30 minutes of ischemia at 37 degrees C, 25 degrees C or 10 degrees C, the hearts were reperfused for 1, 2 or 3 minutes and RCS was administered for 1, 2 or 3 minutes. LVDP was satisfactorily reversed early in rats treated with RCS for 3 minutes after 3 minutes reperfusion of the ischemic hearts at 25 degrees C. In this group, no significant change in Ca concentration in myocardial cells was observed at reperfusion:+/-3% of the baseline level. Intracellular Ca overload at reperfusion and decreased intracellular Ca level, which have the effect of suppressing the CICR channel, which plays a role in Ca release into the sarcoplasmic reticulum at contraction, are important causative factors in the development of myocardial stunning, as are free radicals. RCS improved myocardial function rapidly because it inhibited change in Ca level.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["189"]}

The kits compared were sero-IPALISA-IgG-IgA, IP-Azyme-IgG-IgA and HITAZYME-IgG-IgA, and micro-IF. Serum samples were collected from the outpatient departments of gynecology, urology, and internal medicine and pediatrics. The results of agreement between WB and test kits in IgG detection were as follows: in sero-IPALISA, total agreement was 85.7%, positive agreement 83.3%, negative agreement 90.9% and in IPAzyme: 85.7%, 83.3%, 90.9%, respectively and in HITAZYME: 82.9%, 75%, 100%, respectively.

The drug was administered as a tablet containing 50 mg orally three times daily for 8 consecutive weeks. The final global improvement rating and global utility rating were respectively 80.8 and 73.1 percent for all patients. The improvement rates on the Hamilton depression rating scale (HAM-D) were more than 60% for depressed mood, guilt, suicide, middle insomnia, delayed insomnia, psychotic anxiety, gastro-intestinal symptom, hypochondriasis, depersonalization and derealization. The rates regarding global symptoms evaluated by the Psychoneurotic rating scale for doctor's use were more than 60% for tension, agitation, irritability and excitement, phobia, depression, hypochondria and nocturnal delirium in psychotic symptoms, and insomnia in addition to palpitation in somatic symptoms. A significant decrease was also observed in the symptoms covered by the Self-rating depression scale of Zung after treatment with this drug. There were no instances of side-effects, nor any abnormalities in laboratory tests, encountered throughout the trial. Therefore, bifemelane hydrochloride is of value for the treatment of geriatric depression.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["189"]}

{"title": "Clinical studies on treatment by ESWL using EDAP LT-02 for upper urinary tract calculi\n", "abstract": " From July 1993 through March 1994, 512 ESWL therapy was performed on upper urinary tract calculi in 277 renoureteral units using an EDAP LT-02 Lithotripter. Of these cases, 244 renoureteral units which were followed up for more than 3 months after ESWL were examined. These included 124 renal stones and 100 ureteral stones. Complete removal or sufficient stone disintegration was obtained in 66.7, 98.0 and 94.1% in the R1, R2 and R3 groups of renal stones, respectively, and in 92.4, 87.5 and 100% in the U1, U2 and U3 groups of ureteral stones, respectively. The over-all stone-free and success rates were 78.2 and 95.2%, respectively for renal stones and 93.0% and 94.0% respectively for ureteral stones. These results were better than those obtained by LT-01 in our experiences. The newly built-in coaxial X-ray system greatly contributed to these high success rates. As side effects, there were no serious complications. It is concluded that ESWL using an EDAP LT-02 is safer and more effective for the treatment of upper urinary tract calculi.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["189"]}

Material constants are necessary for the numerical model developed, but the material constants are arranged into seven model parameters, except for the yield stress. We estimate the values of the seven parameters by inverse analysis. We propose the methods to choose the experimental conditions which we need for the inverse analysis. We also propose the algorithm to obtain the proper converged solutions of the unknown model parameters. We indicate that the solutions converge to true model parameters. Further, we show that bonding processes with unknown parameters can be predicted by our algorithm.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["189"]}
{"title": "Noise Rejection for Joint Configuration Detection of Arc Welding by Using Neural Network (Physics, Process, Instrument & Measurements)\n", "abstract": " On using the signal processing ability of Backpropagation Model of Neural Network, the noise rejection is performed on the image of a joint part of arc welding. The object image, which is obtained by the slit light slice method, is often used for the detection of joint configuration on the purpose ofwelding automation. The noise caused by the welding arc is superimposed on the image and disturbs the detection. Such noise is rejected through the learning process of Neural Network which is carried out for the noise imposed input images and the noiseless teacher images. The Structure of the network, the image input method, the selection of the teacher image and the method to recover the resolution of the processed result are investigated experimentally. It is shown that the noise rejection is successfully done as the results.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["189"]}

This report describes two aged siblings who underwent successful surgery for this disease. Neither patient had the clinical features of Marfan syndrome, and both had histories of systemic hypertension. Case 1: A 76-year-old man had dissecting aortic aneurysm, DeBakey type IIIa, which was localized and had multiple lumina with thrombi. Case 2: A 71-year-old man (younger brother of case 1) had retrograde dissecting aortic aneurysm, DeBakey type IIIa. Histological examinations of the aortae showed cystic medial necrosis in both cases, and also showed atherosclerotic changes in case 1. These two siblings had no familial history of cardiovascular incidents and were much older than previously reported cases. Therefore it may be possible that the dissecting aortic aneurysms of these two cases occurred coincidently rather than due to hereditary factors.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["189"]}

From 1975 to 1992, a total of 4,100 patients underwent coronary arteriography at Show University Hospital. Of these, four patients (0.1%) had complete occlusion of all three coronary arteries and all of them underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The mean numbers of coronary risk factors were only 2.3 but history of angina of effort were long-standing such as 4 to 29 years (mean 16.3 yr). All cases had previous episodes of myocardial infarction. Three cases (75%) had aortic aneurysm. One case was also diagnosed as Leriche syndrome besides coexisting aneurysm. Coronary arteriogram showed total occlusion of right coronary artery, left anterior descending artery and left circumflex artery in the segment of 1.6 or 7 and 11 respectively. All cases had intracoronary anastomosis and intercoronary anastomosis. Among 12 occluded coronary arteries of all four cases, 11 were distally visualized with contrast medium via collateral flow but good opacification of the distal coronary trees were not seen. Also proper assessments of cardiac performance including viability of myocardium were not established because all cases were in the state of CCS grades IV. But significant clinical recovery were obtained in all cases after CAGB of three or four bypass. We conclude that these results might be a useful suggestion for the treatment of total occlusion of all three coronary arteries.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["189"]}
{"title": "Compression method using LZW coding and a sliding window\n", "abstract": " This paper proposes a new compression method which uses a sliding window with an Lempel\u2010Ziv\u2010Welch (LZW) dictionary. When an LZW phrase is constructed, the location of the phrase on the window is also recorded in the dictionary. Using this information, there are cases where we can find that a new LZW phrase is already included in the sliding window. If the current input matches the string on the window longer than the LZW phrase constructed, the length of the string is encoded instead of the phrase itself. For most kinds of inputs, the compression performance of this method is better than the original LZW method and is equal or superior to various improved LZW methods. In addition, compared with that of the LZW method, the execution time of this method increases only about 25 percent.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["189"]}

{"title": "Bandgap profiling of stacked solar cells\n", "abstract": " Amorphous silicon (a-Si) alloy materials have some advantages, for example, their large-area deposition, a low-temperature process, and var-ious substrate materials. As compared with the properties of crystal silicon (c-Si), the electric properties, for example, the mobility and lifetime, of a-Si alloy materials are worse than those of c-Si. However, a-Si alloy materials are widely applied for solar cells and thin-film transistors (TFT). In the case of the solar cells, because the light-absorption coefficients of a-Si alloy materials are larger than those of c-Si, carriers are photo-generated in thin photovoltaic active layers of less than 1 um thickness and they are swept out as current by a high electric field in the thin layer of a pin structure, although a-Si alloy materials have lower mobility and shorter lifetime. From the point of view of using the advantages of a-Si alloy materials for this purpose, one of the big advantages is that their optical bandgap can be continuously controlled by changing the composi-tional ratio of the alloy, even though the bandgap of c-Si is constant. There are some a-Si solar-cell technologies that make use of the controllability of the optical bandgap, for example, pli interface layers, multi-bandgap stacked solar cells, and bandgap profiling. Among these, bandgap profil-ing, where the bandgap of the a-Si main layer is changed, is dealt with here and it has been investigated in relation to a-Si alloy films [1\u20133] and solar cells [4\u201310]. On the other hand, an a-Si alloy, multi-bandgap stacked solar cell is one of the most promising cell structures for obtaining both a high stability and a high conversion efficiency [9].", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["189"]}

{"title": "Selection of methods for diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer\n", "abstract": " The prognosis for ductal cancer of the pancreas is extremely poor. Diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in the earlier stages has become possible by taking note of early symptoms, mild abdominal pain, back pain, anorexia, diabetes and obstructive jaundice. Presently, measurements of amylase in serum and urine, serum elastase-1, serum CA 19-9 and US are usually used for screening patients with the symptoms. Furthermore, for correct diagnosis, intensive study by US, dynamic CT, ERCP, MRI, cytological examination and CEA of pancreatic juice, endoscopic pancreatoscopy and endoscopic ultrasonography are used. The results of surgical treatment for resectable pancreatic cancer are not generally favorable. Extended pancreatic resection (pancreatoduodenectomy, total pancreatectomy or distal pancreatectomy) with en bloc dissection of the lymph nodes has been performed for patients with invasive cancer. However, local recurrence and distant metastasis usually occurred after surgery. It seems difficult to cure pancreatic cancer by surgery alone. To improve the prognosis of resectable pancreatic cancer, multimodality treatment with intraoperative radiation therapy and chemotherapy is performed and a better outcome is achieved.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["189"]}

Histological types with their incidences were seminomas in 31 patients and nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCTs) in 23 adults. DNA ploidy and DI were analyzed by flow cytometry in 158 paraffin embedded samples; 2.9 samples per case on the average. This study revealed that 52 cases (96%) of evaluable 54 adult GCTs were DNA aneuploid, while DNA diploid tumors were observed in only each one case of NSGCT and seminoma. There was a significant difference (p less than 0.01) between the distribution of DIs in adult NSGCTs (median DI= 1.50) and that in pure seminomas (median DI= 1.85). Although we found no significant correlation between DI and clinical staging of Japanese Urological Association, on the basis of Indiana University staging system, the median DI in NSGCT patients of the advanced extent was lower than those of the other extents. DNA heterogeneity was observed only in 4 of 23 NSGCT patients (17%) and 3 of those 4 patients were assigned to advanced extent. These data suggest that the lower DI and the presence of DNA heterogeneity may have prognostic relevance for NSGCTs.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["189"]}

{"title": "Partial Charging of Moisture Controlled Coal for Uniform Carbonization\n", "abstract": " Recently the Coal Moisture Control(CMC) process, in which coal is dried to 5\u20226% moisture content, has been industrially applied to several works in Japan. In order to obtain uniform carbonization throughout the coke oven with low operation cost, a Partial Charging of Moisture Controlled Coal (PCMC) process has been proposed and investigated. The PCMC process is aimed for decrease of moisture content of charged coal and for increase of bulk density in the upper portion of coke oven by selective charging of moisture controlled coal. As a result of this study, the following results were obtained.(1) Through the test using full scale cold model oven, the flow pattern of coal from the charging car was confirmed to be funnel flow type. In order to charge moisture controlled coal in the upper portion of coke oven, it is necessary to charge moisture controlled coal in the lower portion of the charging car.(2) Through the test using actual coke oven, the PCMC process was confirmed to be effective for the uniform carbonization across the oven height.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["189"]}

Our surgical techniques of the extraction, as well as the indication and the prognosis, were described in this paper. Techniques of the lens extraction were basically Barraquer's method, but in modified form. Vitrectomy was carried out by open sky approach (in 2 cases) or pars plana approach (in 12 cases). In cases complicated by acute phacolytic uveitis, excellent results were obtained by these surgical techniques after the complete control of inflammation with steroid. Before surgical extraction, intraocular pressure had been elevated over 21 mm Hg in eight cases. But in all these cases intraocular pressure was controlled without medication after surgery. Visual acuity was improved unless chorioretinal atrophy or glaucoma were not accompanied. From these surgical results, it seems to be reasonable to extract surgically the dislocated lens before the eye is severely damaged.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["189"]}

{"title": "Immunotherapy of gastric cancer\n", "abstract": " Two immunotherapeutic methods were developed as adjuvant therapy for gastrointestinal malignancies, one using oral administration of a streptococcal preparation, OK-432, and the other with adoptive immunotherapy (AIT), local transfer of IL2-cultured and autologous lymphocytes, combined with local preadministration of OK-432. Tsuchitani and Nio in our laboratory have revealed experimentally that oral OK-432 stimulates tumor-specific and non-specific immune mechanisms of gut-associated lymphoid tissues and inhibits the growth of some murine syngeneic tumors that were transplanted into cecal patches. The clinical efficacy of oral OK-432 on gastric cancer patients has been examined by a controlled randomized trial involving a total of about 1000 cases. Oral OK-432 (5KE, once a week) was revealed to be significantly effective in curatively resected group but not effective in non-curatively resected group. Ten consecutive patients with peritoneal dissemination of gastric cancer were treated with intraperitoneal OK-432 and AIT. AIT was performed by transferring autologous lymph node-lymphocytes cultured for 13 days with crude IL2 and tumor-extract. The survival of the treated patients was significantly longer (50% survival period exceeded 1 year) than that of historical control (95 cases, 50% survival period was 5 months). These immunotherapeutic methods are expected to be useful for multidisciplinary therapy of gastric cancer by a combination of each method with other therapeutic methods.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["189"]}

{"title": "Comparative studies on the activities of prostaglandin biosynthesis in platelets and aortas of normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats\n", "abstract": " METHODS: Platelet aggregation induced by AA (10mM) and ADP (5\u03bcM) was monitored using rat platelet-rich plasma(PRP) at 37\u2103 in a Sienco dual sample aggregometer. Fatty acid cyclo-oxygenase in platelets was estimated by measuring oxygen uptake using AA as substrate with a galvanic electrode (type SBOA, the Kyusui-Kagaku Institute, Tokyo) according to the method of Yoshimoto et al (J BIOCHEM TOKYO 68: 487, 1970). TXA2 synthetase activity in platelets was determined by transferable aggregating method of Chignard and Vargafig (PROSTAGLANDINS 14: 222, 1977). PGI2 synthetase activity was expressed as antiaggregatory potency, with the method of Bunting et al (PROSTAGLANDINS 12: 897, 1976). using rabbit PRP and rat thoracic aortas. treated with 20\u03bcg/ml lndomethacin for 1hr at 0-4\u2103.RESULTS: In both SHR and WKY from 6 to 30 wk of age, reactivity to AA induced platelet aggregation decreased with age except in SHR at 30 wk of age. Aggregation response to AA in SHR was significantly higher than in WKY. However, no significant differences were observed between SHR and WKY in the activity of fatty acid cyclo-oxygenase and the extent of platelet aggregation induced by ADP at all ages.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["189"]}
