{"title": "BROAD-RSI\u2013educational recommender system using social networks interactions and linked data\n", "abstract": " There are several educational resources distributed in different repositories that address to a wide range of subjects and different educational goals. The proper choice of these educational resources is a challenge. Recommendation systems may help users in this task. In order to generate personalized recommendations, it is important to identify information that will help to define user profile and assist in identifying his/her interests. The constant and ever-increasing use of social networks allows the identification of different information about profile, interests, preferences, style and behavior from the spontaneous interaction. This paper presents an infrastructure able to extract users\u2019 profile and educational context, from the Facebook social network and recommend educational resources. The proposal is supported by Information Extraction Techniques and Semantic Web technologies for extraction, enrichment and definition of user\u2019s profile and interests. The recommendation approach is based on learning objects repositories, linked data and video repositories. It takes advantage of user\u2019s spent time at the web. The proposal evaluation was made from the development of a prototype, three proofs of concept and a case study. The evaluation showed users\u2019 acceptance of extracted information about their educational interests, automatically generated from social network and enriched to find implicit interests. It was also validated the possibility of people recommendation, enabling the establishment of interest network, based on a specific subject, showing good partners to study and research.", "num_citations": "40\n", "authors": ["753"]}

One way of monitoring software properly is through software process control. Software process control is a critical factor for developing a software with good quality.Software process can be characterized as a set of necessary activities for developing and implementing software, executed by a group of organized people according to an organizational structure and supported by conceptual and technical tools (Acuna et al., 2000). To be able to control software process, the support of suitable tools and techniques is essential. Monitoring and continuously improve processes are important mechanisms to be implemented. This monitoring and improvement go through the information knowledge related to the process, considering that, based on process model information, as well as based on previous or similar process executions, it is possible to refine new executions and provide process quality and software improvements.

{"title": "An approach to configuration management of scientific workflows\n", "abstract": " A scientific software ecosystem aims to integrate all stages of an experiment and its related workflows, in order to solve complex problems. In this vein, in order to assure the experiment proper execution, any modification that occurs must be propagated to the associated workflows, which must be maintained and evolved for the successful conduction of the research. One way to ensure this control is through configuration management using data provenance. In this work, the authors use data provenance concepts and models, together with ontologies to provide an architecture for the storage and query of scientific experiment information. Considering the architecture, a proof of concept was conducted using workflows extracted from the myExperiment repository. The results are presented along the paper.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["753"]}

{"title": "ThesIS: A semantic interoperability service for a middleware service oriented architecture\n", "abstract": " The Web-based Groupware Service-Oriented Architecture (WGWSOA) is an infrastructure that uses middleware services to support collaborative system development. In addition, it aims to support the issue of semantic interoperability conflict resolution for middleware services in the construction of collaborative systems in heterogeneous environments. Interoperability is an essential requirement for service implementation that supports developments in these environments and as a result, this is an important factor for the interaction of user groups in collaborative systems. In this context, the goal of this paper is to describe a solution to widen semantic interoperability support in an infrastructure whose goal is to support collaborative system development and execution.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["753"]}
{"title": "Supporting Context-awareness in Web-based Groupware Development.\n", "abstract": " Context in groupware development has been evaluated in some standalone applications in an ad-hoc manner. Although one of the main goals of groupware infrastructures deployment is to provide the necessary flexibility to build groupware applications, most of them do not supply enough mechanisms in order to consider the context in which group participants interact. Consequently, a large amount of not relevant information could be presented to the user. This paper presents a brief discussion about the importance of context elements support in groupware. Some context features already available in a groupware infrastructure are discussed, in order for them to be deployed in a web-based groupware development. As part of this infrastructure, a context-awareness service which considers group context is also described.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["753"]}
