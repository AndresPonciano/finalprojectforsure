{"title": "A survey of maintenance policies of deteriorating systems\n", "abstract": " In the past several decades, maintenance and replacement problems of deteriorating systems have been extensively studied in the literature. Thousands of maintenance and replacement models have been created. However, all these models can fall into some categories of maintenance policies: age replacement policy, random age replacement policy, block replacement policy, periodic preventive maintenance policy, failure limit policy, sequential preventive maintenance policy, repair cost limit policy, repair time limit policy, repair number counting policy, reference time policy, mixed age policy, preparedness maintenance policy, group maintenance policy, opportunistic maintenance policy, etc. Each kind of policy has different characteristics, advantages and disadvantages. This survey summarizes, classifies, and compares various existing maintenance policies for both single-unit and multi-unit systems. The\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1970\n", "authors": ["462"]}
{"title": "Bayes and classical estimation of environmental factors for the binomial distribution\n", "abstract": " An environmental factor converts reliability test results at one environmental condition into equivalent \"failure\" information at other environments. This paper studies environmental-factor estimation for the binomial distribution. Under general conditions, Bayes point estimates and credibility limits for environmental factors are derived. Classical point and confidence interval estimates are introduced and compared with the Bayes estimators. The characteristics of Bayes and classical estimators for the binomial distribution are summarized through numerical computation and theoretical analysis. A numerical example of reliability assessment by means of environmental factors is presented.", "num_citations": "32\n", "authors": ["462"]}
{"title": "Warranty cost models considering imperfect repair and preventive maintenance\n", "abstract": " Today most products are sold with a warranty that offers financial protection to consumers due to failures during the warranty period. Depending on the type of product, its inherent quality/reliability, and a host of other variables including the warranty period, warranty cost could be a significant portion of the overall product cost. Therefore, it is important to predict warranty cost accurately. However, most existing warranty cost models are not realistic in the sense that perfect or minimal repair is assumed. This paper presents four new warranty cost models which all assume imperfect repair. Imperfect repair restores the system operating state to somewhere between \u201cas good as new\u201d (perfect repair) and \u201cas bad as old\u201d (minimal repair), and could include two extreme cases: minimal and perfect repair. Thus, the warranty cost model with imperfect repair is more general and realistic. Warranty of a k-out-of-n system with\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "27\n", "authors": ["462"]}
{"title": "Method and apparatus for warranty cost calculation\n", "abstract": " Method and apparatus for calculating warranty cost includes determining values for a plurality of parameters that characterize a corresponding plurality of physical conditions of a product that is returned under warranty, determining values for a plurality of variables that characterize a customer profile for the product and evaluating an expression that calculates warranty cost based on said determined parameter and variable values. The plurality of physical conditions of the product includes the conditions of no-trouble-found (NTF), repaired, junked, and subject to further failure mode analysis (FMA). The plurality of parameters further comprises probabilities and costs that correspond to each of the physical conditions. Evaluating the above expression includes evaluating a first expression that calculates repair, product conformance and Dead-On-Arrival cost and evaluating a second expression that calculates Change\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["462"]}
{"title": "A research study of environmental factors for the gamma distribution\n", "abstract": " Environmental factor estimation for the gamma distribution with two parameters is considered here. In the consideration of the characteristics of the gamma distribution, the definition of environmental factors for the exponential distribution and the convenience of data conversion, the definition of environmental factors for the gamma distribution is proposed. In accordance with this definition, the lower and upper confidence limits of environmental factors are derived by Classical, Bayesian and Fiducial methods. Some approximate confidence limits are also given. A practical example is provided and the results indicate that the definition, the confidence limits and their approximants are suitable.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["462"]}

{"title": "Estimation of environmental factors for the normal distribution\n", "abstract": " Two definitions of environmental factors for the normal distribution are proposed in this paper. According to the first definition the upper and lower confidence limits of the normal environmental factor are derived by Mellin transform, characteristic function and the theorem for the quotient of two random variables, whose approximate confidence limits are also given. From the second definition, using the noninformative and the natural conjugate prior distributions respectively, the Bayes confidence limits for the normal environmental factor are derived for two cases where \u03bc is a random variable and \u03c3 is known; both \u03bc and \u03c3 are random variables.
