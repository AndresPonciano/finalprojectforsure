{"title": "Qualitative and quantitative monitoring of spatio-temporal properties\n", "abstract": " We address the specification and verification of spatio-temporal behaviours of complex systems, extending Signal Spatio-Temporal Logic (SSTL) with a spatial operator capable of specifying topological properties in a discrete space. The latter is modelled as a weighted graph, and provided with a boolean and a quantitative semantics. Furthermore, we define efficient monitoring algorithms for both the boolean and the quantitative semantics. These are implemented in a Java tool available online. We illustrate the expressiveness of SSTL and the effectiveness of the monitoring procedures on the formation of patterns in a Turing reaction-diffusion system.", "num_citations": "76\n", "authors": ["1662"]}
{"title": "Specifying and monitoring properties of stochastic spatio-temporal systems in signal temporal logic\n", "abstract": " We present an extension of the linear time, time-bounded, Signal Temporal Logic to describe spatio-temporal properties. We consider a discrete location/patch-based representation of space, with a population of interacting agents evolving in each location and with agents migrating from one patch to another one. We provide both a boolean and a quantitative semantics to this logic. We then present monitoring algorithms to check the validity of a formula, or to compute its satisfaction (robustness) score, over a spatio-temporal trace, exploiting these routines to do statistical model checking of stochastic models. We illustrate the logic at work on an epidemic example, looking at the diffusion of a cholera infection among communities living along a river.", "num_citations": "50\n", "authors": ["1662"]}
{"title": "Qualitative and quantitative monitoring of spatio-temporal properties with SSTL\n", "abstract": " In spatially located, large scale systems, time and space dynamics interact and drives the behaviour. Examples of such systems can be found in many smart city applications and Cyber-Physical Systems. In this paper we present the Signal Spatio-Temporal Logic (SSTL), a modal logic that can be used to specify spatio-temporal properties of linear time and discrete space models. The logic is equipped with a Boolean and a quantitative semantics for which efficient monitoring algorithms have been developed. As such, it is suitable for real-time verification of both white box and black box complex systems. These algorithms can also be combined with stochastic model checking routines. SSTL combines the until temporal modality with two spatial modalities, one expressing that something is true somewhere nearby and the other capturing the notion of being surrounded by a region that satisfies a given spatio-temporal property. The monitoring algorithms are implemented in an open source Java tool. We illustrate the use of SSTL analysing the formation of patterns in a Turing Reaction-Diffusion system and spatio-temporal aspects of a large bike-sharing system.", "num_citations": "26\n", "authors": ["1662"]}
{"title": "Inferring analyzable models from trajectories of spatially-distributed internet of things\n", "abstract": " Internet of things systems are increasingly common nowadays. They feature spatially-distributed, mobile entities with an arising collective behavior. Such entities bear radionavigation sensors that produce positioning information, then used by the (software-enabled) device to produce positioning information over time, referred to as trajectories. However, software applications built on top of this require composite models of space to be in place; such models can provide adaptive behaviors by observing, evaluating, and reacting to a constantly changing spatial environment. This is typically achieved by monitoring for changes, analyzing requirements violations and then planning and executing adequate countermeasures. We are concerned with the fact that model representations of space are highly pertinent to requirements reasoning of internet of things systems, and such spatial models can be very useful for\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["1662"]}
{"title": "Model checking Markov population models by stochastic approximations\n", "abstract": " Many complex systems can be described by population models, in which a pool of agents interacts and produces complex collective behaviours. We consider the problem of verifying formal properties of the underlying mathematical representation of these models, which is a Continuous Time Markov Chain, often with a huge state space. To circumvent the state space explosion, we rely on stochastic approximation techniques, which replace the large model by a simpler one, guaranteed to be probabilistically consistent. We show how to efficiently and accurately verify properties of random individual agents, specified by Continuous Stochastic Logic extended with Timed Automata (CSL-TA), and how to lift these specifications to the collective level, approximating the number of agents satisfying them using second or higher order stochastic approximation techniques.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1662"]}
{"title": "jSSTL-a tool to monitor spatio-temporal properties\n", "abstract": " Controlling and designing spatio-temporal behaviours requires proper formal tools to describe such properties, and to monitor and verify whether, and how robustly, they are satisfied by a system. In this paper, we introduce jSSTL, a Java tool for the specification of Signal Spatio-Temporal Logic (SSTL) properties and their robust monitoring on spatio-temporal trajectories. The tool consists of a jSSTL API and a front-end, integrated in ECLIPSE. We describe in details the framework and the use of the plugin, exploiting a running example of a cholera outbreak.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1662"]}

The novel spatio-temporal logic TSTL enriches the analysis of properties expressed in Signal Spatio-Temporal Logic (SSTL), providing further insight into the dynamic behaviour of systems. Starting from the estimated satisfaction probabilities of given SSTL properties, it enables the analysis of their temporal and spatial evolution. We use a three-valued approach in our verification procedure to include the uncertainty associated with the simulation-based statistical method used to estimate the satisfaction probabilities. In relation to this aspect, we introduce a reliability specification for the TSTL analysis and we present a specific algorithm to automatically\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1662"]}

It can be difficult for patients to manage their T1D, as they must control a variety of behavioral factors that affect glycemic control outcomes. In this paper, we explore T1D patient behaviors using a Signal Temporal Logic (STL) based learning approach. STL formulas learned from real patient data characterize behavior patterns that may result in varying glycemic control. Such logical characterizations can provide feedback to clinicians and their patients about behavioral changes that patients may implement to improve T1D control.
