{"title": "Qos-aware composition of adaptive service-oriented systems\n", "abstract": " Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) increasingly gains momentum in academia and industry as a means to develop adaptive distributed software applications in a loosely coupled way. Software services, as the main entities in SOC, have some distinct properties such as platform-independence or a uniform interface description enabling an easier integration and use within and across organizational boundaries. One of the main assets of service-orientation is composability to develop higher-level services, so-called composite services, by re-using well-known functionality provided by other services in a low-cost and rapid development process. However, in distributed environments, the use of services without any quality guarantees from the service providers can negatively affect a composite service by raising intermittent failures or having a slow performance of one of the services. One of the main problems is the lack of an integrated Quality of Service (QoS) model combined with an automated monitoring technique. The availability of accurate and up-to-date QoS information enables a QoS-aware composition and optimization of composite services by automatically selecting well-performing services and dynamically replace services that reduce the performance or lead to failures in a composition. However, existing QoS-aware composition approaches mainly focus on the optimization aspect to find the best composition in terms of QoS. Therefore, QoS should be seamlessly integrated into multiple layers of the SOC stack, such as choreography, orchestration and execution.
