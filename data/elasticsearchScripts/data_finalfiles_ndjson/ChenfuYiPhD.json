{"title": "Zhang neural networks and neural-dynamic method\n", "abstract": " The real-time solution to a mathematical problem arises in numerous fields of science, engineering, and business. It is usually an essential part of many solutions, e.g., matrix/vector computation, optimisation, control theory, kinematics, signal processing, and pattern recognition. In recent years, due to the in-depth research on neural networks, numerous recurrent neural networks (RNN) based on the gradient-based method have been developed and investigated. Particularly, some simple neural networks were proposed to solve linear programming problems in real time and implemented on analogue circuits. In this book, ZNN, ZD or ZND theory formalises these problems and solutions in the time-varying context and provides compact models that could solve those dynamic problems.", "num_citations": "241\n", "authors": ["873"]}

{"title": "Battery-friendly scheduling policy in MAC layer for WBAN data packets transmission\n", "abstract": " Energy consumption is a critical issue for battery-powered sensor nodes in wireless body area networks (WBANs). Many energy-efficient medium access control (MAC) protocols have been proposed and investigated for energy-constrained WBANs. These protocols assume that the battery has an ideal linear model. However, in practical application, the battery model is non-linear. When the lithium (Li)-ion battery experiences an idle period, the unavailable charge can be transferred to the available charge and the battery lifetime can be extended. In this study, the authors propose a battery-friendly MAC (BFMAC) protocol based on the non-linear electrochemical properties of the Li-ion battery. A remaining charge factor (RCF) of the battery is introduced. On the basis of the RCF, a combined packets transmission scheme is designed to maximise the lifetime of the battery-powered sensor nodes.

For example, a so-called usual primal-dual neural network (PDNN) initiated by Tang et at. However, due to the complexity and diversity of duality theory, that PDNN needs to be improved so as to obtain the optimal solution(s) instead of feasible solutions. Computer-simulation results substantiate the efficacy and correctness of the improved PDNN model for online solution of LP problems.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["873"]}

In this paper, the important properties of four kinds of chaotic sequence, ie, Tent map, Logistic map, improved Logistic map, and Chebyshev map, are investigated. Simulation results show that such four kinds of chaotic sequences possess the same properties as the conventional spread spectrum sequences.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["873"]}
