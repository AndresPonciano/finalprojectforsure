{"title": "Building for social translucence: a domain analysis and prototype system\n", "abstract": " The relationships and work that facilitate content creation in large online contributor system are not always visible. Social translucence is a stance toward the design of systems that allows users to better understand collaborative system participation through awareness of contributions and interactions. Like many socio-technical constructs, social translucence is not something that can be simply added after a system is built; it should be at the core of system design. In this paper, we conduct a domain analysis to understand the space of architectural support required to facilitate social translucence in systems. We describe an instantiation of those requirements as a system architecture that relies on data from Wikipedia and illustrate how translucence can be propagated to some basic visualizations which we have created for Wikipedia users. We close with some reflections on the state of social translucence research\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "30\n", "authors": ["1201"]}

Over almost three decades, the field of human-computer interaction (HCI) has produced a rich and varied literature. Although the focus of attention today is naturally on new work, older contributions that played a role in shaping the trajectory and character of the field have much to tell us. The contributors to HCI Remixed were asked to reflect on a single work at least ten years old that influenced their approach to HCI. The result is this collection of fifty-one short, engaging, and idiosyncratic essays, reflections on a range of works in a variety of forms that chart the emergence of a new field. An article, a demo, a book: any of these can solve a problem, demonstrate the usefulness of a new method, or prompt a shift in perspective. HCI Remixed offers us glimpses of how this comes about. The contributors consider such HCI classics as Sutherland's Sketchpad, Englebart's demo of NLS, and Fitts on Fitts' Law\u2014and such forgotten gems as Pulfer's NRC Music Machine, and Galloway and Rabinowitz's Hole in Space. Others reflect on works somewhere in between classic and forgotten\u2014Kidd's \u201cThe Marks Are on the Knowledge Worker,\u201d King Beach's \u201cBecoming a Bartender,\u201d and others. Some contributors turn to works in neighboring disciplines\u2014Henry Dreyfuss's book on industrial design, for example\u2014and some range farther afield, to Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis and Jane Jacobs's The Death and Life of Great American Cities.

With the rise of large-scale social media systems, category schemes are being created by groups with differing perspectives, values, and expectations for how categories will be used. Prior studies of social tagging and folksonomy focused on the application and evolution of the collective category scheme, but struggled to uncover some of the collective rationale undergirding the decision-making processes in those schemes. In this paper, we qualitatively analyze the early discussions among editors of Wikipedia about the design and creation of its category system.

This year was the fourth year of the \"Revise and Resubmit\" (R&R) process. Over the last four years the CSCW conference community has been conducting the review process in two rounds. In the first round reviewers are encouraged to review papers with an eye to improving the intellectual strength and contributions of the paper, making it clear which changes would be helpful and which are likely required to make the paper acceptable. In the second round, the same reviewers see the same paper and review to understand whether or not the revised paper now meets the standards of the CSCW community as acceptable. This two-round review model, with encouraging and intellectual give-andtake, is designed to improve papers of good quality but in need of work that might otherwise slip just below the bar in the more common one-shot reviewing conferences. As the Papers Co-Chairs we received numerous email commenting on the high quality of the reviewing, even from some authors whose work was not accepted.  Of all the submissions, 262 were offered the opportunity to R&R, representing a little over 45% of the original submissions.

We need to better support citizens and governments in producing innovative, timely, and legitimate decisions. The emergence of online communities oriented toward the creation of useful products suggests that it may be possible to design socially mediating technology that support public-government collaborations. This is an opportunity for HCI and CSCW researchers to start to consider involvement of a wider range of stakeholders in the administration of government, and design technologies that help retool the public sphere.Consider Seattle, a city notorious for decision paralysis when it comes to taking action on critical urban planning decisions. Time and time again regional transportation projects to address what to do with an aging waterfront viaduct susceptible to collapse in the next earthquake come to a political impasse. Some want to replace it. Others want to remove it and increase surface transit options. Or build an expensive tunnel.

This analysis was conducted to generate hypotheses on possible strategies that could be used to improve the overall design of online support groups to facilitate more healthful interactions.Methods: A convenience sample of individuals using an online weight loss forum (N= 4132) included data both on online forum use and weight check-in data. All interactions were coded utilizing the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) system. Mixed model analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between these LIWC variables and weight over time.Results: Results suggested that increased use of past-tense verbs (P=. 05) and motion (P=. 02) were associated with lower weekly weights whereas increased use of conjunctions (eg, and, but, whereas; P=. 001) and exclusion words (eg, but, without, exclude; P=. 07) were both associated with higher weight during the weeks when these utterances were used more.Conclusions: These results provide some insights on the styles of interactions that appear to be associated with weight fluctuations.

This method enables us to do usability testing and elicit prompt user feedback at the early phase of design. We conclude that it is an effective approach to the design of complex medical information systems.BackgroundMany clinical trial protocols contain ambiguities, or inconsistencies. Such protocol problems can lead to inappropriate patient care or even endanger a patient\u2019s life. We are designing a collaborative clinical trial protocol authoring system to enhance communication among collaborative protocol writers and to evaluate whether communication support during the writing process can improve protocol quality.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1201"]}

{"title": "Do We All Talk Before We Type?: Understanding Collaboration in Wikipedia Language Editions\n", "abstract": " The English language Wikipedia is notable for its large number of articles and for the intricate collaborative interactions that create and sustain it. However, 288 other active language editions of Wikipedia have also developed through the coordination of contributing editors. While collaboration in the English Wikipedia has been researched extensively, these other language editions remain understudied. Our study leverages an influential collaboration model based on behaviors in the English Wikipedia as a lens to consider collaborative activity in the Spanish and French language editions. Through an analysis of collaborative interactions across article talk pages, we demonstrate that talk pages, the locus of most collaboration on the English Wikipedia, are used differently in these different language editions. Our study raises broader questions about how results from studies of the English Wikipedia generalize to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1201"]}
{"title": "System Design for Social Translucence in Socially Mediating Technologies\n", "abstract": " Socially mediating technologies (SMTs) like blogs, web forums, Slashdot and Wikipedia, have drastically changed the equation of mass social interaction online. As individuals participate and contribute content, many of their actions are visible to other participants. The work of making a contribution, supporting and maintaining the community are equally valuable to understanding what a community is about. Further, interpretation and understanding of those actions can influence the direction of public decision making (Borning et al. 2005), influence reputations (Resnick et al. 2000), notions of expertise (McDonald and Ackerman 1998) as well as other aspects of collaboration.Wikipedia is an example SMT where large numbers of online actions can be observed. The Wikimedia Foundation provides regular releases of the complete contents of Wikipedia. These releases include all article, user, discussion, and administrative pages, each with the complete revision history. These regular releases have made it possible for us to consider future system architectures that can assist users making observations and interpretations of others activities.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1201"]}
{"title": "Putting Words to Work: Integrating Conversation with Workflow Modeling\n", "abstract": " The ad-hoc nature of work practice is a challenge for developers of systems that attempt to model and support the enaction of work processes. Development in workflow modeling systems has taken a number of approaches to addressing the issue of exceptions, or deviations from the \u201cideal\u201d process. We suggest that one significant element, that of informal communication between process participants, has been largely overlooked by these efforts. Not only is social interaction a key component of work practice, it serves a particularly important role in addressing unusual situations, solving problems, and coordinating the implementation of those solutions. This paper explores the design space of integrating tools for conversation with workflow systems. 1", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1201"]}

For this reason understanding donation behavior and incentives is crucial in this context. In this work, using a dataset of aggregated donation information from Wikimedia's 2015 fund-raising campaign, representing nearly 1 million pages from English and French language versions of Wikipedia, we explore the relationship between the properties of contents of a page and the number of donations on this page. Our results suggest the existence of a reciprocity mechanism, meaning that articles that provide more utility value attract a higher rate of donation. We discuss these and other findings focusing on the impact they may have on the design of banner-based fundraising campaigns.

The impacts of the participation bias on content may be expressed through a number of different behaviors. This research considers potential content biases that may result from efforts to delete content. We collect deletion data on a sample of article pages selected based on a method designed to identify content of likely interest to a specific group of people; men and women in this case. The analysis illustrates that there does not appear to be a systematic bias resulting in more deletions or nominations for deletions against content of likely interest to women. We consider how these results improve our understanding of bias and the ways peer production systems can mitigate the potential for biases.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1201"]}

Studying the discourse in these communities can offer insights on how users benefit from using these applications. This paper presents an analysis of language and discourse patterns in forum posts by users who lose weight and keep it off versus users with fluctuating weight dynamics. In contrast to prior studies, we have access to the weekly self-reported check-in weights of users along with their forum posts. This paper also presents a study on how goal-oriented forums are different from general online forums in terms of language markers. Our results reveal dierences about how the types of posts made by users vary along with their weight-loss patterns. These insights are closely related to the power dynamics of social interactions and can enable better design ofweight-loss applications thereby contributing to a healthy society.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1201"]}

However, the relationships and work that enable content creation in an online contributor system, such as Wikipedia, are not always visible. To expose and better understand these relationships, we have built an information visualization toolkit called Re: Flex to support components of social translucence in Wikipedia, with broad applicability to other contributor systems. By mimicking the flexible, fluid architecture of a wiki within the blackboard architecture of this visualization toolkit, we demonstrate how the composable interactions inherent to contributor systems can be mirrored in the tools that support the work which creates them.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1201"]}

{"title": "Sharing your coding schemas: Developing a Platform to fit within the Qualitative Research Workflow\n", "abstract": " Qualitative coding schemas are an essential part of qualitative research used in methods like Grounded Theory. To date, there is no platform to share these coding schemas. Sharing and exchanging these coding schemas has a great potential when it comes to the traceability of qualitative research and well as the re-use of coding schemas. Based on an interview study with qualitative researchers, we propose concepts for integrating a new platform for sharing qualitative coding schemas. Based on theoretical work by Birnholtz and Bietz (2002), it became clear that an easy-to-use system can foster the acceptance and the willingness of researchers to share their coding schemas. We identified three major points to focus for this on: the governance of the platform, the development of the ontology itself and integrating the sharing of qualitative coding schemas into the workflow of researchers by enabling direct upload\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1201"]}

The high visibility and easy access to social networks makes them popular targets for vandals. Detecting and removing vandalism is critical for these user generated content systems. Because vandalism can take many forms, there are many different kinds of features that are potentially useful for detecting it. The complex nature of vandalism, and the large number of potential features, make vandalism detection difficult and time consuming for human editors. Machine learning techniques hold promise for developing accurate, tunable, and maintainable models that can be incorporated into vandalism detection tools. We describe a method for training classifiers for vandalism detection that yields classifiers that are more accurate on the PAN 2010 corpus than others previously developed.

Social computing researchers are increasingly interested in these studies that examine user behavior across different sites. For example, researchers have conducted multi-sited studies to understand user behavior across culture, language, and media. In such studies, researchers are challenged to develop and execute methodologies that allow them to navigate frameworks that enable comparisons among multiple sites. Researchers face challenges adapting their methodologies to handle diverse populations, regulations, large datasets and more.

Mobile computing holds great promise for providing effective support for helping people manage their health in everyday life. Yet, for this promise to be realized, mobile wellness systems need to be well designed, not only in terms of how they implement specific behavior-change techniques but also, among other factors, in terms of how much burden they put on the user, how well they integrate into the user's daily life, and how they address the user's privacy concerns.

{"title": "Social Computing: A Research Topic in Search of Disciplinarity\n", "abstract": " Social Computing is facing a distinct challenge, one that faces many research topics as researchers become interested and begin to explore the topic in-depth. The challenge is whether a topic is really just some kind of conceptual space or whether there are distinct principles, theories or methods that bring the topic to the level of a new discipline. There is a repeatable, reliable progression when new disciplines emerge and Social Computing has begun that progression.This paper is a brief (and biased) review of selected disciplines that might provide a home to Social Computing. In the progression from topic to discipline, understanding what established disciplines have to offer in terms of theory and methods that we can adopt and what parts of a discipline we should avoid, is critical to reflecting on what will define Social Computing as unique and possibly worthy of being promoted to the realm of discipline.
