The early papers of some of the computing pioneers, however, show an awareness of the need for proofs of program correctness and even present workable methods (eg, Goldstine and von Neumann 1947; Turing 1949).The 1949 paper by Alan M. Turing is remarkable in many respects. The three (foolscap) pages of text contain an excellent motivation by analogy, a proof of a program with two nested loops, and an indication of a general proof method very like that of Floyd.

The underlying concurrent language allows fine-grained interleaving and nested concurrency; it is defined by an operational semantics; the proof that the rely/guarantee rules are consistent with that semantics (including termination) is by a structural induction. A key lemma which relates the states which can arise from the extra interference that results from taking a portion of the program out of context makes it possible to do the proofs without having to perform induction over the computation history. This lemma also offers a way to think about expressibility issues around auxiliary variables in rely/guarantee conditions.", "num_citations": "93\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

In this paper, we give an analytical survey of authentication protocols of this type. We start with non-interactive authentication schemes, and then move on to analyse a number of strategies used to build interactive pair-wise and group protocols that minimise the human work relative to the amount of security obtained as well as optimising the computation processing. In studying these protocols, we will discover that their security is underlined by the idea of commitment before knowledge\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "89\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

{"title": "Enhancing the tractability of rely/guarantee specifications in the development of interfering operations.\n", "abstract": " Formal methods based on model-oriented specifications like VDM or B are applicable to the development of sequential operations. In such approaches, state components can be common to several operations but only one operation is executed at a time. A sequential operation can then be interpreted as a binary relation on the state space and specified with pre and post conditions; examples are given below but readers are assumed to be familiar with pre/post specifications in the style of VDM. In [12], rely and guarantee conditions are proposed as an extension to cope with the specification and development of concurrent operations, a situation that occurs when operations sharing state components have overlapping executions. The necessary background about rely/guarantee specifications is recalled in this paper\u2014detailed expositions (including sound and complete proof systems) can be found in [23]. The new insights in this paper come from an emphasis on methodological issues. Theoretical aspects of rely/guarantee specifications are intentionally omitted in favour of suggestions that improve their practicability in the development of concurrent operations. This paper is concerned with imperative programs whose meaning can be discussed with respect to a set of states\u2014say si\u20ac\u00a3. The additional complexity of concurrent versus sequential operations is due to the presence of interference: operations access state components that can be modified by the execution of other operations during their own execution.

{"title": "Semantics of object-oriented languages\n", "abstract": " Object-oriented programming is becoming an important technique in the construction of large software systems. Compelling arguments, like reduced maintenance costs, are advanced to encourage its use. To maximise the advantages of such methods, object-oriented programming languages need to be welldesigned. When selecting the main features of a programming language, or choosing between alternative designs, formal methods of semantic analysis are invaluable. To date little attention has been given to the formal description of object-oriented languages. This thesis introduces a framework for describing the semantics of object-oriented languages. To characterise the important features of object-oriented languages, an idealised object-oriented language is described and its semantics specified formally, using the denotational style of VDM. Design alternatives are explored in the same way. Several general principles of object-oriented language design are introduced, and the alternatives reviewed in light of these principles. By choosing apposite semantic domains, the fundamental concepts of object-oriented systems are exposed: two message-passing schemes, based on dynamically-bound procedure call and delegation, are presented; class-and prototype-based systems are described; and special emphasis is given to the different approaches to class-based multiple inheritance. The encapsulation of behaviour within classes is discussed, and suggestions are made as to how this might be best achieved. A variety of object-oriented control mechanisms are also surveyed. iii", "num_citations": "45\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

There is also at least one specific \u201cLogic of Partial Functions\u201d (LPF) which tackles the issue at its root by using a weaker logic. Recently, we have come to realise that LPF fits a particular way of developing programs. This paper explains why LPF is a suitable logic for \u201cposit and prove\u201d development and explores some problems that other approaches present.", "num_citations": "43\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

This paper questions that view. Clearly too weak a notation can mean that useful properties either cannot be expressed or their expression is unnatural. But choosing too powerful a notation also has its drawbacks since reasoning receives little guidance. For example, few would suggest that programming languages themselves provide tractable specifications. Both rely/guarantee methods and separation logic(s) provide useful frameworks in which it is natural to reason about aspects of concurrency.

Thus we need a long term approach to analysing the options for national infrastructure provision across a wide range of plausible futures. That, however, is a complex technical task\u2013much easier said than done. It involves understanding the drivers of demand for infrastructure services in the future and the ways in which the different infrastructure networks might cope with, and respond to that demand. The aim of the Infrastructure Transitions Research Consortium (ITRC) programme is to deliver that modelling capability for the UK. The ITRC has now developed an integrated system-of-systems model (NISMOD) that can simulate the long term performance of infrastructure networks in Great Britain. This analysis capability has been used to compare alternative long term strategies for infrastructure provision. In total we have examined 17 different options for infrastructure provision, to be implemented over the coming decades, under a wide range of scenarios of future demographic change, economic growth and climate change. This report presents interim results from that new analysis, helping to evaluate and compare alternative strategies for national infrastructure provision. For the first time this report demonstrates how long term, cross-sectoral plans for infrastructure provision at a national scale can be mapped out and analysed.

{"title": "Comparing degrees of non-determinism in expression evaluation\n", "abstract": " Expression evaluation in programming languages is normally assumed to be deterministic; however, if an expression involves variables that are being modified by the environment of the process during its evaluation, the result of the evaluation can be non-deterministic. Two common scenarios in which this occurs are concurrent programs within which processes share variables and real-time programs that interact to monitor and/or control their environment. In these contexts, although any particular evaluation of an expression gives a single result, there is a range of possible values that could be returned depending on the relative timing between modification of a variable by the environment and its access within the expression evaluation. To compare the semantics of non-deterministic expression evaluation, one can use the set of possible values the expression evaluation could return.

{"title": "Laws and semantics for rely-guarantee refinement\n", "abstract": " Interference is the essence of concurrency and it is what makes reasoning about concurrent programs difficult. The fundamental insight of rely-guarantee thinking is that stepwise design of concurrent programs can only be compositional in development methods that offer ways to record and reason about interference. In this way of thinking, a rely relation records assumptions about the behaviour of the environment, and a guarantee relation records commitments about the behaviour of the process. The standard application of these ideas is in the extension of Hoare-like inference rules to quintuples that accommodate rely and guarantee conditions. In contrast, in this paper, we embed rely-guarantee thinking into a refinement calculus for concurrent programs, in which programs are developed in (small) steps from an abstract specification. As is usual, we extend the implementation language with specification constructs (the extended language is sometimes called a wide-spectrum language), in this case adding two new commands: a guarantee command (guar gc) whose valid behaviours are in accord with the command c but all of whose atomic steps also satisfy the relation g, and a rely command (rely rc) whose behaviours are like c provided any interference steps from the environment satisfy the relation r. The theory of concurrent program refinement is based on a theory of atomic program steps and more powerful refinement laws, most notably, a law for decomposing a specification into a parallel composition, are developed from a small set of more primitive lemmas, which are proved sound with respect to an operational semantics.", "num_citations": "31\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

{"title": "Towards a formalism-based toolkit for automotive applications\n", "abstract": " The success of a number of projects has been shown to be significantly improved by the use of a formalism. However, there remains an open issue: to what extent can a development process based on a singular formal notation and method succeed. The majority of approaches demonstrate a low level of flexibility by attempting to use a single notation to express all of the different aspects encountered in software development. Often, these approaches leave a number of scalability issues open. We prefer a more eclectic approach. In our experience, the use of a formalism-based toolkit with adequate notations for each development phase is a viable solution. Following this principle, any specific notation is used only where and when it is really suitable and not necessarily over the entire software lifecycle.

Over time it became clear that {\\em post facto} verification is only practical for small programs and attention turned to verification methods which support the development of programs; for larger programs it is necessary to exploit a notation of compositionality.

Worldwide, herbivorous insects and mites cause an estimated 18\u201320% of crop yield loss per annum representing a value of more than US$470 billion [1]. In turn arthropod-vectored diseases account for more than 17% of all infectious diseases, causing more than 700 000 deaths annually [2]. The control of these damaging pests has for many years relied heavily on the use of synthetic pesticides, and the impact of chemistry-based interventions has in many cases been spectacularly successful. For example, between 2000 and 2015 the number of deaths due to malaria halved, 80% of which was attributed to the scale-up of insecticide-based vector control interventions [3]. Unfortunately, the over-reliance on chemical pesticides has led to the emergence of widespread resistance, posing a serious threat to the sustainable control of a large number of insect pests. To effectively address this growing problem, it is necessary to understand the origin, spread and maintenance of resistance, and the underpinning mechanisms involved. The Pests and Resistance section published last year (2017) explored the ecological and evolutionary drivers of pesticide resistance, and how such knowledge can be used to inform Insect Resistance Management (IRM) and Integrated Pest Management Strategies (IPM) [4]. This current section focuses on the mechanisms that underpin resistance. An important component of effective IRM/IPM is integrating knowledge on the molecular mechanisms that cause resistance into programmes that prevent, delay, or\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

When tested in tension, the composites exhibited very limited ductility, with the exception of the 409 stainless steel-reinforced composites. The higher ductility demonstrated by these composites is attributed to the high relative density of the reinforcing compact and the low amount of reaction phase formed.

Among the primary causes of readmission are infection and disease states susceptible to the inflammatory cascade, such as diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and gastrointestinal complications.  Currently, it is not known if a patient\u2019s baseline inflammatory state measured by crude white blood cell (WBC) counts could predict 30-day readmission.  We collected data from 2,176 consecutive patients who underwent cardiac surgery at seven hospitals.  Patient readmission data was abstracted from each hospital.  The independent association with preoperative WBC count was determined using logistic regression. There were 259 patients readmitted within 30 days, with a median time of readmission of 9 days (IQR 4\u201316). Patients with elevated WBC count at baseline (10,000\u201312,000 and >12,000\u2009mm3) had higher 30-day readmission than those with lower levels of WBC count prior to surgery (15% and 18% compared to 10%\u201312%,                 ).

One way of reasoning about partial functions with classical First-order Predicate Calculus (FoPC) is to use a non-strict equality notion so as to insulate logical operators from undefined operands.

Recent evidence from Iams et al. 1 suggests that the risk of preterm birth increases as cervical length shortens, making cervical competence a continuous variable.

As Romero et al. 2 reported that over half of asymptomatic women presenting with cervical dilatation in the second trimester will have positive amniotic fluid cultures, this may be a \u2018chicken and egg\u2019situation. The risk of ascending infection is probably related to both the magnitude of the cervical barrier and also the virulence of the organisms within the genital tract.

{"title": "Dimensions of dynamic coalitions\n", "abstract": " Developments in network technology are enabling organisations to form temporary alliances to achieve specific goals. Such alliances are often referred to as\" dynamic coalitions'', emphasising the fluid character of their memberships. Dynamic coalitions vary widely in architecture, scale and complexity, ranging from ad hoc groupings of organisations created in order to perform a very brief transaction to long-running collaborations between allies. In many cases, there is significant sharing of information between the participants. The term\" dynamic coalitions''is often used without definition, giving rise to potential confusion and unfulfilled expectations. This paper attempts to map out a space of dynamic coalitions, using a systematic approach supported by a formal (mathematically-based) modelling language. Seven\" dimensions''are identified and explored, with an emphasis on the flow of information through coalitions. A case study examines software being developed to support dynamic coalitions within the chemical engineering industry. The forms of dynamic coalitions that this software supports are positioned within the space defined by the seven dimensions. Anticipated future work includes the development of validation techniques that exploit the formality of the models and development of more detailed knowledge/guidance about the design of dynamic coalitions. We will also use our approach to represent the Domain Based Security approach, and show how that approach interacts with dynamic coalitions.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

{"title": "Unrestrained ESCRT-III drives chromosome fragmentation and micronuclear catastrophe\n", "abstract": " The ESCRT-III membrane fission machinery1,2 restores nuclear envelope integrity during mitotic exit3,4 and interphase5,6. Whereas primary nuclei resealing takes minutes, micronuclear envelope ruptures appear irreversible and result in catastrophic collapse associated with chromosome fragmentation and rearrangements (chromothripsis), thought to be a major driving force in cancer development7-10. Despite its importance11-13, the mechanistic underpinnings of nuclear envelope sealing in primary nuclei and the defects observed in micronuclei remain largely unknown. Here we show that CHMP7, the nucleator of ESCRT-III filaments at the nuclear envelope3,14, and the inner nuclear membrane protein LEMD215 act as a compartmentalization sensor detecting the loss of nuclear integrity. In cells with intact nuclear envelope, CHMP7 is actively excluded from the nucleus to preclude its binding to LEMD2. Nuclear influx of CHMP7 results in stable association with LEMD2 at the inner nuclear membrane that licenses local polymerization of ESCRT-III. Tight control of nuclear CHMP7 levels is critical, as induction of nuclear CHMP7 mutants is sufficient to induce unrestrained growth of ESCRT-III foci at the nuclear envelope, causing dramatic membrane deformation, local DNA torsional stress, single-stranded DNA formation and fragmentation of the underlying chromosomes. At micronuclei, membrane rupture is not associated with repair despite timely recruitment of ESCRT-III. Instead, micronuclei inherently lack the capacity to restrict accumulation of CHMP7 and LEMD2. This drives unrestrained ESCRT-III recruitment, membrane deformation and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

Thus, documentation of medication use and the implications for contemporary dental practice is of increasing importance.Methods: We recorded medication use in patients referred to a large private periodontal practice in Ottawa, Ontario. Patients self reported medication use and medication allergies in their health history forms on admission.Results: Of 322 sequential patients enrolled, 164 were female and the overall median age was 52 (range 6\u201394 years). Participants reported taking 249 unique medications in 28 categories. Twothirds of patients (63.7%) were taking prescription or overthe counter (OTC) medications or both. The average number of medications per patient was 1.9 (range 0\u201314). The average number of OTC medications per patient was 0.5 for those not taking prescription medications and 0.4 for patients taking prescription medications concurrently. The number of OTC products per patient was 0\u20137.Conclusions: Given the prevalence of the use of both prescription and OTC products, accurate recording of the medication profile is necessary in contemporary dental practice. Medication use and medication allergies provide information on patients' medical history and diagnoses that may have implications for their oral condition and delivery of dental care. Additional concerns include potential interactions between frequently used medications reported by patients and medications that are commonly used in dentistry.Clinical\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

Our lab has discovered RAGE-mediated effects in the orchestration of lung inflammation induced by tobacco smoke and environmental pollutants; however, the specific contribution of RAGE to the progression of proximal airway inflammation is still inadequately characterized. We generated a Tet-inducible transgenic mouse that conditionally overexpressed RAGE using the club cell (Clara) secretory protein (CCSP) promoter expressed by club (Clara) cells localized to the proximal airway. RAGE was induced for 40 days from weaning (20 days of age) until sacrifice date at 60 days. Immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting, and qPCR revealed significant RAGE up-regulation when compared to non-transgenic controls; however, H&E staining revealed no detectible morphological abnormalities and apoptosis was not enhanced during the 40 days of augmentation. Freshly procured bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from CCSP-RAGE TG mice had significantly more total leukocytes and PMNs compared to age-matched control littermates. Furthermore, CCSP-RAGE TG mice expressed significantly more tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin 7 (IL-7), and interleukin 14 (IL-14) in whole lung homogenates compared to controls. These data support the concept that RAGE up-regulation specifically in lung airways may function in the progression of proximal airway inflammation.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1582"]}
{"title": "Refining rely-guarantee thinking\n", "abstract": " Reasoning about concurrent programs can be very difficult due to the possibility of interference. The fundamental insight of Rely-Guarantee thinking is that developing concurrent designs can only be made compositional if the development method offers ways to record and reason about the interference that is inherent in concurrency. The original presentation of rely-guarantee rules used keywords to mark the various predicates and even the read/write frames of operations. Subsequent papers have moved to a more general message of \u201crely-guarantee thinking\u201d but retained this VDM flavour and have typically presented a development style in terms of inference rules based on Hoare-like triples, extended to quintuples to accommodate rely and guarantee conditions. Morgan\u2019s refinement calculus presents concise rules that lend themselves to algebraic arguments. This paper reports on a complete reformulation of the key ideas of rely-guarantee reasoning in a refinement calculus style. As is shown, this indicates new useful and intuitive manipulations of rely/guarantee specifications. The approach makes use of two new commands: a guarantee command (guar g _ c) that behaves like the command c but also guarantees every atomic step satisfies the relation g, and a rely command (rely r _ c) that behaves like c provided any interference steps from the environment satisfy the relation r or stutter. Further notational developments result from the use of a more compact notation to indicate the read/write frame of a command. The new rules are justified with respect to an operational semantics presented in the Colvin style.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

In order to assess the effects of persistent tight junctions involving Cldn6 during lung development, a doxycycline (dox)-inducible conditional transgenic mouse was generated that up-regulates Cldn6 in the distal lung. Pups had unlimited access to dox from conception until sacrifice date at embryonic day (E) 18.5. Quantitative PCR, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry revealed significantly elevated Cldn6 expression in transgenic mice compared to non-transgenic controls. There were no differences in terms of lung size, lung weight, or whole body weight at the time of necropsy. Histological evaluations led to the discovery that E18. 5 Cldn6 transgenic pups appeared to be in the early canalicular stage of development coincident with fewer, thickened respiratory airspaces. In contrast, controls appeared to have entered the saccular stage characterized by thin airspace walls and spherical architecture. Immunostaining for transcriptional regulators including TTF-1 and FoxA2 was conducted to assess cell differentiation and specific cell types were identified via staining for pro-surfactant protein C (alveolar type II epithelial cells) or Clara Cell Secretory Protein (cub or Clara cells). Lastly, cell turnover was qualitatively measured via staining for cell proliferation or apoptosis. These data suggest that Cldn6 is an important junctional protein potentially involved in the programming of epithelial cells during lung development.

Most disease in developed countries is caused by serogroup B infection, against which there is no universal vaccine. Opacity-associated adhesin (Opa) proteins are major meningococcal outer membrane proteins, which have shown recent promise as a potential novel vaccine. Immunisation of mice with different Opa variants elicited high levels of meningococcal-specific bactericidal antibodies, demonstrating proof in principle for this approach. Opa proteins are critical in meningococcal pathogenesis, mediating bacterial adherence to host cells, and modulating human cellular immunity via interactions with T cells and neutrophils, although there are conflicting data regarding their effects on CD4+ T cells. We constructed Opa-positive and Opa-negative meningococcal strains to allow further evaluation of Opa as a vaccine component. All four opa genes from N. meningitidis strain H44/76 were sequentially disrupted to construct all possible combinations of N. meningitidis strains deficient in one, two, three, or all four opa genes. The transformations demonstrated that homologous recombination of exogenous DNA into the meningococcal chromosome can occur with as little as 80 bp, and that minor sequence differences are permissible. Anti-Opa bactericidal antibody responses following immunisation of mice with recombinant Opa were specific to the Opa variant used in immunisation. No immunomodulatory effects were observed when Opa was contained within meningococcal outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), compared to Opa-negative OMVs\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

This report presents the pre-and postirradiation evaluation conducted by GA. The purpose of the test was to characterize the mechanical and chemical performance and fission product release of TRISO ThO/sub 2/particles. Sixteen TRISO ThO/sub 2/samples, which had been fabricated in the production-line (240-mm-ID) coater, were irradiated at approximately 1200 and 1450/sup 0/C to neutron fluences of 5.1 to 10.2 x 10/sup 25/n/m/sup 2/(E> 29 fJ)/sub HTGR/, and burnups of 5.1 to 12.7% FIMA. Following are the results of the postirradiation examination: the OPyC coating failure of the 800-.. mu.. m-diameter particles irradiated at 1200/sup 0/C was less than or equal to 1.8%; the pressure-vessel model overpredicted failure up to seven times the observed failure for the samples irradiated at 1200/sup 0/C; palladium attack and internal corrosion of the SiC coating was observed in the samples irradiated at 1200/sup 0/C; internal corrosion of the SiC coating caused SiC failure up to 100% in the samples irradiated at 1450/sup 0/C; and an average of 16 and 90% of the Cs was released from failed particles irradiated at 1200 and 1450/sup 0/C, respectively, more\u00bb", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

{"title": "Plastic potential: how the phenotypes and adaptations of pathogens are influenced by microbial interactions within plants\n", "abstract": " Predicting the effects of plant-associated microbes on emergence, spread, and evolution of plant pathogens demands an understanding of how pathogens respond to these microbes at two levels of biological organization: that of an individual pathogen and that of a pathogen population across multiple individual plants. We first examine the plastic responses of individual plant pathogens to microbes within a shared host, as seen through changes in pathogen growth and multiplication. We then explore the limited understanding of how within-plant microbial interactions affect pathogen populations and discuss the need to incorporate population-level observations with population genomic techniques. Finally, we suggest that integrating across levels will further our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary impacts of within-plant microbial interactions on pathogens.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

{"title": "Bistable nematic liquid crystal displays\n", "abstract": " A wide variety of different bistable liquid crystal devices have been suggested from the outset of LCD research. In the early years, this was motivated by the need to produce complex images with a high degree of electrical multiplexing. Today, with the advent of low\u2010cost TFT panels that meet all addressing requirements, interest in bistable LCD is still strong, motivated by the promise of low\u2010cost complex displays with negligible power consumption. Despite this variety, there are a number of common factors that need to be considered for practical devices. Following an exhaustive review of these factors, many of the options for bistable nematic displays are described in detail. This includes modes in which the bistability occurs in the bulk of the LCD, such as the bistable twisted nematics (BTN and Binem) and splay\u2013bend modes, and surface bistable modes, such as ZBD.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1582"]}
{"title": "Object Orientation with Parallelism and Persistence\n", "abstract": " Both object orientation and parallelism are modern programming paradigms which have gained much popularity in the last 10-15 years. Object orientation raises hopes for increased productivity of software generation and maintenance methods. Parallelism can serve to structure a problem but also promises faster program execution. The two areas of computing science in which these paradigms play the most prominent role are programming languages and databases. In programming languages, one can take an academic approach with a primary focus on the generality of the semantics of the language constructs which support the respective paradigm. In databases, one is willing to restrict the power of the constructs in the interest of increased efficiency. Inter-and intra-object parallelism have received an increasing amount of attention in the last few years by researchers in the area of object-oriented programming. At first glance, an object is very similar to a process which offers services to other processes and demands services from them. It has, however, transpired that object-oriented concepts cause problems when combined with parallelism. In programming languages, the introduction of parallelism and the synchronization constraints it brings with it can get in the way of code reusability. In databases, the combination of object orientation and parallelism requires, for example, a generalization of the transaction model, new approaches to the specification of information systems, an implementation model of object communication, and the design of an overall system architecture. There has been insufficient communication between researchers\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

{"title": "Reasoning about programs via operational semantics: requirements for a support system\n", "abstract": " Reasoning about programs using \u201caxioms\u201d is well established; in this paper we argue that reasoning about a program directly in terms of Structural Operational Semantic (SOS) language descriptions is a viable addition and that this is anyway necessary for the vast majority of languages where there is nothing like a full axiomatic description. Using an SOS description is likely to require detailed proofs whose acceptability to users will depend on suitable support systems. The paper presents a very simple example to illustrate how we can reason about (in fact, develop) a program to prove that it satisfies a specification. The main contribution is to use this trivial example to point out issues in designing an interactive proof system for constructing such proofs.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1582"]}
{"title": "Bridge distress caused by approach embankment settlement\n", "abstract": " Surtees Bridge, which carries the A66(T) over the River Tees near Thornaby-on-Tees in the UK, has been showing signs of distress that predate its opening in 1981. Subsequent investigations have shown that the bridge distress is related to unexpectedly large settlement of the eastern approach embankment. Recent ground investigations prompted by a proposed widening of the river crossing have produced many new data on the alluvial deposits underlying the site, and explain why embankment settlement was so much larger than originally anticipated. Comparison of the geotechnical parameters obtained from the original and more recent ground investigations suggests that the original investigation significantly underestimated the thickness of an alluvial clay layer underlying the site, and that its coefficient of consolidation was overestimated.

There are a vast number of applications for a vehicle able to track a moving target and especially if the vehicle can then land on the target in question whilst it remains in motion. Landing on moving platforms is not a novel concept, as demonstrated by the fact that aircraft carriers have had aircraft landing on them for decades; piloted aircraft can land on moving vessels with relative ease thanks to advances in technology. The question does however arise as at to what happens when the pilot is removed from the system and autonomous landings are required instead. Solutions to such problems do exist, as demonstrated by the X-45A, but to date little work has been completed on the use of visual control in autonomous landings.

{"title": "Five-minute unit hydrographs for selected Texas watersheds\n", "abstract": " In this thesis, three unit hydrograph methods for the estimation of watershed runoff were compared. The three methods were the traditional unit hydrograph approach, the NRCS unit hydrograph approach, and the Clark unit hydrograph approach. The hypothesis of this research is that results from the traditional method closely compare to those generated using the NRCS and Clark methods. Fifteen Texas watersheds were selected for intensive analysis. The traditional unit hydrograph approach was applied to 129 storm events; however this number was reduced to 51 storm events for application of the Clark and NRCS unit hydrograph approaches. Five-minute average unit hydrographs for each watershed were generated using the three methods. Regression analysis was applied to determine that the most important watershed characteristic for prediction of unit hydrograph peak discharge and time to peak was watershed area.     The 5-minute average unit hydrograph from each method for each watershed was compared to determine differences and similarities between the applied methods. Based on these comparisons, traditional unit hydrographs differed substantially from both the NRCS and the Clark unit hydrographs fitted to observed direct runoff hydrographs, contrary to initial thoughts.     An average dimensionless unit hydrograph appropriate for selected Texas watersheds was developed from the unit hydrographs computed using the traditional method. From the average dimensionless unit hydrograph, an average S-hydrograph was developed and applied to storm events used for optimization of NRCS and Clark unit hydrograph\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

{"title": "Virus expression detection reveals RNA-sequencing contamination in TCGA\n", "abstract": " Contamination of reagents and cross contamination across samples is a long-recognized issue in molecular biology laboratories. While often innocuous, contamination can lead to inaccurate results. Cantalupo et al., for example, found HeLa-derived human papillomavirus 18 (H-HPV18) in several of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNA-sequencing samples. This work motivated us to assess a greater number of samples and determine the origin of possible contaminations using viral sequences. To detect viruses with high specificity, we developed the publicly available workflow, VirDetect, that detects virus and laboratory vector sequences in RNA-seq samples. We applied VirDetect to 9143 RNA-seq samples sequenced at one TCGA sequencing center (28/33 cancer types) over 5\u2009years. We confirmed that H-HPV18 was present in many samples and determined that viral transcripts from H-HPV18 significantly co-occurred with those from xenotropic mouse leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV). Using laboratory metadata and viral transcription, we determined that the likely contaminant was a pool of cell lines known as the \u201ccommon reference\u201d, which was sequenced alongside TCGA RNA-seq samples as a control to monitor quality across technology transitions (i.e. microarray to GAII to HiSeq), and to link RNA-seq to previous generation microarrays that standardly used the \u201ccommon reference\u201d. One of the cell lines in the pool was a laboratory isolate of MCF-7, which we discovered was infected with XMRV; another constituent of the pool was likely HeLa cells.

{"title": "Abstraction as a unifying link for formal approaches to concurrency\n", "abstract": " Abstraction is a crucial tool in specifying and justifying developments of systems. This observation is recognised in many different methods for developing sequential software; it also applies to some approaches to the formal development of concurrent systems although there its use is perhaps less uniform.

In contrast, separation logics were \u2013at least initially\u2013 motivated by reasoning about details of extant code. Such approaches can be thought of as \u201cbottom up\u201d.

{"title": "A formal basis for some dependability notions\n", "abstract": " This paper shows how formal methods ideas can be used to clarify basic notions used in the field of dependability. Central to this endeavour is fixing a notion of system. Relationships between systems are also considered: in particular, the importance of the situation where one system is generated by another (possibly human) system is explored. The formalisation is used as a basis for definitions of the notions of fault, error and failure. Some applications to examples from the dependability literature and extensions of the basic model of system are also sketched.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

Since the 1940s it has attracted large numbers of tourists, mostly families who want to catch and eat perch while they relax for a week or two. A substantial summer resort industry developed, based primarily on cottage and boat rentals.These resorts are the economic backbone of the Cedarville-Hessel area. In recent years there have been many complaints about declines in perch fishing, tourism, and the economic health of this area. Many resort owners believe that large perch are becoming rare and that, as a result, perch fishermen are taking their business elsewhere. They attribute this change in the perch population to a variety of reasons: harvesting with gill nets by native Americans, competition for perch between winter resident anglers and summer tourist anglers, general overfishing\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

{"title": "The effects of soil phosphorous content on microbiota are driven by the plant phosphate starvation response\n", "abstract": " Phosphate starvation response (PSR) in non-mycorrhizal plants comprises transcriptional reprogramming resulting in severe physiological changes to the roots and shoots and repression of plant immunity. Thus, plant-colonizing microorganisms \u2013 the plant microbiota \u2013 are exposed to direct influence by the soil\u2019s phosphorous (P) content itself, as well as to the indirect effects of soil P on the microbial niches shaped by the plant. The individual contribution of these factors to plant microbiota assembly remains unknown. To disentangle these direct and indirect effects, we planted PSR-deficient Arabidopsis mutants in a long-term managed soil P gradient, and compared the composition of their shoot and root microbiota to wild type plants across different P concentrations. PSR-deficiency had a larger effect on the composition of both bacterial and fungal plant-associated microbiota composition than P concentrations in both roots and shoots. The fungal microbiota was more sensitive to P concentrations per se than bacteria, and less depended on the soil community composition.Using a 185-member bacterial synthetic community (SynCom) across a wide P concentration gradient in an agar matrix, we demonstrated a shift in the effect of bacteria on the plant from a neutral or positive interaction to a negative one, as measured by rosette size. This phenotypic shift is accompanied by changes in microbiota composition: the genus Burkholderia is specifically enriched in plant tissue under P starvation. Through a community drop-out experiment, we demonstrate that in the absence of Burkholderia from the SynCom, plant shoots accumulate higher phosphate\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

Build-up of fibrous tissue occurs through the cross-linking of collagen or elastin monomers, which is initiated through the oxidation of lysine residues to form \u03b1-aminoadipic-\u03b4-semialdehyde (allysine). To provide a measure of the extent of collagen oxidation in disease models of fibrosis or metastasis, a rapid, sensitive HPLC method was developed to quantify the amount of allysine present in tissue. Allysine was reacted with sodium 2-naphthol-7-sulfonate under conditions typically applied for acid hydrolysis of tissues (6\u00a0M HCl, 110\u00a0\u00b0C, 24\u00a0h) to prepare AL-NP, a fluorescent bis-naphthol derivative of allysine.

We have used explant culture on collagen I gel to examine factors that influence the de novo development of anchoring sites and have compared the ultrastructure of cells in this system with those from anchoring villi in vivo. Anchoring villi in vivo show thickening of the basement membrane overlying the attachment area and here the cytotrophoblast breaks through the syncytium to form a column of cells. Cells in the columns develop arrays of intermediate filaments and show dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum. Extracellular fibrinoid matrix material is also found.

{"title": "Plasmid DNA vaccine co-immunisation modulates cellular and humoral immune responses induced by intranasal inoculation in mice\n", "abstract": " Background An effective HIV vaccine will likely require induction of both mucosal and systemic cellular and humoral immune responses. We investigated whether intramuscular (IM) delivery of electroporated plasmid DNA vaccine and simultaneous protein vaccinations by intranasal (IN) and IM routes could be combined to induce mucosal and systemic cellular and humoral immune responses to a model HIV-1 CN54 gp140 antigen in mice.   Results Co-immunisation of DNA with intranasal protein successfully elicited both serum and vaginal IgG and IgA responses, whereas DNA and IM protein co-delivery did not induce systemic or mucosal IgA responses. Cellular IFN\u03b3 responses were preserved in co-immunisation protocols compared to protein-only vaccination groups. The addition of DNA to IN protein vaccination reduced the strong Th2 bias observed with IN protein vaccination alone. Luminex analysis also revealed that co-immunisation with DNA and IN protein induced expression of cytokines that promote B-cell function, generation of TFH cells and CCR5 ligands that can reduce HIV infectivity.   Significance These data suggest that while IN inoculation alone elicits both cellular and humoral responses, co-administration with homologous DNA vaccination can tailor these towards a more balanced Th1/Th2 phenotype modulating the cellular cytokine profile while eliciting high-levels of antigen-specific antibody. This work provides insights on how to generate differential immune responses within the same vaccination visit, and supports co-immunisation with DNA and protein by a mucosal route as a potential delivery strategy for HIV vaccines.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

{"title": "Dynamic gain scheduled control of a Hawk scale model\n", "abstract": " When designing flight control laws using linearisations of an aircraft model about different flight conditions, some form of scheduling of the resultant gains will often be required to implement the controller over wide operating regions. In practice, the controller gains are often scheduled against relatively slowly-varying system states such as altitude or velocity. However, it may also be desirable to schedule gains against rapidly-varying states such as angle-of-attack, thereby generating a cyclic dependence through hidden coupling terms. Previous published work at Bristol has developed a numerical method of accounting for this dependence when scheduling state feedback gains against coupled states. The resulting \u2018dynamic gain schedule\u2019 is shown to significantly improve the transient response of the aircraft model during rapid manoeuvring and to reduce the chances of control surface actuator position limit\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

The phenotypic diversity for a range of root morphological traits among 500 mapping family (F1) progeny was characterised using plants grown hydroponically. The root traits measured were: dry weight, length, surface area, diameter, volume, numbers of root tips and root forks. Variance component analysis indicated significant (P< 0.005) genotypic variance among the 500 progeny for all the root traits measured. For most root traits the differences between the minimum and maximum values also indicated a large range of phenotypic variation among the 500 progeny. Pattern analysis helped identify progeny groups as well as providing a graphical representation of the association among the root traits. One of the progeny groups contained members with root trait morphology indicating the potential to enhance soil penetration per unit volume of soil, which could result in improved soil P uptake. The genotype-by-root trait matrix of individual progeny means generated from this study will be used for preliminary QTL analysis.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

There are three major approaches into which most formal methods can be divided. That which fits the normal development route most closely is to fix a specification notation but to record design by bringing in features of the implementation language. Such design steps give rise to 'proof obligations' which are sentences in a logical language; their discharge justifies the design. An alternative approach is to make the initial description a very clear, but probably hopelessly inefficient algorithm. This is transformed in a series of steps to a workable program. Each transformation step is an instance of one of a number of general rules. A few of these are universal; most have applicability conditions which again result in proof obligations.

A set of interviews reveals three main perceptions affecting senior environmental decision makers\u2019 trust in ecological computer models as decision facilitation tools: an ecological computer model is perceived as (i) a \u2018black box\u2019,(ii) processing poorly documented, sparse and out-of-date input data, and (iii) whose sensitivity to model parameters enables manipulation to produce desired outcomes justifying pre-conceived decisions. This leads to lack of trust towards both ecological computer models and model-users, including other scientists and decision makers. Model acceptance appears to depend on the amount, currency and geographical origin of input data. This is at odds with modellers\u2019 communication style, which typically places more emphasis on highlighting the ecological computer model\u2019s features and performance, rather than on describing the input data.

Standard protocols for islet isolation, developed primarily for human islet transplantation, include beating-heart organ donation, vascular perfusion of preservation solutions, specialized equipment. Unfortunately, these processes are prohibitively complex and expensive for veterinary use. The aim of the study was to develop a simplified approach for isolating canine islets that is compatible with the financial and logistical restrictions inherent to veterinary medicine for the purpose of translating islet transplantation to a clinical treatment for canine diabetes. Here, we describe simplified strategies for isolating quality islets from deceased canine donors without vascular preservation and with up to 90\u00a0min of cold ischemia time.

We estimated annual direct losses from these landslides ranged from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars for typical winter storm years in Oregon, and up to tens of millions to $75 million in severe storm years, such as 1996. A major part of this study was developing the lidarbased landslide inventory and shallow-and deep-landslide susceptibility maps. We mapped 2,885 existing landslides, which cover roughly 7% of the study area. Many of these are prehistoric or ancient landslides (that is, older than 150 years); however, these landslides should be considered just barely stable and in most cases would require only a small change in stability to reactivate.

{"title": "Reasoning about concurrent programs: Refining rely-guarantee thinking\n", "abstract": " Interference is the essence of concurrency and it is what makes reasoning about concurrent programs difficult. The fundamental insight of rely-guarantee thinking is that stepwise design of concurrent programs can only be compositional in development methods that offer ways to record and reason about interference. In this way of thinking, a rely relation records assumptions about the behaviour of the environment, and a guarantee relation records commitments about the behaviour of the process. The standard application of these ideas is in the extension of Hoare-like inference rules to quintuples that accommodate rely and guarantee conditions. In contrast, in this paper, we embed rely-guarantee thinking into a refinement calculus for concurrent programs, in which programs are developed in (small) steps from an abstract specification. As is usual, we extend the implementation language with specification constructs (the extended language is sometimes called a wide-spectrum language), in this case adding (in addition to pre and postconditions) two new commands: a guarantee command guar (g)(c) whose valid behaviours are in accord with the command c but all of whose atomic steps also satisfy the relation g, and a rely command rely (r)(c) whose behaviours are like c provided any interference steps from the environment satisfy the relation r. The theory of concurrent program refinement is based on a theory of atomic program steps and more powerful refinement laws, most notably, a law for decomposing a specification into a parallel composition, are developed from a small set of more primitive lemmas, which are proved sound with respect to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

Water audits are becoming part of the standard operation of water utilities, and the volumes of treated water escaping from pipelines are coming under increased scrutiny. Most urban utilities now have leak detection programs to reduce leakage from their small diameter distribution mains. Until recently, however, the large diameter transmission mains have been largely overlooked, due to a lack of concrete data on how much water loss originates in these pipelines, and a lack of effective technologies for locating all leaks on such lines. New technologies engineered specifically for leak detection in large diameter water mains have now emerged on the market, and empirical data is available on actual leakage rates from large diameter mains in\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

{"title": "Pastoral Genomics-a foray into the clover genome\n", "abstract": " Pastoral Genomics is engaged in applying molecular mapping and functional genomics to characterise and manipulate key phenotypic traits associated with improved productivity in the commercially important forage crop white clover (Trifolium repens L.). We report on the development of a framework linkage map for white clover and the application of this map to the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with vegetative and seed yield traits. Homologues of genes responsible for the traits of interest have been identified and cloned in order to identify'perfect markers' for marker assisted breeding and to develop a cisgenic\u00c2\u00ae clover cultivar. We introduce western clover (T. occidentale), a diploid perennial clover species closely related to white clover, as a stoloniferous clover model to dissect low heritability traits initially intractable in white clover. We have identified extensive genetic variation in this species, which previously has been reported to be remarkably uniform. We have developed a framework map for T. occidentale and demonstrated conservation of marker order and spacing with white clover. An ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) mutant population has been used to isolate three distinct groups of condensed tannin (CT) mutants. We have also investigated our model's transformation potential, achieving frequencies 2-3 fold higher than for white clover and suggest that this model is potentially useful for genomic analysis of white clover and other clonal species", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

In response to those questions, my aim is to explore the Melanesian concept of mana and how in the interaction between a received Christianity and existing Melanesian worldviews, a theology of mana has developed. This is reliant as much on versions of European Christianity as Melanesian worldviews and exists in tension with concepts of powerlessness and vulnerability.My research crucially revolves around how my experience of the murders involves an interaction between theological contexts and identities and produces theological reflection out of a synthesis between them. This experience has an intensity that shapes and informs the theological reflection that develops which is neither purely \u201cBritish/European\u201d nor purely \u201cMelanesian\u201d. Rather it exists at that intersection between them which makes connections and allows a conversation. The aim is to make connections between Melanesian theologies of power and European theologies of power and to allow contextual theology to develop from a conversation between concepts of relational power in European theological traditions and existing concepts of relational power in Melanesia. The theology of relational power that develops from such a theological synthesis can then address the theological tension in the Melanesian Brotherhood, Melanesian theology and beyond.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

In this paper, an analysis/design framework based on bifurcation analysis is used, in which control law design and now control allocation can be integrated.

An upgraded version of the MiniSIMS based on a time-of-flight (ToF) mass spectrometer has now been developed.

The instrument has the usual ToF attributes of parallel mass detection, extended mass range and higher mass resolution, but also features a high duty cycle. The result is very fast data acquisition, especially in imaging mode. Moreover, in depth profiling, a continuous beam allows all sputtered material to contribute to the analysis by eliminating the requirement for cycling between etching and analysis modes.

Although mechanically checked proofs are not envisaged, the use of formal notation is recommended so that the basis for correctness arguments exists.             The paper reviews three topics: the first two are relevant particularly to the development of compilers: the third is more general. The subject of the first section is the style of language definition to be used as a basis for development. Beginning with a small language, possible ways of describing added features are discussed.             The selection criterion for definition techniques is their usability in developing a specification of the compiling process: it is this development which is the subject of the second section.

The 32 participants came from 10 countries: Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Norway. The aim of the seminar was to bring together researchers and tool developers from different state-and machine-based formal methods communities in order to share expertise and promote the joint use of modelling tool technologies. Indeed, each of these communities--from Abstract State Machines, to B, TLA, VDM, Z--has valuable tools and technologies which would be beneficial also for the other formal approaches. Understanding and clarifying their commonalities and differences is a key factor to achieve a possible integration or integrated use of these related approaches for accomplishing, in a rigorous way, the various modelling and analysis tasks to construct reliable high quality software systems. The working group formula offered by the Dagstuhl seminar was a fruitful way to share knowledge of the various techniques and tools--such as simulators, animators, model checkers, theorem proves--developed for the individual methods, and to constructively experiment the combined use of different approaches by means of a series of well known case studies. Participants did not arrive with well-prepared solutions, but all the modelling and integration work was directly done in Dagstuhl in a very exciting and competitive atmosphere.

{"title": "Neuroeducational research in the design and use of games-based teaching\n", "abstract": " Research has shown that a games-based approach to learning can have many positive effects in the classroom, although less attention has been paid to the potential of applying a games-based approach to teaching. Meanwhile, recent research into the brain\u2019s reward system has provided fresh understanding about the educational potential of games and associated underlying cognitive and neural processes. However, the harnessing of neuroscientific understanding for educational benefit presents many challenges, not least because it potentially impacts on pedagogical theory as well as technological design, with outcomes in the classroom likely to depend on a successful interaction of both. The effective design and implementation of games-based teaching might thus require a judicious interrelation of insights from diverse theoretical perspectives, such as neuroscientific, pedagogical and classroom praxis. Here we report on the design-based research of a web app, known as zondle Team Play (zTP), that allows teachers to use a games-based approach to teaching whole-classes and which draws on learning theory, the practicalities of classrooms, and concepts from neuroscience. zTP was developed iteratively with teachers, in five cycles of design, intervention, analysis and reflection. Rather than just exploring \u2018what works\u2019 in terms of the technology, iterative prototyping helped us explore aspects of classroom praxis and affordances of the technological design that were contingent upon each other.

{"title": "Ours Is to Reason Why\n", "abstract": " It is now widely understood how to write formal specifications so as to be able to justify designs (and thus implementations) against such specifications. In many formal approaches, a \u201cposit and prove\u201d approach allows a designer to record an engineering design decision from which a collection of \u201cproof obligations\u201d are generated; their discharge justifies the design step. Modern theorem proving tools greatly simplify the discharge of such proof obligations. In typical industrial applications, however, there remain sufficiently many proof obligations that require manual intervention that an engineer finds them a hurdle to the deployment of formal proofs. This problem is exacerbated by the need to repeat proofs when changes are made to specifications or designs. This paper outlines how a key additional resource can be brought to bear on the discharge of proof obligations: the central idea is to \u201clearn\u201d new ways of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

This review characterizes the observed arthralgia and describes its variable definitions in key clinical trials; its typical onset and duration; symptom management strategies; and symptom resolution. The symptomatic manifestations of AI-associated arthralgia are highly variable, with typical onset occurring 2-6 months after treatment initiation. Aromatase inhibitor-associated arthralgia is most often bilateral and symmetrical, involving hands and wrists. Other common locations include knees, hips, lower back, shoulders, and feet. To improve standardization of care as well as patient quality of life, we propose a diagnostic algorithm for the management of patients who receive AIs and who develop arthralgia or worsening symptoms from preexisting joint pain. We conclude that although arthralgia is often associated with AI therapy, prompt diagnosis and management of musculoskeletal symptoms may ensure continued AI treatment and improve quality of life.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

However, no information is provided as to their biological activity. In contrast, the World Health Organization (WHO) provides the 2nd International Standards (IS) for IFN alfa-2a (code 95/650) and for IFN alfa-2b (code 95/566), with activity defined in International Units (IU) for calibration of biological activity of preparations of IFN. We have compared the EDQM CRSs with the WHO ISs in two bioassay systems, one measuring the anti-proliferative activity in the Daudi cell line and the other measuring a reporter gene activation in an A549 cell line. In each of these assay systems, the CRSs gave dose-response relations, which were similar to those for the WHO ISs. Estimates of relative activity for each CRS, in terms of the respective IS, showed specific biological activity for the CRSs of the same order as the nominal specific activity for the ISs. However, the estimates of relative activity were not consistent between the two assays systems, emphasizing the need for calibration within each system, if the CRS were to be used as a working standard for bioassays. For structure-activity studies, both physicochemical and biological activity characterisation are required for the same biopharmaceutical preparation.

Our process combines both mineralization of reactive components (such cellulose, rubber, and oil) and surface decontamination of less reactive materials such as polyethylene, polystyrene and polyvinylchloride. By using this combination of SILVER II and ultrasonic mixing, we have achieved 100% current efficiency for the destruction of the reactive components. We have demonstrated that: The degree of decontamination achieved would be adequate to meet both WIPP waste acceptance criteria and TRUPACT II packaging and shipping requirements; The system more\u00bb", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

Seventy-two clones were mapped to chromosomal subregions by use of somatic cell hybrids. The clones detect 44 different CpG islands, and we have isolated cosmid contigs for 36 of them. Extrapolation from the known 11p13 NotI restriction map suggests that every second CpG island from 11p containing a Not site is already represented in the clone collection. By sequence analysis all of the 11p13 clones exhibit typical features of CpG islands, and cross-species hybridization has been detected with at least one fragment in most cases. The cosmids serve as valuable linking clones for long-range restriction mapping. They also provide excellent starting material for transcript isolation procedures to identify genes on chromosome 11p associated with developmental anomalies and various tumor types.

The clinical manifestations and the physical fndings are of such a nature that they make the recognition of the disease relatively easy, but with mediastinal abscess, the findings are somewhat obscure. Since the introduction of the x-ray in the study of the soft structures of the neck and chest, the diagnosis of retropharyngeal and mediastinal abscess has been within the reach of everyone who makes use of it.

{"title": "Digital communications and information systems\n", "abstract": " \u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2016. Introduction: Digital communications and information systems infrastructure is comprised of a variety of communication and computation systems which provide the transmission, processing and storage of digital information. This includes:(i) legacy and fibre-optic cable networks;(ii) mobile, satellite and wireless networks; and (iii) data storage and processing centres. The acronym ICT is often used to describe these systems, though in other contexts ICT can refer to a much broader class of information and communications technologies. Here we use the shorthand ICT to refer to digital communications and information infrastructure systems. In comparison to other physical infrastructure sectors, ICT is relatively new and very rapidly evolving, so is less completely understood from a system-of-systems perspective. ICT infrastructure has become increasingly embedded in nearly all economic and social activities, including for operation of other infrastructure networks. Because of the complexity and rapid innovation in ICT systems, their future is highly uncertain and analysing the systems\u2019 prospective direction is challenging. Yet, issues surrounding digital connectivity are high on the global policy agenda. In many advanced economies in Europe, North America and beyond, significant increases in ICT capacity have been delivered by inducing competition within industry combined with a light-touch, market-led regulatory approach. Innovation has provided new technologies and has helped serve growing consumer demand, which is itself largely driven by innovations in consumer technologies and business practices\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

{"title": "Climate change, agriculture and the environment: some economic issues\n", "abstract": " Potential global climate change arising from increases in atmospheric C02 and other trace gas concentrations is an environmental issue of growing concern. While there is controversy about the timing and magnitude of climate change, forecasts from general circulation models (GCMs) of the earth's atmosphere suggest that the earth's climate will warm substantially (1.0 to 4.5 C) over the next century (Hansen, 1986; Houghton, Jenkins and Epraums, 1990). These increases in global mean temperature are expected to be accompanied by substantial changes in regional and seasonal temperature and precipitation (National Research Council, 1982; Manabe and Weatherald, 1987). Climate change can affect virtually all ecosystems and ecosystem service flows (Wigley, Ingram and Farmer, 1981; Lough, Wigley and Palutikof, 1983). One ecosystem that is sensitive to climatic variability and of particular importance to human welfare is agriculture. The human consequences of crop failure arising from short-term climatic variation are apparent, as exemplified by recurring famine in the Sahel region of Africa caused by prolonged drought. The flora and fauna of natural or unmanaged ecosystems, including forests, estuaries, lakes and streams, are also likely to be affected by climate changes of the magnitude forecast by some of the GCMs. Changes in forest productivity, a rise in sea levels (due to partial melting of the polar ice caps) and alterations in hydrological balances induced by climate change could affect human welfare.Implications for human welfare of alterations in ecosystem flows have been drawn largely by natural/physical scientists and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

{"title": "Specification as a design base\n", "abstract": " The arguments for a more systematic approach to the development of computer systems are well known (see, for example, Floyd/81/). In Jones/81a/, it is argued that a more formal approach to both specifications and design can ameliorate the problems of errors, productivity and difficult-to-use architecture. This extended abstract identifies some of the key technical ideas and provides further references in the area of\" rigorous methods\".A computer system will normally be developed in response to some requirements description. Although there are various methods which attempt to make this phase more systematic, the first real opportunity to be formal comes in the specification. A specification should define WHAT a system is to do without becoming involved in HOW the effect is to be achieved.

Physical components are inherently liable to failure and yet an overall CPS is required to operate safely, reliably and cost effectively. This paper proposes a framework for deriving the specification of the software control component of a CPS from an understanding of the behaviour required of the overall system in its physical environment. The two key elements of this framework are (i) an extension to the use of rely/guarantee conditions to allow specifications to be obtained systematically from requirements (as expressed in terms of the required behaviour in the environment) and nested assumptions (about the physical components of the CPS); and (ii) the use of time bands to record the temporal properties required of the CPS at a number of different granularities.

The research began with a literature review in which the features influencing road signage effectiveness, in terms of both conspicuity and comprehension, were identified. Based on these findings, alternative signage designs were developed and investigated in relation to the current SRS signage through a public focus group followed by an expert focus group. The outcomes of this process led to the selection of two alternative supplementary plates to be used with the main plate. These signs were constructed to the temporary signage design specifications and compared to the current temporary SRS signage (which consists of a main plate only) in an on-road trial. Metrocounters measured the free vehicle speed associated with each of the signs at three different curves in both wet and dry conditions. In dry conditions the signs made no practical difference to vehicle speed; however, in wet conditions the presence of a sign resulted in both a significant and practical reduction in free vehicle speed in all three curves. Planned comparisons revealed the sign that led to the greatest reduction in free vehicle speed in the wet differed at each of the curves.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

{"title": "Must Achievement Gaps Persist? The Struggle for Educational Reform in Prince George's County, Maryland\n", "abstract": " This project begins with the position that the persistence of the academic achievement gap suggests the need for a new way of thinking about the gap and the efforts to eliminate it.  To be successful, reform efforts need to address both the school and community issues that impact academic achievement.  Community stakeholders must come together as a community to build an education regime that has improving academic achievement as its agenda.         This work presents a case study of a community in need of a new education regime, Prince George's County, Maryland.  The county has a majority African American population and a large black middle class.  For years the county's school system has produced disappointing results on state assessments.  Additionally, the system has been hampered by the existence of a governing regime focused on its own preservation instead of academic achievement.          In 2002, county residents interested in educational reform were handed an enormous opportunity to challenge the existing education regime when the elected school board was dissolved by the state legislature.  This action came after years of subpar academic performance, after repeated allegations of fiscal mismanagement, and after months of feuding between the school board and superintendent.         This work posits the ouster of the elected school board was a focusing event that disrupted the existing regime and provided an opportunity for regime change.  An examination of county education politics after 2002 shows that regime change did not occur.

{"title": "A structural proof of the soundness of rely/guarantee rules (revised)\n", "abstract": " Various forms of rely/guarantee conditions have been used to record and reason about interference in ways that provide compositional development methods for concurrent programs. This paper illustrates such a set of rules and proves their soundness. The underlying concurrent language allows fine-grained interleaving and nested concurrency; it is defined by an operational semantics; the proof that the rely/guarantee rules are consistent with that semantics (including termination) is by a structural induction. A key lemma which relates the states which can arise from the extra interference that results from taking a portion of the program out of context makes it possible to do the proofs without having to perform induction over the computation history. This lemma also offers a way to think about expressibility issues around auxiliary variables in rely/guarantee conditions.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

The instrument is successfully being used in a wide range of applications, in which its low cost and high sample throughput are more important than the higher specification or flexibility in configuration of conventional instrumentation. The original MiniSIMS was designed around a quadrupole mass analyser, selected as the only type able at the time to meet the size and cost criteria appropriate to a desktop instrument. However, the sequential mass scanning needed to acquire a full spectrum is inefficient and the accepted static SIMS limit may often be exceeded during analysis of small areas.

{"title": "Energy Planning for Indian Nations within the WRAP: A Field Guide.\n", "abstract": " Energy in the form of electricity is a hot topic among tribes within the Western Regional Air Partnership (WRAP). For too many people, energy is too expensive, not reliable, or even nonexistent. For many tribal members, up to 20 or 30 percent of income is spent on energy, which is unbelievably high compared to nontribal people in the same area. Many houses and buildings within Indian nations connected to the existing electrical power grid are at the end of these lines and far away from the power source. As a result, any interruptions throughout the line will disrupt power to these houses and buildings. Thousands more homes and buildings are not connected to the existing grid and have no electricity. Creating energy plans specific to the needs of the tribal members will help bridge the gap between the current energy situation and the energy system tribes envision. This article provides an overview of the process for developing a tribal energy plan. The process includes the following steps:(1) development of a tribal energy vision;(2) energy efficiency (EE) programs;(3) renewable energy resource development;(4) electrification programs; and (5) energy plan implementation. Working with the Hualapai tribe in Arizona, the workshop curriculum was presented and led to instantaneous EE projects. Tribes should begin the process of energy planning for economic development (cost savings, revenue generation, job creation, and profit creation), energy independence, cultural integrity, and to increase tribal sovereignty.(Contains 5 figures and 21 notes.)", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

{"title": "What can we do (technically) to get \u201cthe right specification\u201d?\n", "abstract": " One can use formal approaches either post facto to try to show that a program has desirable properties (main of which is that it satisfies a specification); or one can go for correctness by construction. I not only prefer the latter but I have also argued that this is the main way to get formal methods to pay off: there is more mileage in getting a clean architecture than in trying to debug a bad design by retrofitting a proof; I thing this is also a way to choose an appropriate level of formality perhaps using outline arguments and filling in details if doubt arises (see [Jon96]; Jackson and Wing made a similar point in the same journal; also my position paper at the Royal Society meeting in October 2004\u2013yet to be printed).But how do we know that the specification is right? This is not a trivial question especially with the way computers are today. As computers have become more powerful and less expensive, they have become ever more deeply embedded in the way nearly everyone works. In their short history, computers have moved from batch processors in their own buildings to work tools on every desk (or lap); essential components of administration, retail trade, banking and vehicles; and are on their way to becoming invisible dust sprinkled on who-knows-what. This, in itself, has changed the task of understanding the requirements of a system. Above all, the close interaction of people with computer systems makes it essential that designers consider the whole system when formulating a specification of the technical parts.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

{"title": "Telomeres, telomerase and cellular immortalization\n", "abstract": " It is a well documented observation that normal human cells have a limited ability to proliferate in vitro (Hayflick, 1965). They then enter a state of viable growth arrest known as cellular or replicative senescence (Campisi, 1997; Faragher and Kipling, 1998). Replicative senescence arises as a consequence of chromosomal telomere shortening. This review discusses the structure of telomeres and the effects of abrogating the function of the proteins that bind them. Cancer cells overcome a series of barriers that limit proliferation and the significance of the widespread detection of telomerase in tumours is discussed. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex that synthesizes new telomeric DNA at chromosome ends. The key components of telomerase (a catalytic subunit and RNA template) and the phenotype of a telomerase knockout mouse are described.

Cohort 1 was women who had a hysterectomy (not for cancer); Cohort 2 was women who did not have a hysterectomy. Visit counts and costs, prescription counts and costs, hospital costs, and procedure counts. Hysterectomy patients in our dataset tend to have more prescriptions, higher prescription costs, more visits overall, higher visit costs, higher hospitalization costs, and higher total costs per member per month (PMPM) than non-hysterectomy patients. After surgery, the hysterectomy patients' costs and utilization PMPM are higher than those for the non-hysterectomy patients. There is wide variation in the treatment of patients with DUB.

{"title": "An investigation of the microstructure and mechanical properties of the macro-interface in selectively reinforced aluminium castings\n", "abstract": " The ring groove areas of squeeze-cast Al-12% Si alloy pistons can be selectively reinforced with Saffil (Al2O3) fibres or SiC whiskers to provide local high temperature strength and wear resistance. Since the reinforced region and the unreinforced alloy typically have different coefficients of thermal expansion, cyclic residual stress may occur at the macro-interface between them when it experiences thermal cycling. This could conceivably result in fatigue induced damage at the macro-interface, making it susceptible to failure. To investigate this, the strength of the macro-interface has been measured before and after thermal cycling using bimaterial tensile samples. Prior to thermal exposure, samples typically failed at the macro-interface with an average strength less than that of the unreinforced alloy alone. The low initial strength has been attributed to several factors, including poor alloy-reinforcement\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

Few of the larger districts have two cardiologists to meet the recommendation for populations of over 250 000. One hundred and fifty extra consultant posts (in both district and regional centres) together with adequate supporting staff and facilities are urgently needed to provide modest cover for existing requirements.5 The provision of coronary bypass grafting has expanded since 1985, but few regions have fulfilled the unambitious objectives stated in the Third Joint Cardiology Report.6 The development of coronary angioplasty has been slow and haphazard. All regional centres should have at least two cardiologists trained in coronary angioplasty and there should be a designated budget. Surgical cover is still required for most procedures and is best provided on site.7 Advances in the management of arrhythmias, including the use of specialised pacemakers, implantable defibrillators, and percutaneous or surgical ablation of parts of the cardiac conducting system have resulted in great benefit\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

The possibility that immune-mediated injury could subsequently interfere with nonspecific mucosal defenses was also investigated by infecting calves with Pasteurella haemolytica after the antigen challenge and assessing pulmonary clearance of the organism. The results indicated that specific aerosol challenge produces reversible signs of respiratory hypersensitivity and that persistence of incidental infection in the upper respiratory tract is potentiated. Since the calves were sensitized by an immunization regime which imitated conventional vaccination, this study highlights the potential dangers of inactivated parenteral respiratory vaccines.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

Designing a language is a non-trivial task and building tools to process the language requires a significant investment of time and resources. The formalism described in this book makes it possible to experiment with features of a programming language far more cheaply than by building a compiler. This makes it possible to think through combinations of language features and avoid unwanted interactions that can confuse users of the language.

In Metro Vancouver, broad processes of socio-spatial polarization in the region have led to the emergence of a low-income corridor that follows the SkyTrain Expo Line rapid transit alignment from East Vancouver to North Surrey. Within this low-income corridor there are processes of significant and varied neighbourhood change. The population of Metro Vancouver continues to expand, with this growth largely fueled by immigration. In order to accommodate population growth, increased residential density and transit-oriented development near SkyTrain stations has become a common public policy prescription. A mixed-methodology was pursued in order to conduct research at three geographical scales. At the scale of the Vancouver region, quantitative analysis is employed to discover associations between the demographics and the housing stock of neighbourhoods, and the average incomes of census tracts as well as changes in average incomes. At the sub-regional scale of the low-income corridor, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 key informants. Finally, at the local scale, two neighbourhoods were selected for further study. Four focus groups were conducted with a total of 26 residents of two neighbourhoods within the low-income corridor. The key findings of these methods are generally complementary. At the regional scale, the Vancouver CMA has seen an increase of income inequality.

Investigating individual experiences of past episodes through archivebased research and oral histories can provide valuable insights to the nature of humanenvironment interactions during periods of extreme weather. Analysis of three case studies of varying meteorological, temporal and geographical characteristics, namely the 1846 flooding, the 1887\u201388 drought and 1946/47 winter on a local scale of southwest Wales from a qualitative perspective enables the detection of details which would not otherwise have been recognised in global and/or statistical equivalents, especially as acute meteorological extremes that straddle temporal boundaries are unlikely to be detected within compilations of instrumental data. This research highlights how individuals and communities document, are impacted, respond and mitigate against periods of extreme weather. Individual and community vulnerability to extreme weather is found to be affected by factors of amplification and resilience, namely: i) dependency on agriculture, because of its temporalities of recovery and is highly meteorologically-influenced by rain, drought and snow; ii) geographical extent of the extreme weather, as it can affect the level of aid received from remote beneficiaries; iii) technological advancements, which can help before, during and after the extreme weather by forecasting and facilitating effective responses; iv) class and economic standing, as the poor are disproportionately impacted by extreme weather; and, v) memory, through the meteorological and wider temporal context\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

In this course, students analyze the ethical dimensions of Buddhist philosophy and practice that support and compel deep engagement in and commitment to transformation for the common good. In so doing, this course which culminates in this Field Guide to Socially Engaged Buddhism interrogates the relationship between the personal and social manifestations of Buddhist thought and practice and investigates the roles Buddhist thinkers, organizations, and institutions have played in social justice movements.

The study suggests that such models may be valuable tools in designing for dynamic, adaptive behaviour in coalitions. Previous research has used formal modelling as a way of gaining insight into the range of types or patterns of dynamic coalition that may arise. Experience also suggests that human and organisational aspects are at least as important as technical approaches to the dependable operation of coalitions. The goal for this project was to investigate the application of formal modelling techniques, with tool support, to help explore the consequences of alternative designs for coalition structures and policies. The exploration was centered on the role of the human in a coalition, in terms of their understanding of information flows. A``Dynamic Coalitions Workbench''has been developed to allow the animation of a specific coalition model. Users, who may be domain experts, interact with the model by invoking membership and information exchange functions in response to prompts driven by a scenario. Interaction is via a simple graphical interface so that users require no familiarity with the technicalities of the underlying formal modelling language. A specific scenario, based on crisis management in a military context, has been developed in collaboration with Dstl to exercise the workbench.

With a population of approximately 18,000, it is one of the world's smallest and newest independent nations, 2 yet it has acquired the status of a highly-regarded tourist destination and is considered one of the world's great diving locations. 3 In addition to being a premier diving destination, Palau's unspoiled beauty and rich marine environment, especially the unique Rock Islands (which include the famous Jellyfish Lake, a marine lake populated by the only non-stinging jellyfish in the world), have ensured Palau a small but steady stream of tourist visitors. The popular reality television program\" Survivor\" recently featured Palau, 4 indicating that tourism is a trend that can be expected to continue and expand.

{"title": "Designing dependable systems needs interdisciplinarity\n", "abstract": " Modern computer-based systems pose a huge challenge to designers if they are to achieve dependability of the delivered service. These challenges are recognised for safety-critical systems such as medical devices, industrial process supervision workstations or autopilots. But even for systems where life is in not at stake, the need for properties like reliability, security, maintainability is becoming ever more pressing. Historically, a combination of methods derived from the purely technical fields of computing science, mathematics and statistics were used to provide some form of guarantee that the overall system will behave as prescribed. Human considerations were not totally overlooked from such approaches, but the increasingly intimate connection between the purely technical system and the humans surrounding it requires a more explicit consideration of psychological and social dimensions. Such questions as \"Can users revert to manual mode?\"; \"Are the security features usable?\"; \"Does the system match established practices?\" become crucial to the success of the overall computer-based system. We outline an overview of the relevance of these questions in the workplace and emphasize the interest of an interdisciplinary approach to computer-based systems. We will draw on the wisdom acquired in a major interdisciplinary project to shed some light on the need for non-IT disciplines and their contribution to the understanding of dependability.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

We are designing an experiment to measure all four correlations to an order of magnitude better accuracy than existing measurements. The accuracy of the previous measurements was limited by systematics. The experiment will make use of the pulsed nature of the LANSCE source to reduce systematic errors associated with the measurement of the neutron polarization as well as other systematic errors. These measurements are made possible by the use of silicon strip detectors for simultaneously detecting both the proton and electron from the neutron decay.

If one of these lugs lies under the notch (Figure 1, image on left) rather than correctly inserted into the notch (image on right), there is a significant leak around the hard plastic shell, rendering ventilation impossible even with very high gas flows.

{"title": "Granularity and the development of concurrent programs\n", "abstract": " Interference is what makes the design of concurrent programs difficult. In the case of shared-variables, interference manifests itself as state changes; but the issue of interference is also present with communication-based concurrency. In order to reason about interfering programs it is necessary to assume something about the granularity of the steps of the processes concerned. Many development methods circumvent this difficulty by fixing which statement types are atomic. It can be argued that this is unfortunate and is likely to result in programs which are inefficient (in a particular way). This extended abstract shows how development methods based on rely/guarantee-conditions avoid a commitment to a fixed notion of atomicity and suggests that concurrent object-oriented languages are good targets for such a development method.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

{"title": "The Hydrolysis of Cirazoline and the Mechanism of Stabilization by SDDS\n", "abstract": " This thesis princiapally examines the kinetics and mechanism of hydrolysis of cirazoline hydrochloride in aqueous solution and the stabilising effect of sodium dodecylsulphate (SDDS) which results from a variety of drug-surfactant interactions. The introduction outlines the factors affecting hydrolysis kinetics and briefly reviews the stability and medicinal and physicochemical properties of imidazolines. The properties of surface active agents particularly micellization and solubilization are examined and separate sections are devoted to interactions between large organic ions of opposite charge and the effect of surfactants on reaction kinetics and equilibria. Experimental work is divided into seven sections dealing with materials and general methods; HPLC and UV analysis techniques; pK a determination; NMR studies into imidazolaine acidity; ion-pair and complex formation; micellization and solubilization; and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1582"]}

The MSS is an object-space line scanner for gathering data in four spectral bands ranging from 0.5-1.1 micron. In a 705 km near-polar sunsynchronous orbit, the MSS will generate 185 x 185 km imagery with 80 x 80 m ground resolution, mapping the entire earth every 16 days. Photomultiplier tubes are used for four of the bands and the other employs Si photodiodes. A calibration light source provides in orbit calibration during every reverse scan period of a pivotal on-board mirror. The TM collects data in seven bands from 0.45-12.5 microns, yielding a ground resolution of 30 x 30 m in six bands for reflected sunlight and 120 x 120 m for the 10.4-12.5 thermal bands.
