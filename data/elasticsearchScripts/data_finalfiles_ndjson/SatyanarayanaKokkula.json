{"title": "Offset impact behaviour of bumper beam\u2013longitudinal systems: numerical simulations\n", "abstract": " The paper presents the results from numerical simulations of bumper beam\u2013longitudinal systems subjected to 40% offset impact loading. Numerical simulations were carried out with the non-linear finite element code LS-DYNA, searching for an efficient, numerically robust and accurate representation of the observed system behaviour. A comparative study of an industrial-like modelling procedure and another procedure incorporating a user-defined material model has been performed. In the latter procedure, the material model consists of state-of-the-art anisotropic plasticity, an isotropic strain and a strain-rate hardening rule as well as some ductile fracture criteria. Both shell and solid elements were utilized in discretizing the bumper beam\u2013longitudinal set-up. Numerical crash results revealed good agreement with the experiments with respect to overall deformation mode and energy dissipation.

{"title": "Offset impact behaviour of bumper beam\u2014longitudinal systems: experimental investigations\n", "abstract": " Repeatability and robustness are the key factors that the automotive producers are demanding in connectionwith the crash performance of bumper beam systems. Bumper beam systems are important structures of an automotive that protect the passengers from front and rear collisions. Assessing the impact performance of only a bumper beam system through full-scale crash tests of a car is not easy. Thus, this paper presents experimental investigations on the bumper beam\u2013longitudinal systems subjected to 40% offset impact. Bumper beam systems that are generally fitted to the automotives include \u2018crashboxes\u2019 besides the longitudinals. In the current study, the bumper beam system does not include any \u2018crashboxes\u2019. This is also the preferred system for some automotive producers. A longitudinal will offer higher resistance to deformation and thus gives higher energy absorption than if crashboxes are used. Using\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "28\n", "authors": ["1440"]}
{"title": "Bumper beam-longitudinal system subjected to offset impact loading: an experimental and numerical study\n", "abstract": " The present thesis describes an experimental and numerical study of a bumper beam-longitudinal system subjected to 40% offset impact, where longitudinals of two different alloys (AA7003 and AA6060) and two different tempers (T79 and T1) were varied along with the impact velocity. Two impact velocities 10 m/s (~ 36 km/h) and 15 m/s (~ 54 km/h) were used. The bumper beam chosen for the study was taken from the production line at Hydro Aluminium Structures (HAST), Norway, and was made out of the alloy AA7108-T6.The experiments revealed that the robustness of the system was very dependent on the material used in the longitudinals. It was found that changing the temper condition of the longitudinals had significant influence on the collapse mode of the bumper beam-longitudinal system. The longitudinal members with considerable strain hardening had a tendency to develop lobes randomly along the length of the members. At increased impact velocity lower peak force and less fracture in the material was observed.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["1440"]}

The result is reduced profit margins; therefore, the need for increased productivity is higher than ever. Some of the aspects important for productivity include material flow, information flow, sound planning, and organizational structure. This paper focuses on the information transfer between the engineering team and the installation phase of the fabrication at AS Nymo.
