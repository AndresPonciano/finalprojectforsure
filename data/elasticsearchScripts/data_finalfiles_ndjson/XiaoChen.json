However, machine learning models lack robustness to adversarial examples, which are crafted by adding carefully chosen perturbations to the normal inputs. So far, the adversarial examples can only deceive detectors that rely on syntactic features (e.g., requested permissions, API calls, etc.), and the perturbations can only be implemented by simply modifying application's manifest. While recent Android malware detectors rely more on semantic features from Dalvik bytecode rather than manifest, existing attacking/defending methods are no longer effective.

{"title": "Context-aware generative adversarial privacy\n", "abstract": " Preserving the utility of published datasets while simultaneously providing provable privacy guarantees is a well-known challenge. On the one hand, context-free privacy solutions, such as differential privacy, provide strong privacy guarantees, but often lead to a significant reduction in utility. On the other hand, context-aware privacy solutions, such as information theoretic privacy, achieve an improved privacy-utility tradeoff, but assume that the data holder has access to dataset statistics. We circumvent these limitations by introducing a novel context-aware privacy framework called generative adversarial privacy (GAP). GAP leverages recent advancements in generative adversarial networks (GANs) to allow the data holder to learn privatization schemes from the dataset itself. Under GAP, learning the privacy mechanism is formulated as a constrained minimax game between two players: a privatizer that sanitizes the dataset in a way that limits the risk of inference attacks on the individuals\u2019 private variables, and an adversary that tries to infer the private variables from the sanitized dataset. To evaluate GAP\u2019s performance, we investigate two simple (yet canonical) statistical dataset models:(a) the binary data model; and (b) the binary Gaussian mixture model. For both models, we derive game-theoretically optimal minimax privacy mechanisms, and show that the privacy mechanisms learned from data (in a generative adversarial fashion) match the theoretically optimal ones. This demonstrates that our framework can be easily applied in practice, even in the absence of dataset statistics. View Full-Text", "num_citations": "107\n", "authors": ["1393"]}

The shortest path multicast tree guarantees shortest path to each destination. But each source needs to build a tree. Therefore, there exist too many trees in the network.

In order to predict multiple failure modes observed in the tests and gain more insights into the failure mechanisms of the blade, a Finite Element (FE) simulation was performed using a global-local modeling approach and Progressive Failure Analysis (PFA) techniques which took into account material failure and property degradation. Failure process and failure characteristics of the transition region were satisfactorily reproduced in the simulation, and it was found that accumulated delamination in spar cap and shear web failure at the transition region were the main reasons for the blade to collapse. Local buckling played an important role in the failure process by increasing local out-of-plane deformation, while the Brazier effect was found not to be responsible for the blade failure.

{"title": "A novel feature extraction method for ship-radiated noise based on variational mode decomposition and multi-scale permutation entropy\n", "abstract": " In view of the problem that the features of ship-radiated noise are difficult to extract and inaccurate, a novel method based on variational mode decomposition (VMD), multi-scale permutation entropy (MPE) and a support vector machine (SVM) is proposed to extract the features of ship-radiated noise. In order to eliminate mode mixing and extract the complexity of the intrinsic mode function (IMF) accurately, VMD is employed to decompose the three types of ship-radiated noise instead of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and its extended methods. Considering the reason that the permutation entropy (PE) can quantify the complexity only in one scale, the MPE is used to extract features in different scales. In this study, three types of ship-radiated noise signals are decomposed into a set of band-limited IMFs by the VMD method, and the intensity of each IMF is calculated. Then, the IMFs with the highest energy are selected for the extraction of their MPE. By analyzing the separability of MPE at different scales, the optimal MPE of the IMF with the highest energy is regarded as the characteristic vector. Finally, the feature vectors are sent into the SVM classifier to classify and recognize different types of ships. The proposed method was applied in simulated signals and actual signals of ship-radiated noise. By comparing with the PE of the IMF with the highest energy by EMD, ensemble EMD (EEMD) and VMD, the results show that the proposed method can effectively extract the features of MPE and realize the classification and recognition for ships.

Naive forwarding approaches, such as flooding and its derivatives, make the routing cost (here defined as the number of copies duplicated for a message) very high. Many efforts have been made to reduce the cost while maintaining performance. Recently, an approach called delegation forwarding (DF) caught significant attention in the research community because of its simplicity and good performance. In a network with N nodes, it reduces the cost to O(radic(N)) which is better than O(N) in other methods.

VMD is a new self-adaptive signal processing algorithm, which is more robust to sampling and noise, and also can overcome the problem of mode mixing in empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and ensemble EMD (EEMD). Permutation entropy (PE), as a nonlinear dynamics parameter, is a powerful tool that can describe the complexity of a time series. NPE, a new version of PE, is interpreted as distance to white noise, which shows a reverse trend to PE and has better stability than PE. In this paper, three kinds of ship-radiated noise (SN) signal are decomposed by VMD algorithm, and a series of intrinsic mode functions (IMF) are obtained. The NPEs of all the IMFs are calculated, the noise IMFs are screened out according to the value of NPE, and the process of denoising can be realized by reconstructing the rest of IMFs. Then the reconstructed SN signal is decomposed by VMD algorithm again, and one IMF containing the most dominant information is chosen to represent the original SN signal. Finally, NPE of the chosen IMF is calculated as a new complexity feature, which constitutes the input of the support vector machine (SVM) for pattern recognition of SN.

In this paper, we propose a new technique for underwater acoustic signal denoising based on complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN), mutual information (MI), permutation entropy (PE), and wavelet threshold denoising. CEEMDAN is an improved algorithm of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and ensemble EMD (EEMD). First, CEEMDAN is employed to decompose noisy signals into many intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). IMFs can be divided into three parts: noise IMFs, noise-dominant IMFs, and real IMFs. Then, the noise IMFs can be identified on the basis of MIs of adjacent IMFs; the other two parts of IMFs can be distinguished based on the values of PE. Finally, noise IMFs were removed, and wavelet threshold denoising is applied to noise-dominant IMFs; we can obtain the final denoised signal by combining real IMFs and denoised noise-dominant IMFs. Simulation experiments were conducted by using simulated data, chaotic signals, and real underwater acoustic signals; the proposed denoising technique performs better than other existing denoising techniques, which is beneficial to the feature extraction of underwater acoustic signal.

In this study, we utilize dynamical and statistical complexity to detect the presence of weak ship noise embedded in ambient noise. The ambient noise and ship noise were recorded in the South China Sea. The multiscale entropy (MSE) method and the complexity-entropy causality plane (CH plane) were used to quantify the dynamical and statistical complexity of the measured time series, respectively. We generated signals with varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by varying the amplification of a ship signal. The simulation results indicate that the complexity is sensitive to change in the information in the ambient noise and the change in SNR, a finding that enables the detection of weak ship signals in strong background ambient noise. The simulation results also illustrate that complexity is better than the traditional spectrogram method, particularly effective for detecting low SNR signals in ambient noise. In addition, complexity-based MSE and CH plane methods are simple, robust and do not assume any underlying dynamics in time series. Hence, complexity should be used in practical situations.

Using the advantage of variational mode decomposition (VMD) combined with the correlation coefficient for denoising, a hybrid secondary denoising algorithm is proposed using secondary VMD combined with a correlation coefficient (CC). First, different kinds of simulation signals are decomposed into several bandwidth-limited intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) using VMD, where the decomposition number by VMD is equal to the number by empirical mode decomposition (EMD); then, the CCs between the IMFs and the simulation signal are calculated respectively. The noise IMFs are identified by the CC threshold and the rest of the IMFs are reconstructed in order to realize the first denoising process. Finally, secondary denoising of the simulation signal can be accomplished by repeating the above steps of decomposition, screening and reconstruction. The final denoising result is determined according to the CC threshold. The denoising effect is compared under the different signal-to-noise ratio and the time of decomposition by VMD. Experimental results show the validity of the proposed denoising algorithm using secondary VMD (2VMD) combined with CC compared to EMD denoising, ensemble EMD (EEMD) denoising, VMD denoising and cubic VMD (3VMD) denoising, as well as two denoising algorithms presented recently.

Firstly, VMD decomposes the complex multi-component underwater acoustic signal into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), so as to extract the estimated center frequency of each IMF. Secondly, the frequency of the line spectrum can be obtained by using DCO and a kind of PE (KPE). DCO is used to detect the actual frequency of the line spectrum for each IMF and KPE can determine the accurate frequency when the phase space track is in the great periodic state. Finally, the frequency characteristic parameters acted as the input of the support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish different types of underwater acoustic signals.

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the value of computed tomography (CT) imaging features and texture analysis to differentiate PNEC from PDAC. Twenty-eight patients with pathologically-proved PDAC and 14 patients with PNEC were included in this study. CT imaging findings, including tumor boundary, size, enhancement degree, duct dilatation and parenchymal atrophy were used to compare PDAC and PNEC. CT texture features were extracted from CT images at the arterial and portal phases. More PNEC than PDAC had well-defined margins (57.1% vs 25.0%, p\u2009=\u20090.04). Parenchymal atrophy was more common in PDAC than in PNEC (67.9% vs 28.1%, p\u2009=\u20090.02). CT attenuation values (HU) and contrast ratios of PNEC inthe arterial and portal phases were higher than those of PDAC (p\u2009<\u20090.05 or 0.01). Entropy was lower and uniformity was higher in PNEC compare to PDAC at the arterial phase (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Contrast ratio showed the highest area under curve (AUC) for differentiating PNEC from PDAC (AUC\u2009=\u20090.98\u20130.99). Entropy and uniformity also showed an acceptable AUC (0.71\u20130.72).

In order to improve the real-time processing and accuracy of target tracking, based on a probabilistic data association algorithm, a novel data association algorithm using distance weighting was proposed, which can enhance the association probability of measurement originated from target, and then using a Kalman filter to estimate the target state more accurately. Thus, the tracking performance of the proposed algorithm when tracking non-maneuvering targets in a densely cluttered environment has improved, and also does better when two targets are parallel to each other, or at a small-angle crossing in a densely cluttered environment. As for maneuvering target issues, usually with an interactive multi-model framework, combined with the improved probabilistic data association method, we propose an improved algorithm using a combined interactive multiple model probabilistic data association algorithm to track a maneuvering target in a densely cluttered environment. Through Monte Carlo simulation, the results show that the proposed algorithm can be more effective and reliable for different scenarios of target tracking in a densely cluttered environment.

To solve this dilemma, this paper introduces a hybrid energy feature extraction approach for ship-radiated noise (S-RN) based on complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) combined with energy difference (ED) and energy entropy (EE). This approach, named CEEMDAN-ED-EE, has two main advantages:(i) compared with empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and ensemble EMD (EEMD), CEEMDAN has better decomposition performance by overcoming mode mixing, and the intrinsic mode function (IMF) obtained by CEEMDAN is beneficial to feature extraction;(ii) the classification performance of the single energy feature has some limitations, nevertheless, the proposed hybrid energy feature extraction approach has a better classification performance. In this paper, we first decompose three types of S-RN into sub-signals, named intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Then, we obtain the features of energy difference and energy entropy based on IMFs, named CEEMDAN-ED and CEEMDAN-EE, respectively. Finally, we compare the recognition rate for three sorts of S-RN by using the following three energy feature extraction approaches, which are CEEMDAN-ED, CEEMDAN-EE and CEEMDAN-ED-EE.

In order to obtain more power from the PV system, the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is necessary. However, when the PV is partially shaded, there will be multiple peaks in the power-current (PI) curve. The conventional MPPT methods may be invalid due to falling into the local peak. In addition, in a photovoltaic-thermal (PV/T) system, the non-uniform temperature distribution on PV will also occur, which complicates the situation. This paper presents a MPPT method with glowworm swarm optimization (GSO) for PV in a PV/T system under non-uniform solar irradiation and temperature distribution. In order to study the performance of the proposed method, the conventional methods including the perturbation and observe algorithm (P and O), and the fractional open-circuit voltage technique (FOCVT) are compared with it in this paper. Simulation results show that the proposed method can rapidly track the real maximum power point (MPP) under different conditions, such as the gradient temperature distribution, the fast variable solar irradiation and the variable partial shading. The outcome indicates the proposed method has obvious advantages, especially the performance being superior to the conventional methods under the partial shading condition.

Combining cytotoxic chemotherapy with immunotherapy has shown great promise for TNBC treatment. However, chemotherapy often leads to the development of chemoresistance and severe systemic toxicity compromising the immune functions that are crucial to anti-TNBC immune therapy. Tumor-induced immunosuppression also poses a great hindrance to efficacious anti-TNBC immunotherapy. Nanomedicine holds great promise to overcome these hurdles. Doxorubicin-polyglycerol-nanodiamond conjugate (Nano-DOX) was firstly found to be a cytostatic agent to the 4T1 cells and displayed a lower apparent therapeutic potency than DOX. However, the tumor-bearing animals, particularly some key immune cells thereof, showed good tolerance of Nano-DOX as opposed to the severe toxicity of DOX. Next, Nano-DOX did not induce significant upregulation of P-gp and IL-6, which were demonstrated to be key mediators of chemoresistance to DOX in the 4T1 cells. Then, Nano-DOX was shown to downregulate tumor-derived granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and suppresses the induction and tissue filtration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) that are the principal effectors of cancer-associated systemic immunosuppression. Nano-DOX also alleviated the phenotype of MDSCs induced by 4T1 cells. Finally, Nano-DOX induced the 4T1 cells to emit damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that stimulated the tumor immune microenvironment through activating key immune\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["1393"]}

The imbalance due to over-activated osteoclasts plays an important role in various diseases. Activation of NF-\u03baB and MAPK signaling pathways by receptor activator of nuclear factor -\u03baB ligand (RANKL) is vital for osteoclastogenesis. Here we for the first time explored the effects of 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid (18\u03b2-GA), a pentacyclic triterpenoid found in the Glycyrrhiza glabra L roots, on RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis, osteoclast functions and signaling pathways in vitro and in vivo. In bone marrow monocytes (BMMs) and RAW264.7 cells, 18\u03b2-GA inhibited osteoclastogenesis, decreased expression of osteoclastogenesis-related genes, including TRAP, cathepsin K, CTR and MMP-9, blocked actin ring formation and compromised osteoclasts functions in a dose-dependent manner at an early stage with minimal effects on osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs).

The identified pair of open-loop SSO modes is referred to as the condition of open-loop modal resonance (OLMR). Our analysis indicates that under the condition of the OLMR, it is likely that the SSO stability of the multimachine power system is degraded by the grid connection of the VSWGs.

Our laboratory previously demonstrated that maternally deposited, long, noncoding, template RNAs are essential for programmed genome rearrangements in the ciliate Oxytricha trifallax. Here we show that such RNAs are bidirectionally transcribed and transported to the zygotic nucleus. The gene encoding the second-largest subunit of Pol-II, Rpb2, has undergone gene duplication, and the two paralogs, Rpb2-a and -b, display different expression patterns. Immunoprecipitation of double-stranded RNAs identified an association with Rpb2-a. Through immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we show that Rpb2-a in early zygotes appears surprisingly unassociated with other Pol II subunits.

In order to realize the feature extraction of ship-radiated noise (S-RN), we proposed a data-driven optimization method called improved variational mode decomposition (IVMD). IVMD, as an improved method of variational mode decomposition (VMD), solved the problem of choosing decomposition layers for VMD by using a frequency-aided method. Furthermore, a novel method of feature extraction for S-RN, which combines IVMD and sample entropy (SE), is put forward in this paper. In this study, four types of S-RN signals are decomposed into a group of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by IVMD. Then, SEs of all IMFs are calculated. SEs are different in the maximum energy IMFs (EIMFs), thus, SE of the EIMF is seen as a novel feature for S-RN. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, a comparison has been conducted by comparing features of center frequency and SE of the EIMF by IVMD, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and ensemble EMD (EEMD). The analysis results show that the feature of S-RN can be obtain efficiently and accurately by using the proposed method. View Full-Text", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["1393"]}

Seven specimens were used to measure the transmission, including tests of attenuation and phase velocity, while the other seven specimens were used for backscattered measurements to inspect the depth of penetration and A-Mode signals. Five pairs of unfocused broadband ultrasonic transducers were used for the detection, with center frequencies of 0.5 MHz, 1 MHz, 1.5 MHz, 2.25 MHz, and 3.5 MHz. As a result, good and stable results were documented.

Therefore, we established a set of two-dimensional sandpack models to study the steam chamber expansion characteristics of the horizontal-well solvent-enhanced steam flooding (HW-SESF) of different solvents and its influence on production performance. We established a numerical model based on the experimental parameters to simulate the solvent migration in the steam chamber and its effect on temperature, viscosity, and oil saturation profile.

{"title": "Different dimensional nanoadditives for thermal conductivity enhancement of phase change materials: Fundamentals and applications\n", "abstract": " Thermal energy storage technologies based on phase change materials (PCM) have been increasingly studied because of their superb regulation of thermal energy and their recent increases in efficient energy utilization. However, the low thermal conductivity of pure PCM immensely restricts their use in some applications such as the thermal management of devices and wearable textiles. Adding highly thermal conductive nanoadditives to PCM is widely accepted as a highly effective strategy to enhance the thermal conductivity of PCM. In this review, a comprehensive summary of the recent advances in enhancing thermal conductivity of PCM based on different dimensional nanoadditives is proposed, including zero-dimensional (0D), one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), and three-dimensional (3D) nanoadditives along with hybrid nanoadditives.

Imaging and catalytic performance results suggest that the dual-enzyme nanoflower greatly reduces the diffusion and decomposition of H2O2 and facilitates the mass transfer of glucose oxidase/lipase. Furthermore, the controllable generation of H2O2 and peracid contributes to the good stability of the dual-enzyme nanoflower, which exhibits a higher catalytic performance than the free enzymes in a dual-enzymatic cascade epoxidation. The yield of epoxidation was up to 82% even after ten cycles, further indicating the good reusability of the dual-enzyme nanoflower and its great potential for application in other enzymatic oxidations.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["1393"]}

However, the treatment options and prognosis of PNETs and PDAC are substantially different. This retrospective study differentiated hypo-PNETs from PDAC using contrast-enhanced CT (CE-CT). Clinical data and CE-CT findings, including tumor location, size, boundary, pancreatic duct dilatation, local invasion or metastases, tumor contrast enhancement, and tumor-to-pancreas enhancement ratio, were compared between 39 PDACs and 18 hypo-PNETs. At CT imaging, hypo-PNETs showed a higher frequency of a well-defined margin and lower frequencies of pancreatic duct dilatation and local invasion or metastasis when compared with PDAC (p < 0.05 for all). The mean attenuation of hypo-PNETs at the arterial and portal venous phase was significantly higher than that of PDAC (p < 0.001, p = 0.003, respectively). Similar results were observed in tumor-to-pancreas enhancement ratio. Tumor attenuation and tumor-to-pancreas enhancement ratio at the arterial phase showed the largest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.888 and 0.812 with 83.3\u201388.9% of sensitivity and 61.6\u201377.0% of specificity.

Combined characterization by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic, ESR, and X-ray photoelectron spectrosopic methods confirmed the presence of Fe in the ZSM-23 framework. The crystal size decreased with increasing Fe/(Fe + Al) ratio, and the Fe-substituted ZSM-23 samples exhibited large specific areas and pore volumes. The introduction of Fe in the framework reduced the acid strength compared with the Fe-free counterparts. Compared with the Pt/Fe-free ZSM-23 catalyst, the Pt/Fe-substituted catalysts showed lower activity to the hydroisomerization of n-hexadecane and higher isomerization selectivity.

Then, the multilayer TiN/CrAlN films were subjected to large heating-cooling shock during the high temperature process. The thermal expansion mismatch between the substrate-film, film-film and oxide-nitride interfaces causes large thermal stress.

One fundamental problem of such systems is how to increase the transmission rate. Two new schemes are proposed to address the limited data rate issue: adaptive transmission scheme and generalized data representation (GDR) scheme. In the first scheme, an adaptive transmission is designed to select the transmission vectors for maximizing the data rate under different channel conditions. The block error rate (BLER) of the first scheme is 80% lower than that of the conventional one-hot vector scheme. This implies that higher data rate can be achieved by the adaptive transmission scheme. In the second scheme, the GDR replaces the conventional one-hot representation. The GDR scheme can achieve higher data rate than the conventional one-hot vector scheme with comparable BLER\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1393"]}

Motivated by the various Vegetation Indices (VIs), which are introduced by domain experts, we systematically reviewed the VIs that are widely used in remote sensing and their feasibility to be incorporated in deep neural networks. To fully leverage the Near-Infrared channel, the traditional Red-Green-Blue channels, and Vegetation Index or its variants, we propose a Generalized Vegetation Index (GVI), a lightweight module that can be easily plugged into many neural network architectures to serve as an additional information input. To smoothly train models with our GVI, we developed an Additive Group Normalization (AGN) module that does not require extra parameters of the prescribed neural networks.

In this study, we employed high-throughput sequencing technology to reveal the phylogenetic position of Synhymenia, as well as two classes Nassophorea and Phyllopharyngea, which have been a long-standing puzzle in the field of ciliate systematics and evolution. We obtained genomic and transcriptomic data from single cells of one synhymenian (Chilodontopsis depressa) and other six species of phyllopharyngeans (Chilodochona sp., Dysteria derouxi, Hartmannula sinica, Trithigmostoma cucullulus, Trochilia petrani, and Trochilia sp.). Phylogenomic analysis based on 157 orthologous genes comprising 173,835 amino acid residues revealed the affiliation of C. depressa within the class Phyllopharyngea, and the monophyly of Nassophorea, which strongly support the assignment of Synhymenia as a subclass within the class Phyllopharyngea. Comparative genomic analyses further revealed that C. depressa shares more orthologous genes with the class Nassophorea than with Phyllopharyngea, and the stop codon usage in C. depressa resembles that of Phyllopharyngea. Functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that biological pathways in C. depressa are more similar to Phyllopharyngea than Nassophorea.

One important aspect of surveillance is target localization. A location can be estimated by collecting and analyzing sensing data on signal strength, time of arrival, time difference of arrival, or angle of arrival. However, this data is subject to measurement noise and is sensitive to environmental conditions, so its location estimates can be inaccurate. In this paper, we add a novel process to further improve the localization accuracy after the initial location estimates are obtained from some existing algorithm. Our idea is to exploit the consistency of the spatial\u2013temporal relationships of the targets we track.

In the present scheme, an application of spherical radial cubature Bayesian filtering and smoothing is efficiently investigated for accurate state estimation of a far-field moving target in complex ocean environments. The nonlinear model of a Kalman filter based on a Spherical Radial Cubature Kalman Filter (SRCKF) and discrete-time Kalman smoother known as a Spherical Radial Cubature Rauch\u2013Tung\u2013Striebel (SRCRTS) smoother are applied for tracking the semi-curved and curved trajectory of a moving object.

To handle this problem efficiently, it is desirable to construct a surrogate model for the power system response. However, the straightforward MC sampling of the low-fidelity surrogate can lead to biased results in the low-probability tail regions that are vital to risk assessment.

The improved performance could be attributed to the presence of more isolated CuO and MnOx entities on the surface of supported catalysts, which contributed to the efficient utilization of both lattice oxygen from CeO2 and spillover oxygen from surface MnOx. For bulk catalysts, major Cu\u2013Mn species were doped to form  solid solutions and a part of them were coated by ceria mechanically.

It was found that the transformed ignition time  increased linearly with heat flux when index n\u00a0=\u00a00.3, which was lower than 1, 0.55 and 0.5 that were employed in previous study, due to the intumescence of the material. The calculation temperature was more accurate with the minimum heat flux and a variable  depending on external heat fluxes. The peak heat release rate of commercial flame-retardant was lower than others due to the formation of charred layer and the additives which could repair the rupture produced by evolution gas emitting.

{"title": "PHD and CPHD algorithms based on a novel detection probability applied in an active sonar tracking system\n", "abstract": " Underwater multi-targets tracking has always been a difficult problem in active sonar tracking systems. In order to estimate the parameters of time-varying multi-targets moving in underwater environments, based on the Bayesian filtering framework, the Random Finite Set (RFS) is introduced to multi-targets tracking, which not only avoids the problem of data association in multi-targets tracking, but also realizes the estimation of the target number and their states simultaneously. Usually, the conventional Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) and Cardinalized Probability Hypothesis Density (CPHD) algorithms assume that the detection probability is known as a priori, which is not suitable in many applications. Some methods have been proposed to estimate the detection probability, but most assume that it is constant both in time and surveillance region. In this paper, we model the detection probability through the active sonar equation. When fixed the false detection probability, we can get the analytic expression for the detection probability, which is related to target position. In addition, this novel detection probability is used in PHD and CPHD algorithms and applied to underwater active sonar tracking systems. Also, we use the adaptive ellipse gate strategy to reduce the computational load in PHD and CPHD algorithms. Under the linear Gaussian assumption, the proposed detection probability is illustrated in both Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis Density (GM-PHD) and Gaussian Mixture Cardinalized Probability Hypothesis Density (GM-CPHD), respectively.

The study indicates that underwater fillet weld joints have larger strength but smaller ductility when compared with their counterpart in-air ones. The increase in strength ranges from 6.9% to 41.0%, and the decrease in ductility is about 50% for most of weld assembly types.

Cadmium in urine (UCd) and blood (BCd), urinary \u03b22Microglobulin (UBMG), urinary retinol binding protein (URBP) and serum 25 (OH) D were determined. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between 25 (OH) D and prevalence of renal tubular dysfunction. No significant differences were observed in serum 25(OH) D levels among the four quartile of UCd and BCd after adjusting with cofounders. After adjusted with the confounders, the odds ratio (OR) of subjects with 25(OH) D \u2265 40 ng/ml were 0.20 (95%CI: 0.1\u20130.8) if UBMG was chosen as indicators of renal dysfunction and 0.28 (95%CI: 0.1\u20131.1) if URBP was chosen as indicators of renal dysfunction, compared with those with 25(OH) D < 30 ng/ml, respectively. Similar results were observed in those subjects living in cadmium polluted areas or with high level of UCd or BCd. Our data indicated that cadmium exposure did not affect serum 25(OH) D level and high 25 (OH) D levels were associated with a decreased risk of renal tubular dysfunction induced by cadmium.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1393"]}

Gauging these symmetries into local dynamical ones is one way of obtaining exotic phases from conventional systems. We study this using the bulk-boundary correspondence and applying the orbifold construction to the (1+ 1)-dimensional edge described by a conformal field theory (CFT). Our procedure puts twisted boundary conditions into the partition function and predicts the fusion, spin, and braiding behavior of anyonic excitations after gauging.

The global equivalence ratio coupling the horizontal opening and fuel areas was proposed to deal with these measuring parameters obtained. The results show that extinction time presents different variation trends for the burning out and self-extinction modes.

This paper presents a new method which uses a content complexity quotiety of frame for allocating target bits in the frame layer more accurately. The content complexity quotiety is the combination of the average difference of gray histogram and mean absolute difference (MAD) ratio in the frame. Experimental results show that the bit rate maximum error of tested sequences in this algorithm is 1.38 percent and their average peak signal noise ratio (PSNR) is improved by 0.38 dB on average compared to the original JVT-G012 algorithm.

Many machine learning algorithms to detect AD have been trained using limited training data, meaning they often generalize poorly when applied to scans from previously unseen populations. Here we aimed to build a practical brain imaging-based AD diagnostic classifier using deep learning/transfer learning on dataset of unprecedented size and diversity. We pooled MRI data from more than 217 sites/scanners to constitute the largest brain MRI sample to date (85,721 scans from 50,876 participants). Next, we applied a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network, Inception-ResNet-V2, to build a sex classifier with high generalization capability. The sex classifier achieved 94.9% accuracy and served as a base model in transfer learning for the objective diagnosis of AD.

The effects of potential, electrolyte concentration, reactant concentration, and temperature on catalytic performance and Faradaic efficiency were systematically explored. The high conversion of LA (93%) and excellent \u201capparent\u201d selectivity to valeric acid (VA)(94%) with a Faradaic efficiency of 46% can be achieved over a metallic lead electrode in 0.5 MH 2 SO 4 electrolyte containing 0.2 M LA at an applied voltage of\u2212 1.8 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) for 4 h.

{"title": "Thermal-induced blister cracking behavior of annealed sandwich-structured TiN/CrAlN films\n", "abstract": " Sandwich-structured TiN/CrAlN films were rationally designed using metallic Ti and Al-Cr alloy targets by RF-pulsed magnetron sputtering. After obtained films were annealed at diverse temperatures at atmospheric pressure for 1\u00a0h, the hardness reveals an apparent decrease evolution from 29.2 to 15.7\u00a0GPa and H/E* ratio declines below 0.1 with increasing annealing temperature. Meanwhile, the grain size gradually becomes larger from 16.3 to 130.0\u00a0nm with increasing annealing temperature. Interestingly, it is observed that cracking behavior of sandwich-structured composite TiN/CrAlN films at elevated temperature is originated from the top of the blisters where main component is alumina on the surface, in virtue of intrinsically induced stress during oxidation, thermal expansion mismatch and phase transformation of the oxide layer. No cracks, nevertheless, are yielded in the film between any two blisters. Herein\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1393"]}

Structural response of the blade section during the loading process is investigated numerically. It is found that delamination and fracture of the spar cap are two critical failure modes responsible for the root causes of the blade collapse.

{"title": "PMHT approach for multi-target multi-sensor sonar tracking in clutter\n", "abstract": " Multi-sensor sonar tracking has many advantages, such as the potential to reduce the overall measurement uncertainty and the possibility to hide the receiver. However, the use of multi-target multi-sensor sonar tracking is challenging because of the complexity of the underwater environment, especially the low target detection probability and extremely large number of false alarms caused by reverberation. In this work, to solve the problem of multi-target multi-sensor sonar tracking in the presence of clutter, a novel probabilistic multi-hypothesis tracker (PMHT) approach based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is proposed. The PMHT can efficiently handle the unknown measurements-to-targets and measurements-to-transmitters data association ambiguity. The EKF and UKF are used to deal with the high degree of nonlinearity in the measurement model. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can improve the target tracking performance in a cluttered environment greatly, and its computational load is low.

In fission yeast, the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway is critical for the targeting of histone methyltransferase Clr4 to pericentric repeats to establish heterochromatin. However, pericentric heterochromatin cannot be properly inherited in the absence of RNAi, suggesting the existence of mechanisms that counteract chromatin structure inheritance. Here, we show that mutations of components of the INO80 chromatin-remodeling complex allow pericentric heterochromatin inheritance in RNAi mutants.

In this paper, we work on new task allocation schemes for mobile crowdsourcing in Opportunistic Mobile Social Networks (OMSNs) which are formed opportunistically when people gather together. Our goal is to distribute the tasks to the minimum number of users using the minimum number of forwarders quickly. Our task allocation problem is related to the set cover problem which is NP-hard. To solve it, we put forward a heuristic opportunistic task allocation approximation (OTAA) algorithm where we use a consumer control criterion to reduce the number of consumers and a forwarder control criterion to select the best forwarder.

{"title": "Mode separation for multimodal ultrasonic Lamb waves using dispersion compensation and independent component analysis of forth-order cumulant\n", "abstract": " Ultrasonic Lamb wave testing has been successfully applied in nondestructive testing. However, because of Lamb wave multimodal and dispersion characteristics, the received signals are often multimodal and overlapping, which makes them very complicated. This paper proposes a mode separation method by combining dispersion compensation with the independent component analysis of fourth-order cumulant. Taking two-mode overlapped signals as an example, the single-mode dispersion compensation is performed according to the measured distance difference between the two sets of signals. The two sets of signals are returned to the same distance. The fourth-order cumulant independent component analysis method is further used to process the Lamb wave signals of different superposition situations at the same distance. The corresponding mode signal contained in the two sets of signals is separated through the joint diagonalization of the whitened fourth-order cumulant matrix. The different modes are compensated and separated successively, achieving the multimodal signal separation. Experimental results in steel plates show that the presented method can accurately achieve mode separation for the multimodal overlapping Lamb waves. This is helpful for the signal processing of multimodal Lamb waves. View Full-Text", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1393"]}

The objective biomarkers of ASD are urgently awaited to be developed using neuroimaging method including resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI). However, the majority of current R-fMRI studies only examined the static features of brain activity in ASD patients, but neglected the dynamic aspects especially for regional metrics. Furthermore, the concordance of the dynamic regional indices was reported imbedded in human intrinsic brain activity, while its abnormality in ASD is largely unknown. In order to shed light on the abnormity of ASD from dynamic perspective, we analyzed R-fMRI data of 480 ASD male patients and 539 healthy male controls (HC) gathered from ASD public database (ABIDE I/ABIDE II). We used sliding window method to calculate the dynamics of mainstream regional indices of R-fMRI (amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF), fractional ALFF (fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC), degree centrality (DC) and the correlation with global signal (GSCorr)) and generated the SD statistic maps of these six dynamic regional indices. We performed z-standardization and smoothing on the SD statistic maps. After that, two-sample t-test between the SD statistic maps of ASD group and HC group was performed.

Nutritional changes induced fast alterations in PLIN2 mRNA and protein levels in fat body and midgut of the feeding larvae. The relationship observed between PLIN2 expression and TG synthesis in both larval fat body and midgut suggests that PLIN2 is needed when tissues are accumulating TG.

A revisable threshold is developed and is used to select the passes of each code block during Tier-1 encoding. Only the selected passes are encoded during Tier-1 and Tier-2 encoding. This routine avoids the encoding of all code passes and improves the coding efficiency. The experimental results based on standard test images show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the Tier- 1 coding time by up to 86.36% and the working memory by up to 95.50% at a bit rate of 0.125 bpp\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1393"]}

Data routing in such heterogeneous wireless sensor networks (HWSNs) poses challenges. First, the heterogeneous features create asymmetric links in the communication graphs which are not dealt with by conventional routing algorithms using undirected graphs. Second, it is important to provide an assured delivery rate for mission critical applications since sensors communicate with each other through lossy asymmetric links. In this paper, we propose LayHet: a layer-based routing protocol for HWSNs, which takes advantage of the asymmetric links to deliver messages to the sink with an assured delivery rate.

They are widely used as genetic markers, and are insertion/deletion mutation hotspots, which directly influence genome evolution. However, little is known about such important genomic components in ciliated protists, a large group of unicellular eukaryotes with extremely long evolutionary history and genome diversity. With recent publications of multiple ciliate genomes, we start to get a chance to explore perfect SSRs with motif size 1\u2013100 bp and at least three motif repeats in nine species of two ciliate classes, Oligohymenophorea and Spirotrichea. We found that homopolymers are the most prevalent SSRs in these A/T-rich species, with AAA (lysine, charged amino acid; also seen as an SSR with one-adenine motif repeated three times) being the codons repeated at the highest frequencies in coding SSR regions, consistent with the widespread alveolin proteins rich in lysine repeats as found in Tetrahymena. Micronuclear SSRs are universally more abundant than the macronuclear ones of the same motif-size, except for the 8-bp-motif SSRs in extensively fragmented chromosomes. Both the abundance and A/T content of SSRs decrease as motif-size increases, while the abundance is positively correlated with the A/T content of the genome. Also, smaller genomes have lower proportions of coding SSRs out of all SSRs in Paramecium species.

All catalysts selectively cleaved the C\u2013O bond and thus effectively transformed DBF to biphenyl (BP) at relatively moderate conditions. A strong promotional effect in the catalytic activity was observed over the Co/MoO3 catalyst with the optimal Co content of 3 wt %, as evidenced by the decreasing activation barrier which was resulted from Co-facilitated increase of active Mo species and acidic sites. The best catalytic activity was realized with almost 100% yield of BP over Co/MoO3. During 300 h of catalyst life test, the MoO3 and Co/MoO3 catalysts underwent a gradual deactivation because of the over-reduction of Mo species and carbon deposition as evidenced by the characterization of X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman, thermogravimetric analysis\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1393"]}

This study is focused on a repair technique using carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) sheet, especially, CFRP sheet bonding in the underwater environment. Underwater bonding of CFRP sheets is not yet a matured technique, and its repair performance for corroded steel structures is not fully understood. One of the issues is the effect of bond defects on the repair performance. Air bubbles are often found to be trapped in the adhesive layer. To examine an effect of bond defects on the repair performance, uniaxial loading tests are performed on thickness-reduced steel plates with CFRP strand sheets bonded by using underwater epoxy as adhesive. In total, sixteen CFRP strand sheet bonded steel plates are prepared, where test parameters are loading directions of tension and compression and the location of bond defects. The effect of bond defects on the repaired performance is examined in terms of yield strength, initial stiffness, and failure mode. As a result of experiment, it is found that two types of defects considered in this study do not affect repair performance significantly. However, when a CFRP bonded steel plate is under compression, buckling of CFRP strand sheet may control its compression strength, resulting in a smaller strength than the tensile strength.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1393"]}

In this work, we develop a deep learning based automated damage suggestion system for subsequent analysis of drone inspection images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach could achieve almost human level precision in terms of suggested damage location and types on wind turbine blades. We further demonstrate that for relatively small training sets advanced data augmentation during deep learning training can better generalise the trained model providing a significant gain in precision.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1393"]}

Functional brain network studies in MDD have suffered from limited statistical power and high flexibility in data analyses. Here we launched the REST-meta-MDD Project of resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI) data of 1,300 patients with MDD and 1,128 normal controls (NCs) from 25 research groups in China. The data were preprocessed with a standardized protocol across all sites prior to aggregated group analyses. Our analyses focused on functional connectivity (FC) within the default mode network (DMN) which has been frequently reported to show increased FC in MDD. However, we found decreased instead of increased DMN FC in MDD compared to NCs. Specifically, this FC reduction only presented in recurrent MDD but not in first-episode drug na\u00efve MDD. Patients with recurrent MDD even demonstrated decreases of DMN FC when directly compared with the first-episode drug na\u00efve MDD. Decreased DMN FC was associated with medication usage in MDD but not illness duration or severity. Finally, exploratory analyses revealed alterations of local intrinsic activity in the MDD samples. The pooled R-fMRI metrics of the REST-meta-MDD Project provide an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the key neural underpinnings of MDD and call for longitudinal brain imaging studies to understand the effects of medications, illness duration and severity.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1393"]}

Then, to reduce the prohibitive computational time required in the traditional Monte-Carlo method, we propose, instead of using the original complicated power-system model, to rely on a polynomial-chaos-based\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1393"]}

{"title": "Generating private data with user customization\n", "abstract": " Personal devices such as mobile phones can produce and store large amounts of data that can enhance machine learning models; however, this data may contain private information specific to the data owner that prevents the release of the data. We want to reduce the correlation between user-specific private information and the data while retaining the useful information. Rather than training a large model to achieve privatization from end to end, we first decouple the creation of a latent representation, and then privatize the data that allows user-specific privatization to occur in a setting with limited computation and minimal disturbance on the utility of the data. We leverage a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to create a compact latent representation of the data that remains fixed for all devices and all possible private labels. We then train a small generative filter to perturb the latent representation based on user specified preferences regarding the private and utility information. The small filter is trained via a GAN-type robust optimization that can take place on a distributed device such as a phone or tablet. Under special conditions of our linear filter, we disclose the connections between our generative approach and renyi differential privacy. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets including MNIST, UCI-Adult, and CelebA, and give a thorough evaluation including visualizing the geometry of the latent embeddings and estimating the empirical mutual information to show the effectiveness of our approach.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1393"]}

Recent research has shown that myostatin might play an essential role in bone metabolism. In RAW264.7 cells and bone marrow monocytes (BMMCs), myostatin activates the expression of the II type receptor ActR II B. Here, we report that myostatin significantly promoted RANKL/M-CSF-induced osteoclastogenesis and activated NF-\u03baB and MAPK pathways in vitro via the Ccdc50 gene. Overexpression of myostatin promoted osteoclastogenesis and osteoclastogenesis-related markers including c-Src, MMP9, CTR, CK, and NFATc1. Specifically, myostatin increased the phosphorylation of Smad2, which led to the activation of NF-\u03baB and MAPK pathways to activate osteoclastogenesis. Ccdc50 was identified as a gene whose expression was highly decreased in osteoclastogenesis upon myostatin treatment, and it could inhibit the function of myostatin in osteoclastogenesis by blocking NF-\u03baB and MAPKs pathways. Our study indicates that myostatin is a promising candidate target for inhibiting RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis and might participate in therapy for osteoporosis, and that the Ccdc50 gene plays a significant role in the regulatory process.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1393"]}

The engineering simulation process toward the commercial production of bio-gasoline from lignocellulosic biomass using SuperPro Designer\u00ae was modeled. The compatibility of the end products with the current gasoline specifications was evaluated and various blending options were investigated to meet the octane number and Reid vapor pressure requirement of the product.

Mani\u00e0, we consider the uniform K\u00e4hler bundle (UKB) description of some C*-algebraic subjects. In particular, we obtain a one-to-one correspondence between closed ideals of a C*-algebra                                      and full uniform K\u00e4hler subbundles over open subsets of the base space of the UKB associated with                                     . In addition, we present a geometric description of the pure state space of hereditary C*-subalgebras and show that if                                      is a hereditary C*-subalgebra of                                     , the UKB of                                      is a kind of K\u00e4hler subbundle of the UKB of                                     . As a simple example, we consider hereditary C*-subalgebras of the C*-algebra of compact operators on a Hilbert space.

{"title": "Time Delay Estimation by Bispectrum Interpolation\n", "abstract": " Time delay is an important parameter for the characterization of signal propagation of sensors. In order to improve the precision of time delay estimation, this article proposes an algorithm based on bispectrum interpolation. The algorithm first calculates the characteristic spectrum function on the basis of the bispectrum of the two signals. The frequency domain interpolation is done on the characteristic spectrum function. By conducting the inverse Fourier transform and the maxima seeking method, the calculation formula for the time delay of the two signals is deduced. The simulation test results show that compared with the bispectrum-based time delay estimation method, the bispectrum interpolation-based time delay estimation method has improved greatly in terms of the estimation precision and temporal resolution. The algorithm has the advantages of high precision, small error and strong ability to suppress the correlative Gaussian noise.

It provided freedom to select one\u2019s mental or physical activities. Contrast to the negative emotional experience of loneliness, solitude was a constructed state and was open to all emotional experiences. Self-reported scales and Experience Sampling Methods (ESM) were used to measured solitude. Research revealed, as the age increased, individual spent more time on solitude and had more positive attitude toward it. Evidences showed that solitude had positive effects on individuals\u2019 mental health, creativity and enhanced self-integration. In the future, the structure of solitude required more research. Research should also pay attention to the developmental mechanism of solitude and cultural differences. The neural mechanism of solitude would be an important and valuable researching domain in the future.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1393"]}

{"title": "Experimental study on CFRP-bonded steel plates with thickness reduction using underwater epoxy\n", "abstract": " This paper presents a series of uniaxial loading tests on the thickness-reduced steel plates bonded with carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) strand sheets using underwater epoxy as adhesive. Four sets of material test are carried out on epoxy coupons at different curing times. Repaired performance of CFRP-bonded steel plates is investigated in terms of initial stiffness, yield strength, and failure mode of the specimens. Test results showed that the structural performance of CFRP-bonded steel plates does not reach the expected design level due to a slow curing process of epoxy adhesive in this study. The curing effects of epoxy adhesive on the repaired performance are discussed.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1393"]}
{"title": "Advance in Scence Change-Based H. 264 Rate Control Methods\n", "abstract": " Scene change occurs frequently in the video, which has an important impact on the video quality. The JVT-G012 rate control algorithm for H.264/AVC uses fixed-length group of picture structure, which can not effectively deal with the video sequence scene change, resulting in the quality decline of frames after scene change. We reviewed the scene change-based H.264 rate control methods in this paper. They are classified into two categories-scene change detection-based rate control method and scene adaptive rate control method. A comparative study of the interaction and discussion about the various algorithms and their advantages and disadvantages are presented. Based on these research results, some improvedment are discussed.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1393"]}
{"title": "An improved frame layer rate control algorithm for H. 264\n", "abstract": " Rate control is an important part of video coding. This paper presents an improved frame layer rate control algorithm by using the combined frame complexity and the adjusted quantization parameter (QP). The combined frame complexity can be used to more reasonable implement bit allocation for each frame, and the quantization parameter adjusted by the encoded frame information also can get more accurate rate control. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm, in comparison to the original algorithm, reduces the act bit rate error of video sequences and gets a better average PSNR with smaller deviation.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1393"]}

{"title": "Experimental study on strength and ductility of underwater fillet welds in repairing offshore steel structures\n", "abstract": " Underwater wet welding is one of the most common repair measures for corroded offshore steel structures. Few studies have been carried out systematically concerned with mechanical properties of such welds, thus current design provisions rely heavily on limited experimental data on welds made underwater and design properties for corresponding welds made in air. This paper presents a series of experiments on forty-five fillet welded specimens featuring welding both in air and underwater. Weld strength and ductility of fillet welds are examined through strength tests, which are also complemented by Vickers hardness tests and microstructure examination to better understand the weld details. The tested parameters include two welding environments, two weld orientations, two base structural types, and four base steels. Based on the tests, differences between underwater and in-air fillet welds are examined in terms of strength, ductility, and failure modes, underwater weldability of base steels is also evaluated.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1393"]}
