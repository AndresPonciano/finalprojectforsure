{"title": "Supporting collaborative development using process models: An integration-focused approach\n", "abstract": " Software engineering projects are highly collaborative. Existing tools designed to support collaboration usually provide some specific service, and integration with other tools using data and events. However, Process-Centered Software Engineering Environments have traditionally been designed with different assumptions. The process is usually considered as the central aspect of the software project, and used as a center of control. As a result, great emphasis has been placed on the ability of PSEEs to invoke other tools, or use data generated by other tools. However, the integration in the other direction, that is, the ability of other tools to query the data managed by PSEEs (the process model), and hook into their extensions points, has been largely ignored, as it is not compatible with the vision of the PSEE as the central orchestrator of project support tools. We argue that this view has hindered the widespread\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["406"]}
{"title": "Supporting collaborative development using process models: a tooled integration\u2010focused approach\n", "abstract": " Collaboration in software engineering projects is usually intensive and requires adequate support by well\u2010integrated tools. However, process\u2010centered software engineering environments (PSEE) have traditionally been designed to exploit integration facilities in other tools, while offering themselves little to no such facilities. This is in line with the vision of the PSEE as the central orchestrator of project support tools. We argue that this view has hindered the widespread adoption of process\u2010based collaboration support tools by incurring too much adoption and switching costs. We propose a new process\u2010based collaboration support architecture, backed by a process metamodel, that can easily be integrated with existing tools. The proposed architecture revolves around the central concepts of \u2018deep links\u2019 and \u2018hooks\u2019. Our approach is validated by analyzing a collection of open\u2010source projects, and integration utilities\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["406"]}
{"title": "Modeling ad-hoc collaboration for automated process support\n", "abstract": " Understanding and supporting collaboration is a major concern in any collective endeavor. In software engineering, planning collaboration is difficult and often occurs rather ad-hoc. However, many proposals for the description and support of collaboration assume necessary information is readily available and already integrated in process models. We believe practitioners should be given the ability to represent their evolving understanding about collaboration and should be supported by tools using such representation. We developed an extension to the Software & System Process Engineering Meta-Model (SPEM), which introduces concepts needed to represent precise and dynamic ad-hoc collaboration setups. We also describe tool support and present a proof-of-concept based on a fictitious but realistic application example.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["406"]}
{"title": "Towards a tool-supported approach for collaborative process modeling and enactment\n", "abstract": " In software engineering, as in any collective endeavor, understanding and supporting collaboration is a major concern. Unfortunately, the main concepts of popular process formalisms are not always adequate to describe collaboration. We extend the Software & System Process Engineering Meta-Model (SPEM) by introducing concepts needed to represent precise and dynamic collaboration setups that practitioners create to address ever-changing challenges. Our goal is to give practitioners the ability to express evolving understanding about collaboration in a formalism suited for easy representation and tool-provided assistance. Our work is based on a collaborative process metamodel we have developed. In this paper, we first present a meta-process for process modeling and enactment, which we apply to our collaborative process metamodel. Then we describe the implementation of a suitable process model\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["406"]}

Les probl\u00e9matiques habituelles de collaboration (organisation des t\u00e2ches, utilisation des ressources, communication, etc.) y sont exacerb\u00e9es par le rythme rapide des changements, la complexit\u00e9 et la grande interd\u00e9pendance des art\u00e9facts, le volume toujours croissant d\u2019informations de contexte \u00e0 traiter, la distribution g\u00e9ographique des participants, etc. Par cons\u00e9quent, la question du support outill\u00e9 de la collaboration se pose plus fortement que jamais en ing\u00e9nierie logicielle. Dans cette th\u00e8se, nous abordons la question de la collaboration sous l\u2019angle de la mod\u00e9lisation et de l\u2019exploitation des processus de d\u00e9veloppement. Ces derniers sont traditionnellement consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme une structure impos\u00e9e sur le d\u00e9veloppement d\u2019un produit logiciel. Cependant, une part importante de la collaboration en g\u00e9nie logiciel est de nature ad hoc, faite d\u2019activit\u00e9s non planifi\u00e9es. Afin de faire contribuer les processus logiciels au support de la collaboration, en particulier celle non planifi\u00e9e, nous nous int\u00e9ressons \u00e0 leur fonction de banques d\u2019information sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments cl\u00e9s de cette collaboration et les interactions entre ces derniers. Notre contribution est, d\u2019une part, un mod\u00e8le conceptuel du support au d\u00e9veloppement collaboratif, capable de rendre compte de la structure d\u2019outils classiques comme ceux de gestion de versions ou de gestion de d\u00e9fauts logiciels. Ce mod\u00e8le conceptuel est ensuite appliqu\u00e9 aux mod\u00e8les de processus logiciels.
