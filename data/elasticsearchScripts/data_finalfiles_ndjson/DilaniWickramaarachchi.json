{"title": "A method for work distribution in global software development\n", "abstract": " Global Software Development (GSD) has recently evolved and has been embraced by the competitive software industry today. The major attraction of GSD is due to the greater availability of human resources in distributed zones at a low cost and advances in communication technology. However, recent research reveals that expected benefits of GSD are not always realized as predicted since additional costs are often involved for the communication and coordination activities between the dispersed groups. Therefore, the main challenge of GSD today is to minimize the additional costs and maximize the benefits. A proper work distribution mechanism is particularly important to reduce the additional challenges facing GSD. In this paper, we present a method for work distribution to multiple locations. It starts with the identification of work as stages/phases in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and grouping\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["1562"]}
{"title": "Cultural comparison in Asian countries: an application of Greet Hofstede\u2019s cultural dimensions\n", "abstract": " Countries differ from one country to another country by their identical characteristics which are coming under their own national culture. People behaviors are respectively linked to cultural values of the country and this association is based on the framework of Hofstede\u2019s cultural dimensions. The study indicates the cultural differences of the countries among the world according to a four dimension which are Power distance, Uncertainty avoidance, Individualism vs. collectivism and Masculinity vs. femininity. Power distance means the extent to the nations which accept the power in organization or anywhere is distributed unequally without further justifications. The extent to which the members of a culture feel threatened by ambiguous or unknown situations and have created beliefs and institutions that try to avoid these is reflected by the Uncertainty avoidance. The third dimension is Individualism vs. collectivism which reflect the degree of interdependence a society maintains among its members, and the fourth dimension, Masculinity vs. femininity indicates that the society will be driven by competition, achievement and success, with success being defined by the winner / best in field \u2013 a value system that starts in school and continues throughout organizational behavior. The purpose of this study is comparing the national culture in Asian countries and identifies what factors affect to association with the Hofstede\u2019s cultural dimension studies. In this study we identify the how above four dimensions index behave on Asia. The power index of almost all the countries in Asia take high value that means all the nations in Asia has been tend to accept the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["1562"]}
{"title": "Effort estimation in global software development-a systematic review\n", "abstract": " Global Software Development (GSD) is becoming increasingly prevalent, with software development teams being distributed around the world and working in collaboration with partner companies despite geographic and time differences. The main advantage of GSD which makes it attractive is the greater availability of human resources at lower costs. However, there are several disadvantages which are caused by the distance which separates the development teams. Coordination and communication become more difficult when the software development teams are located in different places, resulting in hidden costs involved in this process. As such, the effort estimation models used for collocated software development are inadequate for estimation in GSD. Thus, effort estimation in GSD is becoming an important area of research. Many researchers have focused on effort estimation in GSD over the last decade. This paper presents the findings of a systematic review of the related literature by summarizing the hidden costs in GSD, and discussing the open research issues in effort estimation in GSD.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1562"]}
{"title": "Software modularization in global software development\n", "abstract": " In a Global Software Development (GSD) environment, multiple teams are located in geographically dispersed locations and project management is becoming a difficult task; and the work distribution process has become an important function in GSD. Work distribution process can influence both the benefits of global software development (e.g. cost reduction, availability of people, proximity to the customer) and its risks (e.g. communication and coordination overhead). Therefore, work should be distributed after a thorough study on the different tasks and the various locations. To do this, the categorization of work should be undertaken before it is distributed. This is known as modularization which can help overcome communication and coordination problems in the development process and makes the process more stable. In this paper, we present a survey on software modularization which includes principles of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1562"]}
{"title": "Software usability improvements for Generation Z oriented software application\n", "abstract": " User Experience (UX) which focuses on having a deep understanding of users, what they need, their abilities, and their limitations is one of the most important consideration when developing software applications today. Developing sustainable software application is the aim of any software company. To achieve this, software usability should be improved in the software as one of the main nonfunctional requirements. Sustainability of software usability is determined by user experience. Main users of software applications are people who belong to the workforce since they are working in the complex nature of the businesses and with time limitations. Generation Z is the new addition to the workforce and it will be increasing in the future. Therefore, it is important to pay extra attention to increase usability of software for Generation Z who have been exposed to digital technology from an early age. Accordingly, a survey\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1562"]}
{"title": "A Method for Modularization in Unified Modeling Language Specification for Global Software Development\n", "abstract": " Global Software Development (GSD) is becoming a norm in the software industry and implementing effective strategies for organizing it has become critical [1]. In spite of the growing attention paid to GSD, there is a limited understanding of how to make GSD a success and why it fails [2]. Therefore, the challenge is to minimize the threats in order to increase the likelihood of high profits. Very often, large software projects are developed by multiple teams to meet deadlines and deliver the product on time [3]. In a GSD environment, multiple teams are located in geographically dispersed locations and the work distribution process has become an important function in GSD. The work distribution process can influence both the benefits of global software development (eg cost reduction, availability of people, proximity to the customer) and its risks (eg inexperienced workforce, communication overhead)[4].
