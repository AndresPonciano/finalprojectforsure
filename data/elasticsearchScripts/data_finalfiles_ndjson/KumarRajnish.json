{"title": "Silver ion release from antimicrobial polyamide/silver composites\n", "abstract": " Silver ion (Ag+) the versatile antimicrobial species was released in a steady and prolonged manner from a silver-filled polyamide composite system. Metallic silver powder having varying specific surface area (SSA) has been used as a resource of biocide in polyamide. Strong evidences are found showing the release of the antimicrobial species from the resulting composite upon soaking it in water due to the interaction of the diffused water molecules with the dispersed silver powder within the matrix. The Ag+ release was observed as increasing with time and concentration of the silver powder and is found to be influenced by the SSA of the silver powder, changes in the physical state of the composite specimen as a result of the water diffusion and the composite morphology. It is observed that the Ag+ release increases initially which is followed by a marginal increase between day 4 and 6.

{"title": "Multi-instance multi-label learning\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we propose the MIML (Multi-Instance Multi-Label learning) framework where an example is described by multiple instances and associated with multiple class labels. Compared to traditional learning frameworks, the MIML framework is more convenient and natural for representing complicated objects which have multiple semantic meanings. To learn from MIML examples, we propose the MimlBoost and MimlSvm algorithms based on a simple degeneration strategy, and experiments show that solving problems involving complicated objects with multiple semantic meanings in the MIML framework can lead to good performance. Considering that the degeneration process may lose information, we propose the D-MimlSvm algorithm which tackles MIML problems directly in a regularization framework. Moreover, we show that even when we do not have access to the real objects and thus cannot capture\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "428\n", "authors": ["1205"]}

{"title": "A probabilistic seismic hazard map of India and adjoining regions\n", "abstract": " This paper presents the results of an exercise carried out under GSHAP, over India and adjoining regions bound by 0\u00b0N-40\u00b0N and 65\u00b0E-100\u00b0E. A working catalogue of main shocks was prepared by merging the local catalogues with the NOAA catalogue, and removing duplicates, aftershocks and earthquakes without any magnitude. Eighty six potential seismic source zones were delineated based on the major tectonic features and seismicity trends. Using the probabilistic hazard assessment approach of McGuire, adopted by GSHAP, the Peak Ground Accelerations (PGA) were computed for 10% probability of exceedance in 50 years, at locations defined by a grid of 0.5\u00b0 x 0.5\u00b0. Since no reliable estimates of attenuation values are available for the Indian region, the attenuation relation of Joyner and Boore (1981) was used. The PGA values over the grid points were contoured to obtain a seismic hazard map. The hazard map depicts that a majority of the Northern Indian plate boundary region and the Tibetan plateau region have hazard level of the order of 0.25 g with prominent highs of the order of 0.35-0.4 g in the seismically more active zones like the Burmese arc, Northeastern India and Hindukush region. In the Indian shield, the regional seismic hazard, covering a major area, is of the order of 0.05-0.1 g whereas some areas like Koyna depict hazard to the level of 0.2 g. The present map can be converted into a conventional seismic zoning map having four zones with zone factors of 0.1 g, 0.2 g, 0.3 g and 0.4 g respectively.", "num_citations": "248\n", "authors": ["1205"]}

Anode stripping voltammetry (ASV) was used for the quantitative estimation of Ag+ release from these composites. The biocidal (Ag+) release from the composites was found to be dependent on the time of soaking in water and the nature of the filler. The long\u2010term Ag+ release capability of the elementary silver\u2010based PA/Ag composite is promising compared with the commercial counterparts. The silver ion release potential of polyamide composites where the silver filling was performed by using supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) is also discussed.

{"title": "Ankle arthrodesis for failed total ankle replacement\n", "abstract": " Between 1999 and 2005, 23 failed total ankle replacements were converted to arthrodeses. Three surgical techniques were used: tibiotalar arthrodesis with screw fixation, tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis with screw fixation, and tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis with an intramedullary nail. As experience was gained, the benefits and problems became apparent. Successful bony union was seen in 17 of the 23 ankles. The complication rate was higher in ankles where the loosening had caused extensive destruction of the body of the talus, usually in rheumatoid arthritis. In this situation we recommend tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis with an intramedullary nail. This technique can also be used when there is severe arthritic change in the subtalar joint. Arthrodesis of the tibiotalar joint alone using compression screws was generally possible in osteoarthritis because the destruction of the body of the talus was less extensive\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "166\n", "authors": ["1205"]}

Partitioning of dry matter should be particularly important in such drought-prone environments, where dry matter production may be restricted. With late-season drought, an enhanced capacity to allocate dry matter to grain under water-deficit conditions should be advantageous. Field studies on dry matter partitioning under drought were conducted at eight locations in Chattisgarh, India, between 1995 and 1998, using five diverse rice cultivars. Dry matter accumulation at flowering and maturity was significantly reduced in drought-affected sites. Variation was observed among cultivars in dry matter partitioning to grain under both favorable and water-stressed conditions.

On exposure to local microenvironments, recruited macrophages can be polarized into either classically activated (or M1) or alternatively activated (or M2) phenotypes. Macrophage polarization has been heavily associated with development of asthma. The process of regulation of macrophage polarization involves an intricate interplay between various cytokines, chemokines, transcriptional factors, and immune-regulatory cells. Different signals from the microenvironment are controlled by different receptors on the macrophages to initiate various macrophage polarization pathways.

The worn surfaces were also examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The study showed differing trends with load for the two types of fillers. At low loads, the oxide-filled had lower wear, while at high loads the rubber-filled composite had lower wear. The work also showed that higher loads and sliding velocities bring about changes in worn surface features such as interface separation, inclined fracture of fibres, loss of matrix as well as the appearance of debris with the two different fillers.", "num_citations": "125\n", "authors": ["1205"]}
