The recent formulation of MCI follows previous attempts to characterize cognitive decline associated with aging, including benign senescent forgetfulness, age-associated memory impairment and age-associated cognitive decline [2, 3]. Therefore, this new concept is perhaps best considered as a stage in the difficult process of understanding and characterizing mild defects in cognition that do not fit clearly within the scope of established neurological and psychiatric disorders. This does not mean that someone with MCI will inevitably get Alzheimer's in their lifetime, but their likelihood of doing so is substantially increased [4]. MCI has now been categorized into two sub-types: those with the amnesic subtype (MCI-A) have memory impairments only, while those with the multiple cognitive domain subtype (MCI-MCD) have other types of mild impairments, such as in judgment or language, and mild or no memory loss. Both subtypes progress to Alzheimer's disease at the same rate, but they do have different pathologies in the brain [5]. MCI has been suggested as a term for a boundary area between normal aging and dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease.

Gaseous NH3 and particulate NH4+ concentrations were measured during pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons of the years 2010 and 2011. Average concentrations of gaseous NH3 during pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons were recorded as 26.4, 33.2 and 32.5 \u03bcg m\u22123, respectively. Gaseous NH3 concentrations were the highest during monsoon, thought to be due to decay and decomposition of plants and other biogenic material under wet conditions, leading to increased NH3 emission. The results showed that particulate NH4+ was always lower than the gaseous NH3 during all the seasons. The concentrations of particulate NH4+ were recorded as 11.6, 22.9 and 8.5 \u03bcg m\u22123 during pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons, respectively. The percent fraction of particulate NH4+ was noticed to be highest during the monsoon season, which is attributed to increased humidity levels favouring partitioning into the aerosol phase. On an average, 33.3% of total N-NHx was present as particulate NH4+. Higher concentrations of NH3 noticed during night time may be due to stable atmospheric conditions.

So while searching for other parameters, iron deficiency was found to be a new parameter of interest in the aetiology of gall stones. Aims: The study was aimed at establishing the role of iron deficiency in the supersaturation of bile with cholesterol and thus formation of gallstones. Setting and Design: 50 patients suffering from Cholelithiasis were divided into two groups. Group A consisted of patients with normal serum iron levels (non-anaemic) and group B, of patients with less than normal serum iron (anaemic). Serum cholesterol and gall bladder bile cholesterol of both the groups were studied and compared. Materials and Methods: 50 patients of Cholelithiasis, confirmed by Ultrasonography (USG) were divided into anaemic and non-anaemic groups, based on serum iron levels. Serum cholesterol and gall bladder bile cholesterol of both the groups were estimated. Statistical Analysis Used: Students\u2019t-test. The p-value< 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Total serum cholesterol was not different in gall stone formers from that of the general population.

Unlike WLANs, Mesh networks are selfconfiguring systems where each Access Point (AP) can relay messages on behalf of others, thus increasing the range and available bandwidth. Despite recent advances in wireless mesh networking, many research challenges remain in all protocol layers. To use existing protocols in wireless mesh network we have to add more features in existing protocols so that they become suitable for use in wireless mesh network. In this paper, We present a detailed simulation study of the performance of the predominant mesh routing protocols being considered in IEEE 802.11 s: Ad Hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR). Moreover, for large-scale wireless mesh networks, we gracefully integrate advantages of OLSR and Fisheye routing protocol (FSR). Results show that OFLSR provides better scalability in terms of traffic load and host mobility than AODV in mesh networks.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["787"]}

{"title": "Potassium status of Indian soils: need for rethinking in research, recommendation and policy\n", "abstract": " Growing population and its need pressurize Indian agriculture to produce more from shrinking arable land. Balanced nutrition plays a key role in enhancing the productivity of crops and sustainability of production systems. Potassium is third most important plant nutrient. Recent studies showed declining status of K in majority of the soils in India. High crop K removal than K addition by farmers and imbalanced use of NPK fertilizers contributed to large-scale K mining and K deficiency in soils and crops. K fertility depletion observed in all soil types. Widespread K deficiency was identified in rice-wheat system of Indo-Gangetic plains, horticultural, plantation, ornamental, aromatic and avenue plants. The current fertilizer recommendations are obsolete, very much generalized without considering the soil types, hence need revision and revalidation. Site-specific fertilizer recommendations, if followed can minimize the fertility K depletion and maintain productivity and sustainability and also economize the fertilizer cost. Awareness on K use by farmers needs immediate action.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["787"]}

In the present investigation 16 (10.66%) of isolates of Salmonella spp. were found from 150 raw buffalo meat and offals viz. liver, lung, muscle, intestine and ground beef (30 each), collected from the retail meat market of Anand,(Gujarat) India. All the 16 isolates of Salmonella spp. were screened for the presence or absence of virulence associated genes by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All the Salmonella isolates were subjected to serotyping and all the isolates of Salmonella spp. revealed the presence of invA, stn and fimA genes. Fourteen (87.5%) of the isolates showed the presence of spvR gene and 8 (50%) had the spvC gene. Serotyping of Salmonella isolates revealed that Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium was the only detected serovar.

We use the quantum Langevin approach to study a hybrid optomechanical system that contains a single undoped semiconductor quantum well in a cavity, where one of its mirrors is a thin dielectric membrane having quadratic response to the cavity fields. A decorrelation method is employed to solve for a large number of coupled equations. Transient mean numbers of cavity photons, moving membranes, and excitons that provide dynamical behavior are computed. We obtain the two-boson second-order correlation functions for the cavity field and the membrane oscillator, and their cross correlations that provide nonclassical quantum statistical properties and useful insights into the quadratic optomechanical system.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["787"]}

Application of recommended dose of nitrogen through inorganic source recorded significantly higher mean grain yield of 2 245 kg/ha in comparison to application of recommended dose of nitrogen through compost and integration of inorganic and organic sources (50:50 basis). Conventional tillage was found to be superior for attaining higher grain yield of wheat (2 525 kg/ha) under rainfed conditions. However, when RT I was integrated with post-emergence herbicide-based weed control (RT II), significant improvement in yield (9.6%) was noticed and it was found to be at par with conventional tillage. The lowest CV (25.1%) and highest sustainable yield index (SYI) (0.61) recorded with RT II as against the CV of 27.9% and SYI of 0.54 under conventional tillage indicated its more reliability and optimum tillage for not only resource conservation but also for attaining higher productivity under rainfed conditions.

One approach is to increase plant photosynthetic capacity and transpiration ration (TR). Our objective was to measure the effects of ethephon and N on photosynthesis and related physiological traits of Indian mustard (Brassica juncea L. Czern and Coss, cv. Alankar). Field experiments were conducted in Aligarh, India under irrigated and non-irrigated conditions. Four levels of N (0 to 80 kg ha-1) and three levels of ethrel (0 to 200 \u00b5l l-1) were used. Ethrel and N nearly always had additive effects on LAI and plant dry matter (PDM) in both irrigated and non-irrigated experiments. Similarly, most gas exchange traits responded linearly to ethrel and N addition.

Small lead peaks appear in the peat record at dates corresponding to prehistoric and possibly the Roman and Dark Ages at Nantymwyn, but mining did not commence on a continuous basis until the 18th century AD. At Craig y Mwyn, lead pollution occurs during the Roman period and, hitherto, provides the best estimate for the start of mining at the site.

The images are thresholded and a skeleton of the pore space is obtained from the images. The skeleton is represented by means of a network of resistances. The total resistance of the network along the principal directions is now determined both in the in-plane (X, Y) as well as through the plane (Z) directions. The network resistance for structures at each section is determined. From this data, a correlation length for the network resistance is obtained. Correlation length data are used for determining the effect of heterogeneities on transport properties of paper structures. From this analysis, it is possible to analyze and simulate the moisture transport processes such as wicking and drying in paper, reproducing smaller-scale variations.

It is the main factor which significantly affects the pile capacity quantitatively and leads to establish a distinct trend of load inclination on pile capacity. To illustrate the significance of opted method, an experimental study was conducted on 20 mm diameter and 600 mm length piles under oblique pullout loads of different inclinations. Pile capacity at each load inclination has been evaluated from load\u2013displacement\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["787"]}
{"title": "Comparative expression profiling of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-5 in milk of Bos indicus and Bubalus bubalis during lactation\n", "abstract": " Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-5 (IGFBP-5) is a key molecule in mammary gland development, which facilitates the removal of mammary epithelial cells (MECs) by apoptosis that takes place during remodeling of the mammary gland during involution. IGFBP-5 binds with IGFs for their bioavailability. IGFBP-5 has been reported to perform pleiotropic roles such as cellular apoptosis, proliferation and differentiation. To understand the role of IGFBP-5 during lactation and clinical mastitis, expression profiling of IGFBP-5 at the protein level was performed in both indigenous cows (Bos indicus) and buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) belonging to two different breeds \u2013 Sahiwal cows and Murrah buffaloes. Reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) of IGFBP-5 mRNA confirmed its expression in milk somatic cells and MECs of Sahiwal cows.

Though toxic to human and animals its leaf juice has been indicated for application on fresh wounds. In the study Eupatorium odoratum methanolic extract (EOME) and crushed leaf extract (EOE) from fresh leaves were tested for antimicrobial activity against 893 strains belonging to more than 140 species of 40 genera. The EOME inhibited 31.9% and EOE inhibited only 5.36% strains. There was no significant (p> 0.05) correlation (r,-0.02) between antimicrobial activity of EOE and EOME. Instead, strong (p, 0.01) positive correlation (r, 0.245) was evident between sensitivity of strains to EOME and tetracycline. More of the Bacillus, Brucella and Burhkolderia spp. strains were sensitive to EOME than strains of other bacteria. Pasteurella multocida type B (p, 0.01) and Salmonella indica (p, 0.009) strains were more frequently sensitive to EOME than strains of other species of the respective genera. Among bacterial strains of different origin sensitivity to EOME ranged from 12.5% to 50.4%. Bacteria of food (Axone) origin (50.4%) were more frequently sensitive to EOME than reference strains (p, 0.002) and strains of pig (p< 0.001), cattle (p, 0.001), human (p, 0.009), horse (p, 0.049), wall lizard (p< 0.001), environment (p, 0.007) and zoo animal (p< 0.001) origin. There was no difference in sensitivity to EOME in strains isolated from biotic and abiotic environment (p, 0.11) irrespective of their G+ ve (p, 0.16) or G-ve (p, 0.42) trait.

This condition is milder than the well-known Lipschitz and H\u00f6lder continuity conditions. The importance of our work lies in the fact that numerical examples can be given to show that our approach is successful even in cases where the Lipschitz and the H\u00f6lder continuity conditions fail. The difficult computation of second Fr\u00ebchet derivative is also avoided by replacing it with the divided difference containing only the first Fr\u00ebchet derivatives. A number of recurrence relations based on two parameters are derived. A convergence theorem is established to estimate a priori error bounds along with the domains of existence and uniqueness of the solutions.

Weight loss in older adults is often associated with a loss of muscle mass and can ultimately impact their functional status. Malnutrition in older adults is associated with complications and premature death. The progression to malnutrition is often insidious and often undetected. The purpose of this study was to find out the nutritional status and the prevalence of malnutrition of 89 elderly inmates (age 60 and above) of both the sexes (Male= 47 and Female= 42) living in an Old age home in Urban Varanasi. The Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) scale was used to assess the nutritional status of these inmates. Data analysis was done by using Microsoft excel 2007. Chi square test was applied for statistical analysis. It was found out that 40.44 per cent inmates were malnourished and about 17.97 per cent were at risk of malnutrition. Neuro-psychological issues and psychological stress were not a major concern. Only 4-and 6 per cent inmates complained of such problems.

{"title": "A perfect balance of sparsity and acoustic hole in speech signal and its application in speaker recognition system\n", "abstract": " This paper addresses the issue of balancing the acoustic hole and sparsing the speech signal enrollment for training and testing in Automatic Speaker Recognition (ASR) system. Sparsing techniques involve the representation of a small number of coefficients that hold a large amount of the energy. Sparsity can play a major role in resolving the issue of dealing with big data in ASR by applying speech compression techniques and information storage in databases. Spectral domain compression of the speech signal using novel sparsing algorithms that balance the sparsity of speech signal with the acoustic hole is proposed. The speech signal is converted to a spectral domain using the Discrete Rajan Transform (DRT) and only first and mid-spectrum component in each block of size 8x1 retained forcing the remaining component to zero. The speech signal spectrum can be maximally compressed at 8: 1 ratio to the unique one with balancing acoustic hole and synthesized speech signal, which can be used in ASR systems. A balanced spectrally compressed speech signal can be stored in database as a speaker representative and during training and testing time it can be synthesized using the Inverse Discrete Rajan Transform (IDRT). Simulation results, shows acceptable speech signal spectral compression that balances sparsity and the generation of the acoustic hole is 75% with 94.8% efficiency without sparsification and 99.1% efficiency with TIMIT database respectively.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["787"]}

Several classes of bioactive substances have been isolated and identified from basidiocarp, mycelia and spores of G. lucidum, such as polysaccharides, triterpenoids, nucleosides, sterols, fatty acids, protein and alkaloids. One of the major pharmacological properties of G. lucidum is antitumor activity and polysaccharides (GLPS) are the main component responsible for this property. In this paper, the possible role of host tree species in determining the composition of polysaccharides (GLPS) was examined. To date, a careful comparison of polysaccharides (GLPS) from different host tree species has not been performed. Fruiting bodies were collected from nine host tree species from different regions of India and examined for their polysaccharide composition. These fruit bodies were analyzed and compared on the basis of Gas liquid chromatography (GLC). The result showed the fruit body from Dalbergia sissoo was most potential for GLPS production, as it was composed of all six tested monosaccharides, including rhamnose, arabinose, xylose, fructose, glucose and mannose.

To detect the presence of a fireball in an interaction, a target plot based on the space and azimuthal angles of the secondaries has been devised and employed in conjuction with the usual Duller-Walker plot. The parameters of these fireballs have been determined by using the latest method of AG Agnese and A. Wataghin. The average values of the mass, maximum decay temperature and the number of charged decay particles of the fireballs have been found to be (1.69+-0.4) Gev,(152+-6) MeV/c and (5.5+-0.3) respectively. The fireball mass is observed to be independent of the multiplicity of the event and the energy of the incident particle. The observed parameters of fireballs agree well with the recently proposed cluster models.(author)", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["787"]}

Experimental material comprised of fifty genotypes of barley. Studies on variability, heritability and genetic advance showed that biological yield per plant, grain weight per spike, number of productive tillers and grain yield per plant are having considerable importance to the breeders for selection. Correlation studies showed that positive and significant correlations were observed between biological yield/plant and plant height, number of tillers/plant and days to maturity, grains/spike and number of tillers plant plant, main spike length and plant height, harvest index between number of tillers per plant and number of spike per plant. Path coefficient analysis suggested that biological yield per plant is showing positive and significant overall effects on grain yield per plant. So emphasis could be given on these characters during selection for varietal improvement programme. After D2 analysis fifty genotypes were grouped into eight clusters. Cluster I had highest genotypes (11). The genotypes falling in Cluster I had the maximum divergence. The maximum and minimum divergence was found between cluster I and VIII, Cluster V and II, cluster III and cluster VI and cluster IV and cluster VII respectively. Cluster I and V are exhibiting high mean for most of the characters. For varietal improvement, the hybridization among genotypes falling in clusters III and IV should be done as they are the most divergent clusters.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["787"]}

Male albino Wistar rats were fed on HFD (60% kcal fat) and normal chow (control) for 3 weeks. After 3 weeks, HFD fed rats were injected with STZ (35 mg/kg body weight) intraperitoneally to induce type 2 diabetes. High fat diet fed STZ treated rats had reduction in the oral glucose tolerance, plasma insulin, HDL-C and raised fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin and atherogenic index in comparison to HFD fed rats. On the other hand, feeding of high fat diet resulted in decrease in the total number of bacteria as well as other bacterial groups in comparison to control. Bifidobacteria were most significantly reduced. The propionate proportions (%) in caecal contents were increased in HFD fed rats in comparison to control while HFD fed diabetic animals had decreased propionate proportions. Expression analysis of proglucagon and PC1 in cecum and IL-6 in epididymal fat was higher in HFD fed group and lower expression of adiponectin in epididymal fat as compared to control. STZ treatment significantly lowered the expression of proglucagon and PC1 in cecum and adiponectin in epididymal fat and increased the expression of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in epididymal fat.

The presence of heavy metals constitutes a potential threat to human health and ecosystems. The potential sources of heavy metals as a contaminant are from industrial effluents and leachates from municipal and mining solid waste disposal sites. Understanding the fundamental interaction is a pre-requisite to solve the soil contamination and heavy metals mobility problems and for any proposed clean-up or remediation measures. The leaching column test is a very useful and versatile tool that can be used to study the interactions between soils and various contaminants. The migration of heavy metals through compacted soil columns are monitored in leaching column tests to study the soil interactions with heavy metals. This paper presents the results of batch tests and leaching column tests conducted to examine the interactions of heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Pb) with cohesive soil with low permeability as it can be used as liner in the engineered landfill site or any containment system. The results are compared and it is found that cadmium has lowest retardation or largest mobility while lead has lowest mobility due to highest adsorption degree among all the metals considered.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["787"]}

To cope up the ever increasing demand which will be 109 million tons by the year 2020, the present level of productivity has to be increased to 4.4 tons per hectare. The only approach for achieving quantum jump in productivity is to restructure the wheat plant architecture which can yield up to 8 tons/hectare. The Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, India has developed new plant type (NPT) wheat, utilizing a local germplasm SFW and released wheat and genetic stocks, which has high 1000 grain weight (45\u201350g), high number of grain per spike (90\u2013100), higher biomass, thick, broad, semi erect and dark green leaves, thick stem, plant height 85\u2013100 cm and good root system.

{"title": "Chain-epoxidized polystyrene as compatibilizer for blends of polystyrene and polymers having reactive groups\n", "abstract": " Polystyrene has been often functionalized for its use in various special applications but most often the reactive functional groups have been substituted on its benzene ring. In the present work, epoxy functional groups have been inserted on the backbone of a high molecular weight polystyrene by following a sequence of reaction steps. The products of these reaction steps have been characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR, NMR spectroscopy, HPLC, DSC, and quantitative titration techniques. Epoxidized polystyrene can be used as a compatibilizer for blending polystyrene with other polymers that have functional groups reactive toward epoxy. As examples, polystyrene has been blended with cellulose and ground waste rubber tire using this compatibilizer. From the study of mechanical properties of the blends it has been shown that addition of epoxidised polystyrene compatibilizer brings about improvement in properties, indicating greater dispersion of the blend components.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["787"]}

{"title": "In silico studies of conformational changes in wheat heat shock proteins\n", "abstract": " One of the key limiting factors for life on the planet Earth is temperature. Therefore, nearly all the organisms have developed some biosignaling system to feel thermal changes in the environment and regulate their metabolic process to avoid any loss due to an increased temperature. Heat stress is among the most important environmental challenges against the crop plants with an adverse effect on plant growth, development reproduction, and yield. The physiological response towards high temperature (ie heat stress) leads to the altered proteomic profile of wheat plant resulting in increased level of heat shock proteins (HSPs). The rate of HSPs synthesis is directly correlated with the rising temperature. The HSPs constitute a family of highly conserved proteins. They sample large conformational changes under the effect of elevated temperature. In this opinion paper, conformational analysis of heat shock proteins is suggested to understand their functioning. The computational methods for studying bio molecular 3D structures and conformations provide an opportunity to empathize their function.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["787"]}

Catering to the needs of this rapidly increasing population was a factor for encroachment on the fallow lands and wastelands, but the lure of cash crops under Green Revolution gradually became a major cause of decline in fallow and waste lands. Therefore, efficient management of land and water resources is a major challenge for the scientists, planners, administrators and farmers to ensure food, water and environmental security for the present and future generations. The new paradigm of Green-Revolution-mediated intensification of cropping has also brought some new challenges as demands from the fast-increasing human and livestock population started to outpace the supply, while the impacts of utter neglect of the traditional strength of the livestock sector, and apathy towards a sustainable agricultural input management policy began to be felt. The soil resource studies can be best utilized for making a rational agricultural land use plan for farming community. In the present study the strategies of agricultural land use planning are highlighted with a case study of Bhilwara. Soil resources of Bhilwara district were assessed for development of sustainable land use plan. The study area has three physiographic units viz.

At times, the same area is subjected to one or more of these disasters situation in successive seasons or years. While not all natural calamities can be predicted and prevented, a state of preparedness and ability to respond quickly to a natural calamity can considerably mitigate loss of life and property and the human suffering and restore normalcy at the earliest. Hence it is important for a detailed study and analysis of each disaster. Against this background, this paper reviews the different possible causes behind the Uttarakhand Disaster of 15 17th June 2013 in detail. Uttarakhand district lies on the southern slope of the Himalayan range. The climate and vegetation vary greatly with elevation, from glaciers at the highest elevations to subtropical forests at the lower elevations. The district, in general, is prone to different disasters and the order of severity of damage are; earthquakes, excessive rains and cloud bursts, landslides, floods, forest fires and hailstorms. However, there have been numerous debates and controversies ever since the flash floods hit the state of Uttarakhand in June 2013. This has been one of the worst Himalayan tragedies in recent years in which the actual number of people buried or perished is not known as thousands are still missing. The entire Rambara, a large part of Gaurikund and many villages of Mandakini valley were also fully wiped out.

Few studies have, however, focused on understanding how these \u2018local leaders\u2019 influence employee creativity. While the research exploring the relationship between leadership styles and creativity is scant, there exists even less research analyzing the impact of specific leader behaviors on employee creativity.

Taking leave from the popular two-factor classifications of leadership like transformational-transactional and consideration-initiating structure, the first part of the study identifies important supervisory behaviors that impact employee creativity. The second part presents work motivation (intrinsic and extrinsic motivations), positive psychological capital (self-efficacy, hope, optimism and resilience) and justice perceptions (distributive, procedural and interactional justice perceptions) as important mediating variables for the leadershipcreativity relationship.

An improved form of sand drain is the sandwick, where sand is packed in a cylindrical bag which is inserted in the same way. Sandwicks are easy to install and can be prefilled to the required density. Highly expansive black cotton soil exhibits high swelling and shrinkage which causes loss of strength and cracking. This soil can be stabilized by the provision of a capillary cut-off layer which can be either granular and permeable, or bituminous and impermeable.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["787"]}

Transport critical current density (Jct) of the samples of ceramic and chemical methods has been measured and found very low compared to the Jc values calculated from the magnetization measurements and theoretical depairing critical current density. Here Jct values are interpreted in terms of the microstructure. The poor Jct is attributed to weak links such as, besides grain boundaries, twin boundaries, microinhomogeneity regions within and on the grain and twin boundaries, intrinsic structural disorder and inter and transgranular microcracks which may be responsible for superconducting glassy state and lath or plate type anisotropic grains distributed randomly.

{"title": "Effect of Mesorhizobium in chickpea root nodulation using transcriptome profiling approach\n", "abstract": " Root nodule development is a key event in legume plants for nitrogen fixation. In this process, Mesorhizobium forms a symbiotic relationship with chickpea (legume) crop that can produce nodule to fix the environmental nitrogen for necessary vital activities. Mesorhizobium infected chickpea shows enhanced function at different stages. We studied high throughput sequencing (454/Roche) data of control and three stages, viz. early, middle and late stages of Mesorhizobium infection (Bioproject: PRJNA214031) during nodule formation to identify the key regulatory genes in nitrogen fixation process and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) participating in Mesorhizobium inoculation of chickpea root nodule. De novo assembly of raw reads resulted in 38835 contigs with the N50 value of 1019 bp. Differential expression analysis of assembled transcripts showed that 5615 genes were expressed differentially, out of which 1696 genes were differentially expressed in early infection while 1338 and 2581 genes were expressed in middle stage and late stage of infection, respectively. On analysis of DEGs, it was found that 392 genes were common in all three stages, 1304 were present in both early and late infection while 946 genes were uniquely expressed in the middle stage of infection. It has been evident from studies that long non-coding RNAs participate in host responses to infection but many lncRNAs are still unknown at the level of Mesorhizobium inoculated root nodules of chickpea. The present study aimed at identification of the lncRNAs in chickpea root nodules and to understand the transcriptomic mechanism during Mesorhizobium inoculation\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["787"]}

The program computes various components of water budget (water surplus/deficit, humidity/aridity/moisture indices, bio-climatic type) following the standard methods considering precipitation (P), potential evapotranspiration (PET), and available water holding capacity (AWC) of soils as inputs at either monthly or weekly time steps. The essential inputs for the program are rainfall and evapotranspiration. Mean rainfall is derived from climatic normals and the evapotranspiration is estimated following Penman-Monteith relation based on inputs of normal temperature, humidity, radiation parameters specific to a location. The water-balance program tested for many stations with diverse soil, physiography and climate conditions over India and was found to provide good results. Spatial interpolation techniques in Geographical Information System (GIS) have been adopted for interpretation of geographical variation of the various water budget components. The WatBal software was used in many agriculture research areas in India.

This frequency selective surface (FSS) acts like a dual band reject filter. The proposed design has been investigated theoretically using Ansoft Designer\u00ae software in which the reflection and transmission band have been predicted by the method known as Method of Moment which is most complicated but its accuracy is best. Efforts have been given to achieve dual high band reject filtering with high band ratio (approx 3.18).", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["787"]}
{"title": "Modelling and Analysis of Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor using Matlab/Simulink\n", "abstract": " The need for more efficient electricity systems management has given rise to innovative Technologies in power generation and transmission. Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) is one of such technologies that respond to these needs. It significantly alters the way transmission systems are developed and controlled together with improvement in asset utilization, system flexibility and system performance. Different types of FACTS devices are being used now-a-days. Thyristor Controlled Series Compensator is one of the series compensating FACTS devices. Thyristor Controlled Series Compensator (TCSC) consists of a series compensating capacitor shunted by a Thyristor Controlled Reactor (TCR). The basic idea behind the TCSC scheme is to provide continuously variable impedance by means of partially cancelling the effective compensating capacitance by the TCR. Transmission lines compensation by means of TCSC can be used to increase the power transfer capability, improve transient stability, reduce transmission losses and dampen power system oscillations. In this work device modelling of TCSC have to be carry out along using MATLAB7. 5/Simulink. The thyristor of TCR branch are fired at firing angle \u03b1= 600 degree. The Response of capacitor voltage, the response of TCR currents and response of capacitor currents at the given firing angle is studied.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["787"]}

{"title": "Conservation Agriculture for Sustainable Crop Production in Haryana\n", "abstract": " However, the use of GR technologies showed signs of ecological imbalances. The recent agricultural trends show signs of stagnating production due to (i) decline in factor productivity,(ii) degrading soil health,(iii) inefficiency of current production practices,(iv) scarcity of resources, especially good quality water and labour,(v) changes in land use, driven by socio-economic factors and resource constraints, and good fertile lands going out of cultivation for roads, urban development and industrial uses, etc. and (vi) policy fatigue. The problem is likely to be further exacerbated by the climate change. Climate extremes and poor water availability will necessitate growing more food with less and less water in coming years. An average 1 C rise in temperature will increase the demand for irrigation water by 2-3 per cent to sustain production at the current level (Reeve et al. 2010). In last few decades, rice-wheat cropping system has emerged as a major production system in Haryana.

India ranks first in mango production and presently it is being cultivated in about 20 countries (Anon, 1). Mango hybridization is one important method for the improvement of mango. Success of hybridization depends on choosing the right parents and having more progenies for future selection. There is a heavy drop of hermaphrodite flower and young fruits after fertilization. In general, it may be stated that only 0.1% or less of hermaphrodite flowers develops fruit up to maturity. To reduce the fruit drop and to improve their retention, application of nutrients like calcium and boron as sprays are reported (Chen et al., 3). Therefore, some studies on the similar lines are essential in mango to devise a strategy for achieving higher breeding efficiency.

The proper application of this approach requires a knowledge of the initial mechanical properties, but this is not readily available. However the application of wet-tensile strength, which is extensively used in the paper and pulp industries but has never been considered in the electrical industry, does not require such prior knowledge.

Herpes hominis is of2 types (HSV-1) and (HSV-2). Out of these (HSV-2) infection is more common in neonates (l). The incidence reported is 1-6 newborns/1000 deliveries/year (l).Transmission of infection to the neonates occurs primarily by two routes, ascending infection and transplacental infection. Most neonatal infections are the result of virus acquisition during passage through the birth canal (40%). Transplacencal infection is rare and the exact incidence of the same is not known. Certain factors are said to be associated with increased risk of acquisition of HSV in neonates. These are primary infection in the mother; others being multiple genital lesions in the mother; prematurity, prolonged rupture of membranes and intrauterine instrumentation^).", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["787"]}

Therefore, attempts were made to modify the manufacturing technique and enhance the ripening process. The methods of cheese manufacture were those of Czulak, Burde, Presalting and Goat Milk Supplementation (GMS). The biotechnological means employed were supplementation of starter culture with Lactobacillus casei 300, addition of exogenous free enzymes and addition of microencapsulated enzymes with and without goat milk supplementation. The cheese was analysed for its sensory and biochemical characteristics during ripening at 8 _+ IC.The study revealed that the sensory properties of cheese made by the Czulak method remained subnormal, even after 10 months of ripening, while the Burde method slightly improved the flavour score.

There is a lot of variability about the dose-effect relationship, and the literature on the effect of low doses of radiation on induction of chromosomal aberrations is scanty. Therefore, the irradiation of human lymphocytes with five doses (0.05, 0.1, 0.4 and 1.0 Gy) each of 60 Co gamma rays and x-rays (50KV) was performed in order to obtain dose-response curves for both types of radiations. Since doses of radiation exposure were in the low ranges, it was not possible to fit the common curves for the data obtained for chromosome type aberrations.

This paper also discusses a high-speed conventional full adder design combined with MOSCAP Majority function circuit in one unit to implement a hybrid full adder circuit. Moreover, it presents low-power Majorityfunction-based 1-bit full adders that use MOS capacitors (MOSCAP) in its structure. This technique helps in reducing power consumption, propagationdelay, and area of digital circuits while maintaining low complexity of logic design. Simulation results illustrate the superiority of the designed adder circuits over the conventional CMOS, TG, and hybrid adder circuits in terms of power, delay, power delay product (PDP), and energy delay product (EDP). Post layout simulation results illustrate the superiority of the newly designed majority adder circuits against the reported conventional adder circuits.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["787"]}

Clinicians often face difficulty in identifying patients are risk of neurobehavioural dysfunction due to wide inter-individual variability, disparity between symptoms and conventional metrics of disease severity such as Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI). Quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) measures are determinants of awake neurobehavioural function in healthy subjects. The sinusoidal waveforms of the EEG are often defined by their frequency. The fast Fourier transform is used to perform spectral analysis of the signal, over a period of time (or space) to divide it into its frequency components.

In the United States, approximately 80,000 (6 percent) of known cases of HIV are 50 years of age and older and about 11 percent of all US cases of AIDS are in this age group. AIDS has been identified as the 15th leading cause of death in those over 65 years of age in the United States similar to other developed countries of the world. UNAIDS and WHO have estimated that out of the 40 million people living with HIV/AIDS in the world, approximately 2.8 million were 50 years and older. As treated HIV-infected patients live longer and the number of new HIV diagnoses in older patients rise, clinicians need to be aware of these trends and become familiar with the management of HIV infection in the older patients. Long-term treated HIV infected patients remain at higher than expected risk for cardiovascular disease, cancer, osteoporosis, and other diseases along with a number of complications typically associated with aging. However, additional research is needed to generate deeper insights regarding mutual impacts of HIV infection and aging in order to develop and implement effective prevention measures for safe antiretroviral therapy in the older HIV-infected patient.

Micro-irrigation is the only option to replace the conventional irrigation method to achieve water-use efficiency.Among the various technique developed for application of water, drip irrigation also referred to as trickle irrigation or micro irrigation is gaining popularity as perhaps the most efficient method of water application [4]. The area under drip irrigation was over 355,000 hectares in 2002. Presently, adoption of drip irrigation in India is increasing and about 600,000 hectares area is covered under drip irrigation under various crops [2].

Ovaries were studied for quantitative evaluation of follicles at 1, 4, 12, 28 and 52 weeks after last fractionated exposure. Quantitation revealed lower number of ovarian follicles in irradiated animals than in controls. The follicular number decreased with the advancement of time after last exposure (ie 2 months) and reached a peak level on 28 weeks. After that the recovery was evident but the number remained below 25% of total follicles even at 52 weeks autopsy interval, which indicated an irreversible damage in ovarian tissue. Primary follicles were found to be the most radiosensitive among the various types of follicles. The highest loss in these follicles was noted at 12 weeks after exposure with the high dose-rate, where only 10.61% of them were scored.

After the introduction of future trading, the whole price scenario was changed in the economy. The present study was carried out in two different era ie pre-future and post-future trading era. Time series data of wholesale price indices from 1998 to 2009 of selected agricultural commodities ie wheat, refined soy oil and chana were obtained from the website of the Office of Economic Advisor, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India, New Delhi. Compound growth rate (CGR) was calculated for each commodity for two different time periods. Major findings of the study revealed that the CGR for all the selected commodities was less during the pre-future period compared to the post-future period.

Clinically, the condition manifests as nasal itching (pruritus), sneezing, rhinorrhea, congestion and itchy eyes. The second generation antihistamines are commonly used either as nasal sprays (azelastine) or orally (levocetirizine). Studies have demonstrated equal efficacy of azelastine and levocetirizine, but the data on Indian population is lacking. Hence, we designed this study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of azelastine in comparison to levocetirizine in patients with allergic rhinitis.METHODS: This prospective, randomized, parallel group study was conducted in the otorhinolaryngology outpatient department. Both male and female patients between the ages of 18 to 55 years were enrolled in the study after informed consent. Patients were randomized into two groups. Subjects in group 1 received azelastine whereas group 2 received levocetirizine. Clinic visits were scheduled at baseline and after every 2 weeks of treatment for 4 weeks. The primary outcome measure was mean change in the total daytime nasal symptom scores (PDTS) and secondary outcomes were mean change in the nighttime nasal symptom scores (PNTS) and composite symptom scores (PCS).RESULTS: We enrolled 40 patients, 20 in each group. Both groups were comparable at baseline and tolerated treatment well. There was significant (p< 0.05) improvement in mean PDTS, PNTS and PCS scores in both groups from second week onwards.

{"title": "FORMATION OF NH4 AEROSOLS AND ITS COEXISTENCE WITH GASEOUS NH3 AT JNU, NEW DELHI\n", "abstract": " Very recently, atmospheric ammonia (NH3) has been a topic of increasing interest among atmospheric scientists. It affects human health, visibility, earth radiation budget and climate change (Barthelmie and Pryor, 1998). Ammonia is a dominant basic species of atmosphere and prefers to react with acidic species such as sulphuric acid, nitric acid and hydrochloric acid etc. in the atmosphere resulting in the formation of compounds such as ammonium sulphate, ammonium nitrate and ammonium chloride etc. Most of these exist as submicron size range aerosols. The neutralization reactions of ammonia give rise to fine particulates through gas-to-particle conversion process (Lemmetty et al., 2007; Kulshrestha et al., 2009) which has put NH3 under regulation. According to recent NAAQS published by CBCB, the prescribed limit of annual average of ambient NH 3 is 100 \u00b5g m-3.Ammonia (NH 3) and ammonium (NH 4+) are important atmospheric reactive nitrogen species (NHx). It has been realized that the increased deposition of NHx may lead to changes in plant community (Sutton et al., 1998; Kulshrestha and Kulshrestha, 2007). Also, deposition of NHx to the sensitive ecosystems can lead to serious ecological consequences such as eutrophication and soil infertility. Such changes may prevail in the regions having high ammonia emissions due to intensive livestock and agriculture (Buijsman et al., 1987; Demmers et al., 1999).", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["787"]}

A Z-Source inverter with unified control technique is proposed which can boost the voltage and generate the desired output voltage efficiently when the low voltage is available at generator terminals due to low speed operation of generator. And also when the speed of generator is high giving higher voltages the inverter operates as a traditional voltage source inverter to buck the voltage. Thus proposed system is capable of both boosting and bucking voltage. Thus making system suitable for wind turbine distributed Generation system. In unified control technique a unified voltage vector is used which is composed of both traditional voltage vector and unique boost factor which provides fast dynamic response to maintain constant output voltage of inverter in variable speed operation of SEIG.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["787"]}

Wheat lines? Kingbird,? Kiritati? and? Juchi? showed high levels of APR to Ug99 races of stem rust fungus when tested in Kenya. The F5 and F6 generation recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations developed from the crosses of moderately susceptible? PBW343? with the three resistant parents were used in mapping. Field phenotyping of the parents and RILs were conducted at Njoro, Kenya for at least two years with Ug99+ Sr24 (TTKST) race under high stem rust pressures. The continuous variation ofAPR in each RIL population and genetic analyses indicated quantitative nature of resistance that was likely governed by 3 or 4 minor genes. Single and joint year analyses by Inclusive Composite Interval Mapping (ICIM) using informative DArT and/or SSR markers identified consistent APR QTLs on chromosomes 1A, 3BS, 5BL, 7A and 7DS in Kingbird; 2D, 3BS, 5BL and 7DS in Kiritati and 2B, 3BS, 4A, 5BL and 6B in Juchi. QTLs on each genomic regions explained 10-46% of the phenotypic variation for APR. Pseudo-black chaff phenotype associated with APR gene Sr2 on chromosome 3BS in all six resistant parents and identification of an APR QTL in the same region in all mapping populations confirmed the role of Sr2 in reducing stem rust severity. The QTL on chromosome 7DS in Kingbird was in the same region where pleiotropic APR gene Lr34/Yr18/Pm38 is located. Further\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["787"]}

Such studies have played important roles in fertility analysis. In the proposed study, an attempt has been made to look into the phenomenon of parity progression from reliability or survival point of view based on the models for hazard rates obtained by Pachal (1992), wherein it has been assumed that fertility rates decline uniformly by parity. The hazard rates decline gradually with advancement in parity. Distribution of women in the first parity with respect to the time of birth and hazard rate of births for first parity has been obtained from a cohort of 313 females. Lateron a comparative analysis between observed mean and standard deviation to the expected mean and standard deviation of the time interval also has been done.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["787"]}

This results in the high emission of particulate matter into environment along with SO2, NOx, CO etc. It is mandatory to conduct Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) study before the construction of a new power plant or expansion of the existing one as per requirement of the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India. EIA studies are made with the help of Air Quality modeling. The present study provides an air quality point source model named IIT Point Source (IITPS) model, which is capable of treating moderate and low/calm wind conditions by using a combination of plume and puff models. This model has also modified for dispersion parameters, appropriate for Indian meteorological conditions. The model has been validated by using the observed data of two power plants namely Badarpur Thermal Power Station (BTPS) and Dadri Power Plant (DPP).

These sites had been under zero-tillage for the previous two to four years. The plant parasites Hirschmanniella oryzae (rice-root nematode) and Tylenchorhynchus mashoodi (stunt nematode) were found at all study sites. The present study, found a definite trend for T. mashoodi, with the samples from the conventional tillage fields having significantly higher populations than the zero tillage samples. Also, the mean population of T. mashoodi in the March dough stage samples was significantly more than in the November crown root initiation stage samples. These findings were corroborated by the trend in the population of H. oryzae over the same period.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["787"]}

Physico-chemical properties of soils in all the three sites were also studied. The increase in degree of soil degradation caused a reduction in VAM spore population at both the soil layers of the three sites. Highest VAM spore population was recorded from the undegraded site followed by least degraded and degraded sites respectively. There was a reduction in VAM spore population of up to 70 per cent in the degraded site and 30 per cent in the least degraded site in comparison to the undegraded site. The VAM populations in soils were positively correlated with soil moisture content (P= 0.01), water holding capacity (P= 0.01) and pH (P= 0.05) in the case of surface soil layer. Bulk density was negatively correlated with the VAM spore population at the surface (P= 0.05) and sub-surface soil layers (P= 0.01). Altogether five genera (Acaulospora, Entrophospora, Glomus, Gigaspora, and Scutellospora) having forty-four species were recorded.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["787"]}

This hybrid is having attractive oval tubers, higher dry matter (20.9%) and better keeping quality under on-farm storage. It is expected to replace the existing late blight susceptible red-skin varieties in West-central plains.Traditionally red-skin potatoes have been in demand in eastern India (Kang and Birhman, 1993), they are now increasingly being preferred in North-western and West-central plains. Red-skin potato varieties from Malaut, Muktsar and Abohar districts of Punjab are being regularly sent to Jammu and Kashmir predominantly for cooking with meat. The West-central and eastern plains account for nearly 75% of the potato produce in the country. But regular appearance of late blight is a recent phenomenon in this region. Consequently, two red-skin vaneties Kufri Sindhuri (late maturing) and Kufri lalima (medium maturing) released in 1967 and 1982, respectively failed to continue their hold in this region due to their late blight susceptibility and longer duration.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["787"]}

The traditional tall basmati cultivars were better than semi-tall improved in LAI, leaf area per tiller, leaf size, total biomass production at flowering and grains per panicle, biological yield, pre-anthesis CGR and dry matter production and post-anthesis stem weight coefficient. The improved and traditional cultivars however did not show much variation in SLW, SLA and foliage efficiency for total biomass production. The traditional basmati cultivars though produced about 25-30 per cent greater biomass, manifested lower grain yield than semi-tall mainly due to poor biomass transformation into grain under severe lodging. The economic yield of traditional tall cultivars, however, was at par semi-tall improved ones when protected from lodging", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["787"]}

We report here a protocol for somatic embryogenesis from leaf tissue in mango cv. Amrapali, which is considered highly recalcitrant. Callusing followed by embryogenesis has been achieved from leaf segment of 2-year-old, greenhouse grown plants. The sprouts appearing on beheaded stock (30-days) were covered with black perforated polythene sheet for etiolation (45 days). Three types of leaf explants, i.e. apex, section with midrib and leaf bases with portion of petiole, were agitated in a solution of poly vinyl polypyrrolidone (400 mg/L) + 20 g/L sucrose for 2 hr prior to inoculation. The explants were then inoculated on B5 or WPM (macro salts) + full strength MS (micro salts+organics)+60 g/L sucrose+400 mg/L glutamine+casein hydrolysate (200 mg/L)+L-ascorbic acid (50 mg/L) alongwith 2, 4-D (0 to 5 mg/L) and Zeatin (0.2 or 0.5 mg/L) and Zeatin (0.2 or 0.5 mg/L). Callusing was best (69.4 percent) on the medium (B5+MS) containing 2,4-D (4.0 mg/L+Zeatin (0.5 mg/L) on the leaf segments taken from middle portion of lamina with midrib. Callus multiplication and formation of globular embryoid-like structures was achieved on liquid medium with 2, 4-D (0.5 mg/L) and AgNO3 (10 micro M) on a shaker kept in dark (120 rpm). Globular embryos germinated on solid medium devoid of growth regulators.

{"title": "B74-Expression of Heterosis for Yield and Yield Traits in Indian Wheat Crosses under Drill Sown Condition\n", "abstract": " Methods One hundred intervarietal crosses were developed during the 1994-95 and 1995-97 wheat crop seasons, utilizing diverse commercial wheat varieties of northern India. The parental varieties and their F1 populations were sown in three replications in a randomized block design during two consecutive crop seasons (1995-96 and 1996-97). Sowing was done by hand using the drill sowing method. Each plot consisted of two rows of 3 m with a 30 cm row spacing. Check varieties HUW 206 and HUW 214 were also planted for comparison. The recommended package of practices was followed to raise a normal healthy crop. Whole plots were harvested separately to measure number of effective tillers per meter length, number of grains per spike, thousand grain weight (g), and grain yield (g). Heterosis expressed as percentage increase or decrease of F, over the better parent (heterobeltiosis) and check parent (standard heterosis) was calculated according to the methods suggested by Hays et aI.(1955).Results Several crosses showed heterosis over checks for yield and associated yield components. For grain yield, the best hybrid was CPAN 3048 x HUW 206 followed by CPAN 4007 x HUW 206, BW 362 x HUW 234 and HUW 2005 x K 9107. However, only the first two crosses showed a heterosis for grain yield over the check parent HUW 243 of more than 20%--the accepted minimum for commercial exploitation under the field conditions.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["787"]}
{"title": "A CASE STUDY ON ROUGHENING OF PCC SURFACE FOR A RIGID OVERLAY\n", "abstract": " This paper discusses some experiments conducted at Gorakhpur, India, to find an economically viable solution to the problem of roughening of PCC surface, which had become critical to the process of resurfacing an airfield runway. A total area of 54,000 square m had to be roughened within 120 days at most. The three trials used:(1) a pneumatic jack hammer;(2) a modified terrazzo cutting machine; and (3) an improvised trolley-mounted pneumatic chipping hammer. During the trials, disadvantages observed in the mechanical roughening systems included starting problems and defects of compressors, defects in pneumatic tools, and blunting and breaking of chisels. There were also trials of manual roughening methods, using an axe-type chiselling hammer and a well-designed chipping hammer. It was found that both mechanical and manual methods of roughening produced an excellent roughened PCC surface. The quality of roughening was so high that, with sufficient care, a very effective bond could be created between old and new concrete. Manual roughening was found to much cheaper than mechanical roughening, and employed many previously unemployed workers for the duration of the project.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["787"]}

The fruits were washed with water, graded by density gradation method and kept in cardboard cartons using paper lining and stored at ambient conditions and different parameters were studied on 0, 6, 10, 12 and 14th day of storage. Fruits of both the cultivars harvested without stalk released the latex at the point of detachment of stalk which caused dull appearance of fruits in the storage. There was a gradual reduction in Vitamin 'e' and acidity during storage but with a slower rate in fruits harvested with stalk. Spoilage was mainly due to Diplodia natalensis and loss due to it was more in fruits harvested without stalk. Firmness and organoleptic quality retained for longer period in fruits harvested with stalk than those harvested without stalk in both the cultivars.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["787"]}
