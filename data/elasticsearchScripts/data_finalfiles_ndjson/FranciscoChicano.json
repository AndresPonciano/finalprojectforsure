By definition, these problems use a bit representation. Under partition crossover, the evaluation of offspring can be directly obtained from partial evaluations of substrings found in the parents. Partition crossover explores the variable interaction graph of the pseudo-Boolean functions in order to partition the variables of the solution vector. Proofs are presented showing that if the differing variable assignments found in the two parents can be partitioned into q non-interacting sets, partition crossover can be used to find the best of 2 q possible offspring.

As companies are getting involved in larger and larger software projects, there is an actual need of algorithms that are able to deal with the tremendous search spaces imposed.

{"title": "Mutantes como apoyo para la valoraci\u00f3n de pruebas\n", "abstract": " En este trabajo proponemos el uso de la t\u00e9cnica de mutation testing, o pruebas basadas en mutaci\u00f3n, en asignaturas de pruebas de software para ayudar en la labor de evaluaci\u00f3n de las mismas, a la vez que su propio uso ayuda a los alumnos a entender y asimilar la t\u00e9cnica en s\u00ed, utiliz\u00e1ndola para mejorar sus conjuntos de pruebas. Describimos nuestra experiencia usando mutation testing en una asignatura de pruebas de software. Gracias al uso de una herramienta que automatiza la generaci\u00f3n de mutantes y su evaluaci\u00f3n, el profesor puede obtener una idea r\u00e1pida de la calidad de las pruebas que puede servir para guiar/confirmar su evaluaci\u00f3n. El alumno, por su parte, puede usarla para obtener una primera evaluaci\u00f3n de su trabajo y como gu\u00eda para mejorar el conjunto de pruebas.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["561"]}
{"title": "Optimal Neuron Selection: NK Echo State Networks for Reinforcement Learning\n", "abstract": " This paper introduces the NK Echo State Network. The problem of learning in the NK Echo State Network is reduced to the problem of optimizing a special form of a Spin Glass Problem known as an NK Landscape. No weight adjustment is used; all learning is accomplished by spinning up (turning on) or spinning down (turning off) neurons in order to find a combination of neurons that work together to achieve the desired computation. For special types of NK Landscapes, an exact global solution can be obtained in polynomial time using dynamic programming. The NK Echo State Network is applied to a reinforcement learning problem requiring a recurrent network: balancing two poles on a cart given no velocity information. Empirical results shows that the NK Echo State Network learns very rapidly and yields very good generalization.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["561"]}

{"title": "Optimizaci\u00f3n multi-objetivo basada en preferencias para la planificaci\u00f3n de proyectos software\n", "abstract": " En este trabajo se presenta una herramienta software, denominada Interactive SPS o iSPS, que permite resolver, de forma interactiva, instancias del problema de Planificaci\u00f3n de Proyectos Software (SPS) haciendo uso de algoritmos evolutivos basados en punto de referencia. La finalidad de la herramienta es ayudar al director de proyectos software en la toma de decisiones, teniendo en cuenta sus preferencias para aproximar una regi\u00f3n concreta del frente \u00f3ptimo de Pareto. Para mostrar la utilidad de este enfoque preferencial sobre el problema SPS, se ilustra su aplicaci\u00f3n con un ejemplo paso a paso en el que se aplica el algoritmo iWASFGA a una instancia concreta del problema.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["561"]}
{"title": "Elementary Landscape Decomposition of the Hamiltonian Path Optimization Problem\n", "abstract": " There exist local search landscapes where the evaluation function is an eigenfunction of the graph Laplacian that corresponds to the neighborhood structure of the search space. Problems that display this structure are called \u201cElementary Landscapes\u201d and they have a number of special mathematical properties. The problems that are not elementary landscapes can be decomposed in a sum of elementary ones. This sum is called the elementary landscape decomposition of the problem. In this paper, we provide the elementary landscape decomposition for the Hamiltonian Path Optimization Problem under two different neighborhoods.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["561"]}
