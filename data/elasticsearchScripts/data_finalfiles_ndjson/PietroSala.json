For each of these logics, we establish a small pseudo-model property and construct a sound, complete and terminating tableau that searches systematically for existence of such a pseudo-model satisfying the input formulas. Both constructions are non-trivial, but the latter is substantially more complicated because of the presence of beginning and ending subintervals which require special treatment.

The existence of non-{\\omega}BS-regular languages that are the complements of some {\\omega}BS-regular ones and express fairly natural properties of reactive systems motivates the search for other well-behaved classes of extended {\\omega}-regular languages. In this paper, we introduce the class of {\\omega}T-regular languages, that includes meaningful languages which are not {\\omega}BS-regular. We first define it in terms of {\\omega}T-regular expressions. Then, we introduce a new class of automata (counter-check automata) and we prove that (i) their emptiness problem is decidable in PTIME and (ii) they are expressive enough to capture {\\omega}T-regular languages (whether or not {\\omega}T-regular languages are expressively complete with respect to counter-check automata is still an open problem). Finally, we provide an encoding of {\\omega}T-regular expressions into S1S+U.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1729"]}
{"title": "Counter-queue Automata with an Application to a Meaningful Extension of Omega-regular Languages.\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we introduce a new class of automata over infinite words (counter-queue automata) and we prove the decidability of their emptiness problem. Then, we define an original extension of \u03c9regular languages, called \u03c9T-regular languages, that captures meaningful languages that neither belong to the class of \u03c9-regular languages nor to other extensions of it proposed in the literature, and we show that counter-queue automata are expressive enough to encode them.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1729"]}
{"title": "Beyond \u03c9BS-regular languages: The class of \u03c9T-regular languages\n", "abstract": " In the last years, various meaningful extensions of \u03c9-regular languages have been proposed in the literature, including \u03c9B-regular languages (\u03c9-regular languages extended with boundedness), \u03c9S-regular languages (\u03c9-regular languages extended with strict unboundedness), and \u03c9BS-regular languages, which are obtained from the combination of \u03c9B-and \u03c9S-regular languages. However, while its components satisfy a generalized closure property, namely, the complement of an \u03c9B-regular (resp., \u03c9S-regular) language is an \u03c9S-regular (resp., \u03c9B-regular) one, the class of \u03c9BS-regular languages is not closed under complementation. The existence of non-\u03c9BS-regular languages that are the complements of some \u03c9BS-regular ones and express fairly natural properties of reactive systems motivates the search for larger, well-behaved classes of extended \u03c9-regular languages. In this paper, we introduce the class of \u03c9T-regular languages, that captures meaningful languages not belonging to the class of \u03c9BS-regular languages. We provide an automaton-based encoding of this new class of languages and we prove the decidability of their emptiness problem.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1729"]}

Angiofibromas are the most disturbing marker of the disease because they are conspicuously present on the face.

{"title": "Adding two equivalence relations to the interval temporal logic AB.\n", "abstract": " The interval temporal logic AB features two modalities that make it possible to access intervals which are adjacent to the right of the current interval (modality\u2329 A\u232a) and proper subintervals that have the same left endpoint of it (modality\u2329 B\u232a). AB is one of the most significant interval logics, as it allows one to express meaningful (metric) properties, while maintaining decidability (undecidability rules over interval logics, AB is EXPSPACE-complete [14]). In an attempt to capture \u03c9S-regular languages with interval logics [15], it was proved that AB extended with an equivalence relation, denoted AB\u223c, is decidable (non-primitive recursive) on the class of finite linear orders and undecidable on N. The question whether the addition of two or more equivalence relations makes finite satisfiability for AB undecidable was left open. In this paper, we answer this question proving that AB\u223c 1\u223c 2 is undecidable.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1729"]}
