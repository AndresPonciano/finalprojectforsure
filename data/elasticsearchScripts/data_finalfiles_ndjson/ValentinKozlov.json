The combined use of thermal phonon sensors and charge collection electrodes with an interleaved geometry enables the efficient rejection of \u03b3-induced radioactivity as well as near-surface interactions. A total effective exposure of 384 kg d has been achieved, mostly coming from fourteen months of continuous operation. Five nuclear recoil candidates are observed above 20 keV, while the estimated background is 3.0 events. The result is interpreted in terms of limits on the cross-section of spin-independent interactions of WIMPs and nucleons. A cross-section of 4.4\u00d7 10\u2212 8 pb is excluded at 90% CL for a WIMP mass of 85 GeV.
