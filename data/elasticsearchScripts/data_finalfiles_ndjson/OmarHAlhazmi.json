{"title": "Fog-Based Internet of Things: A Security Scheme\n", "abstract": " Internet of Things (IoT) stack models differ in their architecture, applications and needs. Hence, there are different approaches to apply IoT; for instance, it can be based on traditional data center or based on cloud computing. In fact, Cloud-based IoT is gaining more popularity due to its high scalability and cost effectiveness; hence, it is becoming the norm. However, Cloud is usually located far from the IoT devices and some recent research suggests using Fog-Based IoT by using a nearby light-weight middleware to bridge the gap and to provide the essential support and communication between devices, sensors, receptors and the servers. Therefore, Fog reduces centrality and provides local processing for faster analysis, especially for the time-sensitive applications. Thus, processing is done faster, giving the system flexibility for faster response time.

{"title": "Computer aided disaster recovery planning tools (CADRP)\n", "abstract": " Information Technology Disaster Recovery Plans (DRPs) are becoming an essential component for any organization with IT infrastructure. However, DRPs varies in performance and cost; therefore, based on requirements and resources, an organization can design their DRP. Typically, DRPs depends on data and/or system replication, data needs to be backed up frequently, and a plan to restore the system to running state within the allowed time. Hence, DRP designer must know the needed business requirements in terms of recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO). Then, the appropriate technical requirements will be set. At the same time, the cost factor can play a role in choosing the appropriate DRP. The industry has a widely accepted seven-tier system of how DRP can be designed. In this work, we design and implement a software tool that can simulate the IT DPR systems and therefore help designers to design, optimize, and test their design before it is physically implemented. This tool will run a simulated system with DRP specific design and the designer can exercise with the system to show it\u2019s RTO, RPO, and cost that can significantly improve DRP design.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["483"]}
{"title": "Secure IoT Resources with Access Control over RESTful Web Service\n", "abstract": " With the Internet of Things (IoT), the number of connected devices on the internet has increased to billions, and this number is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years. Services and applications based on the IoT are expected to expand to cover more areas in the near future. Performance, connectivity and security are very important aspects of such an expansive environment. In order to enhance the performance and security of the IoT, a secure and cost-effective model for IoT applications that is based on Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is proposed. This model addresses the IoT security challenges primarily by moving access control and data management from the MQTT broker to a fog server. The performance of the proposed model is validated by multiple metrics; and the obtained results show that it can be deployed successfully in the implementation of IoT applications to enhance both the IoT\u2019s security and performance.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["483"]}
{"title": "A cloud-based adaptive disaster recovery optimization model.\n", "abstract": " Disaster recovery and business continuity plans are essential to make sure businesses keep on going. However, many small and medium businesses feel that these plans can cost them a lot. Moreover, the issues of cost and operation overhead prevent them from having solid disaster recovery plans. However, with the spread of cloud computing and pay-as-you-go and pay-for-what-you-use models, issues of operational overhead and expensive investment in extra storage and extra infrastructure are significantly minimized. On the other hand, as it becomes more affordable, businesses want to make sure they get the most optimal solution for minimum cost and overhead. In this work, we propose an adaptive cloud-based disaster recovery model that will be flexible in protecting data and applications with different plans by considering changes in risk levels and at the same time managing the costs and billing issues associated with the cloud. Therefore, this suggests an adaptive model to manage resources on the go while keeping costs as planned with the best possible protection.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["483"]}

It describes how the vulnerabilities of similar nature irrespective of the types are discovered and are consolidated in a time interval according to the noncumulative vulnerability discovery at any instant. The chapter presents a mathematical derivation for the determination of different vulnerability categories based on time. It provides a numerical background to the proposed categorization of vulnerabilities using different data sets. The vulnerability discovery process under consideration is deployed after the release of a software. When someone discovers security implications in a software system, the flaw becomes a vulnerability.

{"title": "A Survivable Internet of Things Scheme\n", "abstract": " Availability is an essential property of information systems, especially in critical infrastructure and revenue-generating systems. Availability can be compromised when an incident or an attack causes a system to shut down. Then, recovery can be applied to restore availability. One other way to achieve high availability is to start with building survivable systems. Survivable systems resist shutting down as they are built to continue operation despite being affected by incidents. Survivability depends on many factors including architecture and redundancy. Internet of Things systems are complex and often widespread, and to ensure survivability certain measures should be in place to face the challenges inherent in the nature of these systems. In this work, we preview some of the well-known IoT architectures and propose architectural schemes to ensure survivability.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["483"]}
{"title": "Assessing vulnerabilities in software systems: A quantitative approach\n", "abstract": " 1.1 INTRODUCTION Connectivity of computing systems through the internet has brought the security of software systems under intense scrutiny. Until recently, much of the work on security has been qualitative, focused on detection and prevention of vulnerabilities in these systems. This study has attempted to provide a basis for developing systematic quantitative approaches for characterizing security. Quantitatively security can be characterized by factors such as the number of vulnerabilities present in a particular software system and the related discovery, remedy and exploitation processes. A software vulnerability may be defined as a \u201cdefect which enables an attacker to bypass security measures\u201d[65]. Alternatively, a vulnerability may be defined as a defect \u201cwhich enables an attacker to bypass security measures,\u201d[71]. Hence, a software system with a smaller number of vulnerabilities can be viewed as less risky than a software system with a larger number of vulnerabilities. In this study the quantitative characterization of security focuses on the vulnerability discovery process. The analysis starts by observing the cumulative number of vulnerabilities plotted against calendar time, and then appropriate models are identified able to capture the repeated behavior. This study has satisfactorily established the feasibility of quantitative characterization of security risks in terms of vulnerabilities present in a software system.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["483"]}

A beacon-enabled IEEE 802.15.4 consists of a superframe structure that comprises of the contention access period and contention-free period. During contention-free period, nodes transfer their data using guaranteed time slots without any collision. The coordinator node receives data transmission requests in one cycle and allocates guaranteed time slots to the nodes in the next cycle. This allocation process may cause large delay that may not be acceptable for few applications. In this work, a novel superframe structure is proposed that significantly reduces guaranteed time slots allocation delay for the nodes with data requests.

{"title": "Software effort prediction using ensemble learning methods\n", "abstract": " Software Cost Estimation (SCE) is an essential requirement in producing software these days. Genuine accurate estimation requires cost-and-efforts factors in delivering software by utilizing algorithmic or Ensemble Learning Methods (ELMs). Effort is estimated in terms of individual months and length. Overestimation as well as underestimation of efforts can adversely affect software development. Hence, it is the responsibility of software development managers to estimate the cost using the best possible techniques. The predominant cost for any product is the expense of figuring effort. Subsequently, effort estimation is exceptionally pivotal and there is a constant need to improve its accuracy. Fortunately, several efforts estimation models are available; however, it is difficult to determine which model is more accurate on what dataset. Hence, we use ensemble learning bagging with base learner Linear regression, SMOReg, MLP, random forest, REPTree, and M5Rule. We also implemented the feature selection algorithm to examine the effect of feature selection algorithm BestFit and Genetic Algorithm. The dataset is based on 499 projects known as China.
