To address this, we introduce a novel method for identifying the observations on which an ensemble classifier performs poorly. During detection, when a sufficient number of votes from individual classifiers disagree, the ensemble classifier prediction is shown to be unreliable. The proposed method, ensemble classifier mutual agreement analysis, allows the detection of many forms of classifier evasion without additional external ground truth.We evaluate our approach using PDFrate, a PDF malware detector. Applying our method to data taken from a real network, we show that the vast majority of predictions can be made with high ensemble classifier agreement. However, most classifier evasion attempts, including nine targeted mimicry scenarios from two recent studies, are given an outcome of uncertain indicating that these observations cannot be given a reliable prediction by the classifier.

The diffuse style of administration and operation means that even such basic information as topology or link capacity is spread across multiple entities with little incentive to share it. This knowledge, however, is necessary for the design and development of better management tools, communication protocols, and mechanisms that are network-related. As a concrete example, there is little information available on the distribution of access-link capacities and available bandwidth for end-users (eg, how fast can the average user send/receive data from the network). Although our interest is motivated by our work on distributed denial of service defense mechanisms [14, 24], such information is more generally useful. For example, if end users can estimate this information for different network paths then, given a choice between different mirrors, the user can choose the one with the best access characteristics.

To shed light on this trend, in this paper we present a large-scale measurement to study the ADNS deployment patterns of modern web services and examine the characteristics of different deployment styles, such as performance, life-cycle of servers, and availability. Furthermore, we focus specifically on the DNS deployment for subdomains hosted in IaaS clouds.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["336"]}

Our approach is designed to prevent Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks on wireless communications, particularly against multi-path communication in Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs). CapMan offers a mechanism for a per flow, distributed bandwidth control by all the participating nodes along multiple communication paths. By exchanging summary capability messages, each node can maintain a global view of the overall throughput of flows in the network, and then dynamically adjust local constraints to prevent potential DoS attacks against a specific node or the network. Our approach is capable of scalably curtailing sophisticated DoS attacks that target multi-path routing protocols, even in the case that both the initiator and the responder of a network flow are malicious insiders and collude to deprive the network of valuable resources.

Because such mechanisms are currently perceived as too expensive in terms of their performance impact, questions relating to the feasibility and value of such analysis remain unexplored and unanswered.We present a new mechanism for profiling the behavior space of an application by analyzing all function calls made by the process, including regular functions and library calls, as well as system calls.

Testbeds including Emulab [10], and Deter [5] are heavily used for both research and application testing. To scale even further and shed some of the limitations that the relative small number of physical nodes impose, researchers have turned to full virtualization [8] and lightweight, container-based virtualization [16, 10]. Virtualization allows running multiple virtual execution environments (VEEs) per physical host. In this paper, we evaluate the use of hundreds of lightweight containers as a testbed to measure the performance of simple applications. We show that, although economically and technically compelling, virtualization has some limitations due the sharing of host resources (CPU, network, memory and disk) among samehost VEEs. Determining the number of VEEs that can be deployed in a physical machine without interfering with the fidelity of the experiment is not a trivial task and it cannot be estimated or computed ahead of time using aggregate utilization of individual resource. Furthermore, monitoring the health of an experiment by measuring the individual resource utilization can affect the behavior of the service under test. Therefore, we observed what we call a \u201cweak\u201d form of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for host resource measurements: increasing the precision and fidelity of the resource measurements can interfere with the behavior of the experiment.

In this work, GMU introduces a containment based security enforcement mechanism designed to contain applications inside virtual containers, separating the running instance of a program from the rest of the system while providing a complete execution environment that supports monitoring, profiling, and controlling applications. A two-fold approach is taken towards these goals isolation through virtualization and resource management. Isolation addresses the containment of processes at process control and file system levels, whereas resource management handles accounting, profiling, and provisioning of system resources including CPU, memory, network, battery, and storage, etc. With these mechanisms in place, it is believed that a wide range of security policies can be effectively enforced to provide a secure and lightweight execution environment for applications for smart handheld devices.Descriptors:", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["336"]}

As a result, these organizations are currently employing both commercial products and open source Anonymizing Network Systems (ANS) as part of their standard network defenses to anonymize their outbound traffic. In this paper, we analyze the benefits and caveats of a typical deployment of an ANS. We call this the Case-Study Anonymizing Network System (CSANS) and we show that while network-level anonymity systems are better at protecting end-user privacy than having no ANS in place, they are unable to thwart de-anonymization attacks aimed at applications and private data of end-users. Indeed, the anonymity protection that ANS users enjoy can be bypassed by targeted attacks against both applications and users. To further explain our claims and quantify the different types of attacks and intruder capabilities, we introduce two threat models. We demonstrate and substantiate our claims using a targeted experiment against actual operational scenarios of users who are relying on the CSANS in a real organization to complete their research tasks. To that end, we set up an experiment to guide users (often referred to as researchers) to a website containing both non-malicious and malicious files. The downloading and opening of these files can enable an intruder to expose the true identities of the users even though the users were using a protected, isolated ANS connected machine.

{"title": "Approximating a Global Passive Adversary Against Tor\n", "abstract": " We present a novel, practical, and effective mechanism for exposing the IP address of Tor relays, clients and hidden services. We approximate an almost-global passive adversary (GPA) capable of eavesdropping anywhere in the network by using LinkWidth. LinkWidth allows network edge-attached entities to estimate the available bandwidth in an arbitrary Internet link without a cooperating peer host, router, or ISP. By modulating the bandwidth of an anonymous connection (eg, when the destination server or anonymous client is under our control), we can observe these fluctuations as they propagate through the Tor network and the Internet to the end-user\u2019s IP address. Our technique exploits one of the design criteria for Tor (trading off GPA-resistance for improved latency/bandwidth over MIXes) by allowing well-provisioned (in terms of bandwidth) adversaries to effectively become GPAs. Although timing-based attacks have been demonstrated against non-timing-preserving anonymity networks, they have depended either on a global passive adversary or on the compromise of a substantial number of Tor nodes. Our technique does not require compromise of any Tor nodes or collaboration of the endserver (for some scenarios). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in tracking the IP address of Tor users in a series of experiments. Even for an under-provisioned adversary with only few network vantage points, we can identify the end user (IP address)/hidden servers in many cases.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["336"]}

The ability for malcode to be automatically transformed into to a semantically equivalent variant frustrates attempts to construct a single, simple, easily verifiable representation. We present a quantitative analysis of the strengths and limitations of shellcode polymorphism and consider the impact of this analysis on the current practices in intrusion detection. Our examination focuses on the nature of shellcode decoding routines, and the empirical evidence we gather illustrates our main result: that the challenge of modeling the class of self-modifying code is likely intractable\u2013even when the size of the instruction sequence (ie, the decoder) is relatively small. We develop metrics to gauge the power of polymorphic engines and use them to provide insight into the strengths and weaknesses of some popular engines. We believe this analysis supplies a novel and useful way to understand the limitations of the current generation of signature-based techniques. We analyze some contemporary polymorphic techniques, explore ways to improve them in order to forecast the nature of future threats, and present our suggestions for countermeasures. Our results indicate that the class of polymorphic behavior is too greatly spread and varied to model effectively.

{"title": "Content distribution for seamless transmission\n", "abstract": " We introduce a new paradigm in information transmission, the concept of SEAMLESS TRANSMISSION, whereby any client in a network requesting a file starts receiving it immediately, and experiences no delays throughout the remainder of the downloading time. This notion is based on the partial caching concept [2] which was introduced to overcome some of the disadvantages of traditional cache replacement algorithms such as LRU and LRU-threshold [1]. The main idea of partial caching is to store an initial part of the file in the cache and to obtain the rest of the file from the origin server. To achieve the maximal retrieval performance of seamless transmission, clients must be prepared to re-sequence segments of the files received out of order. With this caveat, seamless transmission can be viewed as a way to implement strict quality of service (QoS) guarantees to all clients of a network. This paper gives a provably correct technique for achieving seamlessness for a given file located at the root node in a tree structured network. The SEAMLESS TRANSMISSION PROBLEM has interdependent, combinatorial allocation and scheduling subproblems. The solution to the allocation problem prescribes the subsets of file segments to be stored in different nodes in the network, and the solution to the deterministic scheduling problem specifies transmission schedules for each node based on the given allocation of file segments. In the systems being modeled, cache capacity is at a premium, so our goal is to find solutions that minimize required cache capacity without sacrificing seamless transmission.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["336"]}

The flexibility of MANETs comes at a price, when compared to wired and basestationbased wireless networks: MANETs are susceptible to both insider (compromised node) and outsider attacks due to the lack of a well-defined perimeter in which to deploy firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and other mechanisms commonly used for network access and admission control. In this paper, we define a distributed firewall architecture that is designed specifically for MANETs. Our approach harnesses and extends the concept of a network capability, and is especially suited for environments where the communicating nodes have different roles and hence different communication requirements, such as in tactical networks. Our model enforces communication restrictions among MANET nodes and services, allowing hopby-hop policy enforcement in a distributed manner.

In this paper, we examine the basic functions in Named Data Networking (NDN), a newly proposed Internet architecture, that can address the principle weaknesses in today's IP networks. We demonstrate by a new DDoS mitigation solution over NDN, Fine-grained Interest Traffic Throttling FITT, that NDN's architectural changes, even when incrementally deployed, can make DDoS attacks fundamentally more difficult to launch and less effective. FITT leverages the NDN design to enable the network to detect DDoS from victim's feedback, throttles DDoS traffic by reverse its exact paths through the network, and enforces control over the misbehaving entities at their sources.

{"title": "Resilient and scalable cloned app detection using forced execution and compression trees\n", "abstract": " Android markets have grown both in size and diversity, offering apps that are localized or curated for specific use cases. It is not uncommon for users to be unaware of the exact app version or name they should be installing. This has given rise to the threat of app cloning where adversaries copy the package of an app, minimally modify its code, and redistribute the clone on the market to gain a monetary advantage or to distribute malicious payloads. Existing clone detection methods use static signatures that can be evaded using control-and data-flow obfuscation. Moreover, many approaches do not scale with the number of apps, code size, and complexity, leading to prohibitive detection time requirements. In this paper, we introduce Dexsim, a dynamic analysis based system to accurately index apps and identify bytecode similarities.

With 38.9% of market share, Android is now the most used operating system not just in terms of mobile devices but considering all OSes. As applications' complexity and features increased, Android relied more heavily on code and data sharing among apps for faster response times and richer user experience. To achieve that, Android apps reuse functionality and data by means of inter-app message passing where each app defines the messages it expects to receive.

The clients reach the proxies via the public commodity Internet. The proxies and replicas could be implemented in VMs (or in containers within VMs) of one or more datacenters. The proxies in turn assign clients to replicas to fulfill their requests. The assignment is nominally via a DHT. The clients never know the IP addresses of the replicas, only the proxies.Threats can target either proxies (eg, a volumetric DDoS attack, preliminary probing) or replicas (protocol attack or a localized DoS attack such as Slowloris, ie, a single attacker can bring down the replica). A key assumption is that a server under attack cannot determine which of its assigned client (s) are responsible. This said, it can be reliably determined whether a server is under attack either through the use of probing \u201ccanary\u201d clients that can determine when response times of their mock workloads have grown too high, or by the OS of a VM (or hypervisor of a physical server) managing a number of containers (or VMs) in which proxies or replicas operate. New clients are never added to servers (either proxies or replicas) deemed under attack. Some attacking clients are simple bots that cannot cope with reassignment to a new server. For such bots, continual shuffling of clients to servers is a proactive defense.

{"title": "Mitigating the effect of free-riders in bittorrent using trusted agents\n", "abstract": " Even though Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems present a cost-effective and scalable solution to content distribution, most entertainment, media and software, content providers continue to rely on expensive, centralized solutions such as Content Delivery Networks. One of the main reasons is that the current P2P systems cannot guarantee reasonable performance as they depend on the willingness of users to contribute bandwidth. Moreover, even systems like BitTorrent, which employ a tit-for-tat protocol to encourage fair bandwidth exchange between users, are prone to free-riding (ie peers that do not upload). Our experiments on PlanetLab extend previous research [14, 12, 11] demonstrating that such selfish behavior can seriously degrade the performance of regular users in many more scenarios beyond simple free-riding: we observed an overhead of upto 430% for 80% of free-riding identities easily generated by a small set of selfish users. To mitigate the effects of selfish users, we propose a new P2P architecture that classifies peers with the help of a small number of trusted nodes that we call Trusted Auditors (TAs). TAs participate in P2P download like regular clients and detect free-riding identities by observing their neighbors\u2019 behavior. Using TAs, we can separate compliant users into a separate service pool resulting in better performance. Furthermore, we show that TAs are more effective ensuring the performance of the system than a mere increase in bandwidth capacity: for 80% of freeriding identities a single-TA system has a 6% download time overhead while without the TA and three times the bandwidth capacity we measure a 100% overhead.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["336"]}

However, this scalability comes at the expense of increased vulnerability to specific types of attacks. In this paper, we focus on insider denial of service (DoS) attacks on such systems. In these attacks, nodes that are part of the DHT system are compromised and used to flood other nodes in the DHT with excessive request traffic. We devise a distributed lightweight protocol that detects such attacks, implemented solely within nodes that participate in the DHT. Our approach exploits inherent structural invariants of DHTs to ferret out attacking nodes whose request patterns deviate from \u201cnormal\u201d behavior. We evaluate our protocol\u2019s ability to detect attackers via simulation within a Chord network. The results show that our system can detect a simple attacker whose attack traffic deviates by as little as 5% from a normal request traffic. We also demonstrate the resiliency of our protocol to coordinated attacks by up to as many as 25% of nodes.

However, past studies have shown that classifier-based detection systems are susceptible to evasion attacks in practice. Improving the evasion resistance of learning based systems is an open problem. In this paper, we analyze the effects of mimicry attacks on real-world classifiers. To counter such attacks, we introduce a novel approach that not only exposes attempts to evade the classifier, but also evaluates the ability of the system to operate reliably. We advance mutual agreement analysis for ensemble classifiers: during the detection operation, when a sufficient number of votes from individual classifiers disagree, the ensemble classifier prediction is shown to be unreliable. This method allows the detection of classifier evasion without additional external information. To evaluate our approach, we used thousands of both malicious and benign PDF documents. Applying our method to two recent evasion attack studies, we show that most evasion scenarios are detected. Furthermore, we show that our approach can be generalized to weaken the effectiveness of the Gradient Descent and Kernel Density Estimation attacks against Support Vector Machines (SVM) by creating an ensemble classifier using many base SVMs. We discovered that feature bagging is the most important property for enabling mutual agreement based evasion detection.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["336"]}

{"title": "Countering DDoS Attacks with Multi-Path Overlay Networks\n", "abstract": " Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) has emerged as a major threat to the operation of online network services [1, 2, 3]. Current forms of DDoS attacks implicate multiple groups of Internet machines that have been taken over and controlled by an attacker. These machines, called bots, are manipulated by the attacker to produce an excessive surge of traffic toward a target server, the victim. The target server is forced to processing and/or to link-capacity starvation, since malicious traffic is blended with normal traffic, making it difficult to weed out. Figure 1 depicts a DDoS attack and its impact on the target server. Unfortunately, DDoS attacks can only become worse: Despite network and processing speeds that increase with every passing day, real-world botnet sizes and attack capabilities increase at the same rate. Furthermore, attackers devise sophisticated software to infect and subsequently control thousands of infected machines while remaining stealthy.[4] Addressing the network (DDoS) problem is extremely hard, given the fundamentally open nature of the Internet and the apparent reluctance of router vendors and network operators to deploy and operate new, potentially complex mechanisms.[5] Overlay-based approaches such as Secure Overlay Services (SOS)[6], funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF Grant ITR CNS-04-26623); I3 [7]; and MayDay (Distributed Filtering for Internet Services)[8] offer an attractive alternative, as they do not require changes to the existing routing infrastructure.

{"title": "Document Content Layout Based Exploit Protections\n", "abstract": " Malware laden documents are a common exploit vector, especially in targeted attacks. Most current approaches seek to detect the malicious attributes of documents whether through signature matching, dynamic analysis, or machine learning. We take a different approach: we perform transformations on documents that render exploits inoperable while maintaining the visual interpretation of the document intact. Our exploit mitigation techniques are similar in effect to address space layout randomization, but we implement them through permutations to the document layout. Using document content layout randomization, we randomize the data block layout of Microsoft OLE files in a manner similar to the inverse of a file system defragmention tool. This relocates malicious payloads in both the original document file and in the memory of the reader program. We demonstrate that our approach indeed subdues in the wild exploits by manual validation of both Office 2003 and Office 2007 malicious documents while the transformed documents continue to render benign content properly. The document transformation can be performed offline and requires only a single document scan while the user-perceived delay when opening the transformed document is negligible. We also show that it is possible to thwart malicious heap sprays by injecting benign content in documents. This approach, however, comes at an expense of computational and memory resources.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["336"]}
{"title": "Switchwall: automated topology fingerprinting and behavior deviation identification\n", "abstract": " The continuous improvement of bandwidth, pervasiveness, and functionality of network switching technologies is deeply changing the Internet landscape. Indeed, it has become tedious and sometimes infeasible to manually assure the network integrity on a regular basis: existing hardware and software can be tampered with and new devices can be connected or become nonoperational without any notification. Moreover, changes in the network topology can be introduced by human error, by hardware or software failures, or even by a malicious adversary (e.g. rogue systems).               In this paper, we introduce Switchwall, an Ethernet-based network fingerprinting technique that detects unauthorized changes to the L2/L3 network topology, the active devices, and the availability of an Enterprise network. The network map is generated at an initial known state and is then periodically verified to detect\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["336"]}
{"title": "Decryptable to Your Eyes: Visualization of Security Protocols at the User Interface\n", "abstract": " The design of authentication protocols, for online banking services in particular and any service that is of sensitive nature in general, is quite challenging. Indeed, enforcing security guarantees has overhead thus imposing additional computation and design considerations that do not always meet usability and user requirements. On the other hand, relaxing assumptions and rigorous security design to improve the user experience can lead to security breaches that can harm the users' trust in the system. In this paper, we demonstrate how careful visualization design can enhance not only the security but also the usability of the authentication process. To that end, we propose a family of visualized authentication protocols, a visualized transaction verification, and a \"decryptable to your eyes only\" protocol. Through rigorous analysis, we verify that our protocols are immune to many of the challenging authentication attacks applicable in the literature. Furthermore, using an extensive case study on a prototype of our protocols, we highlight the potential of our approach for real-world deployment: we were able to achieve a high level of usability while satisfying stringent security requirements.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["336"]}
{"title": "Specifying Time-Out Points in Surgical EMRs\u2013Work in Progress\n", "abstract": " Workflows for surgical procedures have built-in time-out points to minimize occurrences of unintended faults and omissions during surgeries. They have been recommended in the best practices of appropriate surgical sub-specialties, as well as the Joint Commission. At these timeout points, designated team members perform recommended precautionary measures, such as verifying the accuracy of implants, to ensure unintended mistakes are not made before proceeding to the next stage. These precautionary measures are usually recorded in paper-based checklists and retained for a stipulated period of time. We show how these timeout points can be specified as formal workflow requirements in surgical Electronic Medical Records (S-EMRs).", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["336"]}

{"title": "NetGator: Malware Detection Through Program Interactive Proofs\n", "abstract": " Exfiltration of data using internet-borne attacks has become a credible threat for organization and enterprises. History has shown that crafted targeted attacks and zero-day malware are capable of penetrating even the most sophisticated defenses. To make matters worse, intrusion detection systems that perform analysis of network traffic are dependent on the timely information provided by blacklisting, signature schemes, or anomaly patterns. This is especially true for heavily used communication protocols where blocking decisions affect the everyday operations of the organization. Even when the intrusion is detected in a timely manner, valuable data might have already been stolen.In this paper, we propose a new approach to distinguish legitimate browser software from malware that generates identical network traffic signatures. Our system consists of two parts: a signature-based passive detection module, and a module that issues Program Interactive Challenges (PICs) to client applications. Initially, we perform passive detection utilizing content inspection techniques that analyze network header element order. Of course this is not enough: we demonstrate that passive detection can be easily subverted. To amend that, we introduce an interactive detection module in the form of inline network proxy that challenges the detected browser forcing it to exercise known specific internal functionality. For browsers, we can leverage HTML, Flash, Javascript and other common browser components to form challenges that malware will not be able to respond to due to lack of functionality. Contrary to interractive challenges, our challenges are transparent to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["336"]}
{"title": "Small World VoIP\n", "abstract": " We present the analysis and design of a Small World VoIP system (SW-VoIP) which is geared towards customers that are communicating with their Small World of social contacts. We use the term Small World to refer to the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network of a client and his contacts both incoming and outbound. We reconstruct the small world of a user by collecting calling patterns over a configurable period of time. We enable user mobility by using a stepwise social identity to an IP address binding propagation model. We propose an efficient algorithm to locate users by electing popular users and leveraging the users closeness. We also introduce a self-stabilized load balancing mechanism to optimize the system performance under heavy network traffic. We evaluate our SW-VoIP system performance by simulating the user\u2019s lookup process using real-world telephone logs.

{"title": "Pushback for overlay networks: protecting against malicious insiders\n", "abstract": " Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlay networks are a flexible way of creating decentralized services. Although resilient to external Denial of Service attacks, overlay networks can be rendered inoperable by simple flooding attacks generated from insider nodes.             In this paper, we study detection and containment mechanisms against insider Denial of Service (DoS) attacks for overlay networks. To counter such attacks, we introduce novel mechanisms for protecting overlay networks that exhibit well defined properties due to their structure against non-conforming (abnormal) behavior of participating nodes. We use a lightweight distributed detection mechanism that exploits inherent structural invariants of DHTs to ferret out anomalous flow behavior.             We evaluate our mechanism\u2019s ability to detect attackers using our prototype implementation on web traces from IRCache served by a DHT network.
