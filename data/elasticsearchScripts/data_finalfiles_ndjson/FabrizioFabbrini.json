{"title": "Teleradiology in Europe\n", "abstract": " The new concept of teleradiology is centered on the consideration that it involves management of medical information rather than the simple transmission of diagnostic images from one location to another. Teleradiology must therefore be able to contribute to the seamless integration of the digital environment in which medical data are managed throughout and beyond the hospital, generating value added services for the patients as well as prospective economical benefits for the institution. In this perspective the evolution of telecommunication with the spectacular success of mobile telephony and Internet will play and increasingly important role, by allowing further development in the exchange of multimedia medical information on a regional as well as international level. However, new responsibilities are being given to the radiologists, who must take all necessary technical and organizational actions in order to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "49\n", "authors": ["1367"]}
{"title": "Software sustainability from a process-centric perspective\n", "abstract": " ICT significantly contributes to the global carbon dioxide production. In the last years the research addressed the problem of increasing ICT sustainability from different perspectives. In this paper this problem is addressed from a software process perspective. Sustainability of software process is approached in a systematic way by defining a core set of processes that represent the activities to be performed in order to introduce and integrate the greenness culture in an organization developing software. The processes have been defined so that they can be measured in terms of process capability according to the ISO/IEC 15504 standard. The relationships between process capability and sustainability are discussed as well.", "num_citations": "34\n", "authors": ["1367"]}

European car makers approach this issue by checking the capability of the suppliers' software process. Fiat Auto, since the year 2001, has been taking proactive actions to address the situation. The basic strategy has been to set up criteria for qualifying software suppliers based on measuring the capability of their software processes. In this article, this qualification mechanism is described in detail. The innovative aspect of the approach is to consider the results of a SPICE (ISO/IEC 15504) assessment as one of the contractual requirements to let a software company become eligible for software supplies. As a positive effect, the assessments made on the software process have allowed Fiat Auto to select suppliers on the basis of some objective and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "23\n", "authors": ["1367"]}

One of the aspects not yet sufficiently addressed in literature is the sustainability of the software lifecycle. In this paper, we focus on the sustainability management of software development projects. In the practice, software development projects are managed by considering principally parameters as time, costs and quality of work products. We propose a methodological approach aimed at identifying sustainability indicators to be used in project management to set up sustainability objectives for a software development project, to control their achievement during the project itself and, possibly, to adopt corrective actions to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1367"]}

Joint reviews and software process assessments (mostly performed according to the Automotive SPICE model) are popular means used by car manufacturers and their suppliers of software-intensive components to face such a situation. Often these two resource-consuming techniques are performed separately, without mutual support or interaction. This paper presents an approach to integrating joint reviews with software process assessment results.

{"title": "Process scenarios in open source software certification\n", "abstract": " Certification of Open Source Software (OSS) presents inherent trade-offs due to the necessity of precisely identifying both a product and an independent certification agent, and on the other of maintain the peculiar, valuable OSS characteristic of being available to an unlimited multiplicity of actors for trial, use and change. This is an intriguing challenge, usually solved by removing from the picture the certifying agent and providing an intrinsic certification by means of rigorous, reapplicable property demonstrations, adopting Formal Methods (FM) in expressing and verifying the code. As such approach, yet quite valuable and good-promising, has some restrictions (such as the limited set of provable product qualities), we propose to tackle the problem by analysing the various processes executed by different OSS stakeholders, including the process of an independent Certification Body. In the paper some kinds of representative scenarios in which such processes interleave are presented and discussed. The aim is to introduce a process-centered perspective for OSS that can stimulate research to further understand and mitigate the mentioned trade-offs.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1367"]}
