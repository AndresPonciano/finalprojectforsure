{"title": "Micro-payments based on iKP\n", "abstract": " Micro-payments are payments too small in amount to warrant the overhead costs of current nancial clearing networks. Furthermore one can expect that content servers for the global information infrastructure (GII) will have to process so many of these low value transactions that computationally complex and costly cryptographic protocols will be impractical. This report proposes a micro-payment scheme that can be bootstrapped with the already wellknown payment protocols for larger amounts, but does not depend on them for each microtransaction. Special attention is given to its integration into IBM's Internet Keyed Payment Systems (iKP).", "num_citations": "213\n", "authors": ["860"]}
{"title": "Secure anonymous information exchange in a network\n", "abstract": " Computer network management for electronic commerce requires technical implementations of business processes. The process addressed here is a technical method for a communication in which two or more parties legitimately want to communicate anonymously, often before discussing a deal or closing a business, eg for anonymous bidding or auctioning in electronic commerce. Essentially, the invention is a method, described by a protocol, for safely exchanging data in a network that provides a public key infrastructure and an anonymous communication possibility between network users. It consists of a sequence of steps in which both sender (eg customer) and addressee (eg merchant) compose data sets (ie, requests and replies) that are based on received data and/or prior knowledge. The data sets are enciphered to provide anonymity, and digitally signed to provide proof of the partner. The invention is\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "171\n", "authors": ["860"]}

The protocol requires the exchange of only two messages between the user desiring the key change and the server, the user's request including, at least partly encrypted, an identification of the sending user, old and new keys, and two nonces, at least one including a time indication. The authentication server's response includes a possibly encrypted accept/reject indication and the regularly encrypted request from the user.", "num_citations": "154\n", "authors": ["860"]}
{"title": "Method and Devices For User Authentication\n", "abstract": " For authenticating a user using a communication terminal (1) to access a server (4) via a telecommunications network, a personal identification code is received from the user From secure session establishment protocol messages exchanged (S1, S2, S3) between the communication terminal (1) and the server (4), a data set is generated (S4). Based on the data set, a transaction authentication number is generated (S52) using the personal identification code. The transaction authentication number is transmitted (S54) from the communication terminal (1) to the server (4). In the server (4), the transaction authentication number received is verified (S20) based on the secure session establishment protocol messages exchanged with the communication terminal (1). The transaction authentication number enables session aware user authentication that protects online users against real-time man-in-the-middle attacks.", "num_citations": "123\n", "authors": ["860"]}

More and more, the magnitude of financial transfers between these two partners are determined by some electronic licensing service being part of the system on which the licensed software is running. In order to ease the use and management of such licensing schemes and to enable economic software usage in enterprise-wide computer systems through flexible and fair billing structures, various organizations are working on formulating requirements, defining architectures, and building standard interfaces for so called license brokerage systems. The trustworthiness of these services is essential because large amounts of money can depend on them. Most of these licensing services are currently operating independently of access control and rely on proprietary and unpublished security algorithms.

The expectations reach as far as that information will have an importance to the coming society similar to that of \u201cmoney\u201d to a market economy.This article discusses some ingredients in the worldwide information infrastructure in which information is expected to assume such an important role, and it lists some of the issues that have to be solved before such statements can become true. First, the distribution of information over open computer networks such as the Internet is under focus. Then, access by users to information and ways to reward the information creator financially for granting such access are discussed. Next, not only the decision on disclosure, but also the control on the duration and intensity of the information usage is discussed.

More and more, software licensing is performed electronically by mechanisms running on the system on which the licensed software operates. In order to facilitate the use and management of such licensing systems and to enable economic software usage in enterprise-wide computer systems, various organizations are formulating requirements and defining architectures and standard interfaces for license systems. The trustworthiness of these systems is essential because large amounts of revenue can depend on them. A long term solution called Stateful Access Control (SAC) has been proposed, which aims for maximal flexibility in the definition of the license policy and still minimizes the restrictions inferred by the system. To achieve a satisfactory long-term solution like SAC requires a perfectly orchestrated effort by all partners\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "30\n", "authors": ["860"]}

An implementation of the metasystem is, for example, available in the .NET Framework 3.0. It interfaces to the user by providing an identity selector named CardSpace (formerly codenamed InfoCard). Various applications can make use of CardSpace, including, for example, Microsoft Internet Explorer 7. We therefore expect Microsoft's identity metasystem and CardSpace to become widely deployed on the Internet and a popular target to attack. In this paper, we elaborate on the security of Microsoft's identity metasystem and CardSpace.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["860"]}

While this is su cient for some purposes, many future applications will need more sophisticated processing on the user side before server-data can be presented to the user or before the user input can be transferred to the servers. For example, electronic payments ought to be seamlessly integrated into a customer's browser to enable him to shop via the Web. This paper proposes two pragmatic approaches to ful ll these requirements without altering current browser technology. We conclude with the proposal of a generalized extension framework for WWW browsers.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["860"]}
{"title": "Verification and modelling of authentication protocols\n", "abstract": " With the emergence of numerous distributed services, the importance of electronic authentication in networks is rapidly increasing. Many authentication protocols have been proposed and discussed. Burrows, Abadi and Needham [BAN1] created a logic of authentication to formally analyze authentication protocols. This BAN-logic has been subject to critique and several extensions have been suggested. Nonetheless, due to its straightforward design and its ease-of-use, it attracts the attention of current research. In this paper, an authentication logic is proposed which is built closely after the BAN-logic. It addresses answers to important criticisms of BAN like the non-disclosure problem, and avoids some newly discovered weaknesses of BAN, e.g. with respect to freshness. It also does not require any idealization which is a major hurdle to the correct usage of BAN. This extended BAN-logic is instrumented as a\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["860"]}

The main idea is to make the user authentication depend not only on the user's credentials, but also on state information related to the SSL/TLS session in which the credentials are transferred to the server. This, in turn, allows the server to detect inconsistencies caused by an MITM. There are many possibilities to implement TLS\u2010SA and to make a user authentication scheme be SSL/TLS session\u2010aware. In this paper, we take the challenge\u2010response (C/R) feature of the Europay International, MasterCard, and Visa (EMV) Chip Authentication Program (CAP) as an example, and we argue that a TLS\u2010SA implementation for this feature is appropriate but susceptible to challenge collision attacks.
