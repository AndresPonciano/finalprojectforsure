{"title": "Using coverage information to guide test case selection in adaptive random testing\n", "abstract": " Random Testing (RT) is a fundamental software testing technique. Adaptive Random Testing (ART) improves the fault-detection capability of RT by employing the location information of previously executed test cases. Compared with RT, test cases generated in ART are more evenly spread across the input domain. ART has conventionally been applied to programs that have only numerical input types, because the distance between numerical inputs is readily measurable. The vast majority of computer programs, however, involve non-numerical inputs. To apply ART to these programs requires the development of effective new distance measures. Different from those measures that focus on the concrete values of program inputs, in this paper we propose a method to measure the distance using coverage information. The proposed method enables ART to be applied to all kinds of programs regardless of their input\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "73\n", "authors": ["1825"]}
{"title": "On the fault-detection capabilities of adaptive random test case prioritization: Case studies with large test suites\n", "abstract": " An adaptive random (AR) testing strategy has recently been developed and examined by a growing body of research. More recently, this strategy has been applied to prioritizing regression test cases based on code coverage using the concepts of Jaccard Distance (JD) and Coverage Manhattan Distance (CMD). Code coverage, however, does not consider frequency, furthermore, comparison between JD and CMD has not yet been made. This research fills the gap by first investigating the fault-detection capabilities of using frequency information for AR test case prioritization, and then comparing JD and CMD. Experimental results show that \"coverage\" was more useful than \"frequency\" although the latter can sometimes complement the former, and that CMD was superior to JD. It is also found that, for certain faults, the conventional \"additional\" algorithm (widely accepted as one of the best algorithms for test case\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "39\n", "authors": ["1825"]}
{"title": "Metamorphic testing of navigation software: A pilot study with Google Maps\n", "abstract": " Millions of people use navigation software every day to commute and travel. In addition, many systems rely upon the correctness of navigation software to function, ranging from directions applications to self-driving machinery. Navigation software is difficult to test because it is hard or very expensive to evaluate its output. This difficulty is generally known as the oracle problem, a fundamental challenge in software testing. In this study, we propose a metamorphic testing strategy to alleviate the oracle problem in testing navigation software, and conduct a case study by testing the Google Maps mobile app, its web service API, and its graphical user interface. The results show that our strategy is effective with the detection of several real-life bugs in Google Maps. This study is the first work on automated testing of navigation software with the detection of real-life bugs.", "num_citations": "23\n", "authors": ["1825"]}
{"title": "Metamorphic testing for machine translations: MT4MT\n", "abstract": " Automated machine translation software and services have become widely available and increasingly popular. Due to the complexity and flexibility of natural languages, automated testing and quality assessment of this type of software is extremely challenging, especially in the absence of a human oracle or a reference translation. Furthermore, even if a reference translation is available, some major evaluation metrics, such as BLEU, are not reliable on short sentences, the type of sentence now prevailing on the Internet. To alleviate these problems, we have been using a metamorphic testing technique to test machine translation services in a fully automatic way without the involvement of any human assessor or reference translation.

In parallel with their popularity, the complexity of aesthetics and functionality of web applications have also increased significantly, creating a big challenge for maintenance and cross-browser compliance testing. Since such testing and verification activities require visual analysis, web application testing has not been sufficiently automated. In this paper, we propose a novel pairwise image comparison approach suitable for web application testing where the location of layout faults needs to be detected efficiently while insignificant variations being neglected. This technique is developed based on the characteristics of fault patterns of browser layouts.

Our method uses metamorphic relations to check software output for erroneous input in the absence of a tangible test oracle. We use this technique to test two major citation database systems: Scopus and the Web of Science. We report a surprising finding that the inclusion of hyphens in paper titles impedes citation counts, and that this is a result of the lack of robustness of the citation database systems in handling hyphenated paper titles. Our results are valid for the entire literature as well as for individual fields such as chemistry. We further find a strong and significant negative correlation between the journal impact factor (JIF) of IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE) and the percentage of hyphenated paper titles published in TSE.

{"title": "A cost-effective software testing strategy employing online feedback information\n", "abstract": " An online partitioning strategy is presented, in which test cases are selected based on feedback information collected during the testing process. The strategy differs from conventional approaches because the partitioning is performed online rather than off-line and because the partitioning is not based on program code or specifications. It can, therefore, be implemented in the absence of the source code or specification of the program under test. The cost-effectiveness of the proposed strategy has been empirically investigated with a set of subject programs, namely, SPACE, SED, GREP, and the Siemens Suite of Programs.

{"title": "A Monte Carlo method for metamorphic testing of machine translation services\n", "abstract": " With the growing popularity of machine translation services, it has become increasingly important to be able to assess their quality. However, the test oracle problem makes it difficult to conduct automated testing. In this paper, we propose a Monte Carlo method, in combination with metamorphic testing, to overcome the oracle problem. Using this method, we assessed the quality of three popular machine translation services - namely, Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, and Youdao Translate. We set the source language to be English, and the target languages included Chinese, French, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish. A sample of 33,600 observations (involving a total of 100,800 actual translations) was collected and analyzed using a 3 x 56 factorial design.

{"title": "High resolution SOM approach to improving anomaly detection in intrusion detection systems\n", "abstract": " Machine learning in general and artificial neural networks in particular are commonly used to address the problem of detecting anomalies in intrusion detection systems. Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) have been shown to be a promising tool for this purpose, but the limitation of the cardinality of their display space has resulted in SOMs being a black box method and impeded the design of a simpler network architecture. High resolution SOMs are a very recent development that can overcome these problems. This paper explores how high resolution SOMs can help with anomaly detection in intrusion detection systems. Experiments on a large and well established benchmark problem show that high resolution SOMs improve results while allowing a simple network architecture. It is also shown that high resolution SOMs allow the development of better understanding of the results and the problem domain.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1825"]}

Software testing and analysis, however, is a very involved task. As the size and complexity of software continue to grow, manual testing becomes very tedious. Automation of software testing and tool support for testing, therefore, have been emerging as a key technology to quality assurance of today's software industry.

This paper presents an automated testing method, termed metamorphic fuzz testing (MFT), in the context of simulation testing of autonomous driving. MFT differs from existing fuzzing techniques in the following two stages: First, it can generate\" unrealistic\" scenarios where scenes of the virtual world are refreshed frequently (so obstacles can suddenly appear/disappear)---this is to test the self-driving vehicle's robustness in the face of unexpected situations. In the second stage, MFT uses metamorphic relations as a filtering or debugging tool to distinguish between genuine failures and false alarms yielded in the first stage. We conduct empirical studies using the real-life Baidu Apollo self-driving system, recording a genuine failure rate of 3.7%.

{"title": "Introduction to the special issue on test oracles\n", "abstract": " Software testing is the de facto technique for correctness verification. Although there are different motivations and approaches to testing, fundamentally, it involves the running of test cases against the software under test. An important aspect is the ability to tell whether the execution results agree with the expected outcomes. The mechanism to determine the correctness of the results is called a test oracle. Unfortunately, such a mechanism does not always exist or may exist but cannot be feasibly used, which is known as the oracle problem. This is a major challenge to software testers, severely curtailing the application of testing approaches and methods to practical situations.  In spite of the vast amount of interest in software testing, studies on test oracles drew much less attention than other aspects of software testing until quite recently.

Method The effect of PMTCT program conducted by Yunnan Province and Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center from 2005to 2012was quantitatively analyzed. Results Of a total of 1861HIV positive women received PMTCT at the program sites, 72.7%(1353/1861) initiated HAART during pregnancy. Of the 1584children who had HIV testing results, 25 (1.58%) were HIV positive. Of the 1168children whose mothers initiated HAART prophylaxis in pregnancy, 9 (0.77%) were infected. For children whose mothers initiated HAART before 28weeks of pregnancy, only 2 (0.22%) were HIV positive. Conclusion HAART prophylaxis is highly effective in preventing mother to child transmission of HIV. Our program results suggest that if HAART prophylaxis is initiated before 28 weeks of pregnancy, mother to child transmission of HIV can be virtually eliminated.

Obfuscators are a type of software that can be as important as compilers, but the testing of obfuscators was almost never studied in the past.

{"title": "Similarity-based search for model checking: a pilot study with Java Pathfinder\n", "abstract": " When a model checker cannot explore the entire state space because of limited resources, model checking becomes a kind of testing with an attempt to find a failure (violation of properties) quickly. We consider two state sequences in model checking: (i) the sequence in which new states are generated, and (ii) the sequence in which the states generated in sequence (i) are checked for property violation. We observe that neighboring states in sequence (i) often have similarities in certain ways. Based on this observation we propose a search strategy, which generates sequence (ii) in such a way that similar states are evenly spread over the sequence. As a result, neighboring states in sequence (ii) can have a higher diversity. A pilot empirical study with Java Path Finder suggests that the proposed strategy can outperform random search in terms of creating equal or smaller number of states to detect a failure.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1825"]}
