{"title": "Conceptual support for test case design\n", "abstract": " A system has been developed to support the design of test cases in the black box testing field. Designing test cases for large-scale software requires knowledge, not only of the functions of the tested, but also of the associated software and hardware. In the black box testing, test case designs are based on the external specifications or manuals. However, since not all of the factors influencing program operations (called input conditions) are described in the external specifications, the omission of test cases are liable to occurr. Several methodologies of test data selection have been proposed to date, but the problem of how to extract the input conditions of a program remains to be solved. The test case design support system described in this paper attempts to solve this problem by accumulating and utilizing the knowledge needed to design test cases and by generating test cases automatically based on the concepts of experimental design.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["1272"]}
