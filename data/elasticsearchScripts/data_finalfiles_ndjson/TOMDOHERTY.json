Integrated into the analysis framework ROOT, TMVA is a toolkit which hosts a large variety of multivariate classification algorithms. Training, testing, performance evaluation and application of all available classifiers is carried out simultaneously via user-friendly interfaces. With version 4, TMVA has been extended to multivariate regression of a real-valued target vector. Regression is invoked through the same user interfaces as classification.

The cluster formation follows cell signal-significance patterns generated by electromagnetic and hadronic showers. In this, the clustering algorithm implicitly performs a topological noise suppression by removing cells with insignificant signals which are not in close proximity to cells with significant signals. The resulting topological cell clusters have shape and location information, which is exploited to apply a local energy calibration and corrections depending on the nature of the cluster. Topological cell clustering is established as a well-performing calorimeter signal definition for jet and missing transverse momentum reconstruction in ATLAS.", "num_citations": "1949\n", "authors": ["3"]}

It is one of the few publications currently available that gives equal treatment to both fields, while remaining accessible to undergraduates. Early chapters cover basic concepts of nuclear and particle physics, before describing their respective phenomenologies and experimental methods. Later chapters interpret data through models and theories, such as the standard model of particle physics, and the liquid drop and shell models of nuclear physics, and also discuss many applications of both fields. The concluding two chapters deal with practical applications and outstanding issues, including extensions to the standard model, implications for particle astrophysics, improvements in medical imaging, and prospects for power production. There are a number of useful appendices.

The search uses the 2015 LHC  collision data at a center-of-mass energy of  TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb. The analysis targets two types of signal models: gluino-mediated pair production of stops with a nearly mass-degenerate stop and neutralino; and direct pair production of stops, decaying to the top quark and the lightest neutralino. The experimental signature in both signal scenarios is similar to that of a top quark pair produced in association with large missing transverse momentum. No significant excess over the Standard Model background prediction is observed, and exclusion limits on gluino and stop masses are set at 95% confidence level. The results extend the LHC Run-1 exclusion limit on the gluino mass up to 1460 GeV in the gluino-mediated scenario in the high gluino and low stop mass region, and add an excluded stop mass region from 745 to 780 GeV for the direct stop model with a massless lightest neutralino.

The main changes with respect to the experimental results presented in summer 2001 are updates to the Z-pole heavy flavour results from SLD and LEP, and new combinations of results above the Z pole. A new investigation of the interference of photon and Z-boson exchange is presented. For the first time, colour reconnection and Bose-Einstein correlation analyses in W-pair production are combined. The results are compared with precise electroweak measurements from other experiments, notably the recent final result on the electroweak mixing angle determined in neutrino-nucleon scattering by the NuTeV collaboration.

Methodology We conducted a Phase Ia, non-randomized clinical trial in 16 healthy, malaria-na\u251c\u00bbve adults of the chimpanzee adenovirus 63 (ChAd63) and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) replication-deficient viral vectored vaccines encoding two alleles (3D7 and FVO) of the P. falciparum blood-stage malaria antigen; apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1). ChAd63-MVA AMA1 administered in a heterologous prime-boost regime was shown to be safe and immunogenic, inducing high-level T cell responses to both alleles 3D7 (median 2036 SFU/million PBMC) and FVO (median 1539 SFU/million PBMC), with a mixed CD4+/CD8+ phenotype, as well as substantial AMA1-specific serum IgG responses (medians of 49 \u252c\u2561g/mL and 41 \u252c\u2561g/mL for 3D7 and FVO AMA1 respectively) that demonstrated growth inhibitory activity in vitro\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "167\n", "authors": ["3"]}

At the two-week follow-up, 28.9% of the P/S treated children but none of the CGP56697-treated children carried gametocytes (P 0.0001). This study showed that CGP56697 is safe in African children with acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria, clears parasites more rapidly than P/S, and results in fewer gametocyte carriers.

Maximal strength was assessed via an isometric mid-thigh pull (IMTP). Isometric mid-thigh pull testing involved trials with peak force (IPF), maximum rate of force development (mRFD), impulse at 100 ms (IP 100) and 300 ms (IP 300) determined. Sprint and COD performance was measured using 5-and 20-m sprint performance, and a modified 505 test. Relationships between variables (IMTP, sprint and COD) were analysed using Pearson\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s product\u0393\u00c7\u00f4moment correlation.

The analysis uses data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.12 fb^-1 of sqrt(s) = 7 TeV proton-proton collisions. The diphoton invariant mass spectrum is observed to be in good agreement with the expected Standard Model background. In the large extra dimension scenario of Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos and Dvali, the results provide 95% CL lower limits on the fundamental Planck scale between 2.27 and 3.53 TeV, depending on the number of extra dimensions and the theoretical formalism used. The results also set 95% CL lower limits on the lightest Randall-Sundrum graviton mass of between 0.79 and 1.85 TeV, for values of the dimensionless coupling k/\\bar{M}_{Pl} varying from 0.01 to 0.1. Combining with previously published ATLAS results from the dielectron and dimuon final states, the 95% CL lower limit on the Randall-Sundrum graviton mass for k/\\bar{M}_{Pl} = 0.01 (0.1) is 0.80 (1.95) TeV.", "num_citations": "105\n", "authors": ["3"]}

The smallness of neutrino masses and the large lepton flavor violation associated with neutrino mixing are both fundamental properties that give insights into modifications of current theories. Other possibilities that may reveal themselves in the neutrino sector include extra\" sterile\" neutrinos, CP violation in the neutrino mixing matrix, and CPT violation associated with the neutrino mass hierarchy. Since neutrino oscillations have now been established, the next step is to map out the parameters associated with neutrino masses and mixings. The experimental program to accomplish this goal will require a wide range of experiments using neutrinos from solar, atmospheric, reactor, and accelerator sources. Due to the relations between these various measurements, it will be important for the world-wide community to set up a structured program to work through the experimental measurements in a coherent and logical manner. The existing experimental results fit rather nicely into a picture with three massive neutrinos, which corresponds to the simplest scenario for three generations (for recent global analyses see, eg, References [1, 2]).

HERA has been a machine of excellence for the study of QCD and the structure of the proton. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which will collide protons with a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV, will be completed at CERN in 2007. The main mission of the LHC is to discover and study the mechanisms of electroweak symmetry breaking, possibly via the discovery of the Higgs particle, and search for new physics in the TeV energy scale, such as supersymmetry or extra dimensions. Besides these goals, the LHC will also make a substantial number of precision measurements and will offer a new regime to study the strong force via perturbative QCD processes and diffraction. For the full LHC physics programme a good understanding of QCD phenomena and the structure function of the proton is essential. Therefore, in March 2004, a one-year-long workshop started to study the implications of HERA on LHC physics.

This is due to the relatively large interaction cross sections of these high-energy neutrinos and to the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect. The LPM effect causes a significant decrease in the cross sections for bremsstrahlung and pair production, allowing charged-current electron-neutrino-induced showers occurring deep in the Earth's crust to be detectable as they exit the Earth into the atmosphere. A search for upward-going neutrino-induced showers in the HiRes-II monocular data set has yielded a null result. From an LPM calculation of the energy spectrum of charged particles as a function of primary energy and depth for electron-induced showers in rock, we calculate the shape of the resulting profile of these showers\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "64\n", "authors": ["3"]}

We see no evidence of the existence of such long-lived particles and interpret this search as a quasi model-independent limit on their production cross section, as well as a limit on a long-lived fourth generation quark.", "num_citations": "63\n", "authors": ["3"]}

{"title": "Workshop on CP Studies andNon-Standard Higgs Physics: CERN, Geneva, Switzerland 14-15 May 2004\n", "abstract": " There are many possibilities for new physics beyond the Standard Model that feature non-standard Higgs sectors. These may introduce new sources of CP violation, and there may be mixing between multiple Higgs bosons or other new scalar bosons. Alternatively, the Higgs may be a composite state, or there may even be no Higgs at all. These non-standard Higgs scenarios have important implications for collider physics as well as for cosmology, and understanding their phenomenology is essential for a full comprehension of electroweak symmetry breaking. This report discusses the most relevant theories which go beyond the Standard Model and its minimal, CP-conserving supersymmetric extension: two-Higgs-doublet models and minimal supersymmetric models with CP violation, supersymmetric models with an extra singlet, models with extra gauge groups or Higgs triplets, Little Higgs models, models in extra dimensions, and models with technicolour or other new strong dynamics. For each of these scenarios, this report presents an introduction to the phenomenology, followed by contributions on more detailed theoretical aspects and studies of possible experimental signatures at the LHC and other colliders.", "num_citations": "63\n", "authors": ["3"]}

Design and Methods: Twenty-two multisport collegiate athletes (mean\u252c\u2592SD; age: 21.8\u252c\u25923.4 years, height: 178.1\u252c\u25926.7 cm, mass: 73.5\u252c\u25927.1 kg) performed three single and triple horizontal hops for distance per limb, followed by three modified 505 and 90 cut CODS trials each side to establish imbalances between right and left, and dominant (D) and non-dominant (ND) limbs. Limb dominance was defined as the limb that produced the furthest hop or faster CODS performance. Results: Paired sample t-tests revealed no significant differences in hop performance and CODS performance between right and left limbs (p> 0.05, g\u0393\u00eb\u00f1 0.11), however, significant differences were observed when comparing D and ND limbs (p< 0.001, g= 0.46-0.61).

Low agreements (32-55%) were demonstrated between like for like identifications of asymmetry for CODS and hop performance. Conclusions: Imbalances in hop and CODS were present; however, greater hop imbalances were not detrimental to CODS. Furthermore, the D limb for hopping did not necessarily correspond to faster performance from that limb during 180 turns and 90 cuts (plant foot).

These measurements reflect 800 inverse microbarns of data taken during 2010. Jets are reconstructed using the antikt algorithm with radius parameter R varying between 0.2 and 1.0. Distributions of the charged-particle multiplicity, the scalar sum of the transverse momentum of charged particles, and the average charged-particle pT are measured as functions of pT^JET in regions transverse to and opposite the leading jet for 4 GeV < pT^JET < 100 GeV. In addition, the R-dependence of the mean values of these observables is studied. In the transverse region, both the multiplicity and the scalar sum of the transverse momentum at fixed pT^JET vary significantly with R, while the average charged-particle transverse momentum has a minimal dependence on R. Predictions from several Monte Carlo tunes have been compared to the data; the predictions from Pythia 6, based on tunes that have been determined using LHC data, show reasonable agreement with the data, including the dependence on R. Comparisons with other generators indicate that additional tuning of soft-QCD parameters is necessary for these generators.

These systems must integrate computer-based technologies that help the human operator place attention on the right tasks at the right times to be successful. One way to assist the operator in this process is to compute where the operator's attention should be focused and then use this computation to influence the operator's behavior. In this paper, we analyze the ability of a particular modeling method to make such computations for effective attention allocation in human-multiple-robot systems. Our results demonstrate that it is not sufficient to simply compute and dictate how operators should allocate their attention.

Differential moments are introduced and are used to demonstrate that within the average represented by the traditional factorial moments the pattern of fluctuations is itself a strong function of rapidity. This pattern is shown to be primarily associated with the emission of hard gluons. The implied structure between the hadron clusters and partons is explored by the use of transverse mass moments.

In Z\u256c\u255d\u256c\u255d events selected from proton-proton collision data recorded at s=8 TeV with the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2012,the Z decay muons are replaced by \u2567\u00e4 leptons from simulated Zarrow\u2567\u00e4\u2567\u00e4 decays at the level of reconstructed tracks and calorimeter cells. The \u2567\u00e4 lepton kinematics are derived from the kinematics of the original muons. Thus, only the well-understood decays of the Z boson and \u2567\u00e4 leptons as well as the detector response to the \u2567\u00e4 decay products are obtained from simulation. All other aspects of the event, such as the Z boson and jet kinematics as well as effects from multiple interactions, are given by the actual data.

One fourth of the calorimeter was exposed to a beam of high energy electrons and the relative calibration of the channels, the intercalibration, was found to be reproducible to a precision of about 0.3%. Additionally, data were collected with cosmic rays for the entire ECAL barrel during the commissioning phase. By comparing the intercalibration constants obtained with the electron beam data with those from the cosmic ray data, it is demonstrated that the latter provide an intercalibration precision of 1.5% over most of the barrel ECAL. The best intercalibration precision is expected to come from the analysis of events collected in situ during the LHC operation.

In this work, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) is used to provide three-dimensional chemical imaging of the interface between poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) and SiOx/Si in a hybrid solar cell. To minimize structural damage to the polymer layer, an Ar cluster sputtering source is used for depth profiling. The present result shows the formation of micropore defects in the interface region of the PEDOT:PSS layer on the SiOx/Si substrate. This interfacial micropore defect formation becomes more prominent with increasing thickness of the native oxide layer, which is a key device parameter that greatly affects the hybrid solar cell performance.

{"title": "Supporting decentralized, security focused dynamic virtual organizations across the grid\n", "abstract": " The ability to dynamically create and subsequently manage secure virtual organisations (VO) is one of the key challenges facing the Grid community. Existing approaches for establishing and managing VOs typically suffer from lack of fine grained security since they largely focus on public key infrastructures with statically defined access control lists, or they are based upon a centralised site for storage of VO specific security information. What is really needed is a federated model of security where sites are able to manage their own security information for their own institutional members, delegating where necessary to trusted local or remote entities, as well as defining and enforcing authorisation policies for their own resources. In this paper we present tools that support such capabilities and highlight how they have been applied to dynamically create and manage security focused VOs in the education domain.

METHODS: Subjects from four villages in the Gambia were followed over nine months through visits to village health workers. Monthly cross-sectional malaria surveys measured the prevalence of P. falciparum infection. Linked databases were searched for treatment requests. Treated cases were individuals with parasitaemia who requested treatment during narrow or extended periods (14 or 28 days, respectively) before or after a positive blood film was obtained. FINDINGS: Parasite prevalence peaked in November 1998, when 399/653 (61%) individuals had parasitaemia. Parasite prevalence was highest throughout the study in children aged 5-10 years. Although access to treatment was better than in most of sub-Saharan Africa, only 20% of infected individuals sought medical treatment up to 14 days before or after a positive blood film. Within two months of a positive blood film, 199/726 (27%) individuals with parasitaemia requested treatment. Despite easy access to health care, less than half (42%) of those with parasite densities consistent with malaria attacks (5000/\u252c\u2561l) requested treatment. High parasite density and infection during October-November were associated with more frequent treatment requests. Self-treatment was infrequent in study villages: in 3/120 (2.5%) households antimalarial drugs had been used in the preceding malaria season.

The determination of the luminosity has recently been improved through studies of the multiplicities observed in the luminosity monitor [3]. These studies indicated that the fraction of observable inelastic collisions was overestimated in our previous analysis [4]. The result of these improvements is to increase the assessment of the total integrated luminosity for this analysis by 16.5% to 185 11 pb 1 and to decrease the estimated uncertainty from 6.5% to 6.1%.

The reliable operation of a FC as a detector depends on the ability of the device to recapture the electrons ejected when energetic particles strike its interior metal surfaces. We have conducted comparative performance studies of a traditional cylindrically-symmetric, electrostatic-based FC versus an alternative design in which the cylindrical symmetry is broken. The purpose of the alternative design is to generate a transverse electric field to recapture the ejected (secondary and tertiary) electrons.

Normalized factorial cumulants up to fourth order are used to measure genuine particle correlations as a function of the size of phase space domains in rapidity, azimuthal angle and transverse momentum. Both all-charge and like-sign particle combinations show strong positive genuine correlations. One-dimensional cumulants initially increase rapidly with decreasing size of the phase space cells but saturate quickly. In contrast, cumulants in two- and three-dimensional domains continue to increase. The strong rise of the cumulants for all-charge multiplets is increasingly driven by that of like-sign multiplets.

Isometric mid-thigh pull testing involved trials with relative peak force (PF [N\u0393\u00ea\u00d6 kg\u2566\u00eb\u252c\u2563]) determined for bilateral stance (IMTP PF), left leg (IMTP L PF), and right leg (IMTP R PF). Sprint and CODS performances was measured using 5-, 10-, and 20-m sprint performance, and traditional 505 (505) and modified 505 (505mod) tests. Relationships between variables (IMTP, sprint and CODS performances) were analysed using Pearson\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s product\u0393\u00c7\u00f4moment correlation. Results: Results suggest that IMTP R PF displayed the strongest relationships with sprint performance (r=\u0393\u00ea\u00c6 0.49 to\u0393\u00ea\u00c6 0.52).

Conclusions: There are no significant relationships between bilateral and unilateral stance IMTP PF and 505mod CODS.

Six of the patients underwent early study and operation because of recurrent ventricular arrhythmias, with resolution of the arrthymia in all. Seventy-five percent of the survivors are not limited by symptoms and 45% are presently working working full time.

Eleven competitive male players (13.4 \u252c\u2592 1.3 years) completed both a playing and nonplaying HIIT session of equal distance, in random order. During each HIIT session, heart rate (HR), blood lactate, and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were monitored. Before and after each HIIT session, the velocity and accuracy of the serve, and forehand and backhand strokes were evaluated. The results demonstrated that both HIIT sessions achieved an average HR greater than 90% HRmax. The physiological demands (average HR) were greater during the playing session compared to the nonplaying session, despite similar lactate concentrations and a lower RPE. The results also indicate a reduction in shot velocity after both HIIT sessions; however, the playing HIIT session had a more deleterious effect on stroke accuracy. These findings suggest that 1) both HIIT sessions may be sufficient to develop maximal aerobic power, 2) playing HIIT sessions provide a greater physiological demand with a lower RPE, and 3) playing HIIT has a greater deleterious effect on stroke performance, and in particular on the accuracy component of the ground stroke performance, and should be incorporated appropriately into a periodization program in young male tennis players.", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["3"]}

The proposed model-based technique begins during early development when design uncertainty is highest and is refined iteratively as development progresses to drive the requirements and necessary design features. The technique is evaluated by applying it to a realistic but generic Shift-By-Wire design concept in two iterations with varying levels of detail. In addition, as the requirements and design evolve and change over time, the changes can be immediately analyzed for new hazards without repeating the entire analysis. The approach is also applicable even before requirements are developed, providing feedback when some of the most important decisions are being made instead of waiting for a finished design or model to begin an analysis. In this way, potential issues can be identified immediately and more efficiently, thereby reducing the need for future rework.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["3"]}

Samples of flatfish, starfish, and crab from the beaches in the affected areas were analysed for a suite of naturally occurring marine neurotoxins of dinoflagellate origin.

For these detectors, a distortion in the drift field due to geometrical or physics reasons can affect the reconstruction of the events.

Recently, we presented a method to calibrate the drift field and correct for these possible distortions. While straight cosmic ray muon tracks could be used for calibration, multiple coulomb scattering and momentum uncertainties allow only a limited resolution. A UV laser instead can create straight ionization tracks in liquid argon, and allows one to map the drift field along different paths in the TPC inner volume.

{"title": "The ATLAS liquid argon calorimeter read-out system\n", "abstract": " The Liquid Argon calorimeters play a central role in the ATLAS experiment. The environment at the LHC collider imposes challenging tasks to their read-out system. To achieve measurements of particles and trigger signals at high precision, the detector signals are processed at various stages before reaching the Data Acquisition system (DAQ). Signals from the calorimeter cells are received by front-end boards, which digitize and sample the incoming pulse. Read-out Driver (ROD) boards further process the data at a trigger rate of up to 75 kHz. An optimal filtering procedure is applied to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio. The ROD boards calculate precise energy, time and quality of the detector pulse, which are then sent to the DAQ. In addition, the RODs perform a monitoring of the data. The architecture of the ATLAS Liquid Argon detector read-out is discussed, in particular the design and functionality of the ROD\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["3"]}

The related R&D work will proceed along two main directions; one aimed at on the assessment of the proposed modular detector design, the other on the exploitation of new signal readout methods. Such a strategy will provide high performance while being cost-effective and robust at the same time. According to our plans, we will firstly realize a detector prototype hosted in a cryostat that is already available.

The online data collection model for calibration data is designed to minimize the use of additional resources, without affecting the behavior of the trigger/DAQ system.

Software components for detector description interpret structured data from a relational database and build from that a complete description of the detector.

Detector-specific services that are not handled in a generic way (eg strip pitches and calorimetric tower boundaries) are added as an additional layer which is synched to the raw geometry. The ATLAS geometry system in the last year has undergone extensive visual debugging, and experience with the new system has been gained not only though the data challenge but also through the combined test beam.

A major feature of the first Data Challenge was the preparation and the deployment of the software required for the production of large event samples as a worldwide-distributed activity. It should be noted that it was not an option to''run everything at CERN''even if we had wanted to; the resources were not available at CERN to carry out the production on a reasonable time-scale. The great challenge of organizing and then carrying out this large-scale production at a significant number of sites around the world had the refore to be faced.

{"title": "The Calibration of the Minos Detectors\n", "abstract": " The MINOS experiment employs both a far and near detector to study neutrino oscillations. The near detector is used to characterize the beam before it has travelled far enough for oscillations to significantly occur. Oscillation measurements, including the energy spectrum of charged-current events at the near and far detectors, are made by comparing the events observed at the far detector to those in the near detector. The relative calibration of the near detector and the far detector, and the different regions of the far detector itself, is paramount in the interpretation of the oscillation results. The absolute calibration is established using a small Calibration Detector while the relative calibration is established using cosmic-ray muons and a light injection system to track short term variations in detector response.

We have compared the phase of the CoGeNT data modulation to that of the concurrent atmospheric muon and radon data collected by the MINOS experiment which occupies an adjacent experimental hall in the Soudan Underground Laboratory. The results presented are obtained by performing a shape-free \u2567\u00e7 2 data-to-data comparison and from a simultaneous fit of the MINOS and CoGeNT data to phase-shifted sinusoidal functions.

Successful collaborations must address both the needs of the end user researchers and the providers that make resources available.

In the present note the search for A/H decays into tau pairs has been studied in the hadronic decay mode of both tau's for large masses (m (A/H)> 500 GeV). Due to the small production cross section for large masses and the high rates from QCD background and the absence of a trigger lepton, the first level trigger performance is of crucial importance. A study has been performed to estimate the signal acceptance and trigger rates. A high signal acceptance in the first level trigger can be achieved using standard trigger conditions, while retaining suitable trigger rates. The study of signal and backgrounds shows that MSSM-Higgs bosons A/H can be discovered at ATLAS assuming an integrated luminosity of 30 fb-1 for masses of m (A/H)= 600 GeV for tanbeta> 50, and for masses of m (A/H)= 800 GeV for tanbeta> 75.

Four independent methods were used to align the silicon modules. The corrections obtained were validated using the known momenta of the beam particles and were shown to yield consistent results among the different alignment approaches.

Depending on the bunch current, the radiation shows bursts of high intensity. These bursts of high intensity THz radiation display a time evolution which can be observed only on long time scales with respect to the revolution period. In addition, long range wake fields can introduce a correlation between the bunches within a bunch train and thus modify the observed behaviour. A novel detection system consisting of an ultra-fast superconducting THz detector and data acquisition system was used to investigate correlations visible on the bursting pattern and to study the interactions of very short pulses in the ANKA storage ring.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["3"]}

{"title": "Efficient network monitoring for large data acquisition systems\n", "abstract": " Though constantly evolving and improving, the available network monitoring solutions have limitations when applied to the infrastructure of a high speed realtime data acquisition (DAQ) system. DAQ networks are particular computer networks where experts have to pay attention to both individual subsections as well as system wide traffic flows while monitoring the network. The ATLAS Network at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has more than 200 switches interconnecting 3500 hosts and totaling 8500 high speed links. The use of heterogeneous tools for monitoring various infrastructure parameters, in order to assure optimal DAQ system performance, proved to be a tedious and time consuming task for experts. To alleviate this problem we used our networking and DAQ expertise to build a flexible and scalable monitoring system providing an intuitive user interface with the same look and feel irrespective of the data provider that is used. Our system uses custom developed components for critical performance monitoring and seamlessly integrates complementary data from auxiliary tools, such as NAGIOS, information services or custom databases. A number of techniques (eg normalization, aggregation and data caching) were used in order to improve the user interface response time. The end result is a unified monitoring interface, for fast and uniform access to system statistics, which significantly reduced the time spent by experts for ad-hoc and post-mortem analysis.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["3"]}

{"title": "The International Large Detector: Letter of Intent\n", "abstract": " The International Large Detector (ILD) is a concept for a detector at the International Linear Collider, ILC. The ILC will collide electrons and positrons at energies of initially 500 GeV, upgradeable to 1 TeV. The ILC has an ambitious physics program, which will extend and complement that of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). A hallmark of physics at the ILC is precision. The clean initial state and the comparatively benign environment of a lepton collider are ideally suited to high precision measurements. To take full advantage of the physics potential of ILC places great demands on the detector performance. The design of ILD is driven by these requirements. Excellent calorimetry and tracking are combined to obtain the best possible overall event reconstruction, including the capability to reconstruct individual particles within jets for particle ow calorimetry. This requires excellent spatial resolution for all detector systems. A highly granular calorimeter system is combined with a central tracker which stresses redundancy and efficiency. In addition, efficient reconstruction of secondary vertices and excellent momentum resolution for charged particles are essential for an ILC detector. The interaction region of the ILC is designed to host two detectors, which can be moved into the beam position with a push-pull scheme. The mechanical design of ILD and the overall integration of subdetectors takes these operational conditions into account.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["3"]}

Path congestion is difficult to measure, therefore congestion aware protocols consider only local status. This protocol uses an innovative representation of congestion for router-router links. These congestion statistics are then distributed via an aggregation protocol to other routers in the network. Using this efficient and scalable approach, we are able to make routing decisions based on both local and eventual next-hop status. We compare our results with Shortest Path only routing (SP), and the Hash-Threshold variant of ECMP (HTE). We show that our algorithm can achieve up to N times the throughput of SP, where N is the number of distinct paths from source to destination.

{"title": "Proposal for hadron production measurements using the NA49 detector for use in long-baseline and atmospheric neutrino flux calculations\n", "abstract": " The experiments on solar and atmospheric neutrinos provide strong evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model. More specifically, the deficit of solar neutrinos observed on Earth, deduced from comparison with the solar model predictions, suggests oscillations of e into some other flavor. The atmospheric neutrinos provide even stronger evidence for the existence of neutrino oscillations, since the observed deficit of muon neutrinos shows dependence on the zenith angle of the observed neutrinos, and hence on their path length from the production point to the observation point. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for these observed phenomena in a quantitative way is of paramount importance. Several accelerator neutrino experiments, K2K in Japan, OPERA and ICARUS in Europe, and MINOS in the United States have been initiated with the goal of understanding the atmospheric anomaly quantitatively. New ideas have been put forth regarding possible next generation atmospheric neutrino experiments. Both the neutrinos produced in the atmosphere and the neutrinos in accelerator beams originate as decay products of mesons (mainly pions and kaons) or of muons, which themselves are primarily pion or kaon decay products. Thus understanding of the atmospheric neutrino fluxes as well as of the detailed composition of the accelerator neutrino beams relies heavily on understanding the nature of the hadronic cascade, ie the production spectra of the secondaries resulting from the collision of a higher energy particle.

{"title": "A Model of Mathematics Achievement Using Proficiency Scores.\n", "abstract": " Using eighth-grade transcript and questionnaire data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988, this study used logistic regression procedures to investigate the extent to which the probability of mathematics proficiency depends on the values of various background factors. The results of the analyses, which were based on a subsample of approximately 450 students, indicate that when race and gender were the sole explanatory variables, the probability of mathematics proficiency at the highest level was greatest for Asian/Pacific Islanders and Whites. Using this model, the odds of mathematics proficiency for females were no different from that of males. When other factors were included in the model, the probability of mathematics proficiency increased with advanced math course enrollment, grades, socioeconomic status, reading proficiency level, and homework. In addition, when other factors were controlled, males were more likely to achieve at the highest level of proficiency than females. A cumulative logit model was used to assess the effect of the explanatory variables on the cumulative probabilities for math proficiency. The results of this analysis reveal that attendance at private nonreligious schools, advanced math enrollment, and increased homework increase the odds of higher mathematics proficiency. Chi-squared tests of the association between mathematics proficiency and the covariates as well as correlation analyses among the covariates suggest that the absence of some variables from the prediction equations may be a results of multicolinearity among the explanatory variables.(Author/SLD)", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["3"]}

The key idea of DEPFET sensors is the integration of amplifying transistors into a fully depleted bulk. The excellent noise performance obtained through the low input capacitance in combination with the full signal from the depleted bulk leads to a large S/N ratio. The sensor itself can therefore be made very thin (50\u252c\u2561m) without loss of efficiency. In this article the progress of the DEPFET development towards an ILC vertex detector is presented. Properties of prototype matrices and dedicated ASIC electronics have been characterized in various laboratory and test beam measurements. In particular a point resolution of less than 2 \u252c\u2561m has been demonstrated (using 450 \u252c\u2561m thick sensors).

{"title": "European strategy for accelerator-based neutrino physics\n", "abstract": " Massive neutrinos reveal physics beyond the Standard Model, which could have deep consequences for our understanding of the Universe. Their study should therefore receive the highest level of priority in the European Strategy. The discovery and study of leptonic CP violation and precision studies of the transitions between neutrino flavours require high intensity, high precision, long baseline accelerator neutrino experiments. The community of European neutrino physicists involved in oscillation experiments is strong enough to support a major neutrino long baseline project in Europe, and has an ambitious, competitive and coherent vision to propose. Following the 2006 European Strategy for Particle Physics (ESPP) recommendations, two complementary design studies have been carried out: LAGUNA/LBNO, focused on deep underground detector sites, and EUROnu, focused on high intensity neutrino facilities. LAGUNA LBNO recommends, as first step, a conventional neutrino beam CN2PY from a CERN SPS North Area Neutrino Facility (NANF) aimed at the Pyhasalmi mine in Finland. A sterile neutrino search experiment which could also be situated in the CERN north area has been proposed (ICARUS-NESSIE) using a two detector set-up, allowing a definitive answer to the 20 year old question open by the LSND experiment. EUROnu concluded that a 10 GeV Neutrino Factory, aimed at a magnetized neutrino detector situated, also, at a baseline of around 2200 km (+-30%), would constitute the ultimate neutrino facility; it recommends that the next 5 years be devoted to the R&D, preparatory experiments and implementation study, in view\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["3"]}

Electroweak measurements constrain the standard model Higgs boson mass to be in the 114.4 to 157 GeV/c 2 range. For m h< 135 GeV/c 2, the Higgs predominantly decays into two b-quarks.

The current ATLAS Inner Detector will not stand the predicted radiation levels nor the expected large increase in the hit occupancy rates. A new inner tracker must therefore be designed, built and installed in a relatively short time-scale. The current layout assumes an all-silicon tracker with pixel detectors for the innermost layers and strip modules at higher radii. Major constraints are the requirements of radiation-hard sensors, efficient power distribution, minimum material budget, affordable cost, and fast and reliable production. This note reports on the design of double-sided silicon strip modules for the short-strip region of the upgraded ATLAS inner tracker. The different components of the module are described. The thermal performance is discussed. The assembly sequence of first module prototypes is explained in detail.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["3"]}

The main goals of this campaign were to study the detector performance in a controlled environment, to validate the description of the data by the Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation and to perform combined studies in a setup close to that of ATLAS (eg studies using the inner tracker with electromagnetic and hadronic calorimetry). One of these combined studies focuses on photon reconstruction. In the specific beam setup used for this study, photons were produced via Bremsstrahlung from 180 GeV electrons incident on a thin target upstream of the experimental apparatus.

{"title": "Serial power protection for ATLAS silicon strip staves\n", "abstract": " Upgrades to the inner tracking detectors at the Super Large Hadron Collider (SLHC) will require more efficient methods of power delivery. Serial power is one architecture that delivers power efficiently by powering a chain of front-end circuits (hybrids) with a common current. A major concern with serial power is the loss of the full hybrid chain due to an open circuit failure of a single hybrid. We propose a method to protect a serial chain of hybrids with emphasis on application to the ATLAS silicon strip upgrade. A prototype protection circuit and its discrete component implementation are described. Results from tests of the protection circuit used with individual \u0393\u00c7\u00a3dummy\u0393\u00c7\u00a5 hybrids and in a system test with a collection of dummy hybrids are given.

{"title": "P1A-4 Model-Based Pulse Detection for 3D Ultrasound Computer Tomography\n", "abstract": " At Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe a 3D ultrasound computer tomograph (USCT) for breast cancer diagnosis is currently under development. For many applications, i.e. reconstruction of speed of sound maps, signal denoising,signal compression and calibration, it is necessary to detect pulses and their parameters (center frequency, bandwidth factor, time of arrival, phase and amplitude) accurately and robustly. The pulse detection is demanding due to low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) caused by unfocused pulses from single emitters. Besides that angle dependent pulse shapes result in ultrasonic echoes which are similar in their center frequency but vary strongly in their bandwidth factor. Additionally, in sum 3.5 million A-scans (20 GB) are acquired, so that the pulse detection has to be fast and efficient. This is achieved by using a fast pre-classifler in order to separate the ultrasonic echoes from the non-white system\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["3"]}

{"title": "Status report: Technical design of neutrino beams for the Main Injector (NuMI)\n", "abstract": " Soon after the Main Injector was proposed as a luminosity upgrade for the Tevatron collider experiments, it was realized that a moderate energy (120 GeV) high-intensity proton beam could lead to neutrino beams with unprecedented uxes [1]. There followed a proposal for a short-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment [2], and several ideas for using the same beam for a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment [3]. A list of the proposed experiments is given in Table 1.1. As suggestive evidence for neutrino mass and neutrino oscillations continues to grow from solar neutrino experiments,[4] atmospheric neutrino experiments [5] and the missing matter problem,[6] the prospect of using one neutrino beam to signi cantly improve the sensitivity of neutrino oscillation searches in both m2 and sin2 (2) has become increasingly attractive.Working with the advocates of oscillation experiments at Fermilab, a succession of beam working groups have studied possible neutrino beams at Fermilab since 1988. A list of several beam design study reports is given in Table 1.2. Fermilab has a long history of neutrino experiments using a double horn wide band beam (WBB) and early in the process it was realized that a double horn system would produce a high intensity neutrino ux, useful for both short-baseline and long-baseline experiments. More recently, it has been concluded that there are many advantages for a narrow band beam (NBB) as well, so now the capability for both beams is a desirable feature of a new neutrino facility.

The clinical domain is one area in particular where this is so. However it is the case that existing security authorization solutions are fragile, inflexible and difficult to establish and maintain. As a result they often do not meet the needs of real world collaborations where robustness and flexibility of policy specification and enforcement, and ease of maintenance are essential.

The devices must operate in a high magnetic field (2 T) and be radiation hard to~ 50-100 Mrad and~ 1015 Neq/cm2. These converters are to be mounted on the same multi-chip modules as the ASIC readout chips or in close vicinity without introducing any additional readout noise due to the high switching frequencies. Such devices will permit higher voltage power delivery to the tracker and thus increase overall power efficiency by limiting the ohmic losses in the stretch of cable (about 100 meters) between the tracker and the power sources.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["3"]}
{"title": "TMVA 4\n", "abstract": " In high-energy physics, with the search for ever smaller signals in ever larger data sets, it has become essential to extract a maximum of the available information from the data. Multivariate classification methods based on machine learning techniques have become a fundamental ingredient to most analyses. Also the multivariate classifiers themselves have significantly evolved in recent years. Statisticians have found new ways to tune and to combine classifiers to further gain in performance. Integrated into the analysis framework ROOT, TMVA is a toolkit which hosts a large variety of multivariate classification algorithms. Training, testing, performance evaluation and application of all available classifiers is carried out simultaneously via user-friendly interfaces. With version 4, TMVA has been extended to multivariate regression of a real-valued target vector. Regression is invoked through the same user interfaces as classification. TMVA 4 also features more flexible data handling allowing one to arbitrarily form combined MVA methods. A generalised boosting method is the first realisation benefiting from the new framework.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["3"]}

The Hadronic Hose would consist of segments of wire, 660 m in total length, running down the center of the decay pipe. A current pulse of order 1000 Amps on the wire produces a toroidal magnetic field. The current is returned through the iron decay pipe. In this field, pions orbit with trajectories that sweep their neutrino decay fluxes across the centers of the near and far detector which helps to average out near and far differences.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["3"]}

By the time enough design has been completed for hazard analysis to be able to identify flaws in the design, the cost of rework and changing basic decisions is great.The solution to these problems is to integrate safety tightly into the system development process from the very beginning of system conception.

The services also offer users the opportunity to deposit and distribute their own supplementary data resources for the benefit of dissemination and replication of the details of their own analysis. The GESDE services focus upon three application areas: specialist data relating to the measurement of occupations; educational qualifications; and ethnicity (including nationality, language, religion, national identity). They identify information resources related to the operationalisation of variables which seek to measure each of these concepts - examples include coding frames, crosswalk and translation files, and standardisation and harmonisation recommendations.

{"title": "CP studies and non-standard Higgs physics\n", "abstract": " There are many possibilities for new physics beyond the Standard Model that feature non-standard Higgs sectors. These may introduce new sources of CP violation, and there may be mixing between multiple Higgs bosons or other new scalar bosons. Alternatively, the Higgs may be a composite state, or there may even be no Higgs at all. These non-standard Higgs scenarios have important implications for collider physics as well as for cosmology, and understanding their phenomenology is essential for a full comprehension of electroweak symmetry breaking. This report discusses the most relevant theories which go beyond the Standard Model and its minimal, CP-conserving supersymmetric extension: two-Higgs-doublet models and minimal supersymmetric models with CP violation, supersymmetric models with an extra singlet, models with extra gauge groups or Higgs triplets, Little Higgs models, models in extra dimensions, and models with technicolour or other new strong dynamics. For each of these scenarios, this report presents an introduction to the phenomenology, followed by contributions on more detailed theoretical aspects and studies of possible experimental signatures at the LHC and other colliders.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["3"]}

It consists of a Preprocessor, a Cluster Processor (CP), and a Jet/Energy-sum Processor (JEP). The CP and JEP receive digitised trigger-tower data from the Preprocessor and produce electron/photon, tau, and jet trigger multiplicities, total and missing transverse energies, and Region-of-Interest (RoI) information. Data are read out to the data acquisition (DAQ) system to monitor the trigger by using readout driver modules (ROD). A dedicated backplane has been designed to cope with the demanding requirements of the CP and JEP sub-systems. A number of pre-production boards were manufactured in order to fully populate a crate and test the robustness of the design on a large scale. Dedicated test modules to emulate digitised calorimeter signals have been used. All modules, cables and backplanes on test are final versions for use at the LHC. This test rig represents up to one third of the Level-1 digital processor system. Real-time data between modules were processed and time-slice readout data was transferred to the ROD at a trigger rate up to 100 kHz. Intensive testing consisted of checking the readout data by comparing to hardware simulations of the trigger. Domains of validity of the boards were also measured and dedicated stressful data patterns were used to check the reliability of the system. Tests results have been successful and the Level-1 calorimeter trigger system is proceeding to full production.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["3"]}

At each intensity, data were taken with different configurations of the front-end chip. This note describes the analysis of the high intensity run of August 2004. The particles trajectories were reconstructed using the pixel detectors under test and the detection efficiency was measured as a function of the beam intensity. With the standard ATLAS b-layer configuration and at the B-layer expected column-pair hit occupancy of 0.17 pixel hits per bunch crossing, the measured readout efficiency is 98%, which is the same value found at low intensity.

The entire complex will need to operate for several decades. Over this long time span, our intent is to operate the complex in a manner which minimizes and prevents pollution of the environment, and simultaneously incurs the lowest life cycle costs to the taxpayer. The complexity of such a planning task has led us to the development of two computational tools to guide the planner. The first is a novel and fast running Production Planning Model (ProdMod) which will be the routine planning analysis tool. ProdMod is a pseudo-dynamic simulation model which, for computational speed, is cast in the form of algebraic equations. The initial version of ProdMod has been used to support HLW System Plan analyses for 30-70 year scenarios. The second tool (the Integrated Flowsheet Model) is a much more detailed, truly dynamic simulation model of the entire HLW complex which will serve to validate the much-simplified process models in ProdMod: it will provide confirmation of short-term predictions by ProdMod. We are in the process of taking advantage of ProdMod's linear equation form to create automatic optimization algorithms which will greatly reduce the planner's need for trial-and-error solutions", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["3"]}

Despite previous meta-analyses consistently showing that probiotics prevent NEC, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) continue to demonstrate conflicting results regarding the efficacy of probiotics. Here we present the largest and most comprehensive meta-analysis to date, and the first to use a random-effects model, to investigate the efficacy of probiotics in very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants. We also attempt to explain for the first time the apparent heterogeneity in results from RCTs by performing meta-regression and sub-group analysis to identify particular probiotic agents and other measured variables that may significantly influence the outcome.Method PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["3"]}

Sixteen female netball athletes (19.8\u252c\u25923.8 years; height: 180.0\u252c\u25926.1 cm; body mass: 75.9\u252c\u25923.4 kg) performed three unilateral stance IMTP trials per leg separated by 7 days. Between-session reliability was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), typical error of measurement (TE) expressed as a coefficient of variation (CV), and smallest worthwhile change (SWC) to determine differences between testing sessions. The results from this study suggest that absolute and relative IMTP PF should be used for assessing unilateral stance IMTP performance, due to its acceptable reliability (CV< 5%) and good sensitivity (CV< SWC). Measures of impulse also demonstrated high reliability (ICC\u0393\u00eb\u00d1 0.88; CV\u0393\u00eb\u00f1 9%) but demonstrated poor sensitivity (CV> SWC). Additionally, RFD demonstrated high between-session CVs> 19% and poor sensitivity (CV> SWC). This study demonstrates that PF in the unilateral stance IMTP is most reliable. Changes in absolute IMTP PF and relative IMTP PF were~ 5% and~ 3%, respectively, identifying meaningful changes in response to training or competition in female netball athletes. Measures of RFD and impulse should be interpreted with caution due to their poor ability to detect the SWC.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["3"]}

In the Standard Model (SM), a forward\u0393\u00c7\u00f4backward asymmetry (AFB), of order \u256c\u2592s, is expected at a proton\u0393\u00c7\u00f4antiproton (p p) collider such as the Tevatron, with a much enhanced asymmetry in certain kinematical regions. Early measurements [3, 4] found a larger AFB than predicted by the SM. Later determinations confirmed this deviation and measurements in intervals of the invariant mass, mtt, of the system formed by the top-quark pair [5\u0393\u00c7\u00f49] found a stronger dependence on mtt than anticipated. Recent calculations of electroweak effects [10] and the full next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) corrections [11] to the asymmetry have brought the difference between the observed asymmetry at the Tevatron and the SM prediction down to the 1.5 \u2567\u00e2 level and reduced the tension with the differential measurements in mtt [12, 13].", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["3"]}
{"title": "STUDY OF OCTUPOLE COLLECTIVITY IN Nd-146 AND Sm-148 USING THE NEW COULOMB EXCITATION SET-UP AT ALTO\n", "abstract": " The nuclei in the vicinity of neutron number N\u0393\u00eb\u00ea 88 are known to have low-lying negative-parity bands that decay to the positive-parity yrast states through the E1 transitions. The enhancement of the B (E3, 0+\u0393\u00e5\u00c6 3-) values indicate enhanced octupole collectivity in this region. Similar correlations are observed in the N\u0393\u00eb\u00ea 56 and 134 regions [1]. While this can explain the appearance of the reflection asymmetry, it is unclear whether such a behaviour is static or dynamic. However, the nature of the octupole correlations can be studied by determining the E3 matrix elements connecting states in the negative-parity band to the positive-parity ground-state band [2]. It is possible to clearly distinguish between octupole vibration and rigid deformation by measuring the B (E3, 4+\u0393\u00e5\u00c6 1-) value that should be close to zero in the case of octupole vibration, and larger than the B (E3, 0+\u0393\u00e5\u00c6 3-) value for static octupole deformation [3\u0393\u00c7\u00f45]. Unfortunately, the E3 transitions are not directly observable by decay, since the E1 and E2 transition rates are several orders of magnitude faster. However, the E3 matrix elements can be determined from the Coulomb excitation cross sections. The atomic nuclei 146Nd and 148Sm (both with N= 86) have such low-lying negative-parity bands, where the 3-state lies energetically below the 1-state. These nuclei, which are found in the transitional region between the spherical N= 82 and well-deformed N\u0393\u00eb\u00d1 90, provide a great opportunity to study octupole correlations.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["3"]}

{"title": "Double parton interactions in double J/\u256c\u00bf production at LHC\n", "abstract": " In the last years, the production of J/\u2567\u00ea pairs has attracted a significant renewal attention in the context of searches for double parton scattering processes [1]. A number of discussions has been stimulated by the recent measurement [2] of the double J/\u2567\u00ea production cross section at the LHCb experiment at CERN. Theoretical estimates based on both collinear [3, 4] and kt-factorization [5] approaches show that the single (SPS) and double (DPS) parton scattering contributions are comparable in size and, taken together, can perfectly describe the measured cross section. However to disentangle the SPS and DPS mechanisms one needs to clearly understand the production kinematics. Naive expectations that the SPS mechanism should result in the backto-back event configuration received no support from the later calculations. Including the initial state radiation effects (either in the form of kt-dependent gluon distributions [6] or by means of simulating the parton showers in a phenomenological way [4]) washes out the original azimuthal correlations. On the other hand, it has been suggested [4] that the DPS production is characterized by a much larger rapidity difference between the two J/\u2567\u00ea mesons. The goal of the present study is to carefully examine the J/\u2567\u00ea pair production properties in the different kinematical domains paying attention to the different contributing processes [7]. On the SPS side, we consider the leading-order O (\u256c\u25924 s) subprocess and the subleading O (\u256c\u25926 s) contribution from pseudo-diffractive gluon-gluon scattering represented by one-gluon exchange and two-gluon exchange mechanisms.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["3"]}

{"title": "Inducing value sparsity for parallel inference in tree-shaped models\n", "abstract": " Single-core architectures are rapidly on the decline, and even the most common computational devices now contain multiple cores. With this easy access to parallelism, the machine learning community needs to go beyond treating the running time as the only computational resource and needs to study approaches that take this additional form of flexibility into account. In this work, we study inference in tree-shaped models. Specifically, we focus on balancing accuracy and efficient use of multiple cores when faced with running time constraints.The problem of inference for tree-shaped models (such as chains) plays an important role as a large number of real-world problems are best modeled as linear-chains or trees [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. A fast approximate inference approach can allow inference over very large models (such as those that model documents instead of sentences) for which exact inference is slow. Second, even for smaller (sentence level) models, the computational limits for certain tasks may be too severe to allow exact inference. One such example is query analysis for real-time search [6].", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["3"]}

{"title": "Security-oriented portals for the Life Sciences\n", "abstract": " Motivation: The life sciences are broad in scope and cover multi- and inter-disciplinary domains as well as the biological domain. These domains can for example involve researchers from the clinical, social, geo-spatial and computer sciences amongst others, e.g. in understanding genetic variations across a population as might be undertaken through a genome-wide association study. Given, this it is essential that portals for these communities are targeted to the individual expertise of the particular domain scientists. Thus tools available to a bioinformatician through a portal might well be meaningless to a social scientist and vice versa. Furthermore certain domains demand that fine-grained access control on data is supported. In this paper we outline how a portfolio of life science related projects at the National e-Science Centre (NeSC) at the University of Glasgow have benefited from security-oriented portals focused upon ease of access, configuration and usage, where data providers are assumed to be autonomous and able to make their own local fine-grained access control decisions.

{"title": "Determination of Spin and CP-eigenvalue of the Higgs Boson with ATLAS\n", "abstract": " A possibility to prove spin and CP-eigenvalue of a Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson is presented. We exploit angular correlations in the subsequent decay H  ZZ  4l (muons or electrons). We compare the angular distributions of the leptons originating from the SM Higgs with those resulting from decays of hypothetical particles with differing quantum numbers. This decay channel is the most promising one for Higgs searches at the LHC. We restrict our analysis to the use of the Atlas-detector which is one of two multi-purpose detectors at the upcoming 14 TeV proton-proton-collider (LHC) at CERN. By applying a fast simulation of the Atlas detector it can be shown that these correlations will be measured sufficiently well to prove consistency with the parameters of the Standard Model Higgs. Although the method is valid for all Higgs masses, we focus on the mass range above 200 GeV, where the branching ratio to ZZ is high enough to perform the measurement at an integrated luminosity of 100 fb .", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["3"]}
{"title": "Low-coherence, high-resolution optical reflectometry for fiber length measurement\n", "abstract": " An optical low-coherence reflectometry (OLCR) system has been developed for precise optical fiber length change measurement. The motivation lies in the desire for an environmentally stable technique to precisely measure drift in the Earth\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s crust. By utilizing a buried optical fiber segment spanning the region to be measured, one can exploit the stability of conditions below the surface of the ground in order to facilitate reliable measurement of the crustal deformation. The success of the system was shown through the ability to provide length change measurement with a precision comparable to existing techniques used in quantifying crustal drift. The overall system measurement resolution was experimentally shown to be 1.7 mm. In addition, a novel technique for extending the measurement range of conventional OLCR was demonstrated to provide as much as 3.7 meters of observed fiber length change. Finally, an innovative method for reducing polarization sensitivities in the interference signal detection was developed and verified both through computer simulations and experimental observations.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["3"]}

Employing more general repulsive fluids (\"dark energy\") encompassing the \u256c\u00a2 component, we quantitatively compare both approaches. Fitting the SN-data by a minimum-component model consisting of dark energy + dust (pressureless matter) yields a closed universe with a large amount of dust exceeding the baryonic content constrained by big-bang nucleosynthesis. The nature of the dark energy is hardly constrained. Only when enforcing a flat universe is there a clear tendency to a dark-energy \u256c\u00a2 fluid and the \"canonical\"value for dust.

Certainly in the UK the largest expenditure on biomedical research is by the pharmaceutical industry (http://www. abpi. org. uk accessed July 4, 2000). That commerce should be a major sponsor of research is not novel and, indeed, in the first half of the 20th century many civic universities only came into being because of their industrial partnerships.

{"title": "Factors affecting the microstructure of pyrolytic carbon coatings on nuclear fuel particles\n", "abstract": " Chemical vapour deposition played an important part in development of fuel for HTR. The fuel is coated particles dispersed in a graphite matrix. The multilayer coating contains the fission products; the preferred coating materials are pyrolytic carbon and silicon carbide. A charge of particles is fluidised in a heated graphite chamber by a flow of gas. The geometries of the chamber and the injector (s) are chosen to produce a generally spouting mode of fluidisation. A hydrocarbon is introduced as part of the fluidising gas and a reaction zone temperature in the range 1200-2000$ sup 0$ C is used. The hydrocarbon decomposes and the eventual products are carbon and hydrogen. Recirculation of the particles leads to deposition of pyrolytic carbon on the particles. The thermal contribution by the fluidising gas mixture is always negative. Differences in the behaviour of pyrolytic carbon under fast neutron irradiation have been observed, and some coatings derived from methane appear to have insufficient ductility in service. A series of studies was carried out on model fluidised beds, leading to the development of a radioactive particle tracer technique. New experiments designed to study microstructure control in pyrocarbon coatings are reported.

{"title": "Missing Political Front in Afghanistan\n", "abstract": " US efforts in Afghanistan since 2001, and especially since the surge of 2010-2011, have emphasized military and to a lesser extend donor aid operations, while side-stepping political and cultural complexities. The policy has failed, as evidenced by both persistence of the insurgency and by acknowledgement of Coalition leaders that they do not know how to reinforce credibility of GIRoA (Government of Islamic Republic of Afghanistan). Going back to 1989, and certainly since 2001, the US has failed to construct a coalition of moderates that might be able to enhance legitimacy and increase stability, and hence to begin to defuse military tensions. Indeed, the US has often supported factions that tended to undermine stability and energize insurgent activity. An improved political strategy going forward would look for ways to collaborate with and strengthen moderate tribal and religious leaders, and to support GIRoA structures already in-place for neutralizing extremists and warlords. In line with Afghan historical precedent, the US and Coalition should also seek to decentralize government finance and appointments, in order that some insurgents might choose to compete politically (non-militarily) in provinces and districts. This can be accomplished over time even without negotiations between GIRoA and Taliban leaders, and with a minimum of Coalition military support.President Barack Obama\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s decision to authorize military action on the part of US forces in Afghanistan after the end of 2014 reopens strategic questions often thought to have been closed.

For example, the W boson can appear in theories with universal extra dimensions, such as Kaluza\u0393\u00c7\u00f4Klein excitations of the SM W boson [1\u0393\u00c7\u00f43], or in theories that extend fundamental symmetries of the SM and propose a massive right-handed counterpart to the W boson [4\u0393\u00c7\u00f46]. Little Higgs theories [7] also predict a W boson. The search for a W boson decaying to a top quark and a b-quark explores models potentially inaccessible to searches for a W boson decaying into leptons [8\u0393\u00c7\u00f411]. For instance, in the right-handed sector, the W boson cannot decay to a charged lepton and a right-handed neutrino if the latter has a mass greater than the W-boson mass. Also, in several theories beyond the SM the W boson is expected to be coupled more strongly to the third generation of quarks than to the first and second generations [12, 13].

{"title": "Integration of Multiple Active Safety Systems using STPA 2015-01-0277\n", "abstract": " Automobiles are becoming ever more complex as advanced safety features are integrated into the vehicle platform. As the pace of integration and complexity of new features rises, it is becoming increasingly difficult for system engineers to assess the impact of new additions on vehicle safety and performance. In response to this challenge, a new approach for analyzing multiple control systems as an extension to the Systems Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) framework has been developed. The new approach meets the growing need of system engineers to analyze integrated control systems, that may or may not have been developed in a coordinated manner, and assess them for safety and performance.The new approach identifies unsafe combinations of control actions, from one or more control systems, that could lead to an accident. For example, independent controllers for Auto Hold, Engine Idle Stop, and Adaptive Cruise Control may interfere with each other in certain situations. This paper demonstrates a method to efficiently identify potential unsafe scenarios without requiring a complete enumeration or individual analysis of all possible scenarios. As a result, the approach is scalable to large systems with many controllers. In this paper, the method is demonstrated through a case study involving several driver assistance systems including advanced brake controls, advanced engine control, and advanced adaptive cruise control. Potential conflicts that would prohibit safe and successful operation are also efficiently identified, allowing engineers to develop suitable controls that prevent these conflicts.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["3"]}

In areas where there is a low incidence (Low Risk Areas or LRAs) of bTB in cattle and the default testing regime is currently quadrennial, to identify approaches that will reduce the total testing burden, without compromising the detection of herds containing infected cattle and efficiently identify high risk herds, possibly for additional testing. 2. In areas where there is a high incidence (High Risk Areas or HRAs) of bTB in cattle, to identify approaches that more quickly identify herds which may present a higher risk of onward transmission to other herds. 3. In areas which are currently perceived as LRAs but are in danger of becoming HRAs (Transition Areas or TAs), to identify signatures of this transition, with an aim of informing increasing surveillance (i.e. moving from (1) above to (2)) and or systematically curtailing spread of HRAs themselves. The work to achieve these objectives was delivered in four separate stages: 1. Identification of areas that could be epidemiologically classified as HRA, LRA and TA. 2.

The Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) represents an extensively developed plan for a world-class experiment dedicated to addressing these questions. LBNE is conceived around three central components: (1) a new, high-intensity neutrino source generated from a megawatt-class proton accelerator at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, (2) a near neutrino detector just downstream of the source, and (3) a massive liquid argon time-projection chamber deployed as a far detector deep underground at the Sanford Underground Research Facility. This facility, located at the site of the former Homestake Mine in Lead, South Dakota, is approximately 1,300 km from the neutrino source at Fermilab -- a distance (baseline) that delivers optimal sensitivity to neutrino charge-parity symmetry violation and mass ordering effects. This ambitious yet cost-effective design incorporates scalability and flexibility and can accommodate a variety of upgrades and contributions. With its exceptional combination of experimental configuration, technical capabilities, and potential for transformative discoveries, LBNE promises to be a vital facility for the field of particle physics worldwide, providing physicists from around the globe with opportunities to collaborate in a twenty to thirty year program of\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["3"]}

Experience at JET showed that a human-in-the-loop tele-operated approach is crucial, although this approach entails drawbacks such as the required extensive operator training and relatively long execution times. These drawbacks are common knowledge, but little quantitative research is available to guide improvements (such as improved training methods, or active operator support systems). The aim of this paper is to identify the key areas for further improvement of tele-operated maintenance for ITER. This is achieved by a detailed task analysis based on recent maintenance at JET, using task logbooks and video data as well as interviews with experienced master-slave operators. The resulting task analysis shows the (sub) tasks that were most time-consuming and shows a large variance in time performance within operators, but also substantial differences between qualified operators with different levels of experience. The operator interviews indicate that intuitive (virtual) visual feedback and artificial (guiding) forces are promising directions for improvement.

{"title": "Radiation-resistant erbium-doped optical fiber for space applications\n", "abstract": " In the last decade, there has been increased interest in photonic technology for new satellite applications. One critical issue is the high sensitivity to radiative environments of the Erbium Doped Fiber (EDF). It leads to a radiation-induced absorption (RIA) that is not due to erbium content but mainly to the aluminium that ensures the erbium inclusion in glass. As the radiation induced losses grow as an exponential function of fiber length, the principal way so far to reduce EDFA degradation has consisted in increasing erbium concentration using conventional doping techniques. However, this is limited by the quenching effect, which impacts the fiber length needed to reach high gain, but also by the Aluminium-induced RIA. It has been recently proposed an original nanoparticle (NP) doping approach, which allows codopant content decrease with reduced quenching impact, while keeping EDF amplifying performances\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["3"]}

As yet no clear mechanism accounts for these observations. BMCs do not directly form into hepatocytes but can improve liver regeneration and function. In chronic liver disease hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) are a potential source of parenchymal regeneration. Whilst the transplantation of human HPCs is not currently a practical therapeutic option, manipulating endogenous HPCs in vivo represents a potential approach. HPCs exist in a specialised niche of leukocytes and mesenchymal cells, which secrete cytokines that are capable of regulating HPC behaviour. We therefore hypothesised that infusion of BMC into the liver may induce HPC expansion via paracrine signalling.Aim To investigate the effect of autologous BMC infusion upon regeneration by\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["3"]}

The excellent noise performance obtained through the low input capacitance in combination with the full signal from the depleted bulk leads to a large S/N ratio. The sensor itself can therefore be made very thin (50\u252c\u2561m) without loss of efficiency. Readout is performed by cyclic enabling of transistor rows in a large matrix. The total system, including readout and sequencing chips, is expected to dissipate less than 10 W for a five layer geometry assuming a 1: 200 power duty cycle.In this status report the progress of the DEPFET development towards an ILC vertex detector with respect to the last PRC review in May 2005 is presented.

In particular a point resolution of less than 2 \u252c\u2561m has been demonstrated (using 450 \u252c\u2561m thick sensors). Based on these results larger matrices, improved readout and control electronics have been designed which are presently in production.

Sandea (halosulfuron) is an excellent herbicide for nutsedge control and has activity on most of the weeds mentioned above. It has both soil and foliar activity. Sandea is labeled for several vegetable crops and southernpea may have enough tolerance to Sandea to warrant a label expansion. Experiments were conducted in Arkansas and Oklahoma between 2002 and 2005 to determine the tolerance of southernpea to Sandea and its efficacy on some weed species. In Oklahoma, trials were conducted in LeFlore County and at the Bixby Research Station in 2002 and 2003. Treatments consisted of various herbicides applied preemergence (PRE) or postemergence (POST), among which were some Sandea treatments. The doses of Sandea tested ranged from 0.024 to 0.048 lb a.i./A with some treatments applied with Basagran (bentazon), POST. Preemergence treatments were applied at 20 GPA and POST treatments at 30 GPA. Experimental units were arranged in randomized complete block design with four replications. The cultivar used was Early Scarlet. Plots were comprised of four rows, spaced either 30 or 36 inches, depending on location, 15 ft long.

{"title": "Eosinophilia\n", "abstract": " The most common cause of eosinophilia worldwide is helminth infection, though infection is often asymptomatic. Worm migration causes higher eosinophil counts. In developed countries, other causes of eosinophilia should always be considered, including drug reaction and allergy, connective tissue disease and malignancy. It is important to assess eosinophilia by absolute count and not percentage. The importance of careful assessment of travel history is emphasized. Even with a significant travel exposure, it must be remembered that eosinophilia may have a non-helminth cause.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["3"]}

The laborious task of detector description benefits from the implementation of a scalable relational database approach. We have created and extensively exercised in the ATLAS production environment a primary numbers database utilizing NOVA relational database technologies. In our report we describe the architecture of the relational database deployed for the storage, management, and uniform treatment of primary numbers in ATLAS detector description. We describe the benefits of the ATLAS software framework (Athena) on-demand data access architecture, and an automatic system for code generation of more than 300 classes (about 10% of ATLAS offline code) for primary numbers access from the Athena framework. Integration with the common Interval-of-Validity database infrastructure, measures for tighter primary numbers database input control, experience with ATLAS Combined Test Beam geometry and conditions payload storage using NOVA technologies integrated with the LCG ConditionsDB implementation, methods for application-side resource pooling, new user tools for knowledge discovery, navigation and browsing, and plans for new primary numbers database developments, are also described.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["3"]}

Another important discovery is that the collision zone is opaque to the passage of hadrons and perhaps even partons.

Three methods have been studied for coordinate determination, one using a Gaussian fit approach, one using the center of gravity of the charge deposition and the third using the function from Mathieson 1. The best results for single coordinate finding are achieved with the Mathieson function and similar results are obtained with the gaussian method. The latter was used to study the two track resolution as a function of distance between tracks which was found to be degraded by at worst a factor 3 at a separation of about 1.5 pad widths and to reach a limit at about 0.2 pad widths separation.
