{"title": "An efficient methodology for mapping quantum circuits to the IBM QX architectures\n", "abstract": " In the past years, quantum computers more and more have evolved from an academic idea to an upcoming reality. IBM's project IBM Q can be seen as evidence of this progress. Launched in March 2017 with the goal to provide access to quantum computers for a broad audience, this allowed users to conduct quantum experiments on a 5-qubit and, since June 2017, also on a 16-qubit quantum computer (called IBM QX2 and IBM QX3, respectively). Revised versions of these 5- and 16-qubit quantum computers (named IBM QX4 and IBM QX5, respectively) are available since September 2017. In order to use these, the desired quantum functionality (e.g., provided in terms of a quantum circuit) has to be properly mapped so that the underlying physical constraints are satisfied-a complex task. This demands solutions to automatically and efficiently conduct this mapping process. In this paper, we propose a methodology\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "225\n", "authors": ["1883"]}
{"title": "Elementary quantum gate realizations for multiple-control Toffoli gates\n", "abstract": " A new method for determining elementary quantum gate realizations for multiple-control Toffoli (MCT) gates is presented. The realization for each MCT gate is formed as a composition of realizations of smaller MCT gates. A marking algorithm which is more effective than the traditional moving rule is used to optimize the final circuit. The main improvement is that the resulting circuits make significantly better use of ancillary lines than has been achieved in earlier approaches. Initial results are also presented for circuits with nearest-neighbour communication. These results show that the overall approach is not as effective for that problem indicating that research on direct synthesis of nearest-neighbour quantum circuits should be considered. While, the results presented are for the NCV quantum gate library (i.e. for quantum circuits composed of NOT gates, controlled-NOT gates, and controlled-V=V +  gates), the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "163\n", "authors": ["1883"]}
{"title": "Assisted behavior driven development using natural language processing\n", "abstract": " In Behavior Driven Development\u00a0(BDD), acceptance tests provide the starting point for the software design flow and serve as a basis for the communication between designers and stakeholders. In this agile software development technique, acceptance tests are written in natural language in order to ensure a common understanding between all members of the project. As a consequence, mapping the sentences to actual source code is the first step of the design flow, which is usually done manually.             However, the scenarios described by the acceptance tests provide enough information in order to automatize the extraction of both the structure of the implementation and the test cases. In this work, we propose an assisted flow for BDD where the user enters into a dialog with the computer which suggests code pieces extracted from the sentences.

{"title": "Look-ahead schemes for nearest neighbor optimization of 1D and 2D quantum circuits\n", "abstract": " Ensuring nearest neighbor compliance of quantum circuits by inserting SWAP gates has heavily been considered in the past. Here, quantum gates are considered which work on non-adjacent qubits. SWAP gates are applied in order to \u201cmove\u201d these qubits onto adjacent positions. However, a decision how exactly the SWAPs are \u201cmoved\u201d has mainly been made without considering the effect a \u201cmovement\u201d of qubits may have on the remaining circuit. In this work, we propose a methodology for nearest neighbor optimization which addresses this problem by means of a look-ahead scheme. To this end, two representative implementations are presented and discussed in detail. Experimental evaluations show that, in the best case, reductions in the number of SWAP gates of 56% (compared to the state-of-the-art methods) can be achieved following the proposed methodology.", "num_citations": "94\n", "authors": ["1883"]}
{"title": "Equivalence checking of reversible circuits\n", "abstract": " Determining the equivalence of reversible circuits designed to meet a common specification is considered. The circuits' primary inputs and outputs must be in pure logic states but the circuits may include elementary quantum gates in addition to reversible logic gates. The specification can include don't-cares arising from constant inputs, garbage outputs, and total or partial don't-cares in the underlying target function. The paper explores well-known techniques from irreversible equivalence checking and how they can be applied in the domain of reversible circuits. Two approaches are considered. The first employs decision diagram techniques and the second uses Boolean satisfiability. Experimental results show that for both methods, circuits with up to 27,000 gates, as well as adders with more than 100 inputs and outputs, are handled in under three minutes with reasonable memory requirements.", "num_citations": "92\n", "authors": ["1883"]}

{"title": "Reducing reversible circuit cost by adding lines\n", "abstract": " Additional lines are required to implement an irreversible function as a reversible circuit. The emphasis, particularly in automated synthesis methods, has been on using the minimal number of additional lines. In this paper, we show that circuit cost reductions can be achieved by adding additional lines. We present an algorithm for line addition that can be targeted to reducing the quantum cost of a circuit or the transistor count for a CMOS implementation. Experimental results show that the cost reduction can be significant even if (1) only a small number of lines (even one) is added and (2) other circuit optimizations have already been applied.", "num_citations": "83\n", "authors": ["1883"]}
{"title": "Determining the minimal number of swap gates for multi-dimensional nearest neighbor quantum circuits\n", "abstract": " Motivated by the promises of significant speed-ups for certain problems, quantum computing received significant attention in the past. While much progress has been made in the development of synthesis methods for quantum circuits, new physical developments constantly lead to new constraints to be addressed. The limited interaction distance between the respective qubits (i.e. nearest neighbor optimization) has already been considered intensely. But with the emerge of multi-dimensional quantum architectures, new physical requirements came up for which only a few automatic synthesis solutions exist yet all of them of heuristic nature. In this work, we propose an exact scheme for nearest neighbor optimization in multi-dimensional quantum circuits.

{"title": "Verifying dynamic aspects of UML models\n", "abstract": " The Unified Modeling Language (UML) as a defacto standard for software development finds more and more application in the design of systems which also contain hardware components. Guaranteeing the correctness of a system specified in UML is thereby an important as well as challenging task. In recent years, first approaches for this purpose have been introduced. However, most of them focus only on the static view of a UML model. In this paper, an automatic approach is presented which checks verification tasks for dynamic aspects of a UML model. That is, given a UML model as well as an initial system state, the approach proves whether a sequence of operation calls exists so that a desired behavior is invoked. The underlying verification problem is encoded as an instance of the satisfiability problem and subsequently solved using a SAT Modulo Theory solver.

In order to enable the exploration of this technology, we propose a model for the logic synthesis of QCA circuits that, for the first time, considers and abstracts all main physical aspects-in particular, energy dissipation. To this end, we review in detail how energy is dissipated in QCA cells and present a corresponding environment that allows for the estimation of the energy dissipation with respect to any specific set of technology parameters. Based on that, we derive a model for logic synthesis. A case study confirms the accuracy of the proposed model and reveals that interconnections have a significant impact in this technology-motivating a more rigorous consideration.

Suitable technologies for the modeling and design of quantum computers and other information processing techniques that exploit quantum mechanical principles are in the range of vision. Quantum algorithms that significantly speed up the process of solving several important computation problems have been proposed in the past. The most common representation of quantum mechanical phenomena are transformation matrices. However, the transformation matrices grow exponentially with the size of a quantum system and, thus, pose significant challenges for efficient representation and manipulation of quantum functionality. In order to address this problem, first approaches for the representation of quantum systems in terms of decision diagrams have been proposed.

{"title": "Exact reordering of circuit lines for nearest neighbor quantum architectures\n", "abstract": " Research in the domain of quantum computation is mainly driven by their promising applications e.g., for factorization or database search. At the same time, physical developments for this emerging technology constantly lead to new constraints to be addressed by logic designers. The limited interaction distance between qubits, the elementary information storage in quantum circuits, is one of the most common restrictions, leading to the fact that, for many quantum architectures, computations can only be performed on adjacent (i.e., nearest neighbor) qubits. Motivated by that, optimization of quantum circuits with respect to this restriction has become an intensely considered research topic. In this paper, we briefly review existing approaches that have been proposed in the past for this purpose. We particularly consider that almost all existing solutions are of heuristic nature, i.e., do not guarantee an optimal solution. In\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "75\n", "authors": ["1883"]}
