{"title": "A quantitative study to identify critical requirement engineering challenges in the context of small and medium software enterprise\n", "abstract": " Requirement engineering field has been intensively studied in last decade. Even though requirement still one of the most critical process in software development. Recent studies shows that 56% of system defects are coming from requirement. Additionally, by one estimate requirement errors cost 10 times more than coding errors. Thus, there is a need to identify those critical requirement engineering challenges. To address this issues, critical challenges have been investigated in the last two decades between the year 1995 and 2016. Where systematic literature review (SLR) has been used to explore previous studies findings and results. Additionally, identified critical challenges have been further investigated using quantitative study through software small and medium enterprises (SME). Where a total of 250 surveys have been collected, after eliminating incomplete surveys 217 completed surveys used for data\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["402"]}
{"title": "Assessment and evaluation of requirements elicitation techniques using analysis determination requirements framework\n", "abstract": " Numerous requirements engineering methods have been proposed to improve the quality of requirements documents and to increase customer satisfaction with the final product. However, the choosing between various techniques may be confusing and puzzling. Therefore, this paper aims to present an empirical study to assess requirement analysis techniques, highlight their key features, strength and limitations. The empirical study results show a high competitiveness between requirement engineering techniques and slight score differences among them. Statistics shows that Interview technique is the uppermost obtained score among all techniques, followed by JAD and Brainstorming technique.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["402"]}

{"title": "The study of available techniques for existing requirements engineering challenges based on literature review evidences\n", "abstract": " It is well known that software engineering suffer from various challenges. Moreover, numerous researchers found that project challenges have a negative effect on project time cost and user satisfaction. Additionally, Numerous Requirements Engineering (RE) methods have been proposed to improve the quality of requirements documents and to increase customer satisfaction about final product. Nevertheless, the choosing between various techniques may be confusing and puzzling. Therefore, this study aims to present, Literature review based study to link between RE challenges and available techniques to eliminate challenges using the utmost appropriate technique. Study conclusions are relevant for both industry and academic researchers in order to achieve effective software requirement engineering.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["402"]}
{"title": "Measuring Security in Requirements Engineering\n", "abstract": " The aim of this paper is to measure the security and related verification method in requirements engineering (RE). There are a few existing approaches to measure RE performance like IEEE Software Requirements Specification (SRS) and Security Quality Requirements Engineering (SQUARE). However, these existing approaches have some limitations such as lack of flexibility and require long implementation period. In order to address these issues, this paper intends to propose a new set of tools. First is the Effective Security Check List (ESCL), which is a check list with security questions that should be considered for measuring security. Secondly, the Traceability Matrix (TM), which is a two dimensional matrix to measure security during RE. Thirdly, Requirement Engineering Assessment Document (READ), which is a tool containing all statistical information about security performance during RE. The combination of presented approaches had been implemented in a case study. The outcome results are encouraging and illustrated integrated outcomes within existing RE model. The security level had also been properly measured.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["402"]}

{"title": "Questionnaire based Approach to Measure Security in Requirement Engineering\n", "abstract": " The aim of this paper is to measure security in requirement engineering using questionnaire based approach. The questionnaire is applied in the four stages of requirement engineering(Elicitation, analyses, validation, management). The questionnaire based approach is composing of three main parts. First the security questions part. Second the evaluation part which should be filled by the stakeholders. Third the assessment part. Finally A case study conducted to apply Questionnaire based approach and to measure security in requirement engineering.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["402"]}
{"title": "The study of the relation between requirement engineering techniques and challenges in software industry\n", "abstract": " Requirement engineering (RE) filed has been intensively studied by researchers in order to reduce its challenges effects. By one estimate requirement engineering errors costs 10 times more than coding errors, which reflect that the earlier errors has been discovered the better. This paper aims to study the relation between RE techniques and challenges. Moreover a conceptual research framework has been propose to link aforementioned research items. Consequently a research survey has been identified and distributed to 246 software engineering respondents in order to assess proposed framework.
