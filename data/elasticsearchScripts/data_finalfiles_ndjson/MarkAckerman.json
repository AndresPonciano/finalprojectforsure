{"title": "Expertise networks in online communities: structure and algorithms\n", "abstract": " Web-based communities have become important places for people to seek and share expertise. We find that networks in these communities typically differ in their topology from other online networks such as the World Wide Web. Systems targeted to augment web-based communities by automatically identifying users with expertise, for example, need to adapt to the underlying interaction dynamics. In this study, we analyze the Java Forum, a large online help-seeking community, using social network analysis methods. We test a set of network-based ranking algorithms, including PageRank and HITS, on this large size social network in order to identify users with high expertise. We then use simulations to identify a small number of simple simulation rules governing the question-answer dynamic in the network. These simple rules not only replicate the structural characteristics and algorithm performance on the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1138\n", "authors": ["1182"]}

In this paper, we seek to understand YA's knowledge sharing and activity. We analyze the forum categories and cluster them according to content characteristics and patterns of interaction among the users. While interactions in some categories resemble expertise sharing forums, others incorporate discussion, everyday advice, and support. With such a diversity of categories in which one can participate, we find that some users focus narrowly on specific topics, while others participate across categories. This not only allows us to map related categories, but to characterize the entropy of the users' interests. We find that lower entropy correlates with receiving higher\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1015\n", "authors": ["1182"]}
{"title": "The intellectual challenge of CSCW: The gap between social requirements and technical feasibility\n", "abstract": " Over the last 10 years, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) has identified a base set of findings. These findings are taken almost as assumptions within the field. In summary, they argue that human activity is highly flexible, nuanced, and contextualized and that computational entities such as information sharing, roles, and social norms need to be similarly flexible, nuanced, and contextualized. However, current systems cannot fully support the social world uncovered by these findings. In this article I argue that there is an inherent gap between the social requirements of CSCW and its technical mechanisms. The social-technical gap is the divide between what we know we must support socially and what we can support technically. Exploring, understanding, and hopefully ameliorating this social-technical gap is the central challenge for CSCW as a field and one of the central problems for human-computer\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "988\n", "authors": ["1182"]}

The information in a repository has the advantage of being easily transferable and reusable. But it is not easy to use decontextualized information, and users often need access to human experts. This book describes a more recent approach to knowledge management, which the authors call\" expertise sharing.\" Expertise sharing emphasizes the human aspects--cognitive, social, cultural, and organizational--of knowledge management, in addition to information storage and retrieval. Rather than focusing on the management level of an organization, expertise sharing focuses on the self-organized activities of the organization's members. The book addresses the concerns of both researchers and practitioners, describing current literature and research as well as offering information on implementing systems.

We examined the use of this information before and after the adoption of a CPOE (Computerized Provider Order Entry) system in an inpatient unit of a large teaching hospital. Before CPOE adoption, nurses used paper working documents to detail psycho-social information about patients; after the CPOE adoption, they did not use paper or digital notes as was planned. The paper describes this process and analyses how several interlocked reasons contributed to the loss of this information in written form. We found that a change in physical location, sufficient convenience, visibility of the information, and permanency of information account for some, but not all, of the outcome.

Indeed, knowledge management has been a flourishing commercial area for almost ten years, and one can point to many precursors within organizations as well. Knowledge management\u2014regardless of its title or position in history\u2014has always been an important, though not necessarily frequent, aspect of organizational life. It would be difficult to imagine a modern corporation that did not occasionally reflect on and improve its methods of handling communications, data, and information\u2014or try to learn from its experience. In this chapter, we move from the metaphor of knowledge management to a new metaphor, expertise sharing, which promotes a focus on the inherently collaborative and social nature of the problem.In our view, knowledge management subsumes a number of differing strategies. What all of these strategies share\u2014as do many informationaccess strategies\u2014are interactions with or foundations in the social setting of an organization or institution.

Our study focuses on one community employing faceted ratings, CouchSurfing. org, and combines data analysis of ratings, a large-scale survey, and in-depth interviews. In order to understand the ratings, we revisit the notions of friendship and trust and uncover an asymmetry: close friendship includes trust, but high levels of trust can be achieved without close friendship. To users, providing faceted ratings presents challenges, including differentiating and quantifying inherently subjective feelings such as friendship and trust, concern over a friend's reaction to a rating, and knowledge of how ratings can affect others' reputations. One consequence of these issues is the near absence of negative feedback, even though a small portion of actual experiences and privately held ratings are negative.

Because of its size and diversity, it is increasingly likely that if the information one seeks is not already there, it will be soon. Unfortunately, finding the right places to look, and persistently revisiting those places until the information is available is an onerous task. In this paper, we describe Do-I-Care (DICA), an agent that uses both technical and social mechanisms to ease the burden of locating\" interesting\" new information and resources on the Web.DICA monitors Web pages previously found by the agent\u2019s user to be relevant for any changes. It then compares these changes against a user model, classifies them as potentially interesting or not, and reports the interesting changes to the user. The user model is derived by accepting relevance feedback on changes previously found. Because the agent focuses on changes to known pages rather than discovering new pages, we increase the likelihood that the information found will be interesting. DICA combines an effortless collaboration mechanism with the natural incentives for individual users to maintain and train their own agents. Simply by pointing DICA agents at other agents, changes and opinions can be propagated from agent to agent automatically. Thus, individuals train and use DICA for themselves, but by using a simple technical mechanism, other users can use those results without the additional effort that often accompanies collaboration.", "num_citations": "41\n", "authors": ["1182"]}

Many parents want to capture the candid, fleeting moments of their young children's lives to treasure later, but these moments are difficult to anticipate and to capture without disruption. Current technologies to address this are limited to indiscriminately capturing everything, or are dependent on parents' presence and prescience to initiate capture and manually record the moment. To address these limitations, we introduce KidKeeper, a toy-like system to capture, select, and deliver everyday family memories with minimal effort and disruption to family life. It uses an innovative approach to capture that we call\" integrated capture,\" that combines previous attempts to continuously capture family memories with the practice-oriented approach of\" unremarkable computing\" to embed capture capabilities unobtrusively into everyday activities.

{"title": "Extra-technical information for method libraries\n", "abstract": " With the development of a number of problem-solving method (PSM) libraries, recent work has focused on the need for a method description language to describe PSMs for easier retrieval, understanding and reuse. Fensel, et al.(1999) have proposed a Unified Problem-solving Method Development Language (UPML) to address this need. However, to date, this language is focused on formal descriptions of capabilities, and on ontologies that describe inputs and outputs. While these technical descriptions of a method are clearly important, we suggest that other extra-technical information about PSMs can be essential for cost-effective reuse. This information is especially important for those PSMs that are available as an implemented software product. In some user communities, these informal, pragmatic data about a method are as important as any description of the capabilities of a method. Thus, we suggest that expanding UPML in this direction is an important research task. As an initial step, we propose a set of attributes and features that should be added to UPML in order to capture and use extra-technical information about PSMs.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1182"]}

It is often viewed as a goal that can be facilitated with the use of patient data. It is also viewed, especially from the medical side, as something an individual achieves. However, in the lived experience, independence is often a set of collaborative practices. In this paper, we unpack findings from an interview-based study of Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) self-care. We found that independence - both functional and in the form of effecting agency - must be co-constructed by the choices and activities of the care network, including the person with disability, caregivers, and clinicians. This collaboratively shaped independence also affects potential collection and use of data in support of self-care.

{"title": "The intellectual challenge of CSCW\n", "abstract": " Over the last 10 years, ComputerSupported Cooperative Work (CSCW) has identified a base set of findings. These findings are taken almost as assumptions within the field. In summary, they argue that human activity is highly flexible, nuanced, and contextualized and that computational entities such as information sharing, roles, and social norms need to be similarly flexible, nuanced, and contextualized. However, current systems cannot fully support the social world uncovered by these findings. In this article I argue that there is an inherent gap between the social requirements of CSCW and its technical mechanisms. The social\u2013-technical gap is the divide between what we know we must support socially and what we can support technically. Exploring, understanding, and hopefully ameliorating this social\u2013technical gap is the central challenge for CSCW as a field and one of the central problems for human\u2013computer interaction. Indeed, merely attesting the continued centrality of this gap could be one of the important intellectual contributions of CSCW.

The research is conducted in an inpatient unit at an academic medical center, where the CPOE is being implemented and clinicians have found to develop ways to workaround the system. The findings of the study will help improve our understanding of the interaction between people, information, and IT systems in a highly efficient and highly collaborative clinical environment.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1182"]}
{"title": "Knowledge Management In Action: IFIP 20th World Computer Congress, Conference on Knowledge Management in Action, September 7-10, 2008, Milano, Italy\n", "abstract": " Knowledge management (KM) is more a nd more recognized as a key factor of success for organisations: not only stru ctured companies, but also virtual enterprises, networks of organisations or ev en virtual communities. These organisations of differentki nds, are becoming increasingly aware of the need to collect, organise, mobilise, increase, in sum manage, the knowledge characterising their ability to stay alive, adapt and evolve in a turbulent context. Through various organisationaland t echnological approaches, KM aims at improving knowledge access, sharing and reuse as well as new knowledge creation. KMIA 2008 highlights problems, requirements and solutions that are derived from actual, concrete experiences. The fourteen papers accepted at KMIA 2008 give various answers to the following questions: What organisational strategies can enable to enact and promote KM within organisations? How to link these organisational strategies withth e ICT technology? Organisational strategies can be related to the evolution of the organisation itself or to its environment: intra organisational and inter organisational strategies can thus bedi stinguished. Some papers emphasize the importance of collaboration and knowledge transfer for team work and collaborative projects that may be intra organisational or inter organisational (eg intero rganisational outsourcing relationships). Strategies for designing and manufacturing innovative products are recognised as crucial for enterprises that operate in competitive sectors. Networkso forg anisations can help to improve the competitiveness of these organisations: KM can thus enhance competency\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1182"]}
{"title": "Reflections and Conclusions: Toward a Theory of Resources\n", "abstract": " This book has examined a broad range of resources. From the hand gesture that signifies a hypothesis about the configuration of a Thrombin molecule when binding a substrate (Becvar et al., this volume), to material artifacts like the rush cheat sheet (Halverson and Ackerman, this volume), to information systems like Zephyr (Ackerman and Palen, this volume) and CareVue (Reddy and Dourish, this volume), resources run the gamut from the minimal and material to the complex and virtual. The work reported here has explored questions ranging from how resources come into being and how they evolve over time, to the social arrangements that make them what they are.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1182"]}
{"title": "Surviving the Information Explosion\n", "abstract": " The Problem: A typical person deals with a great deal of electronic information, and it can be overwhelming to keep track of it all. The problems that people have in interacting with large amounts of information are well documented. In 1988 Lansdale outlined some of \u201cthe problems of classification and the role of memory\u201d in information organization\u2014in other words, the problems of storing and retrieving information [2]. Lansdale states that the main problem with information organization is that humans have too limited a memory to remember exactly where they file every piece of information, either in the physical world or on their computers. Instead, people remember certain pieces of their organization, such as visual cues or dates, and rely on these pieces to help guide them to the information they need. Unfortunately, existing information organization tools are not tailored to the aspects of electronic information that people recall easily when locating information.Motivation: Haystack is a personal information management tool intended to provide users with centralized access to their personal information. With Haystack we seek to allow users to organize and access their information in a natural way. To allow for natural interactions, we must understand the cues that people use to store and retrieve their information. For example, when looking for a previously received email, a person might recall the email sender, but she may not remember specific words in the body of the email that could be used to generate", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1182"]}
{"title": "Expertise networks as an enabling technology for cyberspace use\n", "abstract": " Expertise networks are technical augmentations of the ad-hoc social networks that enable people to answer questions, accomplish tasks, and find information. Technologies to create, enhance, and maintain these networks will be important uses of the Net.In this paper, I briefly survey two interrelated things. First, the paper notes the social aspects of the Net that suggest these augmentations would be useful and interesting to do. Second, it discusses some technical directions to augment expertise networks that may change the ways we work and socialize. Because the technical and social are so interwoven in both the design and use of Net applications, at the end of this paper, I also note how important, although difficult, it is to understand the interplay of the technology and the social change.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1182"]}
