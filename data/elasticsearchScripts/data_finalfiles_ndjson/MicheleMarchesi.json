The algorithm is essentially an iterative random search procedure with adaptive moves along the coordinate directions. It permits uphill moves under the control of a probabilistic criterion, thus tending to avoid the first local minima encountered. The algorithm has been tested against the Nelder and Mead simplex method and against a version of Adaptive Random Search. The test functions were Rosenbrock valleys and multiminima functions in 2,4, and 10 dimensions. The new method proved to be more reliable than the others, being always able to find the optimum, or at least a point very close to it. It is quite costly in term of function evaluations, but its cost can be predicted in advance, depending only slightly on the starting point.", "num_citations": "2107\n", "authors": ["1207"]}

This raises the question of whether scaling in finance emerges in a similar way\u2014from the interactions of a large ensemble of market participants. However, such an explanation is in contradiction to the prevalent \u2018efficient market hypothesis\u20197 in economics, which assumes that the movements of financial prices are an immediate and unbiased reflection of incoming news about future earning prospects. Within this hypothesis, scaling in price changes would simply reflect similar scaling in the \u2018input\u2019signals that influence them.

This paper presents a possible explanation for this phenomenon within a multi-agent framework of speculative activity. In the model, both chartist and fundamentalist strategies are considered with agents switching between both behavioural variants according to observed differences in pay-offs. Price changes are brought about by a market maker reacting to imbalances between demand and supply. Most of the time, a stable and efficient market results. However, its usual tranquil performance is interspersed by sudden transient phases of destabilisation. An outbreak of volatility occurs if the fraction of agents using chartist techniques surpasses a certain threshold value, but such phases are quickly brought to an end by stabilising tendencies. Formally, this pattern can be understood as an example of a new type of dynamic behaviour\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "956\n", "authors": ["1207"]}

In particular, after defining a proper neuron structure (i.e. using a non-analytic activation function), a novel learning algorithm is derived. On equalizing an 8-PSK complex signal distorted by a nonlinear communication channel, a comparison between this new complex network and the real-valued Multi-Layer Perceptron is also reported in this paper.

{"title": "Smart contracts software metrics: a first study\n", "abstract": " Smart contracts (SC) are software codes which reside and run over a blockchain. The code can be written in different languages with the common purpose of implementing various kinds of transactions onto the hosting blockchain, They are ruled by the blockchain infrastructure and work in order to satisfy conditions typical of traditional contracts. The software code must satisfy constrains strongly context dependent which are quite different from traditional software code. In particular, since the bytecode is uploaded in the hosting blockchain, size, computational resources, interaction between different parts of software are all limited and even if the specific software languages implement more or less the same constructs of traditional languages there is not the same freedom as in normal software development. SC software is expected to reflect these constrains on SC software metrics which should display metric values characteristic of the domain and different from more traditional software metrics. We tested this hypothesis on the code of more than twelve thousands SC written in Solidity and uploaded on the Ethereum blockchain. We downloaded the SC from a public repository and computed the statistics of a set of software metrics related to SC and compared them to the metrics extracted from more traditional software projects. Our results show that generally Smart Contracts metrics have ranges more restricted than the corresponding metrics in traditional software systems.

A learning procedure based on back-propagation for obtaining a neural network with such discrete weights is presented. This learning procedure requires full real arithmetic and therefore must be performed offline. It starts from a multilayer perceptron with continuous weights learned using back-propagation.

We discuss the distribution of these metrics, and their correlation, both at class and at system level. We found that most metrics follow a leptokurtotic distribution.

{"title": "Power laws in Smalltalk\n", "abstract": " Many real systems have been described as complex networks, where nodes represent specific parts of the system and connections represent relationships among them. Examples of such networks come from very different contexts. Traditional theories suggest to represent complex systems as random graphs, according to the models proposed by Erdos and R\u00e9nyi. However, there is an increasing evidence that many real world systems behave in different ways displaying scale-free distributions of nodes degree. Random graphs are not suitable to describe such behaviors, thus new models have been proposed in recent years. Recently, it has emerged the interest in applying complex network theories to represent large software systems. Software applications are made of modules and relationships among them. Thus, a representation based on graph theory is natural. This work presents our study1 in this context. We analyzed four large Smalltalk systems. For each one we built the graph representing all system classes and the relationships among them. We show that these graphs display scale free characteristics, in accordance to recent studies on other large software systems.", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["1207"]}

Very few studies however have explored whether the MI correlates strongly with class features such as coupling, defects or size - features of object-oriented (OO) classes which are acknowledged to be surrogates of maintenance complexity. We explore the relationship between the MI and these four perspectives.

At every time step an agent is chosen with uniform distribution to issue an order. The order can be a limit order or a market order. If the order is a limit order, it is stored in the book; if the order is a market order, a transaction occurs. Prices are formed at variable time steps, i.e., only when a market order is issued.

{"title": "Applying the etl process to blockchain data. prospect and findings\n", "abstract": " We present a novel strategy, based on the Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) process, to collect data from a blockchain, elaborate and make it available for further analysis. The study aims to satisfy the need for increasingly efficient data extraction strategies and effective representation methods for blockchain data. For this reason, we conceived a system to make scalable the process of blockchain data extraction and clustering, and to provide a SQL database which preserves the distinction between transaction and addresses. The proposed system satisfies the need to cluster addresses in entities, and the need to store the extracted data in a conventional database, making possible the data analysis by querying the database. In general, ETL processes allow the automation of the operation of data selection, data collection and data conditioning from a data warehouse, and produce output data in the best format for subsequent processing or for business. We focus on the Bitcoin blockchain transactions, which we organized in a relational database to distinguish between the input section and the output section of each transaction. We describe the implementation of address clustering algorithms specific for the Bitcoin blockchain and the process to collect and transform data and to load them in the database. To balance the input data rate with the elaboration time, we manage blockchain data according to the lambda architecture. To evaluate our process, we first analyzed the performances in terms of scalability, and then we checked its usability by analyzing loaded data. Finally, we present the results of a toy analysis, which provides some findings\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1207"]}

We focused on the influence of these kinds of restrictions on daily price volatility and on traders long-run wealth distribution. We performed analysis both in a closed market and in an open market, where there is random cash inflow or outflow ten simulation days apart. Considering the closed market, we found that if short selling and margin trading are not banned, volatility tend to slightly increase. Also, we found that, if short selling and margin trading are allowed, there is a chance that some traders declare bankrupt and leave the market. Generally, the open and the closed market have similar features, except for the fact that in an open market the number of bankrupts increases. External factors, such as sudden variations of prices and wealth, damage traders who are in debt positions much more than the other traders.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1207"]}

{"title": "Adopting agile methodologies in distributed software development\n", "abstract": " From the second half of the '90s, some software engineering practitioners introduced a new group of software development methodologies called Agile Methodologies (Ams): they have been developed to overcome the limits of the traditional approaches in the software development. FLOSS (Free Libre Open Source Software) has been proposed as possible different solution to the software crisis that is afflicting the ICT worldwide business. If the AMs improve the quality code and allow to respond quickly to requirement changes, FLOSS approach decreases the development costs and increases the spreading of competences about the software products. A debate is shaping about the compatibility of these two approaches. Software development teams have been spreading around the world, with users in Europe, management in the USA and programmers in the USA and India. The scattering of team members and functions around the world introduces barriers to productivity, cultural and languages differences can lead to misunderstanding of requirements, time zone differences can delay project schedules. Agile methods can provide a competitive advantage by delivering early, simplifying communication and allowing the business to respond more quickly to the market by changing the software. Trying to distribute a development project in an agile way isn't easy and will involve compromises. The goal of this thesis is to determine the application of the AMs in several contexts so to define which of these can be used effectively in non traditional software projects as the distributed development.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1207"]}

In this case, because one of the two multiplier operands is a power-of-two, the multiple operation can be performed as a much simpler shift operation on the neuron input.

Because of the wide application of agile approaches in industry, the need for collaboration between academics and practitioners has increased in order to develop the body of knowledge available to support managers, system engineers, and software engineers in their managerial/economic and architectural/project/technical decisions. Year after year, the XP conference has facilitated such improvements and provided evidence on the advantages of agile methodologies by examining the latest theories, practical applications, and implications of agile and lean methods. The 15 full papers, seven short papers, and four experience reports accepted for XP 2014 were selected from 59 submissions and are organized in sections on: agile development, agile challenges and contracting, lessons learned and agile maturity, how to evolve software engineering teaching, methods and metrics, and lean development.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1207"]}
{"title": "Study of the Competition between Proprietary Software Firms and Free/Libre Open Source Software Firms Using a Simulation Model\n", "abstract": " In recent years, a very important structural change in the software industry took place, with an increasing number of firms that got involved in Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) development communities. FLOSS communities and products have been studied as complementary to proprietary software companies and products. In this paper we propone a business model for the software market, and in particular we analyze the competition between proprietary software firms and FLOSS firms. Our software market is a system where each agent is independent of each other in the choice about buying or selling software products or services. The proposed work aims to analyze the influence of FLOSS firms producing both software and services in vertical software markets, nowadays mostly dominated by large proprietary firms. The findings show that FLOSS firms are able to compete with proprietary firms\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1207"]}

Tabu Search (TS) is a metaheuristic that guides the search for the optimal solution making use of flexible memory systems which exploit the history of the search. It consists of systematically prohibiting some solutions to prevent cycling and, at the same time, avoiding to be trapped in local minima, and deeply explores the search space to minimise the objective function. Since the variables to be optimised are continuous in nature, we developed a continuous tabu search algorithm in which the range of variation of each variable is discretised by division into sub-ranges. In this way, it is possible to identify a finite alphabet and apply tabu search strategies. Best performances have been reached by coupling tabu search with other optimisation procedures, such as Golden Search (GS) and a non-linear Simplex\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1207"]}

We evaluated the performance of one stage frameworks, based only on one machine learning technique, such as the Bayesian Neural Network, the Feed Forward and the Long Short Term Memory Neural Networks, and that of two stages frameworks formed by the neural networks just mentioned in cascade to Support Vector Regression. Results highlight higher performance of the two stages frameworks with respect to the correspondent one stage frameworks, but for the Bayesian Neural Network.

{"title": "Can islands profit from economies of density? An application to the retail sector\n", "abstract": " This paper examines the additional costs borne by retailers whose strategy relies upon the exploitation of density economies when they decide to expand their network in an island. Insularity implies indeed being a non-connected node in the network, thus preventing economies of density to be entirely exploited. On this regard, such a discontinuity would entail lower profits due to a reduced efficiency in the distribution network. Starting from real data regarding an Italian large retailer, we evaluate the extent to which insularity represents a threat for the exploitation of economies of density by the retail industry. In this respect, the Italian peculiar geograph-ical configuration makes it an interesting case study. The main finding is that while stores located in the mainland are interested by a progressive reduction of transport costs, Sardinia, which is a remote island, is not interested by such a pattern. Indeed, a contiguous distribution network helps lowering distances covered to make deliveries, thus reducing the burden represented by distribution costs.

The relationship between the software engineering concept of\" coupling\"(ie, the degree of inter-connectedness of a system's components) and faults is still a research question attracting attention and a relationship with strong implications for performance; excessive coupling is generally acknowledged to contribute to fault-proneness. In this paper, we explore the relationship between faults and coupling. Two releases from each of three open-source Eclipse projects (six releases in total) were used as an empirical basis and coupling and fault data extracted from those systems. A contrasting coupling profile between fault-free and fault-prone classes was observed and this result was statistically supported. Object-oriented (OO) classes with low values of fan-in (incoming coupling) and fan-out (outgoing coupling) appeared to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1207"]}

The software system is characterized by the degree distribution of the graph properties, like in-or-out links, as well as by the distribution of Chidamber and Kemerer metrics computed on its CUs. Every CU can be related to one or more bugs during its life. We find a relationship among the software system and the bugs hitting its nodes. We found that the distribution of some metrics, and the number of bugs per CU, exhibit a power-law behavior in their tails, as well as the number of CUs influenced by a specific bug. We examine the evolution of software metrics across different releases to understand how relationships among CUs metrics and CUs faultness change with time.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1207"]}

Since the classical real-valued sigmoidal activation function, analytically extended to the complex plane, is not bounded everywhere (due to the Liouville's theorem), a new complex activation function is proposed which is always bounded and behaves in a way very close to its real-valued counterpart.

Developers involved in an open-source projects do not usually know each other; they mainly communicate through mailing lists, chat rooms, and tools such as issue tracking systems. The way in which they communicate affects the development process and the productivity of the people involved in the project. We evaluated politeness, sentiment and emotions of comments posted by developers and studied the communication flow to understand how they interacted in the presence of impolite and negative comments (and vice versa). Our analysis shows that when in presence of impolite or negative comments, the probability of the next comment being impolite or negative is 14% and 25%, respectively; anger however, has a probability of 40% of being followed by a further anger comment. The result could help managers take control the development phases of a system, since social aspects can seriously affect a developer's productivity.

The particular behavioural variant adopted by an agent also determines her decision to enter on the long or short side of the market. Short-run imbalances between demand and supply lead to price adjustments by a market maker or auctioneer in the usual Walrasian manner. Our interest in this paper is in exploring the behaviour of our model when testing for the presence of chaos or non-linearity in the simulated data. First, attempts to determine the fractal dimension of the underlying process gave unsatisfactory results in that we experienced a lack of convergence of the estimate. Explicit tests for non-linearity and dependence (The BDS and Kaplan tests) also give very unstable results in that we can find both acceptance and strong rejection of IIDness in different realisations of our model. All in all, this behaviour is very similar to experience collected with empirical data and our results may point towards an explanation of why robustness of inference in this area is low. Estimating GARCH models, we also find that most of the nonlinearity is contained in second moments.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1207"]}
