We describe a meta-model for representing business rules in terms of an enterprise model, and also a decision support sub-model for reasoning about and deriving the rules.

In this paper, we extend WIFA to take resources into account when modeling and enacting workflows. Resources can become important decision factors when combined with control flow information. In many situations, business processes are constrained by scarce resources. The lack of resources can cause contention, the need for some tasks to wait for others to complete, and the slowing down of the accomplishment of larger goals. This is particularly true in an emergency response system where large quantity of resources, including emergency responders, ambulances, fire trucks, medications, food, clothing, etc., are required. Often potential delays can be avoided or reduced by using resource analysis to identify ways in which tasks can be executed in parallel, in the most efficient way. Currently, during a time of crisis, a decision maker often concentrates on a single criterion in order to simplify, speed up or control the decision process itself. A resource-constrained workflow model can support the decision process by analyzing multiple criteria. It can keep track of resources availability, disable the path that is not executable, and present all executable paths, allowing the emergency responders to make decisions and implement them more confidently.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["382"]}

{"title": "Informed and Timely Business Decisions\u2013A Data-driven Approach\n", "abstract": " One of the main characteristics of business rules is their propensity for frequent change, due to internal or external factors to an enterprise. As these rules change, their immediate dissemination across people and systems in an enterprise becomes vital. The delay in dissemination can adversely impact the reputation of the enterprise, and cause significant loss of revenue. The current BRMS are often maintained by the IT group within a company, therefore the modifications of the BRs intended by executive management would not be instantaneous, since they have to be coded, and tested before being deployed. Moreover, the executives might not have the possibility to take the best decisions, without having the benefit of analyzing historical data, and quickly simulating what-if scenarios to visualize the effects of a set of rules on the business. Some of the systems that provide this functionality are prohibitively expensive. This paper addresses these challenges by using the power of Big Data analysis to source, clean and analyze historical data that is used for mining business rules, which can be visualized, tested on what-if scenarios, and immediately deployed without the intervention of the IT group.
