{"title": "A methodology and tool support for managing business rules in organisations\n", "abstract": " Business rules are evidently important for organisations as they describe how they are doing business. Their value has also been recognised within the information system (IS) domain, mostly because of their ability to make applications flexible and amenable to change. In this paper, we propose a methodology that helps business people and developers to keep business rules at the business level inline with the rules that are implemented at the system level. In contrast to several existing approaches that primarily focus on business rules in the scope of an application, our methodology addresses the entire IS of an organisation. The paper also describes requirements for a tool support that would be appropriate to support the methodology.", "num_citations": "212\n", "authors": ["373"]}

Furthermore, due to its simplicity, it is also currently one of the most commonly adopted algorithms in the literature. Despite various subsequent advances, an important issue of the algorithm has not yet been properly addressed. Random (node) update orders within the algorithm severely hamper its robustness, and consequently also the stability of the identified community structure. We note that an update order can be seen as increasing propagation preferences from certain nodes, and propose a balanced propagation that counteracts for the introduced randomness by utilizing node balancers. We have evaluated the proposed approach on synthetic networks with planted partition, and on several real-world networks with community structure.

When developing supervised named entity recognition (NER) systems, the availability of a large, manually annotated text corpus is desirable. Furthermore, large corpora permit the robust evaluation and comparison of different approaches that detect chemicals in documents. We present the CHEMDNER corpus, a collection of 10,000 PubMed abstracts that contain a total of 84,355 chemical entity mentions labeled manually by expert chemistry literature curators, following annotation guidelines specifically defined for this task. The abstracts of the CHEMDNER corpus were selected to be representative for all major chemical disciplines. Each of the chemical entity mentions was manually labeled according to its structure-associated chemical entity mention (SACEM) class: abbreviation, family, formula, identifier, multiple, systematic and trivial. The difficulty and consistency of tagging chemicals in text was measured using an agreement study between annotators, obtaining a percentage agreement of 91. For a subset of the CHEMDNER corpus (the test set of 3,000 abstracts) we provide not only the Gold Standard manual annotations, but also mentions automatically detected by the 26 teams that participated in the BioCreative IV CHEMDNER chemical mention recognition task.

The current challenge is the development of information extraction procedures that can directly infer more complex relational structures, such as gene regulatory networks. We develop a computational approach for extraction of gene regulatory networks from textual data. Our method is designed as a sieve-based system and uses linear-chain conditional random fields and rules for relation extraction. With this method we successfully extracted the sporulation gene regulation network in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis for the information extraction challenge at the BioNLP 2013 conference. To enable extraction of distant relations using first-order models, we transform the data into skip-mention sequences.

We propose an approach for assessing the effectiveness of the simplification process to define the most appropriate size of simplified networks and to determine the method that preserves the most properties of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["373"]}

{"title": "Quantifying the consistency of scientific databases\n", "abstract": " Science is a social process with far-reaching impact on our modern society. In recent years, for the first time we are able to scientifically study the science itself. This is enabled by massive amounts of data on scientific publications that is increasingly becoming available. The data is contained in several databases such as Web of Science or PubMed, maintained by various public and private entities. Unfortunately, these databases are not always consistent, which considerably hinders this study. Relying on the powerful framework of complex networks, we conduct a systematic analysis of the consistency among six major scientific databases. We found that identifying a single \"best\" database is far from easy. Nevertheless, our results indicate appreciable differences in mutual consistency of different databases, which we interpret as recipes for future bibliometric studies.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["373"]}

Existing systems rely heavily on external resources, hand-engineered features, patterns, and complex pipelines fine-tuned for the English language. In this paper we describe a different approach and system inspired by end-to-end training of deep neural networks. Its input consists of only sequences of tokens, which are processed by our novel focused RNNs layer, and followed by a dense neural network for classification. Neural networks implicitly learn latent features useful for discourse relation sense classification, make the approach almost language-agnostic and independent of prior linguistic knowledge.

{"title": "Empirical comparison of network sampling techniques\n", "abstract": " In the past few years, the storage and analysis of large-scale and fast evolving networks present a great challenge. Therefore, a number of different techniques have been proposed for sampling large networks. In general, network exploration techniques approximate the original networks more accurately than random node and link selection. Yet, link selection with additional subgraph induction step outperforms most other techniques. In this paper, we apply subgraph induction also to random walk and forest-fire sampling. We analyze different real-world networks and the changes of their properties introduced by sampling. We compare several sampling techniques based on the match between the original networks and their sampled variants. The results reveal that the techniques with subgraph induction underestimate the degree and clustering distribution, while overestimate average degree and density of the original networks. Techniques without subgraph induction step exhibit exactly the opposite behavior. Hence, the performance of the sampling techniques from random selection category compared to network exploration sampling does not differ significantly, while clear differences exist between the techniques with subgraph induction step and the ones without it.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["373"]}

{"title": "Group extraction for real-world networks: The case of communities, modules, and hubs and spokes\n", "abstract": " Large real-world networks are often composed of characteristic groups of nodes with common linking pattern. Densely connected groups known as communities are perhaps the most well studied example with diverse applications in various fields. However, most real-world networks also contain other characteristic groups of nodes, while some parts of networks reveal no significant groups at all. To overcome the latter, Zhao et al. have recently proposed a community extraction criteria that explicitly guards against extracting groups that are not statistically significant. We extend their framework to arbitrary groups of nodes and propose a local group quality criteria W. Let S be a group of nodes and let T represent its linking pattern. Criteria W favors links between S and T, and penalizes links between S and TC, while disregarding links with both endpoints in SC. For this talk we consider groups with S= T that correspond to communities and groups with S\u2229 T=\u2205 denoted modules, with hub and spokes as a special case (for| T|= 1). We apply the extraction framework to the famous American football social network and a software network compiled from JUNG network analysis library (among others).

However, recent studies reveal that networks comprise even more sophisticated modules than classical cohesive communities.

Recently, a propagation based algorithm has been proposed for the detection of arbitrary network modules. We here advance the latter with a more adequate community modeling based on network clustering. The resulting algorithm is evaluated on various synthetic benchmark networks and random graphs. It is shown to be comparable to current state-of-the-art algorithms, however, in contrast to other approaches, it does not require some prior knowledge of the true community structure.

More specifically, the study demonstrates how to collect relevant and important data on the current state of the organization\u2019s information system in an efficient way, and how these data can be useful in the initial phase of the information system knowledge management life cycle. General information system due diligence can be seen as an explanatory theory that helps the stakeholders to obtain detailed information on what, how, why, when, and where, all concerning the matters of their information system. In contrast, the initial information system due diligence only acts as a prediction theory that helps the stakeholders to get a high-level picture on the current and desired state of the information system. The article outlines definitions of due diligence, various information system due diligence types and briefly presents the ISDDF, which was founded in Slovenia several years ago for conducting information system due diligences in financial industry. With this framework information system due diligence can be conducted in a very short time frame in a small or large-sized organization. The paper presents the hypothesis that the ISDDF can be applied as a knowledge collection tool in knowledge management life cycle. In order to prove this hypothesis, general information system due diligence activities were carried out in two organizations.

Several automated approaches have been suggested, but all rely on external resources, linguistic feature engineering, and their processing pipelines are built from substantially different models. In this paper, we introduce a novel system for sense classification of shallow discourse relations (FR system) based on focused recurrent neural networks (RNNs). In contrast to existing systems, FR system consists of a single end-to-end trainable model for handling all types and senses of discourse relations, requires no feature engineering or external resources, is language-independent, and can be applied at the word and even character levels. At its core, we present our novel generalization of the focused RNNs layer, the first multi-dimensional RNN-attention mechanism for constructing text/argument embeddings. The filtering/gating RNN enables downstream RNNs to focus on different aspects of the input sequence and project it into several embedding subspaces. These argument embeddings are then used to perform sense classification. FR system has been evaluated using the official datasets and methodology of CoNLL 2016 Shared Task.

{"title": "Clustering assortativity, communities and functional modules in real-world networks\n", "abstract": " Complex networks of real-world systems are believed to be controlled by common phenomena, producing structures far from regular or random. Clustering, community structure and assortative mixing by degree are perhaps among most prominent examples of the latter. Although generally accepted for social networks, these properties only partially explain the structure of other networks. We first show that degree-corrected clustering is in contrast to standard definition highly assortative. Yet interesting on its own, we further note that non-social networks contain connected regions with very low clustering. Hence, the structure of real-world networks is beyond communities. We here investigate the concept of functional modules---groups of regularly equivalent nodes---and show that such structures could explain for the properties observed in non-social networks. Real-world networks might be composed of functional modules that are overlaid by communities. We support the latter by proposing a simple network model that generates scale-free small-world networks with tunable clustering and degree mixing. Model has a natural interpretation in many real-world networks, while it also gives insights into an adequate community extraction framework. We also present an algorithm for detection of arbitrary structural modules without any prior knowledge. Algorithm is shown to be superior to state-of-the-art, while application to real-world networks reveals well supported composites of different structural modules that are consistent with the underlying systems. Clear functional modules are identified in all types of networks including social. Our findings thus\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["373"]}

{"title": "Who reads and who cites? unveiling author citation dynamics by modeling citation networks\n", "abstract": " Networks are the simplest representation of complex systems of interacting parts. Despite seemingly plain form real-world networks reveal characteristic structural properties that are absent from regular or random systems. Scale-free degree distributions, small-world structure (ie, high clustering and short paths), degree mixing (ie, degree correlations at links\u2019 ends) and communities (ie, densely linked groups) are perhaps the most widely analyzed properties in the literature. Note that communities imply assortative (ie, positively correlated) mixing by degree that is most notably pronounced in social networks. The above are also the properties captured by many random graph models [1]. However, non-social networks greatly deviate from this picture. Biological and technological networks are in fact degree disassortative (ie, negatively correlated), while different information networks often reveal no clear degree mixing and lower clustering (eg, citation networks). We here present an evolving random graph model denoted Citation model [4, 3]. Each newly added node explores the network using the burning process of [1], while links of the visited nodes are copied independently of the latter (Fig. 1). The model generates scale-free networks with arbitrary degree mixing and clustering, and very well reproduces the structure of over 60 years of Web of Science data (Fig. 2). The model also has a natural interpretation for citation networks. The process imitates an author of a paper including references into bibliography (ie, citation dynamics).

The latter especially holds for the field of natural language processing. Therefore in this paper we present a new information extraction toolkit, called nutIE, that offers a frontend for end-to-end text analysis using a modern javascript-based web application. The core of the toolkit includes all the high-level information extraction techniques with supporting preprocessing and evaluation methods. All these can be accessed by a Scala programmatic API or an arbitrary third-party application via REST interface. It has already been shown that the integrated toolkit's algorithms achieve state-of-the art results. The toolkit is currently applied at international text processing projects and courses.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["373"]}

The latter is especially important when designing a new ontology, which often includes at least some of the concepts that already exist in the linked open data cloud. Thus, in this paper we describe a new end-to-end tool LogMap+ for transformation of relational data into an ontology and matching it against a pre-existent semantic source. Apart from offering the efficient web-based application, the main contributions are the improvements of the domain specific LogMap system. We evaluate our general tool against OAEI 2014 challenge datasets and achieve comparable results to the top performing algorithms and also outperform the domain specific LogMap tool.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["373"]}

{"title": "What coins the bitcoin? Exploratory analysis of bitcoin market value by network group discovery\n", "abstract": " Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital currencies that gained tremendous popularity in recent years. Daily market trade currently exceeds 100000 BTC (over 50 million USD) with\u2248 70000 processed transactions. It relies on a network of computers that solve complex mathematical problems as a part of a process that verifies and permanently records every transaction made. Unlike traditional currencies, no central authority governs the supply or has control over bitcoins. The bitcoin market value thus depends solely on people\u2019s confidence or trust in it, similar to other real-world commodities and assets. Consequently, little is known about the trading behavior on exchange markets and their periodic or mutual dynamics. We thus here report the results of a preliminary exploratory analysis of bitcoin market value from a popular exchange market BitStamp. We collect the data for a period of five days in January 2014 at a rate of about one minute and construct different network representation of the time series. In particular, we consider proximity networks including cycle [1] and correlation [2] networks, transition networks [3] and visibility graphs [4](see Fig. 1). Cycle network has a grid-like structure with uniform degree distribution and high clustering. On the contrary, the transition network reveals very sparse topology with bell-shaped degree distribution and no pronounced degree correlations. Correlation network and visibility graph are scale-free and small-world with assortative mixing by degree, otherwise a characteristic of social networks. Next, we apply a node group discovery approach to constructed networks in order to gain an insight into the their structure\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["373"]}
{"title": "A Framework for Reengineering Software Development Methods\n", "abstract": " Empirical investigations clearly show that in contrast to the theory which implies that the use of methods in software development is beneficial, their use in practice is actually very low. Several reasons have been identified recently as contributing to this rather paradoxical situation. Most importantly: the socio-technical inappropriateness of a prescribed method to the company's actual ways of working, and the rigidity, i.e. inability of a prescribed method to be adapted to a particular problem. In this paper, we present a framework that deals with these issues. Its purpose is to help software development companies to reengineer their software development processes by establishing formalized and flexible methods based on the actual ways of working in that companies.
