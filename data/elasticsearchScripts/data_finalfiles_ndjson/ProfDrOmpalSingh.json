We investigated the oxidative stress and antioxidant status during the transition period in dairy cows. In this study, plasma level of MDA was considered as an indicator of lipid peroxidation and SOD, catalase, GSH and GSHPx as antioxidants. The lipid peroxidation was significantly (p< 0.001) higher in cows during early lactation as compared to the cows in advanced pregnancy. A significant positive correlation (r=+ 0.831, p< 0.01) was determined between MDA and catalase in early lactating cows. In early lactating cows, blood glutathione was significantly lower than in advanced pregnant cows. However, early lactating cows showed non-significant negative correlation for all antioxidant enzymes with lipid peroxidation. In conclusion, dairy cows seemed to have more oxidative stress and low antioxidant defense during early lactation or just after parturition than advanced pregnant cows, and this appears to be the reason for their increased susceptibility to production diseases (eg mastitis, metritis, retention of fetal membranes etc.) and other health problems.", "num_citations": "182\n", "authors": ["472"]}

It is during this phase it is checked whether the software product meets user requirements or not. Any discrepancies that are identified are removed. But testing needs to be monitored to increase its effectiveness. Software Reliability Growth Models (SRGMs) that specify mathematical relationships between the failure phenomenon and time have proved useful. SRGMs that include factors that affect failure process are more realistic and useful. Software fault detection and removal during the testing phase of SDLC depend on how testing resources (test cases, manpower and time) are used and also on previously identified faults.

Although current laboratory methods are generally considered adequate to detect high concentrations of oocysts, they fail to detect cases of cryptosporidiosis in many immunocompromised patients. The present study was done to determine the diagnostic efficacy of modified Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN), antigen detection ELISA, and a nested PCR assay for detection of Cryptosporidium in 58 adult AIDS cases with diarrhea from the ART clinic of Lok Nayak Hospital, New Delhi. Cryptosporidium was detected in 17 (29.4%), 39 (67.3%), and 45 (77.5%) cases by modified ZN staining, antigen ELISA, and nested PCR assay, respectively. Taking nested PCR as the gold standard, specificity of both modified ZN staining and Cryptosporidium antigen detection ELISA was 100% while the sensitivity of the tests was 37.8% and 86.6%, respectively. PCR was more sensitive than the other two diagnostic modalities but required a more hands-on time per sample and was more expensive than microscopy. PCR, however, was very adaptable to batch analysis, reducing the costs considerably.

It has been observed that by varying the sulfurization time from 5 to 40 min, the secondary phases got eliminated and stoichiometric film is obtained. This leads to change in the optical band gap from 1.67 to 1.51 eV. The crystallite size calculated using the broadening in the (112) peak of the X-ray diffraction spectra also changed with the sulfurization time from 15.0 to 21.7 nm. Broadening and shift in the Raman peaks have also been observed. Changes in grain size have been observed in scanning electron microscopic studies. In short, the increased band gap reported in literatures may be due to the presence of impurities (except for particles where quantum confinement is applicable; with size less than~ 7 nm). The above conclusion is based on careful analysis of XRD and Raman data.

Twenty cases of peripheral nerve involvement in hemophilics are presented with an aim to highlight its features and the role of pulsed ultrasound in the management. METHODOLOGY: Between January, 1999 and 2000 June, 134 patients of bleeding disorders were examined. Twenty of them presented with features of nerve palsy. In addition to usual conservative treatment, pulse ultrasound electrotherapy of 10-15 sittings was used in all the cases. RESULTS: Femoral nerve was involved in majority (15), followed by sciatic (4) and peroneal nerve in one case. Femoral nerve involvement was associated with iliacus bleed in 13 patients and inguinal bleed in two cases. All the four cases of sciatic nerve palsy were associated with gluteal hematoma. Only case of peroneal nerve palsy was associated with hematoma at upper leg and calf. Twelve cases improved completely within six months whereas another four recovered around 10 months. Remaining four showed only partial recovery even when followed up to 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Recognition of nerve complications in hemophilics is important to avoid long-term disability. Conservative therapy starting early was associated with favourable results. Pulsed ultrasound therapy at the site of haematoma helped in early regression of hematoma and neural recovery.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["472"]}

Scientists are working since a long time to search for some renewable resources which can replace these conventional sources. As we know, solar energy is the ultimate source of energy; so converting this solar energy into usable form of energy which can be stored for later use is the best alternative. Solar cells are the devices which convert light energy into electrical energy and hence are the best replacement for conventional sources to solve the upcoming energy crisis. Among all the present technologies CZTS and CIGS based thin film solar cells are the most researched [1-5]. The highest reported efficiency of CZTSSe based solar cell is 12.6%[6] and for CIGS is 21.7%[7]. The theoretical conversion efficiency of single junction solar cell is nearly 32%[8]. Besides CIGS, CZTS and its selenide compounds are more popular as an absorber layer for thin film solar cell application [9-11].To ensure high efficiency of a CIGS/CZTS based solar cell device, an ideal ohmic back contact is needed for the enhanced transport of majority charge carriers and low recombination for minority charge carriers [12]. According to researchers, molybdenum has been found to be the most suitable material for back contact among all other materials; like, W, Ta, Cr, V, Nb or Ti due to its inertness, high melting point, high thermal stability, high conductivity and mechanical hardness [13-15]. Thus, Mo has the capability to be used as a surface electron collector layer because of its high electronic conducting capabilities\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["472"]}

In order to excel in the market, firms have to constantly update themselves and so have to come up with patching.

Keeping this frame of consistent processing in mind, we have proposed an optimal scheduling policy where the release time and testing stop time are the key variables. Further, we discuss the advantage of providing patching and its cost effectiveness.

Technical advancements are taking place at a speed faster than ever. This has further enhanced the pressure on software developers. They are trying hard to keep a pace with these rapid developments by coming out with strategies to increase the pace of their work without significantly affecting the software quality and reliability. One such strategy is distributed development of software in which the software is composed of two different types of components viz. newly developed and re-used component. Software developed in Distributed Development Environment (DDE) is characterized by enhanced availability and reliability. At the same time, the ever growing contention in the market and increasing needs of customers obligate the developers to come out with enhanced functionalities in the software from time to time leading to multiple releases of a software\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["472"]}

It is already being grown as a plantation crop for building and industrial raw materials, as well as for reforestation of difficult sites. Extensive cultivation of this promising tree would enrich the natural resources besides being useful for industrial raw material, waste land management, and afforestation. In addition, Acacia exhibits extensive medicinal values. In view of the medicinal importance of Acacia nilotica and the therapeutic utility of flavonoids, an attempt has been made to isolate novel flavonoids from the wood of cultivated A. nilotica. The extraction of crude ethanol extract from the A. nilotica wood was followed by fractionation with chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methanol in increasing order of polarity of the solvent. The mixed ethyl acetate and methanol extract afforded three pure compounds through column chromtomatography and fractional crystallization. Among the isolated phenolic compounds, a new acylated flavonoidic glycoside, tricin-4\u2032-O-\u03b2-(6\u2032\u2032-hydroxycinnamic)-glucoside (1) was isolated from the wood of A. nilotica together with two known compounds, gallic acid and apigenin. Their structures were established by chemical evidence, spectroscopic techniques (FT-IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, HSQC, HMBC, and ESI-MS), and by comparison with already existing spectroscopic data.

{"title": "Performance enhancement strategies of a hybrid solar chimney power plant integrated with photovoltaic panel\n", "abstract": " This paper examines the possibility of integrating a photovoltaic (PV) module in a hybrid solar chimney power plant (HSCPP). Since HSCPP is a greenhouse thermal buoyancy-driven system, the surrounding high temperature environment makes PV module temperature extremely high resulting in lower electrical conversion efficiency. Various design configurations of collector duct and solar chimney are investigated using an experimentally validated numerical model to study the PV panel cooling and turbine power output. The results show that turbine power output is sensitive to diverging the chimney up to maximum static pressure recovery limit while PV module shows marginal increase in electrical efficiency. Converging the collector duct alone shows worst turbine and PV module performance. However, in case of combine designs of converging duct and divergent chimney, considerable improvement of PV panel efficiency (about 7%) was observed. The results show that about 80% of the collector area measured from the chimney axis are the most effective region for cooling the PV module where consistent temperature drop of 10\u201312\u00a0\u00b0C was observed. A design map vs. PV panel efficiency has been shown charting future directions for designing such energy efficient hybrid solar chimney systems.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["472"]}

Therefore the software developers have to come up with multiple releases in order to survive in the market. But, enhancing the product and coming up with multiple releases puts a constant pressure on even the best organized engineering organizations. The reason being, up-grading a software application is a complex process. Up-grades of software introduce the risk that the new release will contain a bug, causing the program to fail. Therefore, to capture the effect of faults generated in the software with multiple release, we have developed a multi release software reliability model in this paper. The model uniquely take into account the faults of the current release and the remaining faults of just previous release. The multi release software reliability growth model treats the faults removal rate as a function of testing resources consumed. In addition, most of the debugging process in real life is not perfect. Due to complexity and incomplete understanding of the software, the testing team may not be able to remove/correct the fault perfectly on observation/detection of a failure and the original fault may remain resulting in the phenomenon known as imperfect debugging, or get replaced by another fault causing error generation.

Speed of research and development in software technology is tremendous, and its relevance has also increased exponentially by mass availability. The other thing that knocks many of us for a loop is that software manufacturers come out with the same software but they call it an update or an upgrade. Most organizations recognize the importance of technology enhancement to improve the quality of their products and services, to be competitive, and to remain attractive both to investors and to a technology-oriented workforce. Software companies come out with software upgrades all the time. However a software company can lose its name and goodwill in the market if the functionalities added to the software leads to an increase in the number of faults of the software. Therefore, to capture the effect of faults generated in the software with multiple releases, we develop multi up-gradation software reliability model with testing effort. Thus, in this paper, we first review the Weibull testing-effort function that can be used to describe the amount of testing-effort spent on software testing. We later describe how to incorporate the Weibull testing-effort function into software multi up-gradation reliability models. Particularly, a Software Reliability Growth Model has been developed using an Exponential Power distribution which identifies the faults left in the previous release and faults introduced in the upcoming release.

{"title": "Considering the effect of learning with two types of imperfect debugging in software reliability growth modeling\n", "abstract": " Software reliability is defined as the probability of failure-free operation for a specified period of time in a specified environment. Software reliability growth models (SRGM) are mathematical models used during late stages of software testing to measure testing progress and reliability. Most of the models for software reliability analysis are based on reliability growth models that describe fault observation/detection/correction as a one-stage process where on the observation of a failure, the fault causing that failure is immediately removed without any time delay. Further, many researchers considered fault observation/detection/correction as a two-stage process. A software failure is observed then the fault causing that failure is detected/corrected with a constant, time dependent or a random delay time lag. Due to the complexity of software system and incomplete understanding of software, the testing team may not be able to remove/correct the fault perfectly on observation/detection of a failure and the original fault may remain resulting in a phenomenon known as imperfect debugging, or get replaced by another fault causing error generation. In this paper, we have proposed an SRGM which considers the learning and expertise gained by testing team as testing progresses in the presence of two types of imperfect debugging.

In this paper we develop a SRGM, which can account for reliability growth during both testing and operational phases by suitably changing the parameters in the model for testing phase. It is also interesting to observe that in order to change from testing phase to operational phase, a model from Marketing can be used to account for usage in the operational phase as for the commercially used software, number of instructions executed depends on the number of users. The usage function so defined can also take care of increasing, linearly decreasing trends as a function of time, which implies slow start but gain in growth rate.

{"title": "Software release time based on multi attribute utility theory\n", "abstract": " The quality of the software system usually depends on how much time testing takes and what testing methodologies are used. More we spend time on testing; more faults can be removed, which leads to more reliable software. However, the testing cost of the software tends to increase in the process. On the other hand, if testing time is too short, the testing cost of the software may be reduced, but the customers may take higher risk of buying unreliable software. Therefore, it is important to determine when to stop testing, and release the software. In this paper, we propose a new method to estimate the optimal software release time by using Multi Attribute Utility Theory. More precisely, three significant attributes, namely Reliability, Cost and Detection rate indicator are used to determine the optimal release time. The proposed new decision model based on multi-attribute utility analysis is tested on the real world data sets.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["472"]}

Reliability estimation has a direct role in project management. Reliability models are used by the project managers to decide when to stop testing Jalote [15]. During the last three decades many software reliability growth models (SRGM) have been developed incorporating various development and testing environments. From our studies, many existing SRGM can be unified under a more general formulation. In fact, model unification is an insightful investigation for the study of general models without making many assumptions. Software testing is an important phase of software development life cycle (SDLC). Fault detection-correction are considered as separate processes in software reliability growth models. In the literature various software reliability models have been proposed incorporating change-point concept. To the best of our knowledge the change-point models have not been developed under the consideration of fault detection-correction process. In this paper we propose a general framework for deriving several software reliability growth models for fault detection-correction process incorporating change-point concept based on non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP).

During the operational phase, users also participate in the fault detection process and notify the defects to the software manufacturer. In this study, a reliability growth model is proposed using a unified approach based on the expenditure of efforts during the testing process. Besides, debugging process is considered imperfect as new faults may enter the software during each fault removal. The developed model further considers that the developer's rate of defect identification changes with a software release. Thus, the software time-to-market act as a change-point for the failure observation phenomenon. It is asserted that the accuracy of the software reliability estimation improves by implementing the concept of change-point. The main aim of the paper is to evaluate the optimal release time and testing termination time based on two attributes, particularly, reliability, and cost. A multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) is applied to nd a trade-of between the two conflicting attributes. Finally, a numerical example is presented by using the historical fault count data.

{"title": "Market segmentation-based modeling: An approach to understand multiple modes in diffusion curves\n", "abstract": " The diffusion of innovation is an essential topic of research in the field of marketing management. Since the 1960s, plenty of innovation diffusion models have been introduced to study the diffusion process of a product. A plethora of diffusion models based on the highly pertinent work of Bass (1969) are available in literature. Bass (1969) has contributed greatly to the understanding of a variety of diffusion models. The simple structure of the Bass model has led to its higher number of applications over the last few decades. The Bass model perceives that an innovation spreads throughout the market by two main channels: mass media (external influence) and word of mouth (internal influence). His model assumes the nature of consumers to be homogenous with respect to their response behavior (Agliari et al. 2009).

{"title": "Generalised framework for optimal pre and post release software testing in presence of warranty\n", "abstract": " Significant advances in the field of software testing have been made by providing extended warranties, operational support and desired software reliability to the customers. However, the trade-off between minimising testing cost and maximising reliability to ensure well-timed market penetration has been a key concern for developers. Separate release and testing stop time strategy in order to optimise overall testing and market opportunity cost is proposed. We propose a generalised framework for developers to achieve multiple objectives of minimum testing and market opportunity cost; optimal warranty length; and optimal testing and release time. Software reliability growth models (SRGMs) are used to model an average number of bugs detected by testers (users) during the pre (post) release of software. Significant implications and quite intriguing facts related to separate release and testing stop time; early release\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["472"]}
{"title": "When to start remanufacturing using adopter categorization\n", "abstract": " Remanufacturing of goods involves taking the product back from the customer so as to use it as a feedstock for manufacturing new products. It provides double benefits of cost and environmental saving to the manufacturer and society, respectively. One of the major challenges faced by original equipment manufacturer (OEM) here is forecasting quantity returned by the customers and when to start remanufacturing. In this paper, we formulate a strategy for OEMs to optimize time to start remanufacturing using the adopter categorization approach as proposed by Roger. We propose an optimization model based on famous Bass diffusion model to depict not only the quantity returned in the remanufacturing process but also the amount of cost saving a manufacturer does with efficient remanufacturing. With data on 11 consumer durable products, we compare product returned under various adopter categorization\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["472"]}

{"title": "Assessment of Distribution Based SRGM with the Effect of Change-Point and Imperfect Debugging Incorporating Irregular Fluctuations\n", "abstract": " Computer software has progressively turned out to be an essential component in modern technologies. Testability is the probability whether tests will detect a fault, given that a fault in the program exists. How efficiently the faults will be uncovered depends upon the testability of the software. Various researchers have proposed qualitative and quantitative techniques to improve and measure the testability of software. Furthermore, it is well known fact that the progress of software testing is influenced by various uncertainty factors like effort expenditure, skill of test personal, testing tool, defect density and irregular state of software fault-report phenomena on the bug tracking system. Hence, there is an irregular fluctuation in fault detection/removal rate during testing phase. In this paper, distribution based software reliability growth models have been developed by applying It\u00f4 type Stochastic Differential Equations in order to incorporate (i) the irregular fluctuation in the fault detection process due to various uncertainty factor during testing phase;(ii) two types of imperfect debugging and (iii) change-point concept.

Farmers in north western India are not willing to involve their land for mulberry plantation due to limited crops in this region as the farmers mostly belong to below poverty line and do not have large land holdings. Whatever land they have they use it for growing seasonal cash crops. There are only two sericulture crops, one in spring and one in autumn. Each crop was of 25 days duration and hence just for 50 days farmers were not willing to plant mulberry in their one acre or two acre land holding. With this back drop it was known that lakhs of hectares of land were available as waste land as they are salt affected and were not used for agriculture. If this available land could be made to be utilized for sericulture purposes it may help the farmers as well as the environment. In Uttar Pradesh 1.25 million hectares of area are salt affected.
