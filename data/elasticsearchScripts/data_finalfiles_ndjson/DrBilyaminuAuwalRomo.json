{"title": "Towards an Automation of the Traceability of Bugs from Development Logs \u2013 A Study based on Open Source Software\n", "abstract": " Context: Information and tracking of defects can be severely incomplete in almost every Open Source project, resulting in a reduced traceability of defects into the development logs (ie, version control commit logs). In particular, defect data often appears not in sync when considering what developers logged as their actions. Synchronizing or completing the missing data of the bug repositories, with the logs detailing the actions of developers, would benefit various branches of empirical software engineering research: prediction of software faults, software reliability, traceability, software quality, effort and cost estimation, bug prediction and bug fixing.Objective: To design a framework that automates the process of synchronizing and filling the gaps of the development logs and bug issue data for open source software projects.Method: We instantiate the framework with a sample of OSS projects from GitHub, and by\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1008"]}
