{"title": "Securing Relational Database Storage with Attribute Association Aware Shuffling\n", "abstract": " With the fast-increasing prevalence of mobile devices, mobile cloud computing has emerged as an important computing paradigm. Storing databases in the cloud server has been one significant application of mobile cloud computing. However, there is one severe security problem: the protection of most database system relies on the security schemes of the operating system or the hard drive of the server. If an attacker successfully hacks into a cloud server and accesses the database files, then the attacker is able to recover the database and get information about every attribute of a tuple in the database. Encrypting the database does not fully address the problem as seen in the continued incidents of large-scale database breaches. In this paper, we propose a novel and practical database shuffling approach that breaks the original relations between the value of the attributes while keeping the ostensible integrity.

{"title": "Cybersecurity Issues in the Context of Cryptographic Shuffling Algorithms and Concept Drift: Challenges and Solutions\n", "abstract": " In this dissertation, we investigate and address two kinds of data integrity threats. We first study the limitations of secure cryptographic shuffling algorithms regarding preservation of data dependencies. We then study the limitations of machine learning models regarding concept drift detection. We propose solutions to address these threats.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1108"]}
{"title": "Modeling Concept Drift in the Context of Discrete Bayesian Networks\n", "abstract": " Concept drift is a significant challenge that greatly influences the accuracy and reliability of machine learning models. There is, therefore, a need to detect concept drift in order to ensure the validity of learned models. In this research, we study the issue of concept drift in the context of discrete Bayesian networks. We propose a probabilistic graphical model framework to explicitly detect the presence of concept drift using latent variables. We employ latent variables to model real concept drift and uncertainty drift over time. For modeling real concept drift, we propose to monitor the mean of the distribution of the latent variable over time. For modeling uncertainty drift, we suggest to monitor the change in beliefs of the latent variable over time, ie, we monitor the maximum value that the probability density function of the distribution takes over time. We implement our proposed framework and present our empirical results using two of the most commonly used Bayesian networks in Bayesian experiments, namely the Burglary-Earthquake Network and the Chest Clinic network.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1108"]}
