{"title": "On legal contracts, imperative and declarative smart contracts, and blockchain systems\n", "abstract": " This paper provides an analysis of how concepts pertinent to legal contracts can influence certain aspects of their digital implementation through smart contracts, as inspired by recent developments in distributed ledger technology.  We discuss how properties of imperative and declarative languages including the underlying architectures to support contract management and lifecycle apply to various aspects of legal contracts. We then address these properties in the context of several blockchain architectures. While imperative languages are commonly used to implement smart contracts, we find that declarative languages provide more natural ways to deal with certain aspects of legal contracts and their automated management.", "num_citations": "145\n", "authors": ["654"]}
{"title": "Evaluating suitability of applying blockchain\n", "abstract": " Blockchain is an emerging technology for decentralized and transactional data sharing across a large network of untrusted participants. It enables new forms of distributed software architectures, where agreement on shared states can be established without trusting a central integration point. As a database and computational platform, blockchain has both advantages and disadvantages compared with conventional techniques. Blockchain may be an appropriate choice for some use cases while conventional technologies will be more appropriate for other use cases. A major difficulty for practitioners to decide whether or not to use blockchain is that limited product data or reliable technology evaluation available to assess the suitability of blockchains. In this paper, we propose an evaluation framework that comprises a list of criteria and a typical process for practitioners to assess the suitability of applying blockchain\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "130\n", "authors": ["654"]}

However, dealing with the increasing sparseness of user-item matrix still remains a challenge. To tackle such issue, hybrid CF such as combining with content based filtering and leveraging side information of users and items has been extensively studied to enhance performance. However, most of these approaches depend on hand-crafted feature engineering, which is usually noise-prone and biased by different feature extraction and selection schemes. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid model by generalizing contractive auto-encoder paradigm into matrix factorization framework with good scalability and computational efficiency, which jointly models content information as representations of effectiveness and compactness, and leverage implicit user feedback to make accurate recommendations\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "127\n", "authors": ["654"]}
{"title": "Analysis of Data Management in Blockchain-Based Systems: From Architecture to Governance\n", "abstract": " In a blockchain-based system, data and the consensus-based process of recording and updating them over distributed nodes are central to enabling the trustless multi-party transactions. Thus, properly understanding what and how the data are stored and manipulated ultimately determines the degree of utility, performance, and cost of a blockchain-based application. While blockchains enhance the quality of the data by providing a transparent, immutable, and consistent data store, the technology also brings new challenges from a data management perspective. In this paper, we analyse blockchains from the viewpoint of a developer to highlight important concepts and considerations when incorporating a blockchain into a larger software system as a data store.

Nevertheless, the dot product adopted in matrix factorization based recommender models does not satisfy the inequality property, which may limit their expressiveness and lead to sub-optimal solutions. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel recommender technique dubbed as {\\em Metric Factorization}. We assume that users and items can be placed in a low dimensional space and their explicit closeness can be measured using Euclidean distance which satisfies the inequality property. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we further designed two variants of metric factorization with one for rating estimation and the other for personalized item ranking. Extensive experiments on a number of real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art by a large margin on both rating prediction and item ranking tasks.", "num_citations": "28\n", "authors": ["654"]}

By using a blockchain as uniform infrastructure, different registries can also more easily interact with each other. In this paper, we present a browser-based tool for the model-driven generation and deployment of registries as smart contracts on blockchain. The tool also generates web-based RESTful APIs and user interfaces to interact with the generated registries.

We evaluated the two models using CPN-based simulation and analyzed their task migration accessibility, integrity during the migration process, reliability, and the stability of the pervasive cloud system after task migration. The energy consumption and costs of the two models were also investigated.

{"title": "A Resource-oriented Architecture for Business Process Systems\n", "abstract": " Background: The REpresentational State Transfer (REST) design principles behind the Web treat all concepts in the world as link-connected resources, and support ROA (Resource-Oriented Architecture) for the Web applications. REST and ROA are responsible for the adaptability achieved in the Web. Some design approaches of Web-based business process systems recently evolved towards RESTful to inherit adaptability. However, none of the approaches can improve the adaptability of the produced systems because the new approaches just build a simple RESTful facade to traditional operation-centric workflow technologies without aligning the business process concepts with ROA concepts and make the produced systems brittle.Aims: Propose a systematic approach for design and execution of Web-based business processes to improve adaptability of the produced systems.Methods: This research followed an empirical research methodology, which evaluates research solutions with real-world cases. On one hand, the research solution was derived by 1) tailoring the REST principles towards business process systems; 2) proposing REST annotations on existing business process modelling; 3) mapping the concepts of business process to the URI and HTTP specifications; and 4) designing a format for process context information based on the workflow patterns framework. On the other hand, the research solution was evaluated through three real-world case studies.
