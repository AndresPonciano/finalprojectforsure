The increasing presence of automatic controlling operation, the massive use of networks to transfer data and information, and the human operations introduce a new security concern in safety-critical systems. Security issues (threats) do not only have direct impact on systems availability, integrity and confidentiality, but they also can influence the safety aspects of the safety critical systems.

In the scope of Independent Code Verification (IVE), two different static analysis tools have been used during Code Verification activities of the LISA Pathfinder onboard software in order to assess their contribution to the efficiency of the process and quality of the results. Polyspace (The MathWorks) and FlexeLint (Gimpel) tools have been used as examples of high-budget and low-budget tools respectively. Several aspects have been addressed: effort has been categorised for closer analysis (eg setup and configuration time, execution time, analysis of the results, etc), reported issues have been categorised according to their type and the coverage of traditional IVE tasks by the static code analysis tools has been evaluated. Final observations have been performed by analysing the previously referred subjects, namely regarding cost effectiveness, quality of results, complementarities between the results of different static code analysis tools and relation between automated code analysis and manual code inspection.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1420"]}

Since the failure of a Safety Critical System may lead to loss of human lives or large economical effects, the standards that guide the development of these systems have always focused in these two aspects, independently of the domain applicable. By looking into Reliability and Safety independently and focused, one can design a system highly reliable and safe without Security concerns. However, Security plays a major role in the achievement of both Reliability and Safety. A system cannot be reliable and safe if it is not secure.

The aim of this paper is to present a framework that can overcome this lack. Reasoning from the available product assurance standards for certifying mission critical systems, the proposed approach is based on the customized quality model that describes the quality attributes.
