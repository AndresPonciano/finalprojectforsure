Although the CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response to latently infected cells is well characterized, very little is known about T cell controls over lytic infection; this imbalance in our understanding belies the importance of virus-replicative lesions in several aspects of EBV disease pathogenesis. The present work shows that the primary CD8+ CTL response to EBV in infectious mononucleosis patients contains multiple lytic antigen-specific reactivities at levels at least as high as those seen against latent antigens; similar reactivities are also detectable in CTL memory.

Despite the contrasting chlorophyll and primary productivity pattern, sediment trap data shows that annual fluxes of organic carbon reach comparable rates in both the basins.

We propose eddy pumping as a possible mechanism of vertical transfer of nutrients across the halocline to the oligotrophic euphotic zone during summer monsoon when upper ocean is highly stratified. This would induce rapid biological uptake and in turn significantly increase biological production. In the northern Bay, riverine input acts as an additional source of nutrients and augments the subsurface nutrient injection to the euphotic zone by eddy pumping.

The search is motivated by models based on gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking, which predict the electroweak production of a pair of Higgsinos, each of which can decay via a cascade process to a Higgs boson and an undetected lightest supersymmetric particle. The observed event yields in the signal regions are consistent with the standard model background expectation obtained from control regions in data.

Our architecture is designed to efficiently accommodate incremental domain additions achieving two orders of magnitude speed up compared to full model retraining.

We evaluate the performance of this zero-shot approach on a subset of a virtual assistant\u2019s third-party domains and show the effectiveness of the technique on new domains not observed during training. We compare to generative baselines and show that our approach requires less storage and performs better on new domains.", "num_citations": "28\n", "authors": ["450"]}

{"title": "A possible mechanism of zika virus associated microcephaly: imperative role of retinoic acid response element (RARE) consensus sequence repeats in the viral genome\n", "abstract": " Owing to the reports of microcephaly as a consistent outcome in the foetuses of pregnant women infected with ZIKV in Brazil, Zika virus (ZIKV) - microcephaly etiomechanistic relationship has recently been implicated. Researchers, however, are still struggling to establish an embryological basis for this interesting causal handcuff. The present study reveals robust evidence in favour of a plausible ZIKV-microcephaly cause-effect liaison. The rationale is based on: (1) sequence homology between ZIKV genome and the response element of an early neural tube developmental marker \u2018retinoic acid\u2019 in human DNA and (2) comprehensive similarities between the details of brain defects in ZIKV-microcephaly and retinoic acid embryopathy. Retinoic acid is considered as the earliest factor for regulating anteroposterior axis of neural tube and positioning of structures in developing brain through retinoic acid response elements (RARE) consensus sequence (5\u2032\u2013AGGTCA\u20133\u2032) in promoter regions of retinoic acid-dependent genes. We screened genomic sequences of already reported virulent ZIKV strains (including those linked to microcephaly) and other viruses available in National Institute of Health genetic sequence database (GenBank) for the RARE consensus repeats and obtained results strongly bolstering our hypothesis that ZIKV strains associated with microcephaly may act through precipitation of dysregulation in retinoic acid-dependent genes by introducing extra stretches of RARE consensus sequence repeats in the genome of developing brain cells. Additional support to our hypothesis comes from our findings that screening of other viruses\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "27\n", "authors": ["450"]}
{"title": "Environmental attributes to respiratory diseases of small ruminants\n", "abstract": " Respiratory diseases are the major disease crisis in small ruminants. A number of pathogenic microorganisms have been implicated in the development of respiratory disease but the importance of environmental factors in the initiation and progress of disease can never be overemphasized. They irritate the respiratory tree producing stress in the microenvironment causing a decline in the immune status of the small ruminants and thereby assisting bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections to break down the tissue defense barriers. Environmental pollutants cause acute or chronic reactions as they deposit on  the alveolar surface which are characterized by inflammation or fibrosis and the formation of transitory or persistent tissue manifestation. Some of the effects of exposures may be immediate, whereas others may not be evident for many decades. Although the disease development can be portrayed as three sets of two-way communications (pathogen-environment, host-environment, and host-pathogen), the interactions are highly variable. Moreover, the environmental scenario is never static; new compounds are introduced daily making a precise evaluation of the disease burden almost impossible.

It causes severe pain and occurs repeatedly, causing discomfort in daily routine activities. The description of etiology is varied and none of the explanations given so far are satisfactory. Clinically this condition presents itself in three forms: major, minor and herpetiform ulcers. Causes for the ulcers could be related to host and/or environment. Host factors include genetic, nutritional deficiency, immune dysregulation and stress which can again be multifactorial. Environmental factors include trauma (both physical and chemical) and infections. There are several clinical syndromes which are associated with RAS like Behcet\u2019s syndrome. There are several causes acting together in initiating formation of ulcer unlike a single etiological factor as was thought previously. This means combination of host and environmental factors are essential not only for triggering the ulcer but also for an increase in size. The severity of etiological factors to which an individual is exposed would decide the type of ulcer. Identification of the trigger for a particular individual seems to be important in management of the disease. Hence understanding etiopathogenesis for recurrent aphthous stomatitis would be helpful in formulation of individualized treatment modalities.

{"title": "Glycosylation of the core of the HIV-1 envelope subunit protein gp120 is not required for native trimer formation or viral infectivity\n", "abstract": " The gp120 subunit of the HIV-1 envelope (Env) protein is heavily glycosylated at \u02dc25 glycosylation sites, of which \u02dc7\u20138 are located in the V1/V2 and V3 variable loops and the others in the remaining core gp120 region. Glycans partially shield Env from recognition by the host immune system and also are believed to be indispensable for proper folding of gp120 and for viral infectivity. Previous attempts to alter glycosylation sites in Env typically involved mutating the glycosylated asparagine residues to structurally similar glutamines or alanines. Here, we confirmed that such mutations at multiple glycosylation sites greatly diminish viral infectivity and result in significantly reduced binding to both neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, using an alternative approach, we combined evolutionary information with structure-guided design and yeast surface display to produce properly cleaved HIV-1 Env\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["450"]}

{"title": "A survey of compressive sensing based greedy pursuit reconstruction algorithms\n", "abstract": " Conventional approaches to sampling images use Shannon theorem, which requires signals to be sampled at a rate twice the maximum frequency. This criterion leads to larger storage and bandwidth requirements. Compressive Sensing (CS) is a novel sampling technique that removes the bottleneck imposed by Shannon\u2019s theorem. This theory utilizes sparsity present in the images to recover it from fewer observations than the traditional methods. It joins the sampling and compression steps and enables to reconstruct with the only fewer number of observations. This property of compressive Sensing provides evident advantages over Nyquist-Shannon theorem. The image reconstruction algorithms with CS increase the efficiency of the overall algorithm in reconstructing the sparse signal. There are various algorithms available for recovery. These algorithms include convex minimization class, greedy pursuit algorithms. Numerous algorithms come under these classes of recovery techniques. This paper discusses the origin, purpose, scope and implementation of CS in image reconstruction.

In this study, we evaluated the potential of curcumin to reverse promoter methylation of the p15 gene in Raji cells and its ability to induce apoptosis and genomic instability. Anti-neoplastic action of curcumin showed an augmentation in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. Subsequently, curcumin-exposed Raji cells showed structural abnormalities in chromosomes. These observations suggest that curcumin also causes ROS-mediated apoptosis and genomic instability. The treatment of Raji cell line with 10 \u03bcM curcumin caused hypomethylation of the p15 promoter after six days. Hypomethylation of p15 was further found to be favoured by downregulation of DNA methyltransferase 1 after 10 \u03bcM curcumin treatment for six days. Methylation-specific PCR suggested demethylation of the p15 promoter. Demethylation was further validated by DNA sequencing. Reverse-transcription PCR demonstrated that treatment with curcumin (10 \u03bcM) for six days led to the up-regulation of p15 and down-regulation of DNA methyltransferase 1. Furthermore, curcumin-mediated reversal of p15 promoter methylation might be potentiated by down-regulation of DNA methyltransferase 1 expression, which was supported by cell cycle analysis. Furthermore, curcumin acts as a double-pronged agent, as it caused apoptosis and promoter hypomethylation in Raji cells.", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["450"]}

One of the major problems coming in the medical field is that doctors are not able to detect that infected part which is not visible by naked eyes and therefore they only operate the visible infected part of the skin and this may cause a major problem like cancer or any dangerous disease in the future. Skin cancer classification system is developed and the relationship of the skin cancer image across different type of neural network is established. The collected medical images are feed into the system, and using different image processing schemes image properties are enhanced.

{"title": "Dual phase lag bio-heat transfer during cryosurgery of lung cancer: comparison of three heat transfer models\n", "abstract": " The Pennes bio-heat model is based on Fourier's law of heat conduction, which assumed that a thermal signal propagate with infinite speed. This gives contradiction in physical situation. Also, the hyperbolic bio-heat model considers the micro scale response in time, but it does not explain the micro scale response in space. Therefore, to consider the thermal behaviour which is not captured by the Fourier's law and to take into account the microstructural effect in space, a dual phase lag (DPL) bio-heat conduction model would be advantageous. In this paper, a two dimensional DPL model is proposed to study the phase change heat transfer process during cryosurgery of lung cancer. The governing equations are solved numerically by enthalpy based finite difference method. The non-ideal behaviour of tissue and heat source terms, metabolism and blood perfusion are also considered.

Tumour cells (3 x 10(6) cells/mouse) incubated with cisplatin grow slowly in syngeneic mice as indicated by the late appearance of tumour. However, mice failed to develop tumour when inoculated with tumour cells incubated with cisplatin + alpha-tocopherol. When the animals were challenged with tumour cells (3 x 10(6) cells/mouse) on the 15th day after the initial inoculation, 30-50% survived more than 60 days, with 10% tumour-free survivors being observed in some groups. Antitumour activity was higher in mice receiving lymphoma cells (3 x 10(6) cells/mouse) preincubated with cisplatin + alpha-tocopherol compared to cisplatin alone. Tumour-bearing mice receiving cisplatin in combination with different concentrations of alpha-tocopherol exhibited significantly higher (P<0.001) intratumour platinum content (123-306%) but without any change in the kidney platinum content as compared to those receiving cisplatin (5 or 10 \u00b5g/ml) alone. Enhancement of cisplatin-induced tumour growth inhibition is probably due to the modulation of tumour cell membrane permeability by alpha-tocopherol. alpha-Tocopherol might increase the influx of cisplatin into tumour cells, causing the DNA repair machinery to be less efficient due to increased efficiency of adduct formation in the DNA molecule.

The cultivars, evaluated for changes in appearance, leaf chlorophyll pigments and ionic relations, exhibited salt stress symptoms as yellowing, scorching and chlorosis of the leaves. Majority of the affected leaves subsequently abscised from the plants. Salinity significantly increased membrane injury and caused reduction in relative water content in all the cultivars. Accumulation of total soluble sugars in salt treated plants showed genotypic differences with NB-5 plants recording their maximum accumulation. Leaf chlorophyll (a, b and total) values showed a consistent decrease with increase in salinity except for NB-5 plants which exhibited slightly higher chlorophyll contents at moderate salinity. All the cultivars except NB-5 exhibited significantly higher leaf Na+ concentrations with increasing salinity while the plants of cultivar NB- 5 maintained a favourable ionic balance in terms of low Na+/K+ ratio resulting in good plant performance under salinity.

Myocardial infarction, especially in the young can count as one such event. The development of post traumatic stress after a coronary event not only adversely effects psychiatric health, but leads to increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. There is increasing evidence that like major depression, post traumatic stress disorder is also a strong coronary risk factor.

Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is the commonest cause of childhood acquired epilepsy in developing countries. The use of cysticidal therapy in NCC, except \u201csingle lesion NCC,\u201d is still debated in view of its doubtful usefulness and potential adverse effects. Methods. Children presenting with first episode of seizure or acute focal neurological deficit without fever were screened for NCC and received appropriate therapy (followup done for 1 year to look for the response and side effects). Results. The prevalence of NCC was 4.5%. Most common presenting feature was generalized seizure and commonest imaging finding was single small enhancing lesion in the parietal lobe. Abnormal EEG and CSF abnormalities were found in almost half of the children. The response to therapy was very good with infrequent recurrence of seizure and adverse effects of therapy were encountered rarely. No risk factors for persistent seizure could be identified. Conclusion. Present study shows that the response to cysticidal therapy is very good in NCC as seizure recurrence was observed in only 5%, 4.2%, and 4.2% of cases at 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year followup. Adverse effects of therapy were observed in 20% of cases during therapy but they were mild and self-limiting.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["450"]}
{"title": "Solid dispersion-strategy to enhance solubility and dissolution of poorly water soluble drugs\n", "abstract": " Improving oral bioavailability of drugs those given as solid dosage forms remains a challenge for the formulation scientists due to solubility problems. Over the years a variety of solubilization techniques have been studied and widely used, as maximum drugs are poorly water soluble in pharmaceutical field. The enhancement of dissolution rate and oral bioavailability is one of the greatest challenges in the development of poorly water soluble drugs. Solid dispersions have attracted many researchers as an efficient means of improving the dissolution rate and hence the bioavailability of a range of poorly water-soluble drugs. The term solid dispersion refers to a group of solid products consisting of at least two different components, generally a hydrophilic inert carrier or matrix and a hydrophobic drug. Solid dispersion can form either a eutectic mixture or solid solution or glass solution or amorphous precipitation in a crystalline carrier or compound or complex formation. The focus of this review article is on the advantages, limitations, various methods of preparation and characterization of the solid dispersion.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["450"]}

It is assumed that the plate is clamped on all the four edges and that the thickness varies parabolically in one direction i.e. along length of the plate. Rayleigh-Ritz technique has been used to determine the frequency equation. A two terms deflection function has been used as a solution. For visco-elastic, the basic elastic and viscous elements are combined. We have taken Kelvin model for visco-elasticity that is the combination of the elastic and viscous elements in parallel. Here the elastic element means the spring and the viscous element means the dashpot. The assumption of small deflection and linear visco-elastic properties of \u201cKelvin\u201d type are taken. We have calculated time period and deflection at various points for different values of skew angles, aspect ratio and taper constant, for the first two modes of vibration.

The main concern of this study is to analyze the results and compare them under standard test conditions. PV systems are generally integrated with specific control algorithms in order to extract the maximum possible power. Hence it is highly imperative that the Maximum Power Point (MPP) is achieved effectively and thus we need to design a model from which the MPPT algorithm can be realized in an efficient way. Also other parameters should be taken into account for finding the best model for the use in simulation. It is very important to choose the appropriate model based on the application. The models used for study in this paper include the single diode model, two diode model and Simscape modelling. MATLAB/Simulink presents a powerful tool to study such systems. The work tests the accuracy of the models under different temperature and irradiance conditions. The two diode model is known to have better accuracy at low irradiance levels which allows for a more accurate prediction of PV system performance. Simscape, part of Simulink environment, has a solar cell block that makes building a PV model straightforward and much easier programming with full demonstration to all system details. On the basis of the study, the best model that can be used for simulation purposes can be selected. It is envisaged that the work can be very useful for professionals who require simple and accurate PV simulators for their design.

{"title": "Effect of zeatin on the infection process and expression of MAPK-4 during pathogenesis of Alternaria brassicae in non-host and host Brassica plants\n", "abstract": " Recent studies have revealed an important role of hormones in plant immunity. Cytokinins are phytohormones that are involved in various regulatory processes including plant defense. Zeatin a cytokinin antagonizes the effect of Alternaria brassicae pathotoxin in cell culture of Brassica juncea. Phytohormones are also the inducers of MAP Kinase signaling pathways which are the important signaling modules in eukaryotic cells. In this paper, an attempt was made to study the exogenous application of zeatin on the disease score, infection behavior of A. brassicae, expression pattern of MAPK-4 in the non host Sinapsis alba, host B. juncea susceptible cv Varuna, B. juncea moderately tolerant cv Divya and transgenic Brassica to confer its role in plant immunity. We observed that high concentration of zeatin led to increased defense responses by delaying the infection process as well as significantly reducing the disease score. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR reveals that zeatin also increases the expression of MAPK-4 at early hours of infection. Our result supports that zeatin up regulates plant immunity via an elevation of MAPK-4 and clearly reflects that it antagonizes the effect of A. brassicae. The crosstalk between zeatin and MAPK signaling pathway may help plants fine-tune defense responses against A. brassicae in the disease Alternaria blight.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["450"]}

An experiment of 126 days was conducted on 21 crossbred Landrace pigs (average weight 11.72\u00b10.57 kg, average age 7.59\u00b10.14 weeks). Animals were randomly assigned to three dietary treatment groups T 0, T 1 and T 2 each comprising 7 animals. A basal diet (T 0) was formulated as per NRC (1998). Basal diet (T 1) reduced crude protein by 10% with supplemental lysine identical in T 0; while without supplemental lysine in T 2 (that is, reduced protein by 10% and lysine by 15%). All the diets were iso-caloric and offered in phases according to change in body weight (10 to 20, 20 to 50, 50 to 80 and> 80 kg). Growth performance, carcass parameters, meat composition and meat quality were evaluated at the end of the trial on four animals per group. The results show no significant difference on growth parameters and carcass and meat quality traits among the groups. Thus, it was concluded that the crude protein and lysine concentration can be reduced safely by 10 and 15%, respectively to that of NRC (1998) in diet of crossbred Landrace pigs without any compromise on performance during growing and fattening stage of production.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["450"]}

The authors offer insights into the way a typical mathematician works observing patterns, conducting experiments by means of looking at or creating examples, trying to understand the underlying principles, and coming up with guesses or conjectures and then proving them rigorously based on his or her explorations. With more than 100 pictures, the book creates interest in real analysis by encouraging students to think geometrically. Each difficult proof is prefaced by a strategy and explanation of how the strategy is translated into rigorous and precise proofs. The authors then explain the mystery and role of inequalities in analysis to train students to arrive at estimates that will be useful for proofs. They highlight the role of the least upper bound property of real numbers, which underlies all crucial results in real analysis. In addition, the book demonstrates analysis as a qualitative as well as quantitative study of functions, exposing students to arguments that fall under hard analysis. Although there are many books available on this subject, students often find it difficult to learn the essence of analysis on their own or after going through a course on real analysis.

Addition of divalent cations (Mg2+, Ca2+) to sodium-based petroleum sulfonate-lignosulfonate solutions exerted a strong influence on the coalescence behavior of oil droplets. The interfaces were found to shift from mobile to rigid with increasing ionic strength.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["450"]}

This scenario is observed for many mainstream IPDAs in industry that allow third parties to develop thousands of new domains to augment built-in ones to rapidly increase domain coverage and overall IPDA capabilities. We propose a scalable neural model architecture with a shared encoder, a novel attention mechanism that incorporates personalization information and domain-specific classifiers that solves the problem efficiently. Our architecture is designed to efficiently accommodate new domains that appear in-between full model retraining cycles with a rapid bootstrapping mechanism two orders of magnitude faster than retraining.

{"title": "Study of CBR behaviour of soil reinforced with HDPE strips\n", "abstract": " The disposal of waste plastic has become a major problem now-a-days in view of its use in almost every sphere of life. Moreover, due to limitations of its recycling it is the need of the day to think about the constructive use of this waste at mega scale in order to save the environment from further deterioration. One of the best alternative ways appears is to use it as a geotechnical material for altering soil properties as per requirement. The study is an experimental investigation on the use of HDPE (High Density Polyethylene) mixed with a CL-ML soil. The HDPE sheets were cut into 5mm wide strips and then into three aspect ratios as 1, 2 and 3. Such strips were then randomly mixed in the soil in different proportions (0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5% and 2%) by dry weight of soil. The paper reports results obtained on dry density and CBR behaviour of the soil. A decrease in the dry density of soil with increasing aspect ratio as well as percentage of HDPE content was obtained. On the other hand, CBR value is found to increase with increase in aspect ratio, the maximum CBR value obtained at 1.5% HDPE content. Increasing HDPE to 2%, resulted in reduction of CBR. In view of HDPE, being relatively less expensive as compared to other reinforcing materials; the results find application in designing base material for highway construction and reducing compressibility of soil. Also, it will certainly lead to safe disposal of the waste in eco-friendly manner.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["450"]}

One of the ultimate aims of ex situ conservation is reintroduction of endangered animals into their natural habitats while maintaining 90\u00a0% of the founder genetic diversity. Advances in molecular genetics and microsatellite genotyping techniques make it possible to accurately estimate genetic diversity of captive animals of unknown ancestry. Here we assess genetic diversity of the red panda population in Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park, Darjeeling, which plays a pivotal role in ex situ conservation of red panda in India. We generated microsatellite genotypes of fifteen red pandas with a set of fourteen loci. This population is genetically diverse with 68\u00a0% observed heterozygosity (HO) and mean inbreeding (FIS) coefficient of 0.05. However population viability analysis reveals that this population has a very low survival probability (<2\u00a0%) and will rapidly loose its genetic diversity to 37\u00a0% mainly due to small population size and skewed male-biased sex ratio. Regular supplementation with a pair of adult individuals every five years will increase survival probability and genetic diversity to 99 and 61\u00a0% respectively and will also support future harvesting of individuals for reintroduction into the wild and exchange with other zoos.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["450"]}

From the analysis, it was found that one single probability distribution has not been found appropriate to represent all the datasets though Weibull and Gamma distributions were found promising for most of the datasets. The best-fit distribution has been employed for obtaining the assured quantum of rainfall pertaining to Standard Meteorological Weeks (SMWs) (24-42) at various probability levels. Minimum assured rainfall at 40-50% probability level was found to be in close agreement with the long-term average weekly rainfall data.

Forty-seven children were diagnosed with HIV infection during the study period. The number of HIV infected children increased from 5 during 1981-85, to 14 during 1986-90, and to 21 during the 1991-95 period. The majority (91.5%) of infections resulted from perinatal transmission. Six (12.8%) cases remained asymptomatic and 41 (87.2%) were symptomatic with 19 (46.3%) presenting in infancy, while 22 (53.5%) presented post-infancy. The median age at diagnosis (class P-2) was 13 months. Generalized lymphadenopathy (47.5%), hepatosplenomegaly (40.0%), failure to thrive (27.5%), persistent recurrent diarrhoea (15.0%), oral candidiasis (37.5%), Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (37.5%), lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (12.5%) and progressive neurological disease (10.0%) were common HIV related conditions. Two children developed non-hodgkin's lymphoma. The median age at death for 23 children was 12 months, whereas the median survival after diagnosis was 4 months. Mortality was higher among those diagnosed in infancy (73.7%) as compared to those diagnosed post-infancy (42.8%). Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia was the most common (65.2%) cause of death.

Resumen: The effects of date of sowing on the rust, Uromyces phaseoli var. vignae, was studied on four cowpea cultivars, C-152, KBC-1, TVX-944 and V-37. The cultivars were sown on 27 July, 12 August, 6 September and 16 September in 1985 and on 22 July, 6 August, 1 September and 18 September in 1986. Maximum susceptibility to rust, measured as the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC), was recorded for the third (1986) or fourth (1985) sowings during the first or third week of September, respectively. Irrespective of the year or the sowing time, C-152 was the most susceptible cultivar with TVX 944 and KBC-1 as intermediates; V-37 was the least susceptible and exhibited slow rusting behaviour over all sowings. Analysis of variance of a split-pot design revealed the effects of cultivars, dates of sowing, and their interaction during 1985 to be significant (P< 0.01), suggesting a degree of environmental specificity in varietal response to the rust.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["450"]}

{"title": "Emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in South Africa: Implications for public health\n", "abstract": " South Africa is among the countries with the highest prevalence of debilitating diseases such as HIV/Aids and diabetes. In this context, the emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VREs) in most South African ecological niches is quite disturbing, taking into consideration the fact that therapeutic options in a case of resistant-enterococci infection would be limited. Agricultural practices coupled with the misuse of antibiotics in intensive animal rearing and in hospital facilities have led to the creation of reservoirs of VREs in the environment. VREs can cause serious health problems by transmitting their resistance genes to susceptible pathogens; they are transmitted to humans by direct or indirect contact and through the food chain. We screened thoroughly the AJOL and the PubMed databases for studies on VRE incidence in South Africa. This review gives insight into the current status of antimicrobial resistance management in South Africa; it explores the different pathways involved in the spread of VREs and proposes possible solutions to tackle the issue of VREs and antimicrobial resistance in South Africa and other parts of the world.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["450"]}

Hence, crack detection is indispensable for the condition monitoring and quality control of road surfaces. Pavement images have high levels of intensity variation and texture content; hence, the crack detection is generally difficult. Moreover, shallow cracks are very low contrast, making their detection difficult. Therefore, studies on pavement crack detection are active even after years of research. The fuzzy Hough transform is employed, for the first time, to detect cracks from pavement images. A careful consideration is given to the fact that cracks consist of near straight segments embedded in a surface of considerable texture. In this regard, the fuzzy part of the algorithm tackles the segments that are not perfectly straight. Moreover, tiled detection helps reduce the contribution of texture and noise pixels to the accumulator array. The proposed algorithm is\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["450"]}

{"title": "Experimental investigations on machining of CFRP composites: study of parametric influence and machining performance optimization\n", "abstract": " Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) composites are characterized by their excellent mechanical properties (high specific strength and stiffness, light weight, high damping capacity etc.) as compared to conventional metals, which results in their increased utilization especially for aircraft and aerospace applications, automotive, defense as well as sporting industries. With increasing applications of CFRP composites, determining economical techniques of production is very important. However, as compared to conventional metals, machining behavior of composites is somewhat different. This is mainly because these materials behave extremely abrasive during machining operations. Machining of CFRP appears difficult due to their material discontinuity, inhomogeneity and anisotropic nature. Moreover, the machining behavior of composites largely depends on the fiber form, the fiber content, fiber orientations of composites and the variability of matrix material. Difficulties are faced during machining of composites due to occurrence of various modes of damages like fiber breakage, matrix cracking, fiber\u2013matrix debonding and delamination. Hence, adequate knowledge and in-depth understanding of the process behavior is indeed necessary to identify the most favorable machining environment in view of various requirements of process performance yields. In this context, present work attempts to investigate aspects of machining performance optimization during machining (turning and drilling) of CFRP composites.

Arka Anamika) and laid out in randomized block design with 18 treatments replicated thrice. The treatments consist of control treatments ie conventional control and homa control; homa treatments (Agnihotra and Om Tryambakam homa) and non-homa treatments; and liquid organic manures viz, Panchagavya, Jeevamruta and Gloria Biosol for soil and foliar application. Among the control treatments, organic control recorded highest growth, yield and quality parameters than other controls. Soil and foliar application of Gloria Biosol was significantly superior over all the treatments in terms of growth, yield and quality attributes and recorded 20.28% more plant height and 21.41% more yield than organic control treatments. Ascorbic acid and free total phenol content of okra fruits in homa treatments were also significantly superior over all the treat-ments and recorded 15.45% and 5.33% more over organic control, respectively. Thus, it may be recommended that soil and foliar application of Gloria Biosol, among all the Homa organic treatments, will give the better crop produc-tivity and its produce quality.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["450"]}

{"title": "Effect of Beam Layout and Specification on Side Door Strength of Passenger Cars: An Experimental Approach to Analyze Its Effect and Contribution to Door Strength.\n", "abstract": " Risk of injury to occupant in the event of side impact is considerably higher compared to frontal or rear impact as the energy absorbing zones at the front and rear of vehicle is high whereas limited space is available to dissipate the impact energy in the event of side impact. In such scenario strength of side door plays an important role in protecting the occupant. Side door beam in door structure contributes significantly towards the lateral stiffness and plays dominant role in limiting the structural intrusion into passenger compartment. Hence it is interesting to understand the effect of beam specification and orientation on side door strength. Since these factors not only affect the strength but also the cost and weight targets, their study and analysis is important with respect to door designThis paper showcases the effect of beam layout and its specifications on the overall strength of the door with an experimental approach\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["450"]}

{"title": "Accelerometer sensor specifications to predict hydrocarbon using passive seismic technique\n", "abstract": " The ambient seismic ground noise has been investigated in several surveys worldwide in the last 10 years to verify the correlation between observed seismic energy anomalies at the surface and the presence of hydrocarbon reserves beneath. This is due to the premise that anomalies provide information about the geology and potential presence of hydrocarbon. However a technology gap manifested in nonoptimal detection of seismic signals of interest is observed. This is due to the fact that available sensors are not designed on the basis of passive seismic signal attributes and mainly in terms of amplitude and bandwidth. This is because of that fact that passive seismic acquisition requires greater instrumentation sensitivity, noise immunity, and bandwidth, with active seismic acquisition, where vibratory or impulsive sources were utilized to receive reflections through geophones. Therefore, in the case of passive seismic acquisition, it is necessary to select the best monitoring equipment for its success or failure. Hence, concerning sensors performance, this paper highlights the technological gap and motivates developing dedicated sensors for optimal solution at lower frequencies. Thus, the improved passive seismic recording helps in oil and gas industry to perform better fracture mapping and identify more appropriate stratigraphy at low frequencies.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["450"]}

Kuntze) causing yield losses of 5\u201355%. Various mite species are associated with tea monocultures. In the Kangra valley, Himachal Pradesh, India red spider mites (Oligonychus coffeae) and scarlet mites (Brevipalpus phoenicis) are prevalent during June-July. For mite control, various conventional acaricides are used but resistance has developed to most of them. In India, few acaricides are recommended for controlling mites in tea. However, there are many new risk reduced selective acaricides which are reported to control mites effectively on crops other than tea. Two seasons field bioefficacy trials of bifenazate (Acramite 50WP) were conducted against red spider mites at different application rates (@ 100, 125, 175, 200, 250 g/ha) and results were compared with the propargite 57 EC (@ 1 l/ha). In season 1, a single spray of bifenazate@ 250 g/ha provided 63% control up to 35 days post treatment. Acramite@ 250, 200, 175, and 125 g/ha provided mite control which was not significantly different from each other. In season 2, a repeat spray was made on day 14 and treatments@ 250 and 200 g/ha provided 91\u201393% control up to 35 days. Treatments@ 175 and 125 g/ha provided 84\u201386% control similar to propargite@ 1 l/ha.

Availability of reliable and accurate solar radiation data is crucial to achieve the targets. As a result of this initiative, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) of Government of India (GoI) has awarded a project to Centre for Wind Energy Technology (C-WET), Chennai in the year 2011 to set up 51 Solar Radiation Resource Assessment (SRRA) stations using the stateof-the-art equipment in various parts of the country, especially the sites with high potential for solar power. The GoI project has synergy with SolMap project, which is implemented by the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) in cooperation with the MNRE. SolMap project is contributing to SRRA project in establishing quality checks on the data obtained as per International protocols and helping data processing to generate investment grade data. The paper highlights the details of SRRA stations and an attempt has been made to present some of the important results of quality control and data analysis with respect to DNI. While our analysis of the data over one year finds that intensity and profile of the insolation are not uniform across the geographic regions, the variability in DNI is particularly high.

When an unpolished surface is magnified thousands of times, it usually looks like mountains and valleys. By repeated abrasion, those\" mountains\" are worn down until they are flat or just small\" hills.\" The process of polishing with abrasives starts with coarse ones and graduates to fine ones. The surface of a metallographic specimen is prepared by various methods of grinding, polishing, and etching. After preparation, it is often analyzed using optical or electron microscopy. The process of polishing is divided into rough polishing and fine polishing. The wet grinding machine is used for rough polishing in which we use different grade emery papers. In an industry, making the surface of the material fine and polished is done using highly sophisticated and automatic surface polishing machines which uses abrasive belts rolling over the metallic rollers and the job is being done on it.

Occurring at a faster pace than it has in centuries, climate change with its potential to stall developmental efforts is capable of causing major human devel-opment reversals in the lifetime of humanity (UNDP 2007). According to scientists, melting of glaciers is among the first observable signs of human-induced global warming. Glacier melting is said to affect the global climate, raise sea levels, trigger regional flooding, threaten water availability, endanger lives and alter the habitats of many plant and animal species (Mastny 2000).

The genotypic correlation in general, was similar in sign and slightly higher in magnitude than their phenotypic correlation which indirectly revealed that significant phenotypic association between attributes was primarily due to genetic cause, which may be due to pleiotropic effects and linkage. Grain yield per plot exhibited significant and positive correlation with harvest index followed by 1000-grain weight, tillers per running meter and spikelets per spike in both the environments I and II as well as combined over environments at phenotypic and genotypic levels in the individual as well as combined over environments. Path coefficient analysis revealed high positive and direct influence of spikelets per spike, tillers per running meter, plant height, grains per spike, harvest index, grains per spike, 1000-grain weight, days to 75 per cent maturity and days to 50 per cent heading with grain yield per plot. From the overall study, there is an indication of improvement in yield through selection with high values for spikelets per spike, tillers per running meter, plant height, grains per spike, harvest index, grains per spike, 1000-grain weight, days to 75 per cent maturity and days to 50 per cent heading. The low residual effect in present analysis indicated that almost all the important yield attributes were taken in to consideration.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["450"]}
{"title": "Measuring Service Quality in India Public Transport System: A Comprehensive review\u2016\n", "abstract": " The usage of public transport in India has been declining over the recent years despite the fact that travel demands have increased in geometric proportion. The causes for this decline in India can be attributed to the facts like underdeveloped infrastructure facilities, poor quality of services and socio-cultural stigmas associated with public transport. Over the last few years, Government of India has been involved in a process of deep transformation of public transport through different policy initiatives to attract more and more commuters towards using public transport. Providing a good service quality to meet passengers\u2019 needs is the key to retaining existing passengers as well as attracting new ones who currently use other modes of transport. It is one of the important practical themes for service providers and regulatory agencies, but it also continues to be a challenging research theme. In the present paper researchers address the service quality issues of public transport in India; challenges in measuring service quality; and different dimensions used by researchers to measure service quality of public transport in the backdrop of Government of India initiatives towards improving the state of public transport system. The researchers have attempted to draw out a conceptual framework which can be further tested empirically in different Indian cities to arrive at an effective service quality measurement scale.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["450"]}

The characteristics of these new tribal patients are described and compared with other patients and to the demographics of the tribals in the general population of the State. While tribals were accessing the leprosy services similar to the other social groups, the delay in reporting, high BI and other features pose more serious problems in the transmission of leprosy and in management of complications due to the harsh environment and occupational patterns of the tribals.

The method employs Blackman window family to design the prototype filter for filter banks with novelty of exploiting spline functions in the transition band of the ideal filter instead of using the conventional brick-wall filter. The cutoff frequency is optimized using linear optimization technique such that the filter coefficients values at frequency (/2M \u03c9 \u03c0=) is approximately equal to 0.707. The simulation results illustrate significant reduction in amplitude distortion, aliasing error and computation time.

Infants born to HIV-infected women were enrolled into this cohort at birth or at the time of diagnosis of HIV exposure in the postnatal period and followed-up at regular intervals. RESULTS: From a cohort of 44 HIV-infected children, 17 (38.6%) children survived to the age of eight years and beyond and were classified as long-term survivors. Median age of the sixteen long-term surviving children alive at the time of this report was 12 years (age range 8\u201316.7 years). At the age of 8 years, 17.6% of these children remained asymptomatic. Nine (52.9%) children had no immunodeficiency (CD4 counts> 500 cells x 106/L). Of the 16 long-term surviving children who were alive and had a median follow-up of 4.1 years (range 0.1 year to 8.5 years) after their eighth birthday, 37.5% had a CD4 cell count greater than 500 cells x 106/L and had either no symptoms or only mild symptoms of HIV infection and were therefore categorized as the long-term non-progressors. CONCLUSIONS: In a small cohort of HIV-infected children, in the absence of antiretroviral therapy, only about one-third survived beyond eight years of age. On further follow-up of these long-term surviving children, over one-third had a slow rate of disease progression.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["450"]}

A reduced order approach is used to develop state equations for the non-linear finite element model of deformation processes. The influence of optimally designed process variables is studied using the variance in strain-rates and input power as performance measures. The state variables include the forging die contact nodal velocities and nodal velocities of selected elements within the billet. The control input is the ram velocity which is found using the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) theory to maintain desired strain-rates in the selected finite elements.

{"title": "Enzyme-silicon studies of gibberellic acid-treated sugarcane during the post growth-stimulatory phase\n", "abstract": " Enzyme-sucrose relationships were studied in immature sugarcane 9 weeks after foliar treatment with gibberellic acid (GA). Silicon (Si) was used to induce sucrose and enzyme behavior patterns which then were compared between GA-treated and non-GA treated plants. The ultimate purpose is exploration of the enzyme basis for the growth and sugar decline which supersedes GA growth stimulation. During the present study three objectives were attempted: 1, To induce definite sucrose accumulations by daily use of Si; 2, to induce enzyme trends which could be correlated with changing sucrose level; and 3, to demonstrate that enzymes of cane no longer experiencing growth stimulation behave essentially the same as their counterparts in non-GA treated plants. The following results were obtained: 1. Plants given foliar GA (0.01 percent) experienced initial internode elongation and increased fresh weight. The growth effects outwardly ceased by 9 weeks. Si at the 250 and 500 ppm levels caused moderate growth stunting. This effect was markedly less severe in GA-treated plants. 2. Sucrose levels increased in leaf, immature storage, and stalk tissues in response to progressively higher Si supply. Optimum Si for growth and sucrose production lay between 100 and 250 ppm 3. Evidence was found of a Si-moderating mechanism against relatively extreme shifts in leaf enzyme behavior. 4. Peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, phosphatase, and ATP-ase were strongly suppressed in leaves as Si supply was raised. In each instance the enzyme sensitivity to Si was vastly altered in plants treated with foliar GA. Amylase sensitivity to Si was similarly\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["450"]}

These structures can be array, class, linked list with its various forms, Tree, Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree (BST), etc. These can be differentiated in two major forms. First one uses continuous memory allocation and the second one can occupy any free memory block by pointed by the other memory locations. An array occupies continuous memory space for storage purpose and the size should also be known before allocating the space. Perhaps we can use dynamic memory allocation methods for arrays but a Linked List provides better options. There is a disadvantage in Linked List, it does not allow to perform binary search operation on it. The Binary Search Tree is more efficient than the other mentioned data structures.

{"title": "Nerve Growth Factor (s) Mediated Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal Axis Dysregulation Model in Stress Induced Genesis of Psychiatric Disorders\n", "abstract": " Apart from their established role in embryonic development Nerve Growth Factors (NGFs) have diverse functions in the nervous system. Their role in integration of physiological functioning of the nervous system is now attracting attention. In the present analysis, we propose a novel paradigm about a novel role of NGFs: NGFs play imperative role in maintaining psychological integrity of an individual as a biological system. This function may be mediated through HPA-axis-operated homeostatic mechanisms; stress induced disruption of which may lead to psychiatric disorders. Current literature suggests existence of constitutive homeostatic regulatory mechanisms for NGFs disruption which may lead to pertinent and imperative behavioural effects. NGFs are known to play crucial role in endocrine regulation. This is especially true with the prototype \u2018NGF\u2019and Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF). These moieties have been observed to play important function in maintaining neuro-endocrine homeostasis thereby having a profound impact on the psychological health of an individual. Role of NGFs and HPA-axis activation (in separate studies) in developing psychiatric disorders-especially those born of stress-have been reported. Literature suggests their unique interplay for producing a common effect which might be implicated in stress induced genesis of psychiatric disorders. This aspect, therefore, needs to be elucidated further as a disease etiogenesis model. This model may yield important insights into the biology of psychiatric disorders and may open ways for new therapeutic approaches.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["450"]}

Wilczek] also known as green gram, golden gram or green soy is an important source of Indian dietary protein with highly nutritive value. The food value of mungbean lies in its high and easily digestible protein. It contains approximately 25-28% protein and 62-65% carbohydrate on dry weight basis. The amino acids analysis indicates that as with most grain legume crops, the concentration of lysine is higher but sulphur containing amino acid is low. This is grown in all the season with maximum area in Kharif cultivation. Asia holds more than 90% of world\u2019s mungbean production and India is the largest mungbean producer having 3.43 Million hectare area with a production of 1.71 Million tones (Gupta, 2013). In India, the major mungbean growing states are Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Odisha and Bihar. A phenomenal increase in area, production and productivity has occurred since 1964-1965. This is due to short duration varieties which can be successfully grown as both sole crop and intercrop. Despite, the increase in area and production, the productivity of this crop is very low (0.5-1.0 t/ha) in tropical and sub-tropical Asia, including India. One of the causes is their susceptibility to diseases especially Mungbean Yellow Mosaic Virus (MYMIV), which is transmitted by whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Nairani, 1960; Nene, 1972 and Nene, 1973).In recent years, Mungbean Yellow Mosaic Virus has emerged as threat to cultivation of this crop in Southern Peninsula also. The important symptoms appear in the form of small irregular yellow spaces and spots along the veins which gradually increase until\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["450"]}
{"title": "Resistance potential of newly released urdbean genotypes against Mungbean yellow mosaic India virus\n", "abstract": " India is one of the major pulses contributors in global pulses economy. In pulses, urdbean [Vigna mungo (L.) Hepper] is very important kharif crop of the country and used for different purpose viz., dal, curries, snacks, idlie, dosa etc. Urdbean is also cultivated in spring season in northern India and winter cultivation in rice fallow in southern and coastal areas of country. The food value of urdbean lies in its high and easily digestible protein which is approximately 25-28 per cent. In India, area, production and productivity of urdbean has increased since 1971-75 and presently, India becomes largest urdbean producer in the world having cultivated area of 3.30 mha and production of 1.83 mt (3). However, the productivity of this crop is quite low 555 (kg/ha) as compared to other legumes. One of the major causes of low productivity is its susceptibility to yellow mosaic disease (YMD). The disease is caused by representative species of the genus Begomovirus. Based on earlier studies it has been confirmed that at least two virus (MYMV and MYMIV) species causing YMD are prevalent in Indian subcontinent (4). One of these species, Mungbean yellow mosaic India virus (MYMIV) is considered to be more predominant in northern, central and eastern India (7) and other MYMV in peninsular region of India (5, 6). Begomo virus is transmitted through the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci Genn.(7). MYMIV is very destructive disease and in conducive situation, the yield penalty may reach up to cent per cent (4). This disease portrays symptoms to almost all the stages of crop growth which ultimately causes severe losses in yield and is a major menace to urdbean.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["450"]}
{"title": "Stress in academia manifested as aphthous ulcers\n", "abstract": " Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is the most common oral ulcerative condition and affects 20% of the general population. Stress is all pervasive and it is more common in faculties and students of professional colleges like medical and dental sciences. Any type of stress either physical or psychological induces increased secretion of cortisol. The purpose of this work was to study the role of academic stress in RAS. Two groups of subjects one with RAS (n= 36) and the other without RAS serving as the control group (n= 36) were studied. The stress level in both the groups was assessed using STAI (state trait anxiety inventory) and the serum cortisol was measured at the same time. A significant increase (p= 0.014) was seen in the STAI scores in RAS group (48\u00b14) compared to the control group (46\u00b17). The serum cortisol levels were 132\u00b170ng/ml in the RAS group and 126\u00b163 ng/ml in the control group respectively. The increase in STAI scores and concomitant increase in serum cortisol in RAS group is highly suggestive of stress as a causative factor for ulcers. Presence of RAS could be an indicator of distress in the individual.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["450"]}

{"title": "Transmissible Venereal Tumor Induced Paraphimosis in Dogs\n", "abstract": " In the present study, all the dogs were young adult to middle aged. Three out of four dogs were Mongrel and street dogs. Similarly previous studies report high incidence of genital TVT in free roaming, intact young dogs between 2 to 5 years of age and is transmitted by contact with infected genitalia during coitus (McEntee et al., 2002, Rogers et al., 1998, Fossum, 2007). Since it is a venereal tumor and mostly occurs in stray population in adulthood age when the dog is allowed to mate in the pack. A dog suffering from TVT lesions may not be able to retract the penis back into the prepucial cavity after coitus or sexual excitement due to the presence of massive growth at the bulbus glandis which might have hindered the retraction of penis. De-Lorimier and Fan (2007) opined that TVT may cause paraphimosis but Ndiritu (1979) reported that co-incidence of paraphimosis in cases of TVT is statistically non-significant. Presence of paraphimosis in three Mongrel or stray dogs of the present study, indicates that chronic untreated cases of genital TVT in male dogs may result in development of paraphimosis due to physical obstruction. No necrosis or discoloration of penis due to paraphimosis associated with TVT lesions was seen in any of the dog of the present study; however discoloration, necrosis and urethral obstruction have been reported in dogs with paraphimosis (Fossum, 2007). The TVT can be tentatively diagnosed from typical lesions and by fine needle aspiration or impression smear cytology (Rogers et al 1998; McEntee et al 2002; Fossum 2007).

Although such stressors have received little research attention until recent years, some research indicates that these stressors may have a negative impact on health and well-being. A number of stress-reduction strategies have been studied to be useful for working women focused on reducing the occupational stress. This article examines the relations between occupational stress in working women, strategies to cope up with stress and feeling of well-being. For this one hundred working women in the age range of 25 to 45 years from middle job strata working in government organizations of district Haridwar were undertaken through the purposive sampling technique. Occupational Stress Index, Coping Checklist and PGI-Well-being scales were used to measure the work related stress, coping strategies and feeling of well-being of such people. Critical analysis of data revel that working women were high on role overload, role conflict, unreasonable group and political pressure, under participation, strenuous working conditions of occupational stress. On the other hand they were high on use of coping strategies like positive cognitive and distraction.

Function of MsFHbI is associated with nitric-oxide detoxification but physiological relevance of MsFHbII remains unknown. This study unravels some unique spectral and functional characteristics of MsFHbII. Unlike conventional type I FHbs, MsFHbII lacks nitric-oxide dioxygenase and NADH oxidase activities but utilizes d-lactate as an electron donor to mediate electron transfer. MsFHbII carries a d-lactate dehydrogenase type FAD binding motif in its reductase domain and oxidizes d-lactate in a FAD dependent manner to reduce the heme iron, suggesting that the globin is acting as an electron acceptor.

Dispersion of CNTs in polar basefluids during preparation is one of the critical steps because of the hydrophobic nature of CNTs. To prepare long term stable CNT nanofluids, addition of surfactant, ultrasonication, homogenization, change of pH, etc. can be utilized. In addition to static conditions the prepared CNT nanofluids must be stable under dynamic conditions because of the fact that when CNT nanofluids are used in heat exchangers for heat transfer applications, a centrifugal force is exerted to the CNT nanofluids which cause separation between CNTs and basefluids and may block the pipelines of heat exchangers.

{"title": "A novel approach for boosting base station anonymity in a wsn\n", "abstract": " Nodes in a wireless sensor network scrutinize the nearby region and transmit their findings to the base station (BS) using multi-hop transmission. As the BS plays an important role in a wireless sensor network, therefore an adversary who wants to interrupt the operation of the network would avidly look for the BS location and imposes maximum damage by destroying the BS physically. The multi-hop data transmission towards BS makes a prominent pattern of the traffic (huge traffic near the BS region) that indicates the presence of BS in the nearby region and thus the location of the BS may expose to the adversaries. This work aims to provide a novel approach which will increase the BS anonymity. For this purpose, a randomly roamed BS and the special nodes are proposed to achieve the above mentioned objective. The special nodes produce a large number of high traffic regions, which are similar to the BS region. Now, there are many regions which look like BS region and hence the probability to get the BS region using traffic analysis is very low. Therefore, this approach increases the effort of adversaries in order to find the exact BS position. We have used a standard entropy model to measure the anonymity of the base station and the GSAT test is used to calculate the number of steps required to find the base station. The results show that the proposed technique provides better results in terms of anonymity compared to the existing techniques.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["450"]}

{"title": "Heritability of Behavior\n", "abstract": " The postulate that animal behavior has a genetic basis is now well supported by scientific literature, and the determination of heritability has been an important measure in current quantitative behavioral genetics. Nature versus nurture (or gene versus environment) contribution in expression of a trait (ie, phenotype) has been a longtime conflict, leaving scholars either denying contributions by one of these or claiming dominance over each other. Environment refers to anything other than genotype, to which an individual is exposed and which may influence expression of a trait. Psychologist Eric Turkheimer proposed three laws of heritability which got wide acceptance among the scholars of behavioral studies. The first law says all human behavioral traits are heritable. The second law says the effect of shared family environment is less than genes. The third law states that a substantial proportion of variation in complex behavioral traits is not explained either by environment or genes (Turkheimer 2000). These laws are in stark contrast to the primitive views regarding biological basis of behavior which had given solo importance to the environment. Although now enough literature is available which provides scientific basis for the heritability estimation in behavior, the evidence also supports inclusion of the counter view (Flynn 2001). Conceptually, heritability doesn\u2019t ensure that any percentage of the said behavioral trait will be solely decided by genes. Current view is that although genes may have an essential role, animal behavior is decided by the intricately multifaceted interplay of the contributing factors and not by any single factor in isolation\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["450"]}

{"title": "Investigating the Synchronous Bandwidth Allocation in an FDDI Network for Real-Time Communications\n", "abstract": " The Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) is recommended as a candidate for many hard real-time local-area communication systems. The Timed-Token Medium Access Control (MAC) Protocol of FDDI is capable of guaranteeing real-time tra c on the FDDI network with the synchronous transmission mode. This report addresses the issues in implementing real-time communications on an FDDI network using synchronous mode transmission, and guaranteeing the application-to-application deadlines of multiple message streams. Extensive research has been done on using FDDI for real-time communication. Most previous research was based on a simpli ed model and had two main limitations:(1) delays and deadlines were only considered at the MAC level; and (2) in order to simplify the analysis, only one message stream per node was allowed. These limitations restrict the applicability of the past research to practical FDDI-based communication systems, since in these systems, multiple communication applications may have to run on the same node to send out messages, and the processing delays of higher layers than MAC layer may have great impact on the total delay.Our work removes these limitations and shows a systematic way for managing end-to-end message delays at the application level on an FDDI network. We consider the integrated system which include host subsystems (sender and receiver hosts) and the network. A synchronous server is proposed to eliminate the restriction of one message stream per node.

The present investigation describes the development and evaluation of duplex PCR assay for simultaneous detection of Babesia bigemina (B. bigemina) and Theileria annulata (T. annulata) in cattle. Following in silico analysis for candidate target genes representing each of the haemoparasites, an optimised duplex PCR assay was established using two sets of primers, ssurRNA and cytob1 for genomic DNA amplification of B. bigemina and T. annulata encoding product size of 689 and 312 bp, respectively. The results were compared with conventional microscopy and monoplex PCR assay. The sensitivity of each primer pair was checked using serial dilutions of parasite DNA, while specificity was determined by testing for amplification from DNA of different stocks of each pathogen. The duplex PCR detected each parasite species with the same level of sensitivity, irrespective of whether its DNA was amplified in isolation or with DNA mixture representing the other pathogens. Additionally, single and duplex PCRs could able to detect each species with equal sensitivity in serially diluted DNA representing mixtures of both the pathogen, and nonspecific amplification from non target species was not observed.

{"title": "Commentary: A Possible Mechanism of Zika Virus Associated Microcephaly: Imperative Role of Retinoic Acid Response Element (RARE) Consensus Sequence Repeats in the Viral Genome\n", "abstract": " The present commentary emerges from the skepticism about our recent paper describing/proposing the mechanism of Zika-virus (a positive strand RNA virus) mediated microcephaly (Kumar et al., 2016). Our hypothesis mainly elaborates on the retinoic acid signaling problems precipitated by Zika infection. Owing to our intriguing bioinformatics results, we commenced with a coherent line of arguments that viral DNA (somehow synthesized from the viral RNA) may be integrating into the host DNA, and if the inserted DNA sequences match the regulatory regions of certain host genes then their expression signature may be altered. It could then be justified that the Retinoic Acid Response Element (RARE) consensus sequence repeats (if present) in the genomic sequences of ZIKV strains would be inserted into the regulatory regions of RARE dependent genes of the host DNA and, therefore, could influence their expression in a way that the developing fetus manifests with brain malformation like microcephaly. Another reason for implicating RARE elements in Zika induced microcephaly is because retinoic acid metabolism has an imperatively essential role in normal brain development, and the reported cases of Zika virus mediated microcephaly demonstrated striking resemblances to retinoic acid embryopathy (Kumar et al., 2016; Mawson, 2016). The most plausible explanation that could account for all the features of Zika microcephaly was through retinoic acid signaling. All this was the substance of our paper published last year (Kumar et al., 2016) which necessitates the possibility of integration of a positive strand RNA virus genome into the host\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["450"]}

Most of the similarity measures, which are used to classify an instance, are based on geometric model. Their effectiveness decreases with the increases in the number of dimensions. This paper establishes an efficient technique called ARSkNN for finding out class of any given instance using a measure based on an unique similarity, that does no longer compute distance, for k-NN classification. Our empirical results show that ARSkNN classification technique is better than the previous established k-NN classifiers. The performance of algorithm was verified and validated on various datasets from different domains.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["450"]}

Phosphate ions are essential during phorylation, a key enzyme reaction which diverts glucose to metabolic pathways. Urate, an end product of purine metabolism is altered in uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (DM) particularly in T2DM. As blood Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) serves as an Index of long term Diabetic Control and is considered a gold standard, its level will indeed be associated with metals like Ca, Mg along with Phosphate and Urate, all of which are altered. Hence there must exist some association between HbA1c and Ca, Mg, P and Uric acid. Uric acid level is always low in DM and is associated with metabolic syndrome (metS) and serves as a potential biomarker for DM as its level is directly proportional to albuminuria. This study is an attempt to find out the association of HbA1c to Ca, Mg, P and Urate and to suggest that these 4 tests must be done for all T2DM patients.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["450"]}

After overnight incubation 100 Staphylococcus aureus were isolated, among which 26 were MRSA and 74 were MSSA has been isolated. The susceptibility pattern of antibiotics showed that all MRSA isolates were significantly less sensitivity to antibiotics as compared to MSSA. None of the MRSA strain showed resistance towards Vancomycin & Linezolid. Conclusion: The emergence of MRSA and other antibiotic resistant organisms reflects widespread ubiquitous over-use of antibiotics on a global scale. Control measures are required to prevent spread and reduce emergence of resistance.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["450"]}
{"title": "A review on nanotechnology in civil engineering\n", "abstract": " Nanotechnology is the science of engineering that deals with particle which are less than 100 nm in size. It is the study of manipulating matter on molecular and atomic scale. Traditionally, nanotechnology has been concerned with developments in most of the fields like microbiology, medicine, electronic, chemical, and materials sciences. However, the potential for application of many of the developments in the nanotechnology field in the area of construction engineering has been growing. Concrete is stronger, more durable and more easily placed, steel tougher and glass self-cleaning. At the nanoscale, familiar materials can have dramatically different properties-changes can affect colour, elasticity, strength, conductivity and other properties. Conventional concrete improved by applying nanotechnology provides a novel, smart, eco-and environmentfriendly construction material towards the green structure. There are two main types of approaches to nanotechnology: The \u201ctop-down\u201d approach and the \u201cbottom-up\u201d approach. The \u201ctop-down\u201d approach involves taking larger structures that are either reduced down in size until they reach the nano-scale, or are deconstructed into their composite parts. On the other hand, the \u201cbottom-up\u201d approach is where materials are constructed from the atomic or molecular components. Based on this view, research is going on evolve new or alternate material towards a green and sustainable solution.

{"title": "Development of 2-D MRT based image compression techniques\n", "abstract": " The thesis explores the area of still image compression. The image compression techniques can be broadly classified into lossless and lossy compression. The most common lossy compression techniques are based on Transform coding, Vector Quantization and Fractals. Transform coding is the simplest of the above and generally employs reversible transforms like, DCT, DWT, etc. Mapped Real Transform (MRT) is an evolving integer transform, based on real additions alone. The present research work aims at developing new image compression techniques based on MRT. Most of the transform coding techniques employ fixed block size image segmentation, usually 8\u00d78. Hence, a fixed block size transform coding is implemented using MRT and the merits and demerits are analyzed for both 8\u00d78 and 4\u00d74 blocks. The N2 unique MRT coefficients, for each block, are computed using templates. Considering the merits and demerits of fixed block size transform coding techniques, a hybrid form of these techniques is implemented to improve the performance of compression. The performance of the hybrid coder is found to be better compared to the fixed block size coders. Thus, if the block size is made adaptive, the performance can be further improved. In adaptive block size coding, the block size may vary from the size of the image to 2\u00d72. Hence, the computation of MRT using templates is impractical due to memory requirements. So, an adaptive transform coder based on Unique MRT (UMRT), a compact form of MRT, is implemented to get better performance in terms of PSNR and HVS The suitability of MRT in vector quantization of images is then\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["450"]}

{"title": "Engineered nanomaterials as disinfectants: benefits and health concerns\n", "abstract": " Engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) such as Ag, TiO2, ZnO, etc. are currently being used as disinfectants for killing pathogens in water treatment plants. However, this increased usage also raises an important question of their long-term effects on pathogen\u2019s defense systems. This study aims to understand toxic effects of ENMs on pathogens and identify current research needs for developing better understanding. First bacterial disinfection with ZnO NPs was considered and toxic effects were correlated with bacterial defense mechanisms. Literature reports and findings were synthesized to identify issues, needing immediate research and regulatory attention. Analysis indicated that ENMs are better disinfectants when used in combination with antibiotics by releasing oxygen radicals and inducing oxidative stress. Toxicity of these effects depends on ENM dose level, exposure duration, and bacterial defense system. Bacteria employ defense mechanisms such as release of extracellular polymeric substance which can reduce toxic effects of ENMs. Experience with exposure of bacteria to antibiotics indicates that bacteria develop resistance mechanisms by adapting themselves against antibiotics by employing phenotypic and genetic changes. This kind of information is currently not available for exposures of bacteria to ENMs, which leaves the question of long-term effect of ENMs on bacteria unanswered. Overall, it is still unclear how bacteria would react to exposures of ENMs after repetitive exposures and what conditions are conducive for them to develop resistance against ENMs. These uncertainties in bacterial defense mechanisms towards ENMs\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["450"]}

However, in all such algorithms, a fixed path is returned always for the same start and goal positions in the environment. Recently, Perlin noise has been used to add variations to a path so that it appears more natural. However, because of pure random nature of Perlin noise function, often unnatural path occurs.

{"title": "Cryopreservation of Human Sperm: Effect of Cooling Rate on Intracellular Ice Formation\n", "abstract": " The effect of cooling rate on the intracellular ice formation for human spermatozoa have been studied and a correlation formula is established in this study. It is found that after a certain cooling rate, termed as optimal cooling rate in this study, the volume of intracellular ice increases exponentially with increase in the cooling rate. The cellular response of human sperm cells to different cooling rates, varying between 5 C/min and 300 C/min, is studied using the diffusion limited transport model. The membrane permeability parameters are taken from the published literature. For a cooling rate lower than the optimal value, almost all intracellular water flows out to the extracellular compartment through the cell membrane leaving behind only the osmotically inactive cell volume inside the cell. For the calculation of the amount of intracellular ice formation, it has been assumed that the amount of water trapped inside the human sperm at-19 C will finally form intracellular ice with sufficient super-cooling.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["450"]}

{"title": "Universal Pattern Set for Arithmetic Circuits\n", "abstract": " The exponential increase in test cost is one of the new challenges being posed by technology scaling. This Paper has been aimed to deal with the issue of testing cost which adds to the chip cost. Here we propose a new pattern set for testing the arithmetic circuits which contains a minimum number of test vectors and easy to generate on the chip and hence supports at-speed testing of the circuit. Though maximum fault coverage is desired but practically generation of test vectors for testing of all the possible defects is not at all feasible. This leads to the modeling of defects as faults which facilitate for simplification of test generation process. Though various fault models have been proposed, the single stuck-at fault model is one of widely accepted model because of having closeness to the actual defects and also, it provide the algorithmic possibilities which, further helps in generation of test vectors. The desired smaller DPM (defective parts per million) levels for devices, creates the need for application of better fault models, which can model the defects in the most accurate fashion. This result in complex fault models which tends to make test generation tedious or even impossible and ultimately increase the test cost. Our motive is to cut down the test cost by finding the minimal number of test vectors for the test. If reduction in the patterns for one module is achieved, it would reduce the overall test cost. We propose universal pattern set which gives good fault coverage for arithmetic circuit with small set of vectors.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["450"]}

{"title": "A novel technique to extract Statechart representations of FSMs\n", "abstract": " UML statechart based models are being used extensively during software development. However, often designers produce state models that are essentially finite state machines rather than statecharts, lacking hierarchy and concurrency. Also for legacy code, reverse engineering efforts lead naturally to finite state machines rather than statecharts, necessitating a model transformation at a later stage. We propose a method to convert an FSM model to an equivalent statechart model.Our method results in different statechart representations of an FSM. We use structural complexity metrics to compare statecharts. This enables us to identify a statechart with the lowest structural complexity. In case, the resultant statechart is similar to the original FSM, we propose a method to extract statechart from such an arbitrary FSM. Our method can be applied to not only FSMs of objects but FSMs used in other modeling applications. Our method produces statecharts upto two levels of nesting. We have developed a prototype tool to demonstrate the transformation process. We have supplemented our technique with experimental data. The FSMs used for experimentation are randomly generated. Our experimental evaluation indicates that our technique produces statecharts that substantially improve the complexity of state models.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["450"]}

The main objective of this study was to review the mortality in HIV-infected paediatric patients in Barbados. It is a retrospective analysis of the hospitalization course of HIV-infected paediatric patients aged< 16 years who died during a 15-year period of surveillance. Using a specific database, information pertaining to number and duration of hospitalizations, and cause of death were analyzed. There were 39 (65%) deaths among 60 HIV-infected patients diagnosed during the period of study. Twenty-one (54%) were male and 18 (46%) were female. Twenty-seven (69%) case records were retrieved for analysis. The highest mortality (56%) was among patients aged< 1 year and between 1989 and 1995. Hospitalizations averaged three per patient. No patient received anti-retroviral therapy. Nineteen (70%) patients died during hospitalization on the paediatric ward. Lower respiratory tract infections suspected to be Pneumocystis carinii, gastroenteritis and septicaemia were the most frequent diagnoses at the time of death. The annual mortality ranged between 0 and 1.7 (mean 0.7) per 1000 live births. The overall mortality rate was high among HIV-infected paediatric patients, with lower respiratory tract infections being implicated as a major contributing cause of death. Results of this study definitely indicate a need for improved resources in the management of paediatric HIV/AIDS cases, especially focussing on the availability and administration of anti-retroviral therapy.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["450"]}

A reduced order approach is used to develop linear state equations at fixed times during a process evolution using a non-linear finite element model and a simulation of the deformation process. The design of process control inputs is accomplished by using results from steady state linear quadratic regulator (LQR) theory as a convenient algorithm for calculating die ram velocities that approximately maintain desired strain-rates in selected finite elements. The linear state space model is obtained from the nonlinear simulation using condensation techniques. The state variables include the forging die contact nodal velocities and the nodal velocities of selected elements within the billet.

{"title": "Mfsd2b, a Novel Sphingosine-1-Phosphate transporter: Implication in cancer therapeutics\n", "abstract": " Sphingosine-1-Phosphate (S1P) is a potent sphingolipid metabolite that regulates physiological functions including cell proliferation, survival, migration, angiogenesis, lymphocyte trafficking, mitochondrial functions as well as carcinogenesis [1]. Growing evidences suggest that S1P promotes tumor growth while inhibiting apoptosis and conferring chemo-and radiation resistance to cancer cells [2]. S1P is secreted in the extracellular environment and mediates its actions by binding to a family of G-protein-coupled receptors known as S1P receptors (S1PRs) in an autocrine as well as paracrine fashion [1]. S1P concentration is more in the circulatory fluid (blood and lymph) compared to lymphoid organs and tissue interstitial fluid. In blood, most of the plasma S1P is transported in bound state to highdensity lipoprotein (HDL) and albumin. On HDL, S1P remains attached to Apolipoprotein M (Apo M) where latter may protect S1P from degradation and facilitates its presentation to receptors [3]. The major sources of plasma S1P are endothelial cells, platelets and RBCs, while lymphatic S1P is produced by lymphatic endothelial cells [3].S1P is generated by the phosphorylation of sphingosine, a step catalyzed by sphingosine kinase 1 and 2 (Sphk1 and-2), and can be dephosphorylated by various lipid phosphatases to regenerate sphingosine. Additionally, S1P is irreversibly degraded by S1P lyase (SPL), which cleaves S1P, yielding two products, ethanolamine phosphate and trans-2-hexadecenal [1, 4]. Therefore, S1P levels are tightly regulated by Sphk, lipid phosphatases and SPL. After synthesis, S1P can be exported outside the cell; once in the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["450"]}

Present study focus on extraction, chemical identification of volatile cues present in tomato variety K-21 and their impact assessment on Trichogramma japonicum Ashmead, Trichogramma brasiliensis Ashmead and Trichogramma chilonis Ishii. For this, the targeted variety was grown in laboratory and field condition in same season by following suitable agronomical conditions. Leaf samples were collected in vegetative and flowering phase of growth for allelochemical extraction. Petri dish bioassay studies were carried out to observe the allelochemical effect of volatile cues present in hexane leaf extracts in different concentrations viz., 4, 00,000 ppm, 2, 00,000 ppm, 1, 00,000 ppm, 50,000 ppm and 25,000 ppm on targeted egg parasitoids. Observation indicated a higher foraging response by Trichogrammatids under the influence of volatile cues derived from plants of vegetative stage growing in field condition (VSF) as evidenced by parasitoid activity index (PAI) and percent parasitisation (% PARA) studies. Among the three Trichogrammatids, T. japonicum exhibited higher stimulation towards VSF stage of targeted variety. These extracts were also subjected to Gas Liquid Chromatography (GLC) to find out the presence of saturated hydrocarbons. Chromatogram of targeted extracts reveals the presence of favourable as well as unfavourable saturated hydrocarbons ranging from C22 to C34; varying in numbers and concentrations. Elevated stimulation in foraging response of egg parasitoids could be ascribed to the presence of favourable volatile cues emitted by K-21.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["450"]}

{"title": "Non-Isolated Pentagon Rule Fullerenes: A Review\n", "abstract": " Fullerenes were discovered by Curl, Kroto and Smalley in 1985. C60 fullerene molecule composed of 20 hexagons and 12 pentagons has diameter of 0.7 nanometers. Open - shell structures are energetically unfavorable and thus avoided. Structures with isolated pentagons are preferred to those containing adjacent five -membered rings. This happens because the local strain increases with the number of bonds shared by two pentagons (pentalene units), thus affording less - stable molecules. The isolated pentagon rule (IPR) coined by Kroto states that all pentagons must be surrounded by hexagons. A head to tail exclusion rule has been proposed to explain the higher stability of fullerenes obeying the IPR rule. The IPR is a very strong rule of thumb for neutral bare fullerenes, where every adjacent pentagon costs about 100 kJ/mol in stability.However, in order to search for number of expected non - IPR fullerenes\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["450"]}

Although natural forests contribute major part of many species of Flemingia used for various purposes, but farmers are now attracted in its cultivation due to its versatile uses. Two major species of Flemingia namely, F. semialata and F. macrophylla is now intensively cultivated by the farmers for lac cultivation in Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and Odisha. While, no remarkable effort have been put for their genetic improvement. To make them highly productive and profitable to the farmers it is highly desirable to apply breeding and selection strategies to develop genetically superior varieties. Flemingia sp. breeding is in early phase as some efforts to improve it, has been made in India, China and other tropical countries. Basic knowledge about their genetics is also very less though it is a relative of pigeon pea.It seems therefore timely to discuss Flemingia breeding and selection strategies.

Wheat occupies of 31.9 mha area with a production of 95.91 mt and productivity 3075 kg ha-1.(Agricultural Statistics at a Glance, 2014). Due to revolution in tillage options like minimum tillage, zero tillage, FIRBS, raised bed planting, the paradigm shift in tillage has been observed in world over. Due to the availability of herbicides, insecticides and fungicides and also more mechanization, the farmers prefer new tillage options compared to conventional tillage that is required mainly for seedbed preparation and weed control (Mohanty et al., 2006). Similarly zero tillage promotes high aggregate stability, decreases soil temperature and maintains high carbon and nitrogen. FIRBS and raised bed planting reduces cost of cultivation and water and nutrient requirement in maize-wheat system and rice-wheat-systems and increased soil quality (Singh et al., 2011; Naresh et al., 2009). The sub soiling is an urgent need to break the hard pan and also improve the soil porosity and percolation. Therefore, some of the research findings have already indicated that the sub soiling may be beneficial to improve the productivity and profitability of the system, compared to adopting conventional tillage system.

Pulse characteristics of fault-normal components in terms of pulse-periods and pulse-indicators have been extracted adopting wavelet analysis. Seven mother wavelets were used in the analysis, and it was found that db4 and db7 mother wavelets were more efficient in extracting the pulse-type characteristics. NFGM spectra, at Bhatwari and Gopeshwar stations, showed higher spectral amplitudes in the velocity-sensitive and acceleration-sensitive regions compared to Indian codal response spectra. This is attributed to high PGV/PGA ratios. The study shows that NFGM leads to widening of acceleration-sensitive region, and the structures that are designed according to the Indian seismic code as flexible structures shall behave as stiff structures when subjected to NFGM.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["450"]}
{"title": "Performance Analysis of OFDM Based RoF System\n", "abstract": " The growth of wireless data systems is seen in the many new standards which have recently been developed or currently in under development. The two major development trends of communication are broadband and wireless, and the existing wireless communication system cannot carry high-speed multimedia service signals because of limited bandwidth, so how to realize high-speed wireless access has become a key problem. The continuing increase in customer demand for broadband applications coupled with mobile cellular and personal communications has also becoming a global phenomenon. One of the solutions is radio over fiber (RoF), alternatively known as Hybrid Fibre Radio (HFR), where millimeter-wave (mm-wave) or microwave signals at the carrier frequency are delivered over an optical network from a central station (CS) to base stations (BSs). This technology combines two media: radio and optical. Typically, the optical part is used to interconnect a central radio processing facility with a remote radio antenna, the latter providing coverage to wireless broadband users. Some of the advantages offered by a RoF system include low signal attenuation (in the fibre), improved coverage and system performance, enhanced capacity, low RF power dissipation, reduced complexity due to the centralised processing of RF signals and ultimately low system costs. In recent, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is an emerging technology for high data rates at particular new and upcoming mobile generation and fixed broadband.

There are several theoretical reasons which favor the technique of using multiple channels for ERP over a single channel. Most important is the possibility of, asymmetries in generator activity of a particular waveform. If there are asymmetries of the generator activity, it will result in topographical deviations of the P300 peak from the midline. Here, we provide support for multiple channel recording on the basis of our study results. Methodlogy: This was a cross-sectional case-control study. 17 normal individuals were recruited for the study. The auditory ERP data were collected using the auditory oddball P300 paradigm. The peak amplitudes obtained in CZ was compared with independent samples t-test with the peak amplitudes in all other electrodes. Results: There were significant differences between the amplitudes of P300 as recorded from CZ compared to the amplitudes of other electrodes. In line with the idea popular in literature, the maximum amplitude was found in the midline region which was however located at the parietal regions rather than the central region. Discussion: Our results show two important findings which should be taken into account while interpreting the active electrode as the major source of P300 recording. The first and foremost seems to be that the standard deviations and variances of the amplitude values that we observed were very high, sometimes even more than the mean values.

There is a need to understand the normal physiological changes in the individual in response to a stressor. Serum cortisol and state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) are most commonly used to assess the quality and quantity of stress in an individual. STAI measures the quantum of stress the person perceives. Serum cortisol measures the neurophysiological response to the stressor. Relationship between STAI and serum cortisol is studied in order assess the stress pattern and its response in the individuals. Materials and Methods: A total of 80 subjects in the age group of 18-24 were included in this study. STAI Questionnaire was administered. Serum cortisol assay was done. Subjects were divided into three groups based on the STAI score. The pattern of serum cortisol was studied in all the groups.Results: The mean age of the participants was 21.5\u00b12.07 years with a range of 18-24 years. The mean values of body mass index were 21.85\u00b14.05 kg/m2, serum cortisol was 130.07\u00b164.38 ng/dl, and STAI scores were 46.81\u00b16.15, respectively.

Several models have been proposed over in last four decades. Classical duplication-degeneration-complementation/subfunctionalization models do not invoke positive selection; however, this can impose higher rates for retaining duplicate genes in small populations only. Rodents have higher retentions rates duplicate genes and only few losses in comparison to humans which corroborates that positive selections are more instrumental players than previously assumed [18].Suppose a condition where two redundant gene copies were retained in the genome without significant functional divergence, this can covenant increase genetic robustness against harmful mutations in the concerned species (Figure 1C). Within multigene families descended from a common ancestor, these genes possess similarities at the DNA level, which implies for similar functions [19, 20]. The tandemly duplicated genes which generate several paralogous on the same chromosomal fragments (like serpin paralogous in the human chromosomes 6-18 [3] and 14 [4]), exhibit the case of concerted evolution. Within this concept, all genes in a given group evolve coordinately by homologous recombination, which vanguard into gene conversion (Figure 1D). These paralogs share higher sequence identities like anti-trypsin-like gene cluster in the human chromosome 14 [4].

India s annual production of phosphate from the land-based mines is far less than the domestic needs and thus depends largely on imports. The domestic demand of phosphorite warrants detailed investigations with the aid of high-resolution multibeam bathymetric survey followed by systematic sampling at target locations from selective sectors of the present-day oceans off western margin of India. The present study has yielded phosphorites/phosphatic concretions from two topographic domains of western margin of India, while the third domain was found to be devoid of phosphatic materials. Detailed multibeam bathymetric study of these sites indicates that amongst several factors that controlled phosphorite formation, seabed morphology appears to have played a vital role in phosphatic enrichment in these areas.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["450"]}

{"title": "Modelling and analysis of wireless communication over networks-on-chip\n", "abstract": " Multi-cores and many-cores are becoming the next computing platform with the interconnection bus becoming the new bottleneck. The bus is replaced by a Network-on-Chip (NoC) for scalability issues. However, the NoC still being RC-wire based links, there are limitations in the transmission speed. As we reach far more denser integration, the problem is likely to aggravate. Wireless interconnects holds a good promise to solve the speed and scalability issue. In this paper we analyse the improvements offered by wireless links as shortcut interconnects in wormhole based NoCs. We measure latency and throughput and observe their variations by altering congestion level, represented by Packet Injection Rate (PIR) and channel count. Using a simple Media Access Control (MAC) protocol we analyse the effect of number of channels and traffic, demonstrating the advantage of using wireless NoC.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["450"]}
{"title": "WiseMAC protocol for wireless sensor network-an energy efficient protocol\n", "abstract": " Wireless Sensor Networks are very useful in case of distance or unreachable areas. WSN are having large number of nodes (sensors) which are randomly distributed. These sensors are primarily used to process data and connected through wireless channel. The processing, transmission and reception and sensing the channel need power. This power is given to nodes by their batteries. So the problem in front of us is to reduce power consumption by these nodes. Some areas are very far and some areas are unreachable like valley or hill areas. Thus it is not possible in some cases to replace or change the battery. Our focus is to make a protocol which makes these nodes work with lesser battery power. There are so many MAC layer protocols which work for this purpose but they too are not energy efficient. These protocols are based on CSMA. Here in this report we have proposed WiseMAC protocol which is also based on CSMA but with preamble sampling. This protocol shows very good reduction in power consumption. For this we used some more schemes with the existing WiseMAC protocol, these schemes are more bit and extended more bit. Our WiseMAC protocol is an asynchronous protocol and works very well in case of adaptive traffic conditions. To make WiseMAC energy efficient we are here focusing to reduce preamble sampling duration and this done with reducing duty cycle and contention window of our proposed protocol. As we have implemented Adaptive WiseMAC protocol so we are focusing that this will help in body are network (BAN) for medical purposes.

The results showed that grain yield, yield attributing characters and nutrients uptake increased with the increasing levels of N, P and K (N120 P80 K40). The minimum values were observed at control (unfertilized), which were at par to nitrogen alone (N120) and N120 K40 treatment. Nitrogen responded only in presence of phosphorus and vise-versa, while potassium responded along with nitrogen and phosphorus both. The regular application of nitrogen fertilizer (80 and 120 kg/ha) reduced the soil pH but maintain soil available N over a span of 36 years. The regular application of phospatic fertilizer (single super phosphate)@ 80 kg P2O5/ha increased soil available P by about 3 fold from its initial level in 36 years. A significant increase in available K was also found by regular application of potassium (40 kg K2O/ha) over the years.

To date, the exact etiology of ophthalmoplegic migraine remains unknown. We report a 9-year-old girl with typical clinical features of ophthalmoplegic migraine. She presented to us shortly after onset of her fifth episode. The initial episodes of opthalmoplegia used to last for about 2-3 months with gradual and complete recovery. Brain MRI with contrast study revealed a thickened, enhancing right oculomotor nerve in the cisternal segment during the acute phase of ophthalmoplegia. She was treated with steroid for two weeks as well as with divalproex sodium for prophylaxis of migraine. There was complete recovery of ophthalmoplegia after four weeks of treatment with complete resolution of third nerve enhancement on repeat imaging. There were no further episodes of ophthalmoplegia within a follow up period of one year. Steroid therapy may hasten the recovery of ophthalmoplegia and prophylactic treatment of migraine may reduce the episodes and severity of ophthalmoplegic migraine.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["450"]}

Among all the joints in the human body, the knee joint is a very important joint for daily life. Diseases such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis may lead to a situation where the knee cartilage is damaged, causing pain and deformation in the joint. When conservative treatments of such conditions of the knee fail, surgical treatments are applied. Such treatments include partial or complete replacement of the joints with an artificial joint. This kind of procedure is called knee arthroplasty. A complete replacement of the tibia and femoral condyles of a knee is called total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

{"title": "Organization of Energy Efficiency in Wireless Sensor Network\n", "abstract": " Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has specific constraints and stringent requirements in contrast to traditional wired and wireless computer networks. Due to the wide potential applications of wireless sensor networks, this topic has attracted great attention. The strict energy constraints of sensor nodes result in great challenges for energy efficiency. Because of limitation in energy and selection of best route, for the purpose of increasing network remaining energy a node with most energy level will be used for transmission of data. The most part of energy in nodes is wasted on radio transmission, thus decreasing number of transferred packets in the network will result in increase in node and network lifetimes. This paper proposes an energy-efficient organization method. The organization of wireless sensor networks is formulated for target tracking. The destination route is achieved by collaborative sensing with multi-sensor fusion. The sensor nodes implement sensing tasks are awakened in a distributed manner. Thus, by using this we can be minimized energy consumption in wireless sensor network.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["450"]}

{"title": "Phylogenetic Suystematics\n", "abstract": " At the outset, it is very important that the meanings of certain terms such as phylogeny, systematics, and taxonomy are clearly understood. This will help in getting into the nuances of phylogenetic systematics. The term phylogeny was coined by Ernst Haeckel in 1866. It refers to the history of a species and its relationships to other species (in Greek phyl refers to tribe and gen refers to origin or descent). There is no general agreement as to the definition of systematics and taxonomy. Capricious use of these and related terms is a very old plague of the discipline. The early documented use of the term systematics (as systematic botany) can be traced back, at least, as far back as Linnaeus (Stuessy 1990).The Swiss botanist de Candolle (1813), in the herbarium at Geneva, coined the term taxonomy (as taxonomie) to refer to the theory of plant classification. From this time until the publication of Darwin\u2019s Origin of Species (1859), the terms taxonomy and systematics were used synonymously, although the latter was used much more frequently. Authors like Mason (1950) have treated taxonomy as a broad field of biological investigation involving four main concerns: systematics (comparative study of the organisms), taxonomic system, nomenclature, and documentation. Simpson (1961), Heywood (1967), Mayr (1969), and Ross (1974) treated \u201csystematics\u201d as a more inclusive field covering the scientific study of the diversity and differentiation of organisms and the relationships existing between them.

The presence of Non Line of Sight (NLOS) channel condition between the sensor nodes is one of the major hindrances for accurate ranging and localization in WSN. As a result there is a need for low complexity and robust algorithm which can effectively identify the channel condition and help in further mitigation of NLOS rangingerrors byusing an appropriate method. In this paper, we have proposed a very low complexity algorithm that only requires the RSSI (requiring no complex external hardware) for estimating the channel condition which can either be LOS or NLOS.

Physicochemical characteristics of mucilage, such as solubility, swelling index, loss on drying, pH and viscosity, were studied and also microbial load was determined. The mucilage was evaluated for its granulating and binding properties in tablets, using guar gum as a standard drug. Mucilage was used in three different concentrations-4, 5 and 6% w/v. The granules were prepared by wet granulation technique. The prepared granules were evaluated for percentage of fines, average particle size, total porosity, compressibility index and flow properties. The properties were compared with Guar gum, which was used as a standard binder. The tablets were prepared and evaluated for content uniformity, hardness, friability, disintegration time and in vitro dissolution profiles. The tablets had good physicochemical properties, and the drug release was more than 85% within 3 h. The tablets prepared by using 6% mucilage as binder exhibited more hardness than by using 4 and 5% concentrations. Hence, 4 and 5% concentrations can be considered as ideal concentrations for preparation of tablets.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["450"]}

The variation of low frequency noise (also called current noise) and TCR of polymer thick film resistor, namely, PVC-graphite thick film resistor, with parameters such as high volume fraction and grain size has been studied. A model is proposed to explain the observed variations, which assumes that the texture of the polymer thick film resistor consists of densely packed conducting particles with a cavity at the center of the structure. Further, the effect of the cavity diameter of polymer thick film resistor on current noise and TCR is explained using the same model. The current noise of these resistors is controlled mainly by the average relative resistance fluctuations between the conducting particles and the number of contacts each particle has with its neighbors.

The investigation of electrical and optical properties of Se based chalcogenide glasses have been a subject of active research for both solid state people and electronic engineers for their applications as photovoltaics [1] and memory switching [2] materials. Many amorphous semi-conducting glasses, especially, Se, exhibit a unique property of reversible transformation [3], which makes them very useful in optical memory devices. Generally, conductivity of a semiconductor obeys the relation, \u03c3= \u03c30 exp (-\u0394E/kT)(1) where, \u0394E is called the activation energy and \u03c30 is called the pre-exponential factor. In most of the semiconducting materials, \u03c30 does not depend on \u0394E [4-12]. However, in some cases, \u03c30 correlates with activation energy \u0394E as, \u03c30= \u03c300 exp (\u0394E/kT0)(2)Where, \u03c300 and kT0 are constants for a given class of materials. \u03c300 is often called as MN pre-exponential factor, and kT0, as the MN characteristic energy. Equation (2) is often referred as MN rule or the compensation rule. This rule in case of ac conductivity has been observed by many workers in some chalcogenide glasses [13-17]. Recently, further MN rule in thermally activated crystallization and high field conduction is observed by Mehta et. al.[18-19]", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["450"]}

There are also problems on account of the noise produced by their continuous striking against the flame of the ventilators whenever the wind blows. One feels helpless in doing anything as these ventilators are far from the reach of one's hands. In the present work an attempt has been made to solve this problem by designing a mechanism which is operated by an electric motor through suitable drives and have the capability to shut down or open the ventilators automatically asper requirements. Afour bar mechanism is adopted as a driving mechanism and is kinematrcally synthesized using Freudenstein's equations with Chebyshev's Spacing of three accuracy points.

In addition, they are difficult to manufacture and operate, and are often unsuitable for measurement in small volumes of liquid or in soils. This limits their use to specialized laboratories under highly controlled conditions. The paper introduces a robust, self-contained, inexpensive MEMS based microelectrode sensor that can be used in situ environments. It deals with the design, analysis and performance of circuitry for a microelectrode sensor. The primary focus is to design, implement and integrate a CMOS circuit with the MEMS device to process, amplify and transmit the signal from the microelectrode to a measuring instrument. A current sensing circuit is developed for amperometric measurement with the microelectrode array. The magnitude of the output\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["450"]}

It is observed that the decay of photoconductivity is quite slow in these samples. A persistent photoconductivity, with an extremely slow decay rate is also observed during decay process. The magnitude of persistent photoconductivity increases with increase in illumination time, intensity of light and temperature of the films. The results indicate that some kind of photo induced structural changes occur in these samples, which are of reversible nature and have time constants of a few hours. Studies made on various compositions under identical conditions show that the persistent photoconductivity is minimum at 4 at. % of Indium.

The solution of the species concentration equation has been utilized to compute the mixing time in the RH ladle under different flow conditions. The numerical procedure and solution algorithm has been first verified by comparing the numerically obtained tracer dispersion curve, with the actual plant measurement, which agrees fairly well with each other. Mixing time for the RH process has been computed for different downleg snorkel size, snorkel immersion depth (SID) and steel velocity within the downleg and a non-dimensional mixing time correlation has been developed for the RH ladle taking the above three pertinent input parameters into considerations. The correlated non-dimensional mixing time equation predicts fairly well the computed result as well as the actual mixing time being observed in the plant.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["450"]}

The mean transverse momentum of charged hadrons (pions) increases by roughly 22%(15%) from peripheral to central collisions. As a function of (pseudo-) rapidity, the measured yields and spectral shapes are consistent with a Lorentz-boost invariant mid-rapidity region at least within| y|< 0.5 for all collision centralities. We compare our measurements of the integrated charged particle (pseudo)-rapidity density per participating nucleon-pair with two models representing different phenomenological concepts of particle production and featuring opposing parameterizations of the centrality dependence of the rapidity density. We furthermore explore the discriminating power of our measurement against the theoretical calculations in the light of uncertainties originating from the determination of the average number of participating nucleons.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["450"]}

At pH >7.4 the reverse reaction, generating octacyanomolybdate complex from the heptacyano species, is faster. At low pH, the ligand is protonated and less reactive; hence, the rate of reaction and quantum yield values decrease. The ionic strength does not affect the reaction rate, implying an associative mechanism for the photochemical reaction with dien, supported by the rate law.

Embryonic mortality appears to occur later (Day 25-40) in buffaloes [1] than in cattle (Day 8-15) and embryonic deaths have been found to be higher between 28-60 days ofgestation compared to fetal deaths after Day 71 in buffaloes. The term abortion is applied to pregnancy losses in buffaloes due to fetal deaths beyond Day 45 ofgestation [2]. Abortions are defined as a \u201closs of pregnancy\u201d in the period between 42 (rectal examination for gestation diagnosis) and 260 days ofgestation [3]. The losses due to abortion are significant and multifold. The first and foremost is the loss of the calf crop along with the production loss in terms ofmilk and meat\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["450"]}

It is very important that the relationships among the vertical and/or horizontal partitions of a relation and the information about data replication be explicitly modeled and dynamically maintained so that their integrity and consistency can be automatically enforced by a DBMS or a distributed DBMS. In this paper, we present an extended generalization concept and show how it can be used to explicitly model various types of data partitions with or without replication. Storage operation rules for these partition types are defined for integrity control purposes and rules for modifying the schema at run time, when partitions are dynamically created or modified, are also presented. Integrity control can be enforced by following the modified model and constraints of these partitions.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["450"]}

{"title": "Sugarcane flower-control studies with paraquat, gibberellic acid and sodium meta-silicate\n", "abstract": " Although the flowering of sugarcane is essential for breeding new varieties, uncontrolled flowering in commercial acreages presents a serious problem for sugar growers. Plants forming a flower do not produce a desirable stalk with regard to percent fiber and juice quality (16, 17, 25, 35). Consequently, major efforts have been made to prevent flowering by use of chemicals applied to the foliage. Some success has been reported with compounds such as maleic hydrazide, CMU, Diquat, Cycocel and Phosphor (21, 22, 26).An important limitation of chemicals having anti-flowering activity is their tendency to restrict sugar-forming mechanisms. An example of this is Diquat, a quaternary ammonium compound which disrupts photos3'nthesis and leads to major sucrose decline (5, 7). Humbert et al.(28) has suggested that these effects are relatively temporary and sucrose losses are more than made good by the flowering control thereby achieved. Heinz (27) expressed a similar view with respect to flowering control in Hawaii. Paraquat, another quaternary ammonium compound, has shown promise as a flower-controlling agent, but again a major sucrose decline is risked owing to its adverse photosynthetic and enzyme effects (2, 5). Controlledillumination studies have shown that Paraquat applied to cane leaves causes a sucrose decline almost identical to that produced by continuous darkness (8). Since many weeks will pass before the dead or injured foliage is replaced by a new green top, the ensuing restrictions against growth and sugar production constitute a serious expense for the grower. The same will likely be true of any chemical whose flower\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["450"]}

The greater part of the current proposal frameworks construct their models in light of community sifting methodologies that make them easy to execute.

In addition, proposal issue is frequently portrayed by the vicinity of numerous clashing destinations or choice variables, for example, clients' inclinations and venue closeness. In this scheme, this system proposed MobiContext, a mixture cloud-based Bi-Objective Recommendation Framework (BORF) for portable interpersonal organizations. The MobiContext uses multitarget enhancement systems to create customized suggestions. To deliver the issues relating to chilly begin and information meager condition, the BORF performs information using so as to preprocess the Hub-Average (HA) deduction model.
