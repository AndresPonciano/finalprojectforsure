First we clarified concepts in order to be able to exclude review articles on in-house projects, continuous services, the customer's perspective, and software product development, with the aim of providing valid results for supplier firms. We divided success criteria into project success and project management (PM) success, and, in seven articles, identified three success criteria from the supplier's perspective: customer satisfaction, short-term business benefits, and long-term business benefits. In contrast, no definition of software development project failure was found. Articles were found in seven different journals, showing that knowledge on software development project success from the supplier's perspective is fragmented.

Distance specifically impacts coordination, visibility, communication and cooperation within a virtual team. In these circumstances the project management of a virtual team must be carried out in a different manner to that of a team in a single-site location.

{"title": "Service science: exploring complex agile service networks through organisational network analysis\n", "abstract": " The discipline of service science encourages the need to develop alternative and more scientific approaches to conceptualise modern service network environments. This chapter identifies the opportunity to apply organisational network analysis (ONA) as a novel approach to model agile service interaction. ONA also supports the visualisation of a service infrastructure which sustains agile practice. The objective of this chapter is to demonstrate how the concept of agile service network (ASN) may be examined through an unconventional method to model service operations. ONA demonstrates the exchange of resources and competencies through an ASN infrastructure. Ultimately, this chapter provides a platform to develop an audit framework with associated metrics borrowed from ONA.

{"title": "Development and evaluation of a risk management capability model (RMCM) for the medical device industry\n", "abstract": " Software is becoming an increasingly important aspect of medical devices and medical device regulation. Software enables highly complex systems to be built. However, complexity is the enemy of safety [1], therefore strict adherence to documented processes is important within the domain of medical device software. Medical devices can only be marketed if compliance and approval from the appropriate regulatory bodies of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the European Commission under its Medical Device Directives is achieved. Medical device companies must produce a design history file detailing the software components and processes undertaken in the development of their products. Due to the safety-critical nature of medical device software it is important that a highly efficient risk management process is in place within medical device companies. The risk of patient injury from software defects is a concern due to the manufacture and deployment of increasing numbers of software-embedded devices [2]. In 2006, there were 325,742 reports of medical device associated injuries, deaths and malfunctions, which represents a 77% increase over 2005 [3]. The Center for Devices and Radiological Health take the matter of software related defects so seriously that they have recently made a significant investment in upgrading their \u201csoftware forensics lab\u201d, whose primary goal is to determine the root cause of the medical device software failures [4]. To reduce the risk of failure it is important that the software design process includes efficient risk management practices.

{"title": "AHAA: integrated assessment tool for plan-driven and agile processes\n", "abstract": " In the automotive industry, there has been significant growth in the amount of software required to ensure efficient and safe cars. Software development projects are also often troubled by time and budget overruns resulting in systems that do not fulfill customer requirements. Therefore, a strategy is required to combine reducing the long software production lifecycles (as required by time-to-market demands) with increasing the quality of the software developed for the automotive domain. Software process improvement (SPI) provides the first step in the move towards software quality, and assessments are a vital part of this process. Unfortunately, software process assessments are often expensive and time consuming. Additionally, they often provide companies with a long list of issues without providing realistic improvement suggestions. The increasing need for software in the automotive industry provides small-tomedium-sized (SMEs) organizations with a good opportunity to work as software suppliers for the large car manufacturing companies. In order to achieve this they have to provide high quality software in an acceptable timeframe and with low cost. Agile practices provide a mechanism to improve these aspects but are not easy to adopt as an approach for developing safety critical software [13]. On the other hand, while plandriven methods are seen as more heavyweight, they are more accepted in critical environments [31].

{"title": "Understanding the value of business process configuration\n", "abstract": " In order to deliver effective services, providers are being advised to 'innovate' their service delivery systems. Innovation in this context often refers to technology, technique or restructuring improvements. However, the difficulty is that in the modern organisation, service delivery is dispersed across a complex network of numerous departments and units. There are greater pressures on organisational service systems to deliver a higher quality and more efficient service. Management must attempt to develop a greater understanding of organisational process and where improvements may be made using business process management (BPM). The network approach ultimately makes service innovations more difficult to implement. Thus, the purpose of this study is to investigate how service innovation is managed across a service network. Specifically, we examine the effectiveness of a technique called 'social network analysis' (SNA) in extending business process management to enhance the manageability of network based services. This paper sets out to provide a state of the art literature review on the short fallings of our ability to understand what triggers business value. It examines the effects of our inability to understand the influence of business process behaviour on service innovation. It also provides a conceptual account of how SNA can be a powerful tool for managers to understand organisational network performance and service interaction (e.g. behavioural, functional, and structural).", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["368"]}
{"title": "Preparing for product derivation: activities and issues\n", "abstract": " Software product lines (SPL) advocates the development of applications by reusing shared software assets across a set of related products. Current approaches to the derivation of products from a product line has focused on handling the commonalities and variabilities of the shared software assets. These approaches have failed to consider the early phases of product derivation. In this paper we report on how we compared both industrial and academic approaches to the establishment of a product derivation project. Based on this research and our experiences, we have identified key activities and important issues that should be considered when establishing a product derivation project", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["368"]}
{"title": "Developing a product derivation process framework for software product line organisataions\n", "abstract": " Inefficient product derivation practices can greatly diminish the productivity gains expected from a software product line approach. As a foundation for systematic and efficient product derivation a better understanding of the underlying activities in industrial product line development is required. This research has been developing a process framework that comprises important tasks product line stakeholders have to perform during product derivation. The framework is based on both literature and industrial practice. In this report, the status of the current research is presented along with the observations obtained thus far and how these observations were obtained.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["368"]}

We present a modified Process Framework for Entrepreneurship Education focusing specifically on ICT. The primary components of the Process Framework are described (inputs, process and content, assessment and outputs) to assist in the design of relevant and targeted entrepreneurship education courses to create an entrepreneurial mindset for graduates in this sector. This Framework can be modified to suit courses focusing on other industry sectors.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["368"]}
