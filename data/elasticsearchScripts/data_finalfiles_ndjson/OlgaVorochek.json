{"title": "Identification and resolution of conflicts during ontological integration using rules\n", "abstract": " Integration of ontologies of information sources and consumers is an important phase in achieving web\u2010based interoperability. The present work describes an approach for identifying certain semantic conflicts while integrating ontologies of heterogeneous information sources. This paper is focused on the identification of homonymy and synonymy between elements in ontologies. In the present work the concepts of homonymy and synonymy are synonymous to naming conflicts and entity identifier conflicts, respectively, and partial synonymy is synonymous to schema isomorphism conflicts. The concept of the mask of interoperability is introduced for the identification of synonymy. The mask of interoperability is expressed in a declarative way as a set of rules, which can then be used for resolution of conflicts during integration of ontologies. As proof of concept, ontologies are implemented using the XML\u2010based\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["1276"]}

Moreover, the globalization of society causes integration and exchange of curricula built in different countries and educational organization. Due to the semantic heterogeneity of learning objects built within different cultural contexts, the delivery of these objects to learners is not effective. The presented paper is related to the development of a delivery technology based on the approach of context mediation, which improves the effective integration of semantically heterogeneous learning objects, adapts their contents to specific cultural contexts of learners and facilitates their delivery to such culturally diverse learners.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1276"]}
{"title": "Toward Assessing Data Quality of Ontology Matching on the Web\n", "abstract": " Nowadays the semantic Web is a leading Web technology, which enables semantic interoperability between structurally and semantically heterogeneous web sources and web users. Ontologies are a key of semantic interoperability and the main vehicle of the development of the semantic Web. One of the most challenging and important tasks of ontology engineering is integration of ontologies because with the purpose to built a common ontology for all Web sources and consumers in a domain. The present paper describes an approach of assessing data quality of ontology matching that allows evaluating correctness of mapping concepts and relationships from one ontological fragment to another. The purpose of correct mapping is to find identical and synonymous concepts and relationships in ontologies facilitating their integration to a common ontology, which serves as a base for attaining interoperability.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1276"]}
{"title": "Toward the Identification and Elimination of Semantic Conflicts for the Integration of RuleML-based Ontologies\n", "abstract": " Integration of ontologies of information sources and consumers is important for achieving web-based interoperability and thus for the success of the Semantic Web as a whole. The present work describes an approach for eliminating semantic conflicts with the purpose of integrating ontologies of heterogeneous information sources. The paper is focused on elimination of homonymy and finding synonymy in ontologies of learning objects (namely course outlines) and identification of (in)compatibilities between course descriptions. As a proof of concept, ontologies are implemented using the XML-based Rule Markup Language (RuleML), which has been combined with the Web Ontology Language (OWL), a W3C standard, to form the Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL). This representation in RuleML allows the ontology to be executable, flexibly extensible and platform-independent. The RuleML source\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1276"]}
