{"title": "Multiple-components weights model for cross-project software defect prediction\n", "abstract": " Software defect prediction (SDP) technology is receiving widely attention and most of SDP models are trained on data from the same project. However, at an early phase of the software lifecycle, there are little to no within-project training data to learn an available supervised defect-prediction model. Thus, cross-project defect prediction (CPDP), which is learning a defect predictor for a target project by using labelled data from a source project, has shown promising value in SDP. To better perform the CPDP, most current studies focus on filtering instances or selecting features to weaken the impact of irrelevant cross-project data. Instead, the authors propose a novel multiple-components weights (MCWs) learning model to analyse the varying auxiliary power of multiple components in a source project to construct a more precise ensemble classifiers for a target project.

{"title": "An investigation of imbalanced ensemble learning methods for cross-project defect prediction\n", "abstract": " Machine-learning-based software defect prediction (SDP) methods are receiving great attention from the researchers of intelligent software engineering. Most existing SDP methods are performed under a within-project setting. However, there usually is little to no within-project training data to learn an available supervised prediction model for a new SDP task. Therefore, cross-project defect prediction (CPDP), which uses labeled data of source projects to learn a defect predictor for a target project, was proposed as a practical SDP solution. In real CPDP tasks, the class imbalance problem is ubiquitous and has a great impact on performance of the CPDP models. Unlike previous studies that focus on subsampling and individual methods, this study investigated 15 imbalanced learning methods for CPDP tasks, especially for assessing the effectiveness of imbalanced ensemble learning (IEL) methods.

{"title": "An abstract syntax tree encoding method for cross-project defect prediction\n", "abstract": " In the last few years, with the development of deep learning theory, researchers have tried to introduce the method of artificial intelligence into the field of software defect prediction (SDP) to improve its prediction effect. To be fed into the neural network, the sample codes are represented as an abstract syntax tree (AST), and the AST is encoded as real numbers. However, in most cross-project defect prediction (CPDP) task, the method for converting the AST into a real number cannot effectively estimate the semantic distance between the ASTs, resulting in a significant reduction in training effects. To solve that problem, we present a new encoding framework, tree-based-embedding (TBE), to convert AST into real vectors and make the semantic gap between the ASTs measurable. To estimate the effect of this encoding method, we promise a tree-based-embedding convolutional neural network with transferable hybrid\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1984"]}
{"title": "Multi-label metric transfer learning jointly considering instance space and label space distribution divergence\n", "abstract": " Multi-label learning deals with problems in which each instance is associated with a set of labels. Most multi-label learning algorithms ignore the potential distribution differences between the training domain and the test domain in the instance space and label space, as well as the intrinsic geometric information of the label space. These restrictive assumptions limit the ability of the existing multi-label learning algorithms to classify between domains. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel distribution-adaptation-based method, the multi-label metric transfer learning (MLMTL), to relax these two assumptions and handle more general multi-label learning tasks effectively. In particular, MLMTL extends the maximum mean discrepancy method into multi-label classification by learning and adjusting the weights for the multi-labeled training instances.

{"title": "Transfer convolutional neural network for cross-project defect prediction\n", "abstract": " Cross-project defect prediction (CPDP) is a practical solution that allows software defect prediction (SDP) to be used earlier in the software lifecycle. With the CPDP technique, the software defect predictor trained by labeled data of mature projects can be applied for the prediction task of a new project. Most previous CPDP approaches ignored the semantic information in the source code, and existing semantic-feature-based SDP methods do not take into account the data distribution divergence between projects. These limitations may weaken defect prediction performance. To solve these problems, we propose a novel approach, the transfer convolutional neural network (TCNN), to mine the transferable semantic (deep-learning (DL)-generated) features for CPDP tasks. Specifically, our approach first parses the source file into integer vectors as the network inputs. Next, to obtain the TCNN model, a matching layer is added into convolutional neural network where the hidden representations of the source and target project-specific data are embedded into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space for distribution matching. By simultaneously minimizing classification error and distribution divergence between projects, the constructed TCNN could extract the transferable DL-generated features. Finally, without losing the information contained in handcrafted features, we combine them with transferable DL-generated features to form the joint features for CPDP performing. Experiments based on 10 benchmark projects (with 90 pairs of CPDP tasks) showed that the proposed TCNN method is superior to the reference methods.

{"title": "A suitable ast node granularity and multi-kernel transfer convolutional neural network for cross-project defect prediction\n", "abstract": " Cross-project defect prediction (CPDP) is a feasible way to perform software defect prediction (SDP) when lacking historical data. Recent CPDP approaches have employed deep learning techniques to better exploit the information from the program's abstract syntax trees (ASTs). However, the granularity of the AST nodes and the data distribution difference between projects may have negative impacts on the prediction performance, which many CPDP studies didn't take into consideration. To handle these issues, this paper explores a better AST node granularity and proposes a CPDP framework based on multi-kernel transfer convolutional neural networks. Specifically, for AST node granularity, we explore the difference of three AST node granularities and then compare the prediction performance of each granularity on several prediction models.

{"title": "Software defect prediction via LSTM\n", "abstract": " Software quality plays an important role in the software lifecycle. Traditional software defect prediction approaches mainly focused on using hand-crafted features to detect defects. However, like human languages, programming languages contain rich semantic and structural information, and the cause of defective code is closely related to its context. Failing to catch this significant information, the performance of traditional approaches is far from satisfactory. In this study, the authors leveraged a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to automatically learn the semantic and contextual features from the source code. Specifically, they first extract the program's Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), which is made up of AST nodes, and then evaluate what and how much information they can preserve for several node types.

To improve the performance of SDP, some researchers have used deep learning algorithms to extract the semantic and structural features of the program. However, in more practical cross-project defect prediction (CPDP) tasks, whether deep learning-generated features can be directly used should be explored due to the data distribution shift that usually exists in different projects. In this paper, we propose a Transferable Hybrid Features Learning with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN-THFL) framework to conduct CPDP. Specially, CNN-THFL mines deep learning-generated features from token vectors extracted from programs\u2019 abstract syntax trees via convolutional neural network. Furthermore, CNN-THFL learns the transferable joint features simultaneously considering deep learning-generated and handcrafted features by applying a transfer component analysis algorithm. Finally, the features generated by CNN-THFL are fed to the classifier to train a defect prediction model.
