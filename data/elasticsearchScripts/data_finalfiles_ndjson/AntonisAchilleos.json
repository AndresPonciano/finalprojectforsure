{"title": "Parameterized modal satisfiability\n", "abstract": " We investigate the parameterized computational complexity of the satisfiability problem for modal logic and attempt to pinpoint relevant structural parameters which cause the problem\u2019s combinatorial explosion, beyond the number of propositional variables v. To this end we study the modality depth, a natural measure which has appeared in the literature, and show that, even though modal satisfiability parameterized by v and the modality depth is FPT, the running time\u2019s dependence on the parameters is a tower of exponentials (unless P = NP). To overcome this limitation we propose possible alternative parameters, namely diamond dimension and modal width. We show fixed-parameter tractability results using these measures where the exponential dependence on the parameters is much milder (doubly and singly exponential respectively) than in the case of modality depth thus leading to FPT algorithms\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["1671"]}
{"title": "Modal logics with hard diamond-free fragments\n", "abstract": " We investigate the complexity of modal satisfiability for certain combinations of modal logics. In particular we examine four examples of multimodal logics with dependencies and demonstrate that even if we restrict our inputs to diamond-free formulas (in negation normal form), these logics still have a high complexity. This result illustrates that having D as one or more of the combined logics, as well as the interdependencies among logics can be important sources of complexity even in the absence of diamonds and even when at the same time in our formulas we allow only one propositional variable. We then further investigate and characterize the complexity of the diamond-free, 1-variable fragments of multimodal logics in a general setting.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1671"]}
{"title": "A complexity question in justification logic\n", "abstract": " Bounds for the computational complexity of major justification logics were found in papers by Buss, N. Krupski, Kuznets, and Milnikel: logics J, J4, JT, LP and JD were established to be \u03a3 2 p-complete. A corresponding lower bound is also known for JD4, the system that includes the consistency axiom and positive introspection. However, no upper bound has been established so far for this logic. Here, the missing upper bound for the complexity of JD4 is established through an alternating algorithm. It is shown that using Fitting models of only two worlds is adequate to describe JD4; this helps to design an effective tableau procedure and essentially is what distinguishes the new algorithm from existing ones.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1671"]}
{"title": "On the Complexity of Two-Agent Justification Logic\n", "abstract": " Justification Logic provides a refined version of epistemic modal logic in which the proofs/justifications are taken into account. As a practical tool, Justification Logic has the ability to model argumentation and track evidence in the full logic context, to measure the complexity of the arguments, to keep the logical omniscience at bay, etc. The complexity of single-agent justification logics has been well-studied and shown to be generally lower than the complexity of their modal counterparts. In this paper we investigate the complexity of two-agent Justification Logic. We show that for most cases the upper complexity bounds established for the single-agent cases are maintained: these logics\u2019 derivability problem is in the second step of the polynomial hierarchy. For certain logics, though, we discover a complexity jump to PSPACE-completeness, which is a new phenomenon for Justification Logic.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1671"]}
{"title": "The completeness problem for modal logic\n", "abstract": " We introduce the completeness problem for Modal Logic and examine its complexity. For a definition of completeness for formulas, given a formula of a modal logic, the completeness problem asks whether the formula is complete for that logic. We discover that completeness and validity have the same complexity \u2014 with certain exceptions for which there are, in general, no complete formulas. To prove upper bounds, we present a non-deterministic polynomial-time procedure with an oracle from PSPACE that combines tableaux and a test for bisimulation, and determines whether a formula is complete.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1671"]}
{"title": "Tableaux and Complexity Bounds for a Multiagent Justification Logic with Interacting Justifications\n", "abstract": " We introduce a family of multi-agent justification logics with interactions between the agents\u2019 justifications, by extending and generalizing the two-agent versions of the Logic of Proofs (LP) introduced by Yavorskaya in 2008. LP, and its successor, Justification Logic, is a refinement of the modal logic approach to epistemology in which for every belief assertion, an explicit justification is supplied. This affects the complexity of the logic\u2019s derivability problem, which is known to be in the second level of the polynomial hierarchy (first result by Kuznets in\u00a02000) for all single-agent justification logics whose complexity is known. We present tableau rules and some complexity results. In several cases the satisfiability problem for these logics remains in the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, while the problem becomes PSPACE-hard for certain two-agent logics and there are EXP-hard logics of three agents.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1671"]}
{"title": "NEXP-Completeness and Universal Hardness Results for Justification Logic\n", "abstract": " We provide a lower complexity bound for the satisfiability problem of a multi-agent justification logic, establishing that the general NEXP upper bound from our previous work is tight. We then use a simple modification of the corresponding reduction to prove that satisfiability for all multi-agent justification logics from there is -hard \u2013 given certain reasonable conditions. Our methods improve on these required conditions for the same lower bound for the single-agent justification logics, proven by Buss and Kuznets in 2009, thus answering one of their open questions.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1671"]}
{"title": "Closing a gap in the complexity of refinement modal logic\n", "abstract": " Refinement Modal Logic (RML), which was recently introduced by Bozzelli et al., is an extension of classical modal logic which allows one to reason about a changing model. In this paper we study computational complexity questions related to this logic, settling a number of open problems. Specifically, we study the complexity of satisfiability for the existential fragment of RML, a problem posed by Bozzelli, van Ditmarsch and Pinchinat. Our main result is a tight PSPACE upper bound for this problem, which we achieve by introducing a new tableau system. As a direct consequence, we obtain a tight characterization of the complexity of RML satisfiability for any fixed number of alternations of refinement quantifiers. Additionally, through a simple reduction we establish that the model checking problem for RML is PSPACE-complete, even for formulas with a single quantifier.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1671"]}
