{"title": "On single image scale-up using sparse-representations\n", "abstract": " This paper deals with the single image scale-up problem using sparse-representation modeling. The goal is to recover an original image from its blurred and down-scaled noisy version. Since this problem is highly ill-posed, a prior is needed in order to regularize it. The literature offers various ways to address this problem, ranging from simple linear space-invariant interpolation schemes (e.g., bicubic interpolation), to spatially-adaptive and non-linear filters of various sorts. We embark from a recently-proposed successful algorithm by Yang et. al. [1,2], and similarly assume a local Sparse-Land model on image patches, serving as regularization. Several important modifications to the above-mentioned solution are introduced, and are shown to lead to improved results. These modifications include a major simplification of the overall process both in terms of the computational complexity and the algorithm\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2344\n", "authors": ["906"]}
{"title": "Weakly nonlinear electrophoresis of a highly charged colloidal particle\n", "abstract": " At large zeta potentials, surface conduction becomes appreciable in thin-double-layer electrokinetic transport. In the linear weak-field regime, where this effect is quantified by the Dukhin number, it is manifested in non-Smoluchowski electrophoretic mobilities. In this paper we go beyond linear response, employing the recently derived macroscale model of Schnitzer and Yariv [\u201cMacroscale description of electrokinetic flows at large zeta potentials: Nonlinear surface conduction,\u201d Phys. Rev. E 86, 021503 (2012)10.1103/PhysRevE.86.021503] as the infrastructure for a weakly nonlinear analysis of spherical-particle electrophoresis. A straightforward perturbation in the field strength is frustrated by the failure to satisfy the far-field conditions, representing a non-uniformity of the weak-field approximation at large distances away from the particle, where salt advection becomes comparable to diffusion. This is remedied using\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "41\n", "authors": ["906"]}

{"title": "The use of fibre Bragg gratings to detect ultrasound in anisotropic materials\n", "abstract": " In previous work we have described the detection and location of damage in isotropic materials using fibre Bragg gratings rosettes to directionally detect Lamb waves. To extend this technique to composite materials it is necessary to understand the propagation characteristics of ultrasound in these materials as a function of their orientation with respect to the ply, and also the directional response of fibre Bragg gratings to them. Finite element modeling of Lamb wave propagation in a 0\u00b0, 90\u00b0 carbon fibre plate is described, as are experiments to detect these waves for various orientations of the source and alignments of the FBG transducers. Results of the experiments are interpreted with respect to predictions from the FE modeling and are shown to give good qualitative agreement.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["906"]}
