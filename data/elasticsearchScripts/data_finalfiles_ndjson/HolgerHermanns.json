In contrast to classical process calculi each atomic action is supposed to happen after a delay that is characterised by a certain exponentially distributed random variable. In this report we present the language together with its operational semantics, that defines Markovian labelled transition systems as a combination of classical action-oriented transition systems and Markovian processes, especially continuous time Markov chains.

Neither is the verification technology available, nor is it even understood what a formal, meaningful, extensible, and scalable testbed might look like for such a technology. The present paper is a modest attempt to improve on both the above aspects. We present a family of formal models that contain basic features of automated decision making contexts and which can be extended with further orthogonal features, ultimately encompassing the scope of autonomous driving. Due to the possibility to model random noise in the decision actuation, each model instance induces a Markov decision process (MDP) as verification object. The NN in this context has the duty to actuate (near-optimal) decisions. From the verification perspective, the externally learnt NN\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["1618"]}

In this paper, we stress the need to link and cross-fertilize these two areas. We point out how Machine Ethics calls for Machine Explainability, and how Machine Explainability involves Machine Ethics. We develop both these facets based on a toy example from the context of medical care robots. In this context, we argue that moral behavior, even if it were verifiable and verified, is not enough to establish justified trust in an autonomous system. It needs to be supplemented with the ability to explain decisions and should thus be supplemented by a Machine Explanation component. Conversely, such explanations need to refer to the system\u2019s model-and constraint-based Machine Ethics reasoning.

Automated test derivation and execution approaches often struggle with asynchrony in communication between the implementation under test (IUT) and tester, a phenomenon present in most networked systems. Earlier attacks on this problem came with different restrictions on the specification model side. This paper presents a new and effective approach to model-based testing under asynchrony. By waiving the need to guess the possible output state of the IUT, we reduce the computational effort of the test generation algorithm while preserving soundness and conceptual completeness of the testing procedures. In addition, no restrictions on the specification model need to be imposed.

They constitute a versatile modelling tool in many circumstances. The size of their matrix representation has a strong influence on computational efforts needed when analyzing these distributions. This representation, however, is not unique, and two representations of the same distribution can differ drastically in size. This paper explores an effective algorithm to reduce the size of the matrix representation without altering the distribution. This proceeds via a symbolic representation of the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the phase-type distribution. The algorithm is of cubic complexity in the size of the given representation.

Such model checking algorithms typically suffer from the state space explosion. In this paper, we address probabilistic bisimulation to reduce the size of such an MDP while preserving the probabilistic CTL properties it satisfies. In particular, we discuss the key ingredients to build up the operations of parallel composition for composing interval MDP components at run-time. More precisely, we investigate how the parallel composition operator for interval MDPs can be defined so as to arrive at a congruence closure. As a result, we show that probabilistic bisimulation for interval MDPs is congruence with respect to two facets of parallelism, namely synchronous product and interleaving.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1618"]}

Typical problems that are addressed by formal verification are:(i) safety: eg, does a given mutual exclusion algorithm guarantee mutual exclusion?(ii) liveness: eg, will a packet transfered via a routing protocol eventually arrive at the correct destination?(iii) fairness: eg, will a repetitive attempt to carry out a transaction be eventually granted? Prominent formal verification techniques are theorem proving, model checking, and simulation/testing. This special issue is devoted to model checking. Model checking is a system validation technique that has received substantial attention during the last decade. Given a model of the system (the \u201cpossible behavior\u201d) and a specification of the property to be considered (the \u201cdesirable behavior\u201d), a model checker systematically checks the validity of the property in the model. Models are typically nondeterministic finite-state automata, consisting of a finite set of states and a set of transitions that describe how the system evolves from one state into another. These automata are usually composed of concurrent entities and are often generated from a high-level description language such as Petri nets, process algebra, PROMELA [14] or Statecharts [9]. Properties are typically specified in temporal logic, an extension of propositional logic that allows one to express properties that refer to the relative order of events. Statements can either be made about states or about paths, ie, sequences of states that model an evolution of the system.

{"title": "Teaching concurrency concepts to freshmen\n", "abstract": " Concurrency phenomena are omnipresent in everyday computer practice and their understanding must therefore become a prime focus of contemporary academic education in computer science. This paper devises a concept suitable for teaching concurrency theory to first year Bachelor students in computer science. It is based on Robin Milner\u2019s Calculus of Communicating Systems, which is smoothly integrated in an introductory functional programming course. We report on a concrete instantiation of this concept in an introductory course held at Saarland University in winter 2005/2006.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1618"]}
{"title": "Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems: 12th International Conference, TACAS 2006, Held as Part of the Joint European Conferences on Theory and\u00a0\u2026\n", "abstract": " ETAPS 2006 was the ninth instance of the European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software. ETAPS is an annual federated conference that was established in 1998 by combining a number of existing and new conferences. This year it comprised? ve conferences (CC, ESOP, FASE, FOSSACS, TACAS), 18 satellite workshops (AC-CAT, AVIS, CMCS, COCV, DCC, EAAI, FESCA, FRCSS, GT-VMT, LDTA, MBT, QAPL, SC, SLAP, SPIN, TERMGRAPH, WITS and WRLA), two tutorials, and seven invited lectures (not including those that were speci? c to the satellite events). We-ceived over 550 submissions to the? ve conferences this year, giving an overall acc-tance rate of 23%, with acceptance rates below 30% for each conference. Congratu-tions to all the authors who made it to the? nal programme! I hope that most of the other authorsstill founda way of participatingin this excitingevent and I hope you will continue submitting. The events that comprise ETAPS address various aspects of the system devel-ment process, including speci? cation, design, implementation, analysis and impro-ment. The languages, methodologies and tools which support these activities are all well within its scope. Di? erent blends of theory and practice are represented, with an inclination towards theory with a practical motivation on the one hand and soundly based practice on the other. Many of the issues involved in software design apply to systems in general, including hardware systems, and the emphasis on software is not intended to be exclusive.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1618"]}
{"title": "On combining functional verification and performance evaluation using CADP\n", "abstract": " Considering functional correctness and performance evaluation in a common framework is desirable, both for scientific and economic reasons. In this report, we describe how the Cadp toolbox, originally designed for verifying the functional correctness of Lotos specifications, can also be used for performance evaluation. We illustrate the proposed approach by the performance study of the Scsi-2 bus arbitration protocol.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1618"]}
{"title": "A model checker for performance and dependability properties\n", "abstract": " Markov chains are widely used in the context of performance and reliability evaluation of systems of various nature. Model checking of such chains with respect to a given (branching) temporal logic formula has been proposed for both the discrete [8] and the continuous time setting [1],[3]. In this short paper, we describe the prototype model checker E TMC2 for discrete and continuous-time Markov chains, where properties are expressed in appropriate extensions of CTL. We illustrate the general benefits of this approach and discuss the structure of the tool.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1618"]}
{"title": "On the use of model checking techniques for dependability evaluation\n", "abstract": " Over the last two decades many techniques have been developed to specify and evaluate Markovian dependability models. Most often, these Markovian models are automatically derived from stochastic Petri nets, stochastic process algebras, or stochastic activity networks. However, whereas the model specification has become very comfortable, the specification of the dependability measures of interest most often has remained fairly cumbersome. In this paper we show that our recently introduced logic", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1618"]}
{"title": "Multi-terminal decision diagrams: a data structure for numerical integration\n", "abstract": " This paper introduces multi-terminal decision diagrams (MTDDs), a generalisation of MTBDDs [15], as a data structure for representing real-valued functions whose arguments are boolean or real variables. These new structures are suitable for numerical integration using quadrature formulas, like trapezoidal, Simpson and Romberg integration schemes. As an application example, we show how MTDDs can be used for a symbolic model checker for continuous-time Markov chains that are at the basis of contemporary performance evaluation and reliability analysis methodologies.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1618"]}
