Usually, simulation tools use mobility traces to build the network topology based on the existing contacts between mobile nodes. However, quality of the traces, in terms of spatial and temporal granularity of each entry in the logfile, is a key factor that impacts the network topology directly. Therefore, the reliability of the results depends strongly on the accurate representation of the real network topology by the vehicular mobility model. We show that five widely adopted existing real vehicular mobility traces present gaps, leading to fallible outcomes. In this work, we propose a solution to fill those gaps, leading to more fine-grained traces, which lead to more trustworthy simulation results.

The recognition of these commonalities is a starting point towards reconciling differences and leading possibly to better ways to interwork these systems and to develop new ones. There is therefore a need for capturing these commonalities that can be fulfilled by the use of the pattern concept, which has been applied to document recurring problems and solutions in software engineering. This research develops a method to extract such common problems and solutions and to document them as patterns. These behavioral and structural patterns are grouped into a pattern language in order to describe how they work together to solve recurring problems in the mobile communication domain. The examples given are related to mobility and radio resource management functions in second and third generation systems. The pattern language for Mobility and Radio R&barbelow;esource management (MoRaR) makes it possible to generate different requirements and analysis models for mobile systems.

In passive monitoring, a monitoring network needs to be deployed in addition to the network to be monitored, named the target network. The monitoring network captures and analyzes packets transmitted by the target network. An energy-efficient passive monitoring system is necessary when we need to monitor a WSN in a real scenario because the lifetime of the monitoring network is extended and, consequently, the target network benefits from the monitoring for a longer time. In this work, we have identified, analyzed and compared the main passive monitoring systems proposed for WSN. During our research, we did not identify any passive monitoring system for WSN that aims to reduce the energy consumption of the monitoring network. Therefore, we propose an Energy-efficient Passive MOnitoring SysTem for WSN named EPMOSt that provides monitoring information using a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) agent. Thus, any management tool that supports the SNMP protocol can be integrated with this monitoring system. Experiments with real sensors were performed in several scenarios.

In such applications, location is a key information to improve the interaction between user and services. Existing applications combine location with other context information, such as weather, user\u2019s activity, temperature, among others. However, developing context-aware applications is still a non-trivial task due to the complexity to implement context management. Additionally, existing context management infrastructures are too brittle to handle changes in the underlying execution infrastructure. In this scenario, this work proposes a context acquisition framework, which tries to reduce the development complexity of mobile spatial and context-aware applications.

In order to detect this kind of nodes, this paper presents a distributed and hierarchical diagnosis model based on comparison and reputation, which can be applied to both public and private grids. This strategy defines the status of a node according to its level of confidence, measured through its behavior. The proposed model was submitted to simulations to evaluate its effectiveness under different quota of malicious nodes.

Therefore, this work proposes specific heuristics to evaluate the usability of ubiquitous systems.

Solve this problem is even more important on applications such as the ones classified as universal control, because the main goal of these applications is to let the user control all smart objects available for him. Context-aware discovery services have potential to minimize this problem by applying contextual filters to determine which smart objects will be discovered and become available to user.

Among twenty-five papers retrieved from the systematic review, we found a high diversity of experiments. Some of them do not present the data clearly and do not apply a statistical method to guarantee the results. Besides this, other points related to the experiments are analyzed.

DSPLs present some interesting properties such dynamic variability and reconfiguration at runtime. The dynamic variability is represented by the definition of variants and context information. The reconfiguration at runtime is the process that enables the features activation and deactivation in a configuration product. Both properties are closely related to the requirements engineering and variability management, in the domain engineering life-cycle.

Even though many refactoring tools are now available for a variety of programming languages, most of them rely on their own, closed mechanisms for representing and manipulating source code information, which makes them difficult to customize, extend and reuse. This paper makes three contributions towards the development of more flexible refactoring tools. Firstly, it proposes an XML-centric refactoring process in which XML is used as a standard way to represent, analyze and modify source code information. Secondly, it presents a concrete realization of that process, in the form of a refactoring framework, called RefaX, which builds on existing XML-based source code models and processing technologies to facilitate the development, extension and reuse of refactoring tools. Finally, it demonstrates the applicability of the proposed process and framework through two RefaX-based refactoring prototypes for Java and C++, respectively.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1149"]}

However, the process of analyzing raw trajectories poses several challenges. In this work, we investigate one of the main tasks in this process of trajectory analysis: detecting stops from GPS trajectories. Stops can reveal interesting behavior aspects of a moving object such as its daily routine, bottlenecks in traffic jams, or visiting times of touristic places. Although there are some efforts in this direction, most current methods ignore the presence of noise segments, which typically occur many times in trajectories. In this sense, we present a method that exploits gaps in time and space to identify episodes of movement, stop, and periods where some classification is inconclusive, which we define as noise. In addition, our method does not rely on contextual information as opposed to some current solutions, which make our proposal also suitable for trajectories recorded in free space. We compare our method to the state of the art highlighting its advantages in terms of manipulating noise, supporting spatial filtering and being independent of external resources. Moreover, we conduct an experimental evaluation using a large-scale bus dataset to show the effectiveness of our method in a real application scenario.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1149"]}

This concern arises because of the risks involved in traffic sensitive information via wireless, since it does not limit the risk of attacks, as in conventional networks. Additionally, the trend in the use of sustainable practices advocated by the Green Computing imposes the need for designing flexible applications that seek to reduce consumption of resources such as energy. Thus, mechanisms for providing confidentiality of information passing over the wireless medium should consider the efficient allocation of computing resources. This is a key issue to be considered when designing secure mobile applications. Therefore, the protection mechanisms should balance the security level required in accordance with the consumption of resources allocated to provide it. The use of information that characterizes the current situation (context) can assist in this task. Thus, the use of appropriate protective security requirements of applications and combined with the context can identify situations where you need to raise or lower the security level in order to reduce the resource consumption of the device. This work proposes a Security Mechanism Dynamic Adaptation (MeSAD), focusing on confidentiality, able to adapt the level of security according to the context and reduce the resource consumption of mobile devices.

Thus, the standard IEEE 802.11s proposes to re-use the IEEE 802.11 medium access in a mesh multi-hop topology while using a routing protocol to create routes at the layer 2. IEEE 802.11s may exploit multi-channel multi-interface wireless routers to increase the through-put. In particular, the routing protocol must select carefully the forwarders to limit inter- and intra-flow interference.

{"title": "A statistical method for detecting Move, Stop, and Noise episodes in trajectories.\n", "abstract": " Detecting stops is an important task in trajectory analysis. Stops can reveal interesting aspects of a moving object behavior such as its daily routine, bottlenecks in traffic jams, or visiting times of touristic places. In order to record those traces, trajectories must be sampled and, in some cases, post-processed. This process from collecting raw data to storing them may vary according to the devices and applications that collect the data. Another important characteristic in many trajectories is the presence of noisy segments, a fact is often ignored by most stop detection methods. In this work, we present a method that exploits gaps in time and space to identify episodes of movement, stop, and periods where some classification is inconclusive, which we define as noise. In addition, our method does not rely on contextual information as opposed to some current methods, which makes our proposal also suitable for trajectories recorded in free space.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1149"]}

Therefore, the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK)[Abran et al., 2004], section on testing, states that testing must be driven based on risk; ie testing can also be seen as a risk management strategy.However, in the delivery of software products, the testing activity commonly does not receive the appropriate attention, especially because of time, resources and cost restrictions.

The main reason for that can be observed in the grid computing architecture, in which tasks are executed in resources shared by other users. Therefore, the main goal of this paper is to analyze trust models in ad hoc grid computing scenarios, based on a model that handles the detection of information about other stations. The results are analyzed based on the number of false-positives and false-negatives generated in punishments applied to stations that are detected as malicious. These results are obtained in simulations that shown the accuracy of each trust model analyzed. Moreover, it was possible to observe that two models obtained best results, decreasing the amount of false-positives and false-negatives.Resumo.

{"title": "Roaming of Mobile Devices Between Cellular IP Networks\n", "abstract": " Nowadays, Internet uses the Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) in the network layer. IPv4 assumes that computers are always attached to their networks without the possibility to communicate if they move to a remote location. Mobile IP is an extension to IPv4 that permits the once fixed terminal to \u201cvisit\u201d a foreign network and to maintain seamless communication without changing its IP number. However, Mobile IP presents difficulties such as the routing scheme and the need for registration of the mobile terminal with its Home Agent every time it migrates to a new network. Some proposals have been developed that aim to minimize the number of registrations when the mobile terminal is within a limited area. For example, Cellular IP applies mobility management functions of cellular systems within a network domain, but when the mobile device is migrating between two domains, the registration follows Mobile IP. This paper proposes a functional entity to locate mobile terminals when roaming between Cellular IP networks. The cellular infrastructure is used in this proposal to benefit from paging and passive connectivity features that are absent in Mobile IP.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1149"]}

The recognition of these commonalities is a starting point towards ironing out differences and possibly towards finding better ways to interwork different systems and to develop new ones. There is therefore a need for recognizing and reusing these commonalities. The concept of pattern, which is used in the software community to describe programming solutions to specific recurring problems, can be adopted for this purpose. This paper proposes an approach for reuse and validation of a set of solutions for mobility and radio resource management functions, solutions that have been identified as common among a number of second and third generation systems. The focus is on the early development stages. A visual technique called Use Case Maps (UCMs) is applied to graphically specify reusable requirements.
