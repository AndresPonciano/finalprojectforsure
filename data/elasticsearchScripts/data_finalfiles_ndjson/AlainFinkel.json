The impact of queued interactions between different specified processes is the main question addressed in the paper. First, the specification model provides decidable algorithms for analysing most questions of interest for the validation of a protocol, even in the presence of unbounded queues. Second, the impact of queues on the specified system is analysed for a non-trivial example consisting of a simplified Transport protocol. In particular, the impact of queues at the service interface is discussed. It is argued that a service interface is better specified with rendezvous interactions between the service user and provider.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1629"]}

In this paper, we provide an underapproximation for the general model by considering only runs that are input-bounded (i.e.\\ the sequence of messages sent through a particular channel belongs to a given bounded language). We prove, by reducing this model to a counter machine with restricted zero tests, that the rational-reachability problem (and by extension, control-state reachability, unboundedness, deadlock, etc.) is decidable. This class of machines subsumes input-letter-bounded machines, flat machines, linear FIFO nets, and monogeneous machines, for which some of these problems were already shown to be decidable. These theoretical results can form the foundations to build a tool to verify general FIFO machines based on the analysis of input-bounded machines.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1629"]}

Many properties (coverability, boundedness,...) can be decided using Clover, in a time proportional to the size of Clover. So it is crucial to design algorithms that compute it efficiently. We present a simple modification of the original but incomplete Minimal Coverability Tree algorithm (MCT), computing Clover, which makes it complete: it memorizes accelerations and fires them as ordinary transitions. Contrary to the other alternative algorithms for which no bound on the size of the required additional memory is known, we establish that the additional space of our algorithm is at most doubly exponential. Furthermore we have implemented a prototype MinCov which is already very competitive: on benchmarks it uses less space than all the other tools and its execution time is close to the one of the fastest tool.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1629"]}

We are able to answer optimally almost all the questions which arise, thus gaining much insight into old and new generalized Petri net decidability results. In a second part, we specialize our analysis to WSN de ned from a ne functions. Such a ne WSN elegantly encompass most Petri net extensions studied in the litterature. Again, we study decidability properties of natural classes of a ne WSN with respect to six computational problems. In particular, we develop a nontrivial algorithm computing limits of iterated nonnegative a ne functions, in order to decide the path-place variant of the boundedness problem for the relevant a ne WSN.

Then, I will demonstrate that a new behavioralism, based on digital and classical behavior and specific areas of the brain, is starting to emerge and produces psychological models that are used to know the thoughts and intents of the people observed, to better sell them stuff and predict their actions.

For non flattable counter systems, the verification of this type of property is generally based on the exhibition of a ranking function.

We provide a framework in which the verification whether a given function is a ranking function is decidable.

{"title": "Towards model checking pointer systems\n", "abstract": " The aim of this work is to investigate the possibility of using a counter machines modelchecker, FAST [2] for instance, for programs working over singly-linked lists. We define a CTL\u2217 logic which may express quantitative properties and shape properties on the memory managed by pointer systems. For this temporal logic, we show that the model-checking problem reduces to the one for counter systems developed in [5], provided an adequate translation from pointers to counters is given. This result serves as a foundation for a two-steps analysis of pointer systems that consists in translating them into counter systems and then, with the help of FAST, to verify safety properties. It remains to provide a good translation of pointer systems into counter systems. We obtain three categories of results concerning the translations:First, we show that, from the experimental point of view, the translation defined in [3] allows us to verify all well-known singly-linked lists case studies, and also some new ones that are not immediately verifiable by the other tools and methodologies. Most of the case studies yield flat counter systems for which we know by advance that FAST will terminate.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1629"]}

For almost all other extended Petri nets models containing a stack the complexity of coverability and termination are unknown or strictly larger than EXPSPACE. In contrast, we establish here that for Recursive Petri nets, the coverability and termination problems are EXPSPACE-complete as for Petri nets.
