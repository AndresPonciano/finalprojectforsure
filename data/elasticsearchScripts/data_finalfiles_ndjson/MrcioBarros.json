{"title": "A Simulation-Based Game for Project Management Experiential Learning.\n", "abstract": " The inadequate use of project management techniques in software projects can be traced to the lack of efficient project management education strategies, where learning by experience and motivation are key issues. An experiential learning process for project management requires an environment where students can act as managers without the costs and risks associated to an unsuccessful software project. Simulation can support this process, but simulation tools lack the look-and-feel of a real project development environment. In this paper we propose a simulation-based game that can be used to provide experiential learning to project managers. A System Dynamics model describing a software project, a simulator, and a game machine that handles user interactions and presents simulation results in a game-like fashion compose the game. System Dynamics limitations to support a game-like user interface are discussed. Also, we present an experimental study that evaluates an experiential learning process based on the proposed game.", "num_citations": "93\n", "authors": ["570"]}

Algoritmos de merge s\u00e3o amplamente utilizados para conciliar altera\u00e7\u00f5es realizadas em paralelo sobre artefatos de software. Entretanto, algoritmos tradicionais de merge em tr\u00eas vias, baseados no diff3, n\u00e3o s\u00e3o capazes de solucionar alguns conflitos por considerar apenas duas opera\u00e7\u00f5es b\u00e1sicas: adi\u00e7\u00e3o e remo\u00e7\u00e3o. Essas opera\u00e7\u00f5es n\u00e3o expressam precisamente a inten\u00e7\u00e3o do desenvolvedor. Al\u00e9m disso, esses algoritmos ignoram vers\u00f5es intermedi\u00e1rias, usando somente as duas vers\u00f5es cabe\u00e7a e a vers\u00e3o base na execu\u00e7\u00e3o do merge. Este artigo introduz uma abordagem baseada em buscas que visa minimizar o n\u00famero de conflitos gerados pelo merge f\u00edsico. Para tal, a inten\u00e7\u00e3o do desenvolvedor e o hist\u00f3rico de desenvolvimento s\u00e3o considerados na execu\u00e7\u00e3o de merge, encontrando sequ\u00eancias alternativas de merge que reduzam os conflitos.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["570"]}
