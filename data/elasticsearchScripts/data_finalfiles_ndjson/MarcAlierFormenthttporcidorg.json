{"title": "Opening learning management systems to personal learning environments\n", "abstract": " New ICT technologies are continuously introducing changes in the way in which society generates, shares and access information. This is changing what society expects and requires of education. eLearning is acting as a vector of this change, introducing pervasive transformations in and out of the classroom. But with Learning Management Systems (LMS) users have reached a plateau of productivity and stability. At the same time outside the walled garden of the LMS new transformative tools, services and ways of learning are already in use, within the PLE and PLN paradigms. The stability and maturity of the LMS may become yet another resistance factor working against the introduction of innovations.

In this context, a new set of tools, Web 2.0, offers a new way to understand the Web, in which the user is the centre. Further, users can cooperate in order to define contents.

One of the most popular trends on this sense is the use of mobile devices to learn, in which is known as mLearning.

The emergence of new technologies, new social trends, new pedagogical activities, new learning context, new content types, and so on; change the way in which we teach and learn. eLearning, understood as the application of Information an Communication Technologies (ICT), must be ready to integrate the new paradigms and consider the student as the centre of the process. This shift will mean important changes on the tools currently used, giving way to other tools that take into account the customization. These changes are expensive and should not consist only of replacing all previously existing but should seek to integrate new initiatives with those of success.

The field of learning analytics has been a common practice in research since last years due their great possibilities in terms of learning improvement. Such possibilities can be a strong positive contribution in the field of computational practice such as programming.

Hence, in order to help teachers in their assessments we propose a solution to categorize and understand students\u2019 behavior in programming activities using business technics such as web clickstream. Clickstream is a technique that consists in the collection and analysis of data generated by users. We applied it in learning programming environments to study students behavior to enhance students learning and programming skills. The results of the work supports this business technique as useful and adequate in programming practice.

Por eso, es fundamental que todos los Trabajos de Fin de Grado (TFG) de las ingenier\u00edas incorporen un estudio de sostenibilidad que analice su impacto ambiental, social y econ\u00f3mico. Este an\u00e1lisis es importante en todas las disciplinas de la ciencia, pero m\u00e1s si cabe en las relacionadas con las TIC, ya que pueden contribuir a mejorar significativamente la sostenibilidad en otros campos de la ciencia.  En este trabajo se propone una metodolog\u00eda para guiar al estudiante en la realizaci\u00f3n del an\u00e1lisis de sostenibilidad de su TFG. Consideramos que la existencia de una gu\u00eda al respecto es fundamental debido a la poca formaci\u00f3n en sostenibilidad que tienen los estudiantes. La gu\u00eda no s\u00f3lo proporciona ayuda a los estudiantes a la hora de realizar su proyecto, sino tambi\u00e9n a los profesores a la hora de evaluarlo.  La propuesta est\u00e1 basada en una matriz ponderada cuyas celdas contienen preguntas que el estudiante debe plantearse mientras realiza su proyecto. La matriz est\u00e1 inspirada en la matriz del bien com\u00fan de Felber y en el m\u00e9todo socr\u00e1tico, y es una evoluci\u00f3n de anteriores trabajos de los autores.  Como ejemplo de aplicaci\u00f3n de la propuesta se ha escogido la estaci\u00f3n de combate denominada Estrella de la Muerte, popularizada por George Lucas en la saga Star Wars. Se defiende que la Estrella de la Muerte podr\u00eda ser construida en los pr\u00f3ximos 100 a\u00f1os a partir de la tecnolog\u00eda existente actualmente, y que su construcci\u00f3n no s\u00f3lo podr\u00eda hacerse de forma sostenible, sino que contribuir\u00eda a mejorar la sostenibilidad de nuestro planeta y permitir\u00eda revertir el cambio clim\u00e1tico, alcanzar los objetivos\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["849"]}
{"title": "Wikis in Collaborative Educational Scenarios: Integrated in LMS or Standalone Wikis?\n", "abstract": " This article outlines a set of features that wiki engines require to successfully host collaborative educational scenarios. The authors explore multiple issues that deal with the use wikis with learning activities. One of the first issues to solve is software support for assessment methodologies. The second is choosing between using an integrated wiki engine inside the Learning Management System (LMS) or an external standalone wiki engine. Advantages and disadvantages from both options of this second issue are discussed. The different implications of each option as far as individual student assessment, feedback, and grading are concerned are also analyzed. Among the expected results, the most notable are incentives to incorporate wikis in the teaching process, significant enhancements in usability, as well as allowing teachers to provide more timely written feedback on their students\u2019 individual contributions on\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["849"]}
{"title": "Atenea exams, an IMS LTI application to solve scalability problems: A study case\n", "abstract": " In 2004, the Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya decided to change one of its critical and strategic information services: the online teaching support platform. An Open Source software, Moodle, was adopted and the previous proprietary software was abandoned. In 2020, the home confinement of the population due to the pandemic caused by COVID-19 has been a stress test for the entire university community, and very specifically by those responsible for providing the support of the online teaching support platform. The increase in activity and the prospect of the generalization of online assessment raised the concerns of possible scalability issues with the quiz functionality during the examination period. The solution applied involved using Moodle\u2019s IMS LTI interoperability features to deploy a high-performance version of the Moodle Quizz Module As A Service (SaaS), to plug-and-play within the university\u2019s LMS without drawing on its internal resources. This solution combined with a systems strategy, private cloud operations, internal communication and teacher training, solved this problem and successfully complete the assessment of the university course in a situation of confinement.

{"title": "A Service-based framework to facilitate the interoperability between personal and institutional learning environments\n", "abstract": " The application of the Information and Communications Technology to teaching and learning processes implies a revolution in the tools employed to carry out learning activities. Especially the learning platforms are one of most relevant tools; they provide services both for teachers and students to facilitate their work. However, such platforms are mostly focused on the course and the institution and no so much in the specific needs of the user. This means that other kind of environments are needed, the personal learning environments. Institutional learning platforms and personal learning environments coexist, so they should interoperate between them. In this work a framework approach is proposed. It uses using web services and interoperability specifications facilitate such integration. The architecture provides the functionalities to make possible that institutional functionalities were exported to personalized\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["849"]}
