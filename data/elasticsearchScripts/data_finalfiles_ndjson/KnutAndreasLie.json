Common for these equations is the prevalence of rough, or non-smooth, solutions, eg, shocks. Rigorous analysis is presented, showing that both semi-discrete and fully discrete splitting methods converge. For conservation laws, sharp error estimates are provided and for convection-diffusion equations one discusses a priori and a posteriori correction of entropy errors introduced by the splitting.

Although image analysis and PDE inverse problems seem to be-related at a? rst glance, there are many techniques used in one of these two areas that are useful for the other. One goal of the conference was to highlight some of the recent e? orts in merging some of the techniques for these two research areas.", "num_citations": "47\n", "authors": ["891"]}

Front tracking and a 2nd order Godunov method are used to advance the solution in time. Diffusion is modelled by piece wise linear finite elements at each new time level. To obtain correct structure of shock fronts independently of the size of the time step, a dynamically defined residual flux term is grouped with diffusion. Different test problems are considered, and the methods are compared with respect to accuracy and runtime.

{"title": "A multiscale two-point flux-approximation method\n", "abstract": " A large number of multiscale finite-volume methods have been developed over the past decade to compute conservative approximations to multiphase flow problems in heterogeneous porous media. In particular, several iterative and algebraic multiscale frameworks that seek to reduce the fine-scale residual towards machine precision have been presented. Common for all such methods is that they rely on a compatible primal\u2013dual coarse partition, which makes it challenging to extend them to stratigraphic and unstructured grids. Herein, we propose a general idea for how one can formulate multiscale finite-volume methods using only a primal coarse partition.

To obtain simulation models that are computationally tractable, it is common to remove spatial detail from the geological description by upscaling. Pressure and transport equations are different in nature and generally require different strategies for optimal upgridding. To optimize the accuracy of a transport calculation, the coarsened grid should generally be constructed based on a posteriori error estimates and adapt to the flow patterns predicted by the pressure equation. However, sharp and rigorous estimates are generally hard to obtain, and herein we therefore consider various ad hoc methods for generating flow-adapted grids.

Although this approach provides adequate accuracy in many practical cases, two-point discretizations are only consistent for K-orthogonal grids and may introduce significant discretization errors for grids that severely depart from being K-orthogonal. Such grid-distortion errors can be avoided by lateral or vertical stair-stepping of deviated faults at the expense of errors in the geometrical fault description. In other words, modelers have the choice of either making (geometrical) errors by adapting faults to a grid that is almost K-orthogonal, or introducing discretization errors because of the lack of K-orthogonality if the grid is adapted to deviated faults.", "num_citations": "32\n", "authors": ["891"]}

The pressure equation is solved using standard finite elements and multigrid techniques. The parabolic saturation equation is addressed via a novel corrected operator splitting approach. In typical applications, the importance of advection versus diffusion (capillary forces) may change rapidly during a simulation. The corrected splitting is designed so that any combination of advection and diffusion is resolved accurately. It gives a hyperbolic conservation law for modelling advection and a parabolic equation for modelling diffusion. The conservation law is solved by front tracking, which naturally leads to a dynamically defined residual flux term that can be included in the diffusion equation. The residual term ensures that self-sharpening fronts are given the correct structure. A Petrov-Galerkin finite element method is used to solve the diffusion equation.

The actual flow of liquid and gas phases occurs on a micrometer scale in the void space between rock grains. On the other hand, the hydrocarbon is typically carried in rock zones that are a few tens of meters thick but extend several kilometers in the lateral directions. The rock formations are typically heterogeneous at all length scales in between and phenomena at all length scales can have a profound impact on flow, making flow in subsurface reservoirs a true multiscale problem. Observing dynamic fluid behavior and measuring the pertinent parameters of a subsurface reservoir is difficult. Predicting reservoir performance therefore has a large degree of uncertainty attached. Simulation studies are usually performed to quantify this uncertainty. Reservoir simulation is the means by which one uses a numerical model of the geological and petrophysical characteristics of a hydrocarbon reservoir to analyze and predict fluid behavior in the reservoir over time. In its basic form, a reservoir simulation model consists of three parts:(i) a geological model in the form of a volumetric grid with cell/face properties that describes the given porous rock formation;(ii) a flow model that describes how fluids flow in a porous medium, typically given as a set of partial differential equations expressing conservation of mass or volumes together with appropriate closure relations; and (iii) a well model that describes the flow in and out of the reservoir, including a model for flow within the well bore and any coupling to flow control devices or\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["891"]}

Here we present a discontinuous Galerkin method for computing time-of-flight in discrete-fracture models of fracture-fault systems. Isocontours of time-of-flight are time-lines of porousmedia flow and give information about flow patterns, in particular for single-phase flow. Recent numerical results show that the discontinuous Galerkin (dG) method is efficient and accurate for solving the time-of-flight equation. In this paper, we use two simplified grid models to examine various approaches for the dG discretisation in fractured regions of the porous medium. Comparing the numerical results of the dG approximation with those from a streamline simulator, we demonstrate the importance of a sufficient grid resolution across the fractures, even though the widths of the fractures are very small compared to typical length scales of the unfractured parts of the reservoir.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["891"]}

For purely advective flow, the coarsening strategy has been shown to be robust, allowing for both accurate and fast transport simulations of highly heterogeneous and fractured reservoirs. Here, we consider advection-dominated two-phase flow, where the capillary diffusion is discretized separately from the advective and gravity terms using operator splitting. In particular, we investigate different damping strategies of the diffusive term to counteract overestimation of the diffusion operator on the coarse grid, this to ensure accurate diffusion modelling in the transport solver.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["891"]}
{"title": "Application of multiscale modelling concepts on the reservoir model for the Norne field\n", "abstract": " Multiscale modelling of flow and transport in porous media has become a hot research topic within the academic research community. Generally speaking, multiscale methods are numerical methods and strategies that aim to describe physical phenomena on coarse grids while accounting for the influence of fine-scale structures in the porous media. However, unlike traditional upscaling techniques, multiscale methods often provide a mechanism for also recovering an approximate finescale solution. In this report we make an effort to demonstrate some applications where multiscale flow solvers, used in combination with various methods for fast computation of fluid transport, may spur new ways of using flow information as part of reservoir planning and management. The multiscale flow solver considered herein is formulated using two grids. Reservoir properties are given on an underlying fine grid and the unknowns\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["891"]}

The method consists of two key technologies:(i) a very fast multiscalestreamline flow simulator, and (ii) a fast and robust\u2019generalized travel-time inversion\u2019method. The travel-time inversion is based on sensitivities computed analytically along streamlines using only one forward simulation. The sensitivities are also used to selectively reduce the updating of basis functions in the multiscale mixed finite-element pressure solver. Moreover, we propose a new streamline formulation that improves the accuracy of production curves and allows a drastic reduction in the number of streamlines required to calculate accurate dynamic data responses.The accuracy and robustness of our method is discussed using two 2-D test cases. Furthermore, We demonstrate the efficiency and utility of our approach using a highly detailed 3-D subsurface model consisting of more than one million cells and 69 producing wells, for which seven years of dynamic data are integrated in less than twenty minutes on a standard workstation PC.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["891"]}

We consider a multiscale formulation based on a hierarchical grid approach, where basis functions with subgrid resolution are computed numerically to correctly and accurately account for subscale variations from an underlying (fine-scale) geomodel when solving the global flow equations on a coarse grid. By using multiscale basis functions to discretise the global flow equations on a (moderately-sized) coarse grid, one can retain the efficiency of an upscaling method, while at the same time produce detailed and conservative velocity fields on the underlying fine grid.For pressure equations, the multiscale mixed finite-element method (MsMFEM) has shown to be a particularly versatile approach. In this paper we extend the method to corner-point grids, which is the industry standard for modelling complex reservoir geology. We consider two different subsolvers: a mimetic finite difference method on the original corner-point grid and a mixed finite-element method on a tetrahedral subdivision.\u00a0The versatility and accuracy of the multiscale mixed methodology is demonstrated on two corner-point models: a small Y-shaped sector model and a complex model of a layered sedimentary bed. In particular, we demonstrate how one can avoid the usual difficulties of resampling, when moving\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["891"]}

{"title": "An Adaptive Sequential Fully Implicit Domain-Decomposition Solver\n", "abstract": " Modern reservoir simulation must handle complex compositional fluid behavior, orders-of-magnitude variations in rock properties, and large velocity contrasts. We investigate how one can use nonlinear domain-decomposition preconditioning to combine sequential and fully implicit (FI) solution strategies to devise robust and highly efficient nonlinear solvers. A full simulation model can be split into smaller subdomains that each can be solved independently, treating variables in all other subdomains as fixed. In subdomains with weaker coupling between flow and transport, we use a sequential fully implicit (SFI) solution strategy, whereas regions with stronger coupling are solved with an FI method. Convergence to the FI solution is ensured by a global update that efficiently resolves long-range interactions across subdomains. The result is a solution strategy that combines the efficiency of SFI and its ability to use\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["891"]}

To predict the potential impact of discretization errors, we propose two types of error indicators. Static indicators measure the degree of nonconsistency of the two-point method at a cell level, and dynamic indicators measure how local discretization errors affect flow paths.

{"title": "Use of dynamically adapted basis functions to accelerate multiscale simulation of complex geomodels\n", "abstract": " A number of different multiscale methods have been developed as a robust alternative to upscaling and as a means for accelerated reservoir simulation of high-resolution geomodels. In their basic setup, multiscale methods use a restriction operator to construct a reduced system of flow equations on a coarser grid, and a prolongation operator to map pressure unknowns from the coarse grid back to the original simulation grid. The prolongation operator consists of basis functions computed numerically by solving localized flow problems. The resulting multiscale solver can both be used as a CPR-preconditioner in fully implicit simulators or as an efficient approximate iterative linear solver in a sequential setting; successful implementation of the latter approach in a commercial simulator was reported at ECMOR XV.

{"title": "Non-linear Newton solver for a polymer two-phase system using interface-localized trust regions\n", "abstract": " Models of polymer flooding account for several processes such as concentration dependent viscosity, adsorption, incomplete mixing, inaccessible pore space, and reduced permeability effects, which altogether gives strongly coupled nonlinear systems that are challenging to solve numerically. Herein, we use a sequentially implicit solution strategy that splits the equation system into a pressure and a transport part. Our objective is to improve convergence rates for the transport subproblem, which contains many of the essential nonlinearities caused by the addition of polymer. Convergence failure for the Newton solver is usually caused by steps that pass inflection points and discontinuities in the fractional flow functions. The industry-standard approach is to heuristically chop time steps and/or dampen saturation updates suggested by the Newton solver if these exceed a predefined limit.

{"title": "A study on how top-surface morphology influences the CO2 storage capacity\n", "abstract": " The primary trapping mechanism in CO2 storage is structural trapping, which means accumulation of a CO2 column under a deformation in the caprock. We present a study on how different top-seal morphologies will influence the CO2 storage capacity and migration patterns. Alternative top-surface morphologies are created stochastically by combining different stratigraphic scenarios with different structural scenarios. Stratigraphic surfaces are generated by Gaussian random fields, while faults are generated by marked point processes. The storage capacity is calculated by a simple and fast spill-point analysis, and by a more extensive method including fluid flow simulation in which parameters such as pressure and injection rate are taken into account. Results from the two approaches are compared. Moreover, by generating multiple equiprobable realisations, we quantify how uncertainty in the top-surface morphology impacts the primary storage capacity. The study shows that the morphology of the top seal is of great importance both for the primary storage capacity and for migration patterns.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["891"]}
{"title": "Accurate Discretization of Vertically-Averaged Models of CO2 Plume Migration\n", "abstract": " When CO2 is injected into a deep formation, it will migrate as a plume that moves progressively higher in the formation, displacing the resident brine. The invasion front is driven by gravity, and the upward movement of the plume is limited by a low-permeable caprock. Several authors have recently proposed to make a sharp-interface assumption and only describe the plume migration in a vertically-averaged sense. For inhomogeneous permeability, the plume migration is then described by a system of conservation laws with spatially discontinuous flux. If one disregards dissolution and residual trapping, the system reduces to a scalar conservation law with a spatially dependent flux function, which may exhibit different solutions depending on the entropy condition that is enforced to pick a unique solution.

Our study is motivated by the simulation of CO2 injection, and we therefore also develop methods that are particularly suited for solving compressible flow where one phase is incompressible. Altogether, we present four front-tracking methods that are based on a combination of solving ordinary Riemann problems and Riemann problems with discontinuous flux.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["891"]}
