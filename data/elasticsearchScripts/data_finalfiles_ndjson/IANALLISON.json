{"title": "Software process improvement as emergent change: A structurational analysis\n", "abstract": " This paper presents a framework that draws on Structuration theory and dialectical hermeneutics to explicate the dynamics of software process improvement (SPI) in a packaged software organisation. Adding to the growing body of qualitative research, this approach overcomes some of the criticisms of interpretive studies, especially the need for the research to be reflexive in nature.Our longitudinal analysis of the case study shows SPI to be an emergent rather than a deterministic activity: the design and action of the change process are shown to be intertwined and shaped by their context. This understanding is based upon a structurational perspective that highlights how the unfolding/realisation of the process improvement (intent) are enabled and constrained by their context. The work builds on the recognition that the improvements can be understood from an organisational learning perspective. Fresh insights to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "98\n", "authors": ["383"]}

Several studies have shown the importance of technologies to SMEs and the potentials of SMEs for economic growth. Using qualitative techniques we obtained and analysed data from ten SMEs that have adopted cloud computing as an IT strategy. These SMEs span across various sectors including finance, information and communication technology (ICT), and manufacturing in Nigeria, a developing country in sub\u2010Saharan Africa. We found that, contrary to the literature on cloud computing adoption in the global north, these SMEs are less concerned with challenges like security, privacy and data loss rather; they continue to show optimism in using the potential opportunities that cloud computing presents to them\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "83\n", "authors": ["383"]}

This paper presents an analysis of SPI across six software teams in the UK using a framework based on Giddens' Structuration Theory. Using a structurational perspective helps to draw out how the process improvements are enabled and constrained by their context. By comparing these across the six situations the key similarities and differences across the cases are highlighted. This work extends the existing literature by helping to identify the areas of risk that need managing in small SPI initiatives. The study shows the issues as pertained to the six contexts and actions in each case. The paper highlights how the context influences the outcome.", "num_citations": "48\n", "authors": ["383"]}

A review of how UK organizations have applied EIS was undertaken, the results from the study are presented and discussed. The findings show many successes in the implementation of EIS, such as the accessibility to managers of the organization's information resources. The monitoring of internal activity by middle management was identified as the principle application of EIS. However, to deliver their full potential, EIS need to be used by senior management to analyse the organization's strategic goals. By comparing the development methods in the study with the theoretical and experiential approaches shown in the literature, the paper shows how the techniques currently utilized could be improved to provide executives with better technological support.", "num_citations": "36\n", "authors": ["383"]}

We explore gaps between traditional agile practices and those required for enhanced levels of governance required by CMMI appraisal.

Our findings show that agile methods must be supplemented with pre-sprint planning, evidence recording, project metrics, team self-organization, process standardization, and process base-lining to support the CMMI appraisal. There are challenges around Agile compliance with CMMI Level 4 processes and misconceptions about agile methods precluding documentation of the rationale for design decisions.

{"title": "Case-based situation awareness\n", "abstract": " Situation-aware case-based decision support (SACBDS) systems comprise two distinct parts: situation awareness (SA) and case-based reasoning (CBR). The SA part keeps a finite history of the time space information of the domain and uses rules to interpret cues from the environment with respect to an individual user's context, and then anticipates future situations by performing statistical inference over historical data. The CBR part is the part that seeks to accomplish a particular task with knowledge of the environment from the SA component. This paper discusses the fusion of the CBR model and the SA model into a case-based situation awareness (CBSA) model for situation awareness based on experience rather than rule, similarity assessment and problem solving prediction.

Previous work has identified that such programmes are subject to resistance. A key challenge in the area is to understand the political issues in SPI change. However, at present there is little existing work in SPI related to the politics of improving. By adopting a view of politics as central to contemporary organizations, this paper reviews how we might understand resistance, how and why resistance occurs, and the implications of resistance for SPI. We provide a more detailed understanding of change management models (Katter's 8 steps and Prosci's Change Management Model) and their use in addressing resistance in SPI. It is argued that change management models can be used to accommodate the human factor of change in SPI.

{"title": "Utilising buffer management to manage uncertainty and focus improvement\n", "abstract": " Production planning and control (PP&C) systems hold two conflicting requirements in tension; on the one hand achieving an optimal plan and on the other ensuring reliable execution of that plan. Demand and process variability underlie this tension and drive the need to protect the plan through the use of buffering in the form of inventory, capacity and forward load. Simplified Drum-Buffer-Rope (SDBR) is a PP&C methodology that attempts to resolve this conflict by integrating the planning process with buffer management. This paper describes buffer management in the context of SDBR and how it has been applied within a fresh food processing company (FCF). The paper concludes that the approach is well suited to companies such as FCF where the market demands short reliable lead times in the context of high levels of variation and uncertainty. The results of this action research are discussed together with the wider issues surrounding the need to manage buffers in the context of PP&C systems.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["383"]}

This is particularly problematic for senior management and project managers where analysis of the actual data is not feasible.

This process requires prior knowledge of the ongoing environment and context. SADIM comprises two major processes: situation awareness (SA)-a cognitive process that assesses current situations and anticipate future situations in the environment; and, disaster management (DM) which is a decision-making process preventing, preparing, responding, and recovering for and from a disaster. One of the decision-making technologies used in current SADIM is case-based reasoning (CBR) CBR is used for the disaster management element only. Situation awareness process in current SADIM is carried out using domain rules, statistical reasoning and other methods. This paper therefore presents a method of using CBR to carry out both situation assessment and disaster management decision-making processes in SADIM, building on previous work focusing in SA alone. Using CBR for both processes provides the capability of using past experiences to understand the state of the environment and also solve specific disaster problems.

The results show a clear improvement in similarity assessment and problem solving prediction to prevent blowout.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["383"]}
