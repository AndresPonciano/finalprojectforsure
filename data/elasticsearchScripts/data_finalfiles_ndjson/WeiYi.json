{"title": "A Riccati-Bernoulli sub-ODE method for nonlinear partial differential equations and its application\n", "abstract": " The Riccati-Bernoulli sub-ODE method is firstly proposed to construct exact traveling wave solutions, solitary wave solutions, and peaked wave solutions for nonlinear partial differential equations. A B\u00e4cklund transformation of the Riccati-Bernoulli equation is given. By using a traveling wave transformation and the Riccati-Bernoulli equation, nonlinear partial differential equations can be converted into a set of algebraic equations. Exact solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations can be obtained by solving a set of algebraic equations. By applying the Riccati-Bernoulli sub-ODE method to the Eckhaus equation, the nonlinear fractional Klein-Gordon equation, the generalized Ostrovsky equation, and the generalized Zakharov-Kuznetsov-Burgers equation, traveling solutions, solitary wave solutions, and peaked wave solutions are obtained directly. Applying a B\u00e4cklund transformation of the Riccati-Bernoulli equation, an infinite sequence of solutions of the above equations is obtained. The proposed method provides a powerful and simple mathematical tool for solving some nonlinear partial differential equations in mathematical physics.", "num_citations": "140\n", "authors": ["1703"]}
{"title": "Swim: Synthesizing what i mean-code search and idiomatic snippet synthesis\n", "abstract": " Modern programming frameworks come with large libraries, with diverse applications such as for matching regular expressions, parsing XML files and sending email. Programmers often use search engines such as Google and Bing to learn about existing APIs. In this paper, we describe SWIM, a tool which suggests code snippets given API-related natural language queries such as \u201cgenerate md5 hash code\u201d. The query does not need to contain framework-specific trivia such as the type names or methods of interest. We translate user queries into the APIs of interest using clickthrough data from the Bing search engine. Then, based on patterns learned from open-source code repositories, we synthesize idiomatic code describing the use of these APIs. We introduce structured call sequences to capture API-usage patterns. Structured call sequences are a generalized form of method call sequences, with if-branches\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "134\n", "authors": ["1703"]}
{"title": "Independent measurement of the neutrino mixing angle  via neutron capture on hydrogen at Daya Bay\n", "abstract": " A new measurement of the \u03b8 13 mixing angle has been obtained at the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment via the detection of inverse beta decays tagged by neutron capture on hydrogen. The antineutrino events for hydrogen capture are distinct from those for gadolinium capture with largely different systematic uncertainties, allowing a determination independent of the gadolinium-capture result and an improvement on the precision of the \u03b8 13 measurement. With a 217-day antineutrino data set obtained with six antineutrino detectors and from six 2.9 GW th reactors, the rate deficit observed at the far hall is interpreted as sin 2 2 \u03b8 13= 0.083\u00b10.018 in the three-flavor oscillation model. When combined with the gadolinium-capture result from Daya Bay, we obtain sin 2 2 \u03b8 13= 0.089\u00b10.008 as the final result for the six-antineutrino-detector configuration of the Daya Bay experiment.", "num_citations": "83\n", "authors": ["1703"]}

{"title": "What good are strong specifications?\n", "abstract": " Experience with lightweight formal methods suggests that programmers are willing to write specification if it brings tangible benefits to their usual development activities. This paper considers stronger specifications and studies whether they can be deployed as an incremental practice that brings additional benefits without being unacceptably expensive. We introduce a methodology that extends Design by Contract to write strong specifications of functional properties in the form of preconditions, postconditions, and invariants. The methodology aims at being palatable to developers who are not fluent in formal techniques but are comfortable with writing simple specifications. We evaluate the cost and the benefits of using strong specifications by applying the methodology to testing data structure implementations written in Eiffel and C#.

{"title": "Is branch coverage a good measure of testing effectiveness?\n", "abstract": " Most approaches to testing use branch coverage to decide on the quality of a given test suite. The intuition is that covering branches relates directly to uncovering faults. The empirical study reported here applied random testing to 14 Eiffel classes for a total of 2520 hours and recorded the number of uncovered faults and the branch coverage over time. For the tested classes, (1) random testing reaches 93% branch coverage (2) it exercises almost the same set of branches every time, (3) it detects different faults from execution to execution, (4) during the first 10 minutes of testing, while branch coverage increases rapidly, there is a strong correlation between branch coverage and the number of uncovered faults, (5) over 50% of the faults are detected at a time where branch coverage hardly changes, and the correlation between branch coverage and the number of uncovered faults is weak.

The present system can achieve a transient acceleration in the water instead of long-time acceleration outside the water. The projectile can obtain a maximum speed of 30 m/s in about 200 \u03bcs by the SHPB launcher. The cavitation characteristics in the stage of acceleration and deceleration are captured by the high-speed camera.

{"title": "Shedding phenomenon of ventilated partial cavitation around an underwater projectile\n", "abstract": " A new shedding phenomenon of ventilated partial cavitations is observed around an axisymmetric projectile in a horizontal launching experiment. The experiment system is established based on SHPB launching and high speed photography. A numerical simulation is carried out based on the homogeneous mixture approach, and its predicted evolutions of cavities are compared with the experimental results. The cavity breaks off by the interaction between the gas injection and the re-entry jet at the middle location of the projectile, which is obviously different from natural cavitation. The mechanism of cavity breaking and shedding is investigated, and the influences of important factors are also discussed.", "num_citations": "34\n", "authors": ["1703"]}
{"title": "Stateful testing: Finding more errors in code and contracts\n", "abstract": " Automated random testing has shown to be an effective approach to finding faults but still faces a major unsolved issue: how to generate test inputs diverse enough to find many faults and find them quickly. Stateful testing, the automated testing technique introduced in this article, generates new test cases that improve an existing test suite. The generated test cases are designed to violate the dynamically inferred contracts (invariants) characterizing the existing test suite. As a consequence, they are in a good position to detect new faults, and also to improve the accuracy of the inferred contracts by discovering those that are unsound. Experiments on 13 data structure classes totalling over 28,000 lines of code demonstrate the effectiveness of stateful testing in improving over the results of long sessions of random testing: stateful testing found 68.4% new faults and improved the accuracy of automatically inferred\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "26\n", "authors": ["1703"]}

The CLIC study concentrated on a design of center-of-mass energy of 3 TeV and demonstrated the feasibility of the technology. However, the physics also demands lower energy collision. To satisfy this, CLIC can be built in stages. The actual stages will depend on LHC results. Some specific scenarios of staged constructions have been shown in CLIC Concept Design Report (CDR). In this paper, we concentrate on the main linac lattice design for E cm= 1 TeV CLIC aiming to upgrade from E cm= 500 GeV CLIC and then to E cm= 3 TeV one. This main linac accelerates the electron or positron beam from 9 GeV to 500 GeV. A primary lattice design based on the 3 TeV CLIC main linac design and its optimization based on the beam dynamics study will be presented.

Dynamic equations of the systems, which are index-3 differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) in the Heisenberg form, are established under the framework of Lagrangian multipliers. R-K methods combined with the technique of projections are then used to solve the DAEs. The basic idea of projections is to eliminate the constraint violations at the position, velocity, and acceleration levels, and to preserve the total energy of constrained Hamiltonian systems by correcting variables of the position, velocity, acceleration, and energy.

A logistic cell growth model was derived that differentiates between actively dividing, resting, and apoptotic cells. The rate of apoptotic cell formation was assumed to have a second order dependence on the normal cell concentration. The proposed mathematical model for metabolites included distinct terms that reflected the metabolic rates of growing and non-growing cell populations.

{"title": "Roles of UGT 1A1 gene mutation in the development of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in Guangxi\n", "abstract": " Neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is one of the most common conditions encountered by the practicing pediatricians. Although it is usually self-limited and benign, the condition is of importance because of the rare instances in which severe hyperbilirubinemia can lead to bilirubin encephalopathy or kernicterus. The uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT 1A1) gene controls bilirubin conjugation by determining the structure of the enzyme glucuronosyltransferase, which is synthesized in the hepatocyte. In the recent years much has been learned about the relationship between UGT 1A1 gene mutation and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. This study aimed to investigate the roles of UGT 1A1 gene mutation in the development of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in Guangxi. A total of 73 cases with hyperbilirubinemia and 31 healthy neonates were enrolled. UGT 1A1 G71R genotypes were identified by the (amplification refractory mutation system, ARMS) and direct sequencing method in all the neonates. To analyze the incidence of bilirubin encephalopathy, the peak (total serum bilirubin, TSB) concentration after 72 hours of age, and the possibility of TSB> 20 mg/dl of each group.(1) The frequencies of allele G71R were 0.1915 in this study, 0.2329 in hyperbilirubinemia group vs. 0.097 in healthy groups. The allele gene frequency of G71R in neonatal hyperbilirubinemia was higher than that in the normal group (P< 0.05).(2) Homozygous neonates had higher possibility to develop bilirubin encephalopathy and higher TSB concentration 72 hours after birth (28.57%, 23.12\u00b14.58) than the normal group (0%, 17.68\u00b12.69).

The constraint equations are accurately satisfied at each time step, and the problem of constraint violation is avoided. Finally, numerical results confirm the validity of present method by comparing the results with those reported in the published literature.

Based on the previous research work, the five different kinds of vector construction methods were summarized depending on their construction strategy. The suggestions have been proposed, aiming at specific plant expressional vector, to utilize the different construction strategy. Construction of multi-link in a serials of small fragment of vector cloning method recommended by one step methods, when building a complex multi-link fragments of the large vector using the complex constructing vector technology, in order to get the marker-free transgenic plants it can be used three T-DNAs vector construction methods. Adoption of the Gateway technology in doing functional verification, constructing very simple vector can be using the traditional method of construction though digestion and connection. The mainstream way of construction vectors now is to use Gateway technology combing with other means, the development trend of the future constructing vector will be on no enzyme connection.

{"title": "Selective sorption of latex membranes with ethanol-water mixtures\n", "abstract": " Latex membranes have recently found use in pervaporation separation. The sorption of water-ethanol mixtures to latex membranes was carried out on three types of latex membranes, poly(acrylonitrile-co-butyl acrylate) [P(AN-BuA)], poly(methyl methacrylate-co-butyl acrylate) [P(MMA-BuA)], and poly(styrene-co-butyl acrylate) [P(ST-BuA)], which were prepared in our laboratory by direct casting of polymer latexes synthesized by emulsion polymerization. These latex membranes all exhibit preferential sorption and permeation toward water. Both water and ethanol sorption to the latex membranes exhibited nonideal sorption, with water sorption being enhanced greatly by the presence of ethanol. It was shown that the solubility parameter theory did not give correct predictions for the preferential sorption of latex membranes. Better results were obtained by using the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1703"]}

Trichothecium roseum is an important mycoparasitic fungus with significant antifungal ability, but studies on chitinases of T. roseum were poor. Here, we report a novel chitinase cDNA isolated from T. roseum by PCR amplification based on conserved chitinase sequences. Southern blot analysis suggested that a single copy of the gene exists in the genome of T. roseum. The deduced open reading frame of 1,143 nucleotides encodes a protein of 380 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 41.6 kDa. The fusion chitinase expressed in Escherichia coli has been purified by single-step chromatography. It has a pI of pH 5.4 and expresses a thermal stability, but is insensitive to pH in a broad pH range. According to expectation, E. coli efficiently yielded a high amount of active chitinase.

For a Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) specimen, by means of the fitted functional relationship between unloading compliance coefficiency and crack length from a closed loop curve relative to the loading and unloading process, crack extension during fatigue precracking for a DCB specimen could be effectively controlled. In addition, after SSC preparation, the critical balance load due to the wedge inserts could be measured from the force-displacement curve recording the process of loading-wedge removal-unloading, the front of the crack propagation induced by SSC could be marked clearly by secondarily fatigue cracking, which is necessary for the determination of factor, K_ (1SSC).", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1703"]}
