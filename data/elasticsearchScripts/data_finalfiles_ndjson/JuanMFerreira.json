{"title": "Software development tools in model-driven engineering\n", "abstract": " Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) is a software development approach that considers the systematic use of models to devel-op software rather than using general purpose programming languages. The development of MDE based on Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) covers two stages. The first, the creation of a set of artifacts such as DSLs, model transfor-mation mechanisms, code generators. A second stage, where people do not necessarily with computer training using the artifacts created, develop applications simply because of the high level of abstraction allowed by technology. However, there are several obstacles that need to be overcome in order for this new approach to software development to be widely used. One of them, the lack of knowledge of tools and the development process with MDE. In order to minimize this problem, in the present work a categorization and description of the main envi\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1309"]}
{"title": "A Software Application for Collecting Usability Empirical Data about User Efficiency, Effectiveness and Satisfaction\n", "abstract": " This article presents a software application developed to collect empirical data in order to study and analyze the usability impact under the attributes of user efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction. The application is endowed with functional usability features implemented as usability mechanisms, which are recommendations of the Human Computer Interaction community with a high impact in software design. The Abort Operation, Progress Feedback and Preferences usability mechanisms are implemented in this software application. In experimental execution, subjects are guided by this application to accomplish different tasks. The application collects quantitative and qualitative data about users behavior while they are using this application with usability mechanisms being activated or deactivated. Data of time, number of clicks, percentage of completed task and answers to questionnaires are collected. Three experimental executions were carried out using this application and the collected empirical data have been proven to be useful in several researches by evidencing which usability mechanisms improve the user-system interaction. Finally, this software application contributes to the experimental software engineering research by allowing to collect empirical data for usability studies.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1309"]}
{"title": "Software development environments and tools in MDE\n", "abstract": " Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) is the notion that we can construct a model of a system that we can then transform into the real thing. The development of software in MDE using Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) has two phases. First, the development of artifacts such as DSLs and transformation mechanisms by the modeling experts. Second, people non-technical experts (domain expert or end user) using the artifacts created develop applications simply because of the high level of abstraction allowed by technology. Several factors are considered to limit the use of MDE. One of them, is the lack of knowledge the tools and the development activities with MDE. To support the MDE initiative, the present work makes a description of the theoretical foundations of MDE, also describes the main activities to build several MDE artifacts with some of the tools most known in this technology.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1309"]}
{"title": "Using experimental material management tools in experimental replication: A systematic mapping study\n", "abstract": " Context: In experimental software engineering (ESE), experimental replication is applied to validate results of an experiment. Much information and one version of the experimental materials are required for replication. Prior to the replication execution, all or part of the materials may require changes, producing new or modified versions of these, which should be incorporated into the material of the original experiment. There is a direct relationship between the increase in the number of replications with the increase of versions of the experimental material, which commonly causes confusion and disorder for experimental administrators. Objective: The aim of this paper is to conduct a mapping study to locate articles about the use of experimental material management tools in experimental replication in ESE. Method: We applied the mapping study to search, analyze and select published papers from reported\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1309"]}
{"title": "Evaluaci\u00f3n Emp\u00edrica de los Mecanismos de Usabilidad: Efectos sobre la Eficiencia y la Eficacia del Usuario\n", "abstract": " Contexto. La usabilidad como atributo de calidad comprende aspectos de eficiencia, eficacia y satisfacci\u00f3n del usuario. Existen varias recomendaciones en la literatura para construir sistemas software usables pero hay escasez de estudios emp\u00edricos que proporcionen evidencias de ello. Objetivo. En este trabajo se presenta un experimento verdadero con usuarios no inform\u00e1ticos para obtener evidencias del efecto de los mecanismos de usabilidad Abort Operation (MU-ABR), Progress Feedback (MU-PFB) y Preferences (MU-PRF) sobre la eficiencia y eficacia de los usuarios. M\u00e9todo. Se realiza un dise\u00f1o experimental donde se asignan aleatoriamente los sujetos a uno de los 24 grupos establecidos para la realizaci\u00f3n de una serie de tareas. Se recolectan datos de tiempo, n\u00famero de clicks y porcentaje de tarea realizada para analizar la eficiencia y la eficacia. Resultados. El estudio revela una tendencia a favor de la eficiencia y eficacia del usuario. Conclusiones. La presencia de determinados mecanismos de usabilidad evidencian mejoras significativas en la eficiencia y eficacia del usuario. Adem\u00e1s, el estudio parece revelar que la mejora en la eficiencia y eficacia depende del dominio del problema. En este sentido, un mecanismo podr\u00eda tener un efecto distinto en otros contextos, por lo que se necesitan experimentos adicionales para reunir m\u00e1s evidencias y confirmar estos resultados.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1309"]}
