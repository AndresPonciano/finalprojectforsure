{"title": "Application of ant colony optimization techniques to predict software cost estimation\n", "abstract": " In modern society, machine learning techniques employed to predict Software Cost Estimation viz. Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, Neural Networks, and Fuzzy Logic and so on. Every technique has contributed good work in the significant field of software cost estimation. The Computational Intelligence techniques also contributed a great extent in standard-alone. Still there is an immense scope to apply optimization techniques. In this paper, we propose Ant colony optimization techniques to predict software cost estimation based on three datasets collected from literature. For each datasets, we performed tenfold cross validation on International Software Benchmarking Standards Group (ISBSG) dataset and threefold cross validation performed on IBM Data Processing Service (IBMDPS) and COCOMO 81 datasets. The method is validated with real datasets using Root Mean\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["426"]}
{"title": "Classification of web services using JForty Eight\n", "abstract": " Web Services are emerging technologies that enable machine to machine communication and reuse of services over Web. They have innovative mechanism for rendering services over diversified environment. They promise to allow businesses to adapt rapidly to changes in the business environment and the needs of different customers. The rapid introduction of new web services into a dynamic business environment can adversely affect the service quality and user satisfaction. Consequently, assessment of the quality of web services is of paramount importance in selecting a web service for an application. In this paper, we employed wellknown classification model decision tree (J48) to predict the quality of a web service based on a set of quality attributes. The experiments are carried out on the QWS dataset. We found that web-service relevance function is most significant attribute in determining quality of a web service. The experiments results shown in this paper are about classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. The results in the paper on this dataset also show that the efficiency and accuracy of J48.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["426"]}
{"title": "Prediction of software cost estimation using spiking neural networks\n", "abstract": " In the modern competitive business world, any software firm has a success, to retain sustainability, the significant task is to estimate accurate process cost, i.e. completion time, resources, and required budget at an early stage of software development which gives success and sustainability of the industry, due to the competitive world, the project managers are estimating resources to hurry up, consequently low-quality precision. Eventually, companies are lacking in terms of metrics such as quality product, projects are completed within time, and budget. The development of the software scope is increasing in demand, the complexity in the development process also increasing. As a result, the inaccurate software product is delivered. Hence, there would be an enhanced model which estimates better planning, efficient manpower, and better resource allocation are vital in the early stages of the software\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["426"]}
{"title": "Review on intelligent and soft computing techniques to predict software cost estimation\n", "abstract": " This article, presents the Machine Learning, Intelligent and Soft computing techniques were applied to predict the estimated cost, quality, accuracy of software developed during 2000-2017. This article, gives a 95% amount of work brought from highly reputed conferences and journals viz. IEEE, Elsevier, Springer, ACM and 5% other journals, and conferences on the application of intelligent techniques. The review is broadly categorized according to the type of technique applied viz.(1) Neural networks (NNs),(2) fuzzy logic,(3) genetic algorithm,(4) decision tree,(5) case base reasoning and (6) soft computing. This article basically attention on the importance of benchmark datasets were used for training and testing of all intelligence techniques, type of techniques were applied, and which are the best evaluation metrics. After doing tremendous analysis, we observed that the benchmark data sets are COCOMO, NASA, ISBSG, DEHANAIS prominent datasets, and the evaluation metrics are MMRE, PRED is prominent which is based on total count is presented in Table 8 and 9. Furthermore, we found that Neural Networks technique was used recurrently by the authors and at the same time the techniques applied non regular intervals such as Hybrid, fuzzy logic, decision tree and evolutionary computation. This review is going to be useful for researchers as beginners as and it provides future directions. This would eventually be led to better predict, in the field of Software Cost Estimation.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["426"]}
{"title": "Application of Hybrid Techniques to Forecasting Accurate Software Cost Estimation\n", "abstract": " In a competitive business world, software development is a challenging task at the primary stage of the life cycle, due to in-complete raw material and dynamically changing environment of technology in the development of the software industry. As a result inferiority software product delivered to the customer. Hence, facing a lot of problems, and wasting of time. In fact, the software quality, the budget, effort and timeliness of the development of the software product are often crucial forms of an organization to achieve success. Moreover, the interaction between vendor and development process is important. A considerable amount of models has been proposed over the most recent 3 decades. One of them the common model is the Construct Cost Mod-el in this area, and it is quite straight forward method to estimate of effort at an initial stage of software development. Shockingly, the COCOMO strategy neglected to manage the certain nonlinearity and the connection between the attributes of the project effort. In this article, we propose the application of hybrid methodology for tuning parameters of the COCOMO model which give an accurate estimated cost for project development. The COCOMO 81, IBMDPS, COCOMO NASA 2 and DESHARNAIS are used to test the performance of the proposed model.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["426"]}
