In this paper, we propose that it is the mismatch between the very ambitious goals of firms and the means they apply that is the primary cause of their failure to obtain benefits from their ERP projects. In particular, seeking strategic benefits and treating the ERP project as a technical venture is bound to fail. Using four case studies of typical ERP implementations, we seek to explain why firms continue to struggle with integrated systems despite their best intentions and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["2229"]}
{"title": "Towards an ontology of innovation models\u2013A conceptual Framework\n", "abstract": " Management literature is renowned for producing concepts and models but few of these are ever translated into software-based tools-even though they could offer value to managers. Innovation models are theoretical constructions that attempt to abstract from reality a set of interesting features that are useful in describing, explaining, and predicting the reality of the innovation processes in organisations. But it is troubling to find that even the latest models emanating from the academic discourse fall well short of organisational reality. The objective of this paper is to recast the concept of the innovation model but this time from a strong theoretical base. We, therefore, start by presenting a conceptual framework for the innovation processes in organizations. From this we set out to develop an ontology that defines the words and sentences that can be used to represent innovation models. So we do not seek to present yet another model of innovation but instead we work towards a conceptually derived ontology of innovation models that can provide a foundation for future software-based tools. We suggest that computer-aided innovation modelling is an interesting area of research deserving of future attention.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["2229"]}

With anecdotal evidence pointing to substantially successful implementations, organisations are beginning to embrace the combination of these seemingly orthogonal strategies with beneficial results. However, with the two areas of research still maturing, the bulk of research is made up of anecdotal studies. Utilising mindfulness, a theoretical concept for understanding how organisations can achieve flexibility and reliability, this paper explores how to effectively integrate Agile and GSD methodologies. Incorporating a longitudinal case study, an operationalised mindfulness instrument is applied and triangulated with qualitative data. The findings depict an in-depth analysis of a GSD organisation and provide key contributions for practitioners. Furthermore, theoretical contributions of the paper include: (i) a comprehensive definition of mindfulness that incorporates shared understanding as a key component, and (ii) the development of relationships between the individual mindfulness components.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["2229"]}

{"title": "A novel approach to challenging consensus in evaluations: the agitation workshop\n", "abstract": " As researchers evaluate organisations, projects, and teams, there is a desire for a consensus from those within the organisations who are participating in the research. A common consensual perspective from a team appears to reflect an optimal state where those being evaluated have a common understanding of the current state of events within the context of their environment. The question arises, though, whether an evaluation finding consensus reflects the reality: there are a variety of reasons why a common understanding may be false consensus. Hidden behind this false consensus may be a variety of unaddressed issues which are actually the core of the problem. This paper proposes an evaluation method incorporating the principles of sensemaking and devil\u2019s advocate, where a consensus of perspectives is challenged before they are considered valid. This is achieved in a workshop where participants reflect on their own perception of reality and represent this reality in a matrix of influencing and relevant factors. The individual matrices are then combined and used to highlight disparities in the participants\u2019 perspectives through a single matrix visualisation. Discussion in the workshop then focusses on the areas, highlighted by the matrix, where differences of perspectives are identified. In effect, the consensus presented by those being evaluated will be challenged, and a new common understanding will have to be created. Problems such as groupthink can create a false consensus, and it is proposed herein that the workshop provides a mechanism for challenging this.

One key contribution of this research is a classification of Information Use, which includes three types: 1) Information Use as Access, 2) Information Use as Processing, and 3) Information Use as Outcomes. Leveraging this classification, we design and distribute an exploratory questionnaire. The results highlight that health professionals and eHealth resources are the most used and influential information resources for expectant\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["2229"]}

However, the findings from empirical studies are at best mixed and in some cases contradictory. This study investigates the complex relationships between these factors as well as the moderating role of project objects (e.g., design outputs such as personas, journey maps, use cases, prototypes, etc.) in small project teams. Our case study explores how knowledge-based interactions and object usage coexist in impacting the performance of a small cross-disciplinary project team tasked with deciding the requirements for a connected health information system.

Playing a dual role, as both a patient and researcher, the lead researcher reflects deeply on his ADR experience with particular emphasis on the problem formulation stage of creating a simple yet impactful checklist to aid memory recall of CF patients or caregivers during a medical appointment. Using Driscoll\u2019s model of reflection, a real-life unsanitized ADR experience is carefully imparted via a series of 4 vignettes, including 4 key learnings, which highlight the connection between a meticulous considered approach to problem formulation and truly effective outcomes. By providing this rich account of problem formulation within ADR, it is hoped that this reflection will help researchers to better understand the complexity of problem formulation in design-oriented research; to avoid making assumptions and becoming fixated on solutions; and to move instead to an end point where several possible ways of examining a problem have been considered, explored, and understood\u2014an end point where successful end results are reached through grit and determination. This paper advocates for the inclusion and portrayal of the actual realities or ups and downs of this dynamic and evolving stage of ADR, capturing the often-tacit knowledge of problem formulation and begetting a sense of realism and humanity to ADR serving as knowledge contributions in their own right. The lead researcher is the patient and researcher in this ADR project. This is my story!", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["2229"]}

Often the information imparted by the patient/carer is inaccurate due to their inability to remember their medical history accurately. Coupled with this, patients/carers often leave medical encounters unable to remember the information that has been imparted to them. These memory issues can seriously impede the doctor\u2019s ability to correctly diagnose and treat a CF patient and the patient\u2019s ability to adhere to the doctors\u2019 recommendations.

The top benefit\u2014better planning and forecasting selected by 47% of respondents\u2014highlights the forward-looking perspective that organizations have on initiatives. Organizations are beginning to realize that data analytics plays an important role in the decisions they make about their future. The second-highest expected benefit (numerous and accurate business insights\u201439%) could indeed support this role. This finding suggests that analytics will indeed provide more options, or at least different perspectives, on future plans of action. At the other end of the scale, it is interesting to see social marketing and Internet behavior (ie, clickstream data) ranking very poorly in the survey, with 10% and 4% of respondents identifying them as benefits respectively. With experts touting social and unstructured data as a major source of value, the lack of perceived benefits by respondents may suggest a lack of maturity in the area and a resulting lack of understanding on how organizations can realize the value. Furthermore, the lack of perceived benefits from fraud detection (6%) is also surprising. This may suggest that organizations have positioned Agile data analytics as a revenue generator rather than a cost saver. If indeed this is true, it is a very positive indication since recent research has shown that technology projects focused on revenue generation are more successful that those that focus on cost efficiency. 5", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["2229"]}

{"title": "The ISD process as a'live routine': The mindless behaviours of a narrative network\n", "abstract": " The objective of this exploratory study is to view an ISD process as a 'live routine' in an effort to identify the inefficiencies in the process caused by mindless behaviours. To meet this objective we present the findings from a sixteen month case study of an ISD organisation, examining the ISD process, the starting point of which is the requirements elicitation (RE) phase. A variety of data gathering techniques are used across two phases of data collection. The case data is organised as a narrative network (NN) of the live routine (ISD process) allowing us to understand the ISD process as a collection of functional events/patterns of action, generated by the enactment of the routine. The NN is showing itself to be a very powerful device to appreciate the knock-on impacts of vague and incomplete requirements (poor requirements elicitation) on downstream ISD process actions. The components of mindfulness are also utilised within the data analysis process to associate ISD process inefficiencies to mindless behaviours. In the findings of this research we generate an \u2018ostensive\u2019 rule that defines a valid sequence of action in the ISD process to overcome mindless behaviour. As a case study, the methods and results provide a means of comparison to additional cases of ISD organisations.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["2229"]}

It highlights the importance of critical adoption factors to the adoption of an agile method and illustrates the usefulness of a decision support process to determine the viability of an agile method for a specific software project. The paper describes the results of a series of workshops (two carried out in commercial software developement companies, and one with personnel from the British Minsitry of Defence) where the adoption assessment matrix was used to assess the suitability of agile methods in software development projects. A major benefit of the tool is that it guides discussion, concentrating the debate on the critical factors, applied to the individual project. These discussions proved to be as valuable as the output of the tool itself.

Along with this, the increased awareness that every business is a data business is beginning to take hold, especially in organizations engaging in data projects through the use of technologies such as Big Data, the Internet of Things and Advanced Analytics. However, it has been shown that there is a lack of understanding on how these projects will deliver value or benefit for the organization (LaValle et al. 2011). Or indeed, there is a lack of understanding on how to effectively manage and govern such projects and capabilities (Tallon 2013). In other words, implementing a data project does not automatically deliver business value, execute as expected, or make your organization data driven. To make your organization more effective when implementing data projects and developing a mature data capability, conversations need to be initiated between stakeholders and focus on the key problem to be solved by the data project. This focus is provided by answering six simple questions: why, what, when, who, where, and how. Yet, given the multitude of conversations that need to take place around the problem there are a lack of appropriate tools that can enable stakeholders to reach a shared understanding when planning data projects.

The Information Behaviour Analysis Tool (IBAT) is based on a theoretical model of information behaviour that is adapted from extant literature. We use interview and activity diary data from the first stage of a longitudinal exploratory study to create and demonstrate the tool. The IBAT can be used to map the information behaviour of new and expectant mothers from beginning to end. Three different search episodes are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the tool and to highlight different types of search strategies.
