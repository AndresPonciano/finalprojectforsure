{"title": "Toward an integration of Web accessibility into testing processes\n", "abstract": " The goal of this paper is to review the literature in order to understand the implications of accessibility testing processes with the objective to detect potential improvements and developments in the field. Thus, a brief review is presented of the fundamental test processes proposed by the International Software Testing Qualification Board (ISTQB) and the currently available literature about testing processes for evaluating the accessibility of web applications. The result of the review reflects an array of proposals to incorporate accessibility requirements and evaluation tools, but they do not describe a comprehensive testing process at each phase of the development lifecycle of accessible web applications.", "num_citations": "48\n", "authors": ["385"]}
{"title": "Getting the best out of people in small software companies: ISO/IEC 29110 and ISO 10018 standards\n", "abstract": " Managers of software small companies struggle to manage their software process. Therefore, for them realizing and understanding the impact of human factors on software process is even more challenging. Although human factors have been proved to have impact on software process, unfortunately they have been overlooked altogether. This paper proposes a holistic view of human factors on software process in VSE, focusing on the concerns and perceived shortcomings present. In order to identify and compare the human factors, the author carried out a systematic comparison of human factors. As a result, this study identifies the connection between software process defined in ISO/IEC 29110 and human factors given in ISO 10018 and its pertinence. In light of that, the author outlines first steps towards enhanced implementation of ISO/IEC 29110 standard based on ISO 10018.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["385"]}
{"title": "Towards an Engineering Process for Developing Accessible Software in Small Software Enterprises.\n", "abstract": " This study presents the results of a web accessibility evaluation performed on a sample of six software products developed by small software enterprises of two countries. According to the International Standard Organization (ISO), an enterprise, organization, department or project with up to 25 people is considered small. All the products evaluated presented accessibility issues, mainly lacN of HTML labels, alternative texts, and color contrast errors. These results showed there is a need in small software enterprises of an engineering development process that, taNing into account their constraints of staff and budget, includes activities for improving the accessibility of their software. We present the current state of an ongoing worN to define such process based on ISO/IEC 29110 that includes accessibility-related tasN in each of the following activities: initiation, analysis, design, construction, integration and test, and delivery.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["385"]}

An empirical software\u00a0\u2026\n", "abstract": " The competitiveness of software development companies depends on their ability to offer software products with quality attributes within approved budget and schedule. Most Very Small Entities (VSEs) that develop software do not see the benefits of implementing software standards. Consequently, they limit their potential to be recognised as quality software development entities. In this study, the authors present results obtained through the application of empirical software engineering in an experiment in which the ISO/IEC TR 29110\u20135\u20131\u20132 \u201cSoftware engineering \u2013 Lifecycle profiles for Very Small Entities (VSEs) \u2013 Part 5\u20131\u20132: Management and engineering guide: Generic profile group: Basic profile\u201d was used.

{"title": "E-Government Accessibility in Ecuador: A Preliminary Evaluation\n", "abstract": " The National Council for Equal Disabilities of Ecuador reports that there are 471,020 citizens with disabilities registered in the country. This represents the 2.75% of the population. From them, 290,148 are adult citizens who are potential beneficiaries of accessible public websites. In 2016, the Ecuadorian Institute for Standardization published the Ecuadorian technical regulation RTE INEN 288 that applies to web content published on public and private Ecuadorian websites that provide public services. The regulation establishes that the level of conformity A of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.0 must have been fully satisfied by 2018 and the level AA should be complied by August 2020. Soon, this regulation should be updated to the current version 2.1 published in June 2018.

{"title": "Evolution of Accessibility Metadata in Educational Resources\n", "abstract": " This chapter presents in a descriptive and visual way the evolution of accessibility metadata in educational resources, considering the different organizations and projects that contributed in investigations and establishment of standards for their implementation. The purpose is to justify the importance of its application in the optimal search of educational resources that responds to the needs and preferences of the user, considering the variability of learning and emphasizing the even greater requirements when dealing with students with disabilities. Accessibility is an issue that is developed optimally, and its adoption is increasing; however, in the area of virtual environments and digital educational resources, the use of accessibility metadata is still incipient and requires to be understood from its implementation of comprehensive manner and the suitability of its application.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["385"]}
{"title": "SPI Manifesto: una visi\u00f3n integradora de tres a\u00f1os de publicaciones\n", "abstract": " The importance of software in the field of information and communication technologies has turned the software development industry in one of the most influential in the world, and as a key to the economic growth. It has been proved that the Software Process Improvement (SPI) integrates more effective activities to create and implement software. In this context, the EuroSPI2 (European System & Software Process Improvement and Innovation) initiative released a Manifesto about SPI. SPI Manifesto has three values and ten principles concerning to people, business and change that give support to the organization. This paper presents an overview that integrates the publications related explicitly with the SPI Manifesto, in order to know the current experiences and the research carried out, thereafter to generate further research that supports this approach.Resumen: La importancia que tiene el software en el \u00e1mbito de las tecnolog\u00edas de la informaci\u00f3n y la comunicaci\u00f3n, ha convertido a la industria de desarrollo de software en una de las m\u00e1s influyentes en el mundo y en clave para el crecimiento econ\u00f3mico. Est\u00e1 demostrado que la Mejora del Proceso Software o SPI (Software Process Improvement) integra actividades que mejoran la forma de crear e implementar software. En este contexto, la iniciativa EuroSPI2 (European System & Software Process Improvement and Innovation) dio a conocer un Manifesto para SPI, el cual consiste en tres valores y diez principios que apoyan a la organizaci\u00f3n en lo referente a las personas, el negocio y el cambio.
