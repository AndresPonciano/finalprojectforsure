{"title": "Improved adaptive splitting and selection: the hybrid training method of a classifier based on a feature space partitioning\n", "abstract": " Currently, methods of combined classification are the focus of intense research. A properly designed group of combined classifiers exploiting knowledge gathered in a pool of elementary classifiers can successfully outperform a single classifier. There are two essential issues to consider when creating combined classifiers: how to establish the most comprehensive pool and how to design a fusion model that allows for taking full advantage of the collected knowledge. In this work, we address the issues and propose an AdaSS+, training algorithm dedicated for the compound classifier system that effectively exploits local specialization of the elementary classifiers. An effective training procedure consists of two phases. The first phase detects the classifier competencies and adjusts the respective fusion parameters. The second phase boosts classification accuracy by elevating the degree of local specialization. The\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "52\n", "authors": ["1087"]}

It determines the benefits that can be obtained through classifier fusion. There are many measures of diversity that can be used in classical decision-making systems which operate in stationary environments. A plethora of algorithms have also been proposed to ensure ensemble diversity. Bagging and boosting are a few of the most popular examples. Unfortunately, these measures and algorithms cannot be applied in systems that process streaming data. Not only must a different implementation be designed for processing fast moving samples in a stream, but the notion of diversity must also be redefined. In this paper it is proposed to assess diversity based on analysis of classifier reactions to changes in data streams. Therefore, two novel error trend diversity measures are introduced that compare the error trends of classifiers\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1087"]}

A purpose of TBISA is to distinguish specific objects based on their characteristics, i.e. shape, colour, texture, or a mixture of these features. All of those information are available in colour channel data. Nonetheless, performing image analysis on the pixel level using RGB values, does not allow to access information on texture which is hidden in relation between neighbouring pixels. Therefore, to take full advantage of all available information, we propose to incorporate the Structural Tensors as a feature extraction method. It forms enriched feature set which, apart from colour and intensity, conveys also information of texture. This set is next processed by different classification algorithms for image segmentation.
