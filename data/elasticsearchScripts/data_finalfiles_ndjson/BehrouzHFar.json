As a result, effective performance testing techniques are essential for understanding whether a Web-based system will meet its performance objectives when deployed in the real world. The workload of a Web-based system has to be characterized in terms of sessions; a session being a sequence of inter-dependent requests submitted by a single user. Dependencies arise because some requests depend on the responses of earlier requests in a session. To exercise application functions in a representative manner, these dependencies should be reflected in the synthetic workloads used to test Web-based systems. This makes performance testing a challenge for these systems. In this paper, we propose a model-based approach to address this problem.

In this paper, a survey on reinforcement learning based recommender systems (RLRSs) is presented. We first recognize the fact that algorithms developed for RLRSs can be generally classified into RL- and DRL-based methods. Then, we present these RL- and DRL-based methods in a classified manner based on the specific RL algorithm, e.g., Q-learning, SARSA, and REINFORCE, that is used to optimize the recommendation policy. Furthermore, some tables are presented that contain detailed information about the MDP formulation of these methods, as well as about their evaluation schemes. Finally, we discuss important aspects and challenges that can be addressed in the future.", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["469"]}

However, emergent behavior is a hurdle. Mechanisms must be in place to make sure that agents participating in the auction systems won't behave in an unintended way. Detecting emergent behaviors in the design phase rather than the deployment is more cost and effort efficient. Patterns of interaction, called scenarios, are the basic modeling constructs for design and behavioral modeling of agents.

Negotiation provides the basis for managing the expectations of the individual negotiating agents, and it enables selecting solutions that satisfy the agents as much as possible. Thus far, most of the negotiation models have limitations when employed in large scale multiagent systems. This paper presents a negotiation model for large scale multiagents systems that is based on qualitative reasoning (QR) and game theory (GT). In the model, each agent classifies its negotiation opponents according to the similarity of their preference model. The agents use QR components of the model to estimate the preference models of their opponents, and to determine the amount of tradeoff associated with the various solution options.

The workload of such an application has to be characterized in terms of sessions; a session being a sequence of inter-dependent requests submitted by a single user. Dependencies arise because some requests depend on the responses of earlier requests in a session. To exercise application functions in a representative manner, these dependencies should be reflected in the synthetic workloads used to test Web-based applications. The need to handle these dependencies makes performance testing a time consuming process. Specifically, since the nature of these dependencies varies across systems considerable effort needs to be dedicated towards tailoring a set of test tools that will work for a given system. Furthermore, the traditionally followed approach of manually developing test scripts that handle dependencies makes it difficult to achieve fine-grained control over a synthetic workload\u2019s characteristics.

Accurate detection of COVID-19 from the sound datasets requires overcoming two main challenges (i) the variable number of coughs in each recording and (ii) the low number of COVID-positive cases compared to healthy coughs in the data. We use two open datasets of crowdsourced cough recordings and segment each cough recording into non-overlapping coughs. The segmentation enriches the original data without oversampling by splitting the original cough sound files into non-overlapping segments.

The aim of this work is to measure and analyze the possible energy savings for homes if zonal heat control system is used. A control circuit is used to sense the indoor and outdoor temperature and turns the furnace ON or OFF according to the preferred temperature set by the householders. Zonal heat control is performed by closing the heating vents in the unoccupied areas of the house during the nighttime. Over one-month test period in winter, the measurement results proved that the zonal control system could save the heating energy up to 36% depending on the weather temperature. The study results support the assumption that, more saving in energy consumption can be reached by controlling the delivery of heat on a zone-by-zone basis.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["469"]}

However, the COTS marketplace is characterized by a vast array of products and product claims, extreme quality and capability differences between products, and many products incompatibilities, even when they purport to adhere to the same standards. Therefore, there is need for a robust COTS evaluation methodology to help software developers select appropriate components for projects. A variety of COTS evaluation methods have already been proposed. These methods are based on either consensual opinion aggregation approach or regression models. However, both approaches are inadequate for the COTS Evaluation process. In this paper, we propose an agent-based COTS evaluation method, which models each of the players as either a cooperative or a competing agent that is capable of making its own decisions to meets its goals. In this model, there is an administrator agent that collects, evaluates, and combines knowledge from different areas of expertise (Roles) to offer support in the COTS selection process. This way, we circumvent COTS evaluation problems\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["469"]}

For a signalized intersection, this theory was developed to analyze the dynamics of queue formation along the cycles. In an oversaturated condition, part of the queue cannot be discharged at the end of a cycle. This generates residual queue for other cycles, causing delays or even blocking upstream ramps and intersections. Given this, finding the residual queue length is significant to the calculation of travel times and delays. Reviewing the literature, we found nine papers that have used the residual queue length equation. However, the equation has been presented in six different forms, and some of them are completely different from the others. Since the equation is based on a given geometrical proof, it should be identical throughout the literature, but this is not the case. Hence, in this paper we aim to investigate if the existing variations of the residualqueue equation generate thesame andcorrect values.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["469"]}

A central problem in a social network is to identify the nodes that actively participate in the expansion of the net both physically and functionally.

In this paper we use an agent model of the social net and propose a method that can identify the neutral nodes, i.e. the nodes that can never be considered as hot spot nodes given the network topology and rules of negotiation among nodes. Therefore these nodes can be eliminated from the net. A direct advantage of this method is reducing the computational complexity for the configuration and identification of hot spots.

The parameterized strategy pattern presented in this paper addresses the case when the algorithms have different sets of parameters, and when the user is allowed to see and modify these parameters for each concrete algorithm before its execution. This is accomplished by introducing special parameter classes which encapsulate algorithms parameters.

In fact many faults are introduced into the system at this stage of the software development life cycle. Therefore design validation of distributed software systems prior to the implementation phase is greatly desirable as it results in huge savings in time and cost.

{"title": "Concepts in Action: Performance Study of Agents Learning Ontology Concepts from Peer Agents.\n", "abstract": " The ability to share knowledge is a necessity for agents in order to achieve both group and individual goals. To grant this ability many researchers have assumed to not only establish a common language among agents but a complete common understanding of all the concepts the agents communicate about. But these assumptions are often too strong or unrealistic. In this paper we present a comprehensive study of performance of agents learning ontology concepts from peer agents. Our methodology allows agents that are not sharing a common ontology to establish common grounds on concepts known only to some of them, when these common grounds are needed by learning the concepts. Although the concepts learned by an agent are only compromises among the views of the other agents, the method nevertheless enhances the autonomy of agents using it substantially. The experimental evaluation shows that the learner agent performs better than or close to teacher agents when it is tested against the objects from the whole world.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["469"]}

There are also some works that given a specification, can answer whether it is safely realizable or not. However, while these works are restricted by certain assumptions such as synchronous message passing in the system, they also cannot answer why given two specifications, one is safely realizable and the other is not. In this paper, we present a property of MSC specifications that explains implementation problems for them. Using this result, we show how we can effectively correct a specification to avoid implementation problems such as deadlocks and implied scenarios.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["469"]}

{"title": "Adjudicator: A Statistical Approach for Learning Ontology Concepts from Peer Agents.\n", "abstract": " We present a statistical approach for software agents to learn ontology concepts from peer agents by asking them whether they can reach consensus on significant differences between similar concepts. This method allows agents that are not sharing common ontologies to establish common grounds on concepts known only to some of them, when these common grounds are needed. The method starts with fetching positive and negative examples for a concept vaguely understood by a learner agent from the peer agents. The learner agent then uses a concept learning method to learn the concept in question. Then example objects of the candidate concept are sent back to the peer agents asking for their feedback. Peer agents evaluate the examples using two dimensional rate and weight evaluation criteria. The returned data is then tested for integrity and analyzed using analysis of variance to identify whether a statistical consensus can be achieved among peer agent with respect to the learnt concept. If such consensus exists, the learning agent can add the concept to its ontology with a higher degree of confidence. This will enhances the autonomy and improve communication and cooperation abilities among software agents.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["469"]}

A common practice to acquire this data is through roadside sensors. This approach is expensive because of infrastructure and planning costs and cannot be easily applied to new routes. In this paper, a low-cost Web mining approach is proposed to address these limitations. Our system gathers information about vehicle commute times, accidents, and weather reports from heterogeneous Web sources. Information from these sources can be combined to support road traffic analytics. We illustrate the utility of our system through a clustering analysis that investigates the traffic patterns of the busiest highway in Calgary along with factors having the most impact on commute time. The analysis shows that most of the accidents are localized around a small section of the highway near the city center and that the commute time in this segment is significantly more than that in other segments. Bad weather increases the typical evening rush hour commute time by 60% for days with moderate accidents and by a factor of 100% for days with large number of accidents. Overall, commute times can vary by a factor of 4 depending on accidents and weather.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["469"]}

An unwanted behavior, known as Emergent Behavior (EB) or Implied Scenario (IS), could lead to irreversible damages. Thus, detecting IS at an early stage of the system development is needed to decrease the cost of maintaining the system. This work focuses on verification of DSS that its requirements modeled using Message Sequence Chart (MSC). The system verification focuses on the detection of IS using two already proposed different approaches.

First, the impact of clustering projects on the estimation accuracy is investigated. Second, the impact of using ANN ensembles instead of a single ANN is also investigated. The proposed method includes three phases called pre-processing, k-means clustering, and ANN ensembles effort estimation. The method starts with exploring the historical projects dataset. Afterward, k-means is used to cluster the projects.

Agents which conduct semantic search on behalf of a user, deploy ontologies to organize structured and unstructured documents in their corresponding repositories. The ontology for each repository is individualized and commitment to a common ontology is not required. The agents can improve their search capability by learning new concepts from each other.

Cost is evaluated by the amount of load hosted by the mirror servers. The goal is then to keep the latency within a tolerable threshold, while minimizing the delegated load.

Particularly, this paper introduces a systematic approach towards implementation of software design knowledge of a team of human experts, using cooperative expert system technology. The focus is on reuse of the design knowledge that a single expert possesses when contributing to a design shared among a number of experts. We propose a structure for expert systems that combines function detailing and data detailing for a team of human experts through interactions and negotiations among units.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["469"]}
{"title": "Software Creation: An Expert System for Applying Design Process Knowledge in Automatic Software Design\n", "abstract": " A goal of this project is automating software design by accumulating knowledge and experience of human designers. CREATOR2, an experimental expert system that simulates behavior of human designers by applying design process knowledge is introduced. A novel point is using a unified representation scheme for the design process knowledge, composed of design rules for detailing and tacit knowledge, and the design product knowledge. Experiments on designing switching software are reported.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["469"]}
{"title": "Modelization of a wider class of flexible manufacturing systems(a DEDS approach).\n", "abstract": " A quantitative model for describing the behavior of FMS systems is proposed and applied to explain problems such as dispatching of jobs and scheduling of activities. The new modelling object introduced here is \"compound multi-task server\" which is used to explain the indeterministic problems. Moreover, a method of tracking partially processed jobs is proposed. The behavior of the FMS system is represented into the state-space form, where the state variables are selected to present system's performance explicitly.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["469"]}
{"title": "Applications of Data Management and Analysis\n", "abstract": " The quantity of data in various science and engineering domains is increasing at a phenomenal rate, in structured and semi-structured formats. The data is characterized by its complexity, volume, high dimensionality, and velocity. Together with this growth, there are a large number of data science-related tools and techniques available for analyzing data and extract useful, actionable and reusable knowledge. Data science is an interdisciplinary field. Theories, techniques, and tools are drawn from various fields within mathematics, statistics, information science, software engineering, signal processing, probability models, machine learning, statistical learning, data mining, database systems, data engineering, pattern recognition, visualization, predictive analytics, uncertain modeling, data warehousing, data compression, artificial intelligence, and high performance computing.
