The main hypothesis made was that by using different methods of foresight in the industry level significant value could be created. The question was approached through a case study in portable fuel cell technology.  The theoretical background of the study draws from Innovation, Product Development, Management of Technology, and Technology Foresight. The connection within the topics is made by analyzing foresight, not in a policy view as often done in Europe, but in a micro-level. Focusing mostly on how a technology driven development scenario could be analyzed. The study is based on a bibliometric, extrapolation and patent analysis within the context of a case study. In addition, a large two-year Delphi study was conducted. The study was finalized with a scenario work on the future possibilities of the case study technology. Original publications also consider several methodological issues.  In the context of the case study, the study questions the practicality of establishing a portable fuel cell technology in Finland showing several impractical assumptions has been made. In a more conceptual level, the study makes notions on two underlying factors: policy-push technologies and growth of data.  Policy-push questions in which level a policy effort towards a single technology is practical. The European foresight effort is more directed towards policy decisions in contrast to US foresight, which is to some extent corporate driven.

The smaller a firm is, the harder succeeding is. It is assumed that reaping the benefits of network effects necessitates specific platform competences that will, in turn, improve the possibilities to success. An action research-based empirical study with a few, small tech-rich case firms will be conducted during 2016-2017. The expected results will have two main contributions: first, an explorative taxonomy of what kind of competences an SME typically use, and second, a list of actions how a manager can enable network effects to realize within its business ecosystem. The results may help managers to seek and utilise better their platform competences and evaluate their firms' ability and potential to survive through internal and external ignited shocks in business ecosystem.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["748"]}

TiO 2 nanotube arrays are prepared by oxidizing titanium foil in an aqueous electrolyte solution of hydrofluoric acid (HF, 0.5 wt.%). The morphologies of the oxide film are characterized by FESEM. The empirical color properties are obtained using the L* a* b* system. The different interference colors of oxidized Ti samples are obtained depending on the anodization time. The anodization time clearly indicates a strong effect on the reflectance at the visible wavelength region, thus confirming the observed color differences. Consequently, the interference colors can be controlled by the anodization time. By observing the coloration of Ti during the anodization, the interference colors can be utilized to identify the thickness of oxide layer and the formation of nanotubes on Ti sheet.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["748"]}

This multiphase model focuses on the flow mechanism of a single CO2 gas bubble. The model describes the mass transfer in a single cell by using the physical properties of a single bubble and by tracing its movement. The simulation results indicate that the thickness of a gas diffusion layer (GDL) has an effect on the CO2 bubble size at a low power output level.

{"title": "Text Mining on Job Advertisement Data: Systematic Process for Detecting Artificial Intelligence Related Jobs\n", "abstract": " The use of online job advertisement has made them an important source of quantitative information about the innovation system. This data offers significant opportunities to study trends, transitions in the job markets and skill demands. In this study, we have utilized the job ads data of a major Finnish job market platform to investigate the emergence of AI-related jobs. More than 480 000 job advertisements during 2013-2020 was used to create insight on skills transitions, particularly focusing on artificial intelligence related skills. A glossary of AI-related skills was created and applied to the job data to identify the relatedness spectrum of ads to AI using a three-tier system. By incorporating sectoral firm-level information, we explored the variation in AI-related skills demand over time and sectors. Our study presents a systematic way to utilize job advertisement data for detecting demand trends for specific skills.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["748"]}
{"title": "Pathways to a drug: A mixed methods analysis of emergence\n", "abstract": " Despite the calls for a broader methodological base, the technology management and the forecasting literature remain short of studies synthesising quantitative and qualitative methods. This paper addresses this gap by employing a mixed method approach to study the case of Taxol, a revolutionary drug developed to fight ovarian and breast cancer. The paper shows in detail how a data mining-based network model can be synthesised with qualitatively created event narrative to understand the development of a technology and its ecosystem. As a result, the paper shows an npartite network of Taxol drug ecosystem containing over 4,000 nodes and 11,000 edges. The network enables decision makers to understand the process, interaction of actors and lock-in mechanism in the process of technological development.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["748"]}
{"title": "Board interconnections and company performance: An analysis of the finnish game developer companies\n", "abstract": " In the world of networked innovation, flows of resources into the organization are emphasized. One special approach of interorganizational flows is board networks or interlocks, which have been widely studied as contributors toward company performance. In this paper, we apply prior research from board interlock SNA as well as prior wider innovation ecosystem research into the case context of Finnish game industry with existing board interlocks. This industry has been very successful, with a turnover of 1.8 Billion Euros in 2014. This paper we explore the role of board interlocks toward the performance of individual companies. We find that 51 percent of the game companies have interlocks. With further analysis we find that even though the descriptive evaluation of data suggest otherwise, there is no statistical support for volume or centrality of networks having positive impact to company performance.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["748"]}
{"title": "DIFFERENTIATION WITHIN MOBILE ECOSYSTEMS\u2014THE UNSPECIALIZED MARKETPLACES\n", "abstract": " Nowadays, the \u2018war of ecosystems\u2019 between alliances of giant mobile operating system vendors and mobile phone manufacturers is a popular topic in the news. In the public discussion, the application ecosystem emerged inside the mobile ecosystem is argued to be a key in the differentiation. This has striven the ecosystem orchestrators for recruiting an increasing number of software developers and applications to join in their ecosystem. In this paper, we study how different mobile ecosystems differentiate both in application offering and in the mobile phone users. We use the information gathered from over 800 000 applications and the questionnaire answered by approximately 2 000 university students to study the research questions. The results show that the ecosystems are rather similar in their offering although it is possible to make distinction between the users of different ecosystems.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["748"]}
