Business school authorities would therefore always want to ensure that they admit the right set of students to their MBA program. In this article, we used supervised learning techniques to model and select the optimal academic characteristics of students to enhance their placement probability.

{"title": "Unemployment rate forecasting: A hybrid approach\n", "abstract": " Unemployment has always been a very focused issue causing a nation as a whole to lose its economic and financial contribution. Unemployment rate prediction of a country is a crucial factor for the country\u2019s economic and financial growth planning and a challenging job for policymakers. Traditional stochastic time series models, as well as modern nonlinear time series techniques, were employed for unemployment rate forecasting previously. These macroeconomic data sets are mostly nonstationary and nonlinear in nature. Thus, it is atypical to assume that an individual time series forecasting model can generate a white noise error. This paper proposes an integrated approach based on linear and nonlinear models that can predict the unemployment rates more accurately. The proposed hybrid model of the unemployment rate can improve their forecasts by reflecting the unemployment rate\u2019s asymmetry\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["470"]}

Use of single PCI for all the situations could be misleading. Hence appropriate PCIs need to be chosen based on the characteristics of the specification limits.

In real-life classification and regression problems, situations exist in which a model based on one of the methods is preferable based on some subjective criterion.

In this work, we present two hybrid models combining the Bayesian and frequentist versions of CART and neural networks, which we call the Bayesian neural tree (BNT) models. Both models exploit the architecture of decision trees and have lesser number of parameters to tune than advanced neural networks. Such models can simultaneously perform feature selection and prediction, are highly flexible, and generalize well in settings with a limited number of training observations.
