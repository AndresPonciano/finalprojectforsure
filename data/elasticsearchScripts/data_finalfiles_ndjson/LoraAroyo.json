Two main challenges can be seen in this direction: on the one hand, to achieve interoperability among various educational systems and on the other hand, to have automated, structured and unified authoring support for their creation. In the spirit of the Semantic Web a key to enabling the interoperability is to capitalize on the (1) semantic conceptualization and ontologies,(2) common standardized communication syntax, and (3) large-scale service-based integration of educational content and functionality provision and usage.

The Web has been the\" Big Thing\" during the past 10 years, but its success has also made it very difficult to find the appropriate information in an ocean of over 3 billion pages. Whereas search engines achieve incredible precision, they suffer from the same\" one size fits all\" approach that characterizes the Web sites they index. The paper defends the position that personalization, and in particular automatic personalization or adaptation, is the key to reach the goal of offering each individual user (or user group) the information they need. During the panel discussion there was debate about whether the user should always have access and control over the entire (hypertextual) information space. There were different views on whether the\" right\" to all the information is best guaranteed by offering tools that reduce the information space the user perceives so that the user can actually find and reach the information, or by offering unfiltered access to an ocean of information in which everything is available but in which perhaps nothing can be found. We argue in favor of adaptation but at the same time point out flaws in the way adaptive hypermedia has been used until now. The paper then proposes a new, modular adaptive hypermedia architecture that should lead to adaptive Web-based systems as the\" Next Big Thing\" indeed. In this architecture, different applications can collaborate in creating and updating a user model.

{"title": "User modeling and adaptive Semantic Web\n", "abstract": " Historically, personalization and adaptation have been important factors for the success of the Web and therefore they have been important topics in Web research. Many research efforts in the field of adaptive hypermedia and adaptive Web-based systems have resulted in solutions for user-adapted access to Web content, often in terms of systems that provide an adaptive hypermedia structure of content pages and hyperlinks. With pages and links that depend on the user, it is feasible to offer a high degree of personalization. Next to research into engineering and realizing adaptation, research into user modeling has been crucial for the success of adaptation. To apply the right adaptation it is necessary to know the user and her relevant properties and the research field of user modeling has focused on theories and techniques for eliciting knowledge about the user.

{"title": "The design space of a configurable autocompletion component\n", "abstract": " Autocompletion is a commonly used interface feature in diverse applications. Semantic Web data has, on the one hand, the potential to provide new functionality by exploiting the semantics in the data used for generating autocompletion suggestions. Semantic Web applications, on the other hand, typically pose extra requirements on the semantic properties of the suggestions given. When the number of syntactic matches becomes too large, some means of selecting a semantically meaningful subset of suggestions to be presented to the user is needed. In this paper we identify a number of key design dimensions of autocompletion interface components. Our hypothesis is that a one-size-fits-all solution to autocompletion interface components does not exist, because different tasks and different data sets require interfaces corresponding to different points in our design space. We present a fully configurable architecture, which can be used to configure autocompletion components to the desired point in this design space. The architecture has been implemented as an open source software component that can be plugged into a variety of applications. We report on the results of a user evaluation that confirms this hypothesis, and describe the need to evaluate semantic autocompletion in a task and application-specific context.", "num_citations": "34\n", "authors": ["2101"]}

The novelty of items is calculated with cosine similarities between items, using Linked Open Data paths. The coping potential of users is estimated by measuring the diversity of the items in the user profile.

This paper presents an approach to information handling, which implies conceptual support for both learners and instructors engaged in openlearning and teaching tasks in a web-based course support environment. The proposed approach combines two powerful techniques to support web-based course learning-information retrieval and concept mapping. It involves conceptualisation of the subject domain and representation of the domain structure in an ontological way by a concept map, which is used for knowledge classification and indexing and allows for efficient information search. In addition, it includes strong visual presentation and graphical navigation of the subject domain and information search results and supports adaptive matching of the presentation to particular learners. AIMS-an intelligent tool for task-based information handling support in web-based learning/training/work environments demonstrates the main ideas of this approach.

{"title": "Historical event-based access to museum collections\n", "abstract": " This paper presents research in the context of two multidisciplinary projects aimed at facilitating the history domain with an automatic approach for event extraction and modelling. To realise this, the Semantics of History project is providing a historical ontology and a lexicon to support the detection of historical events in textual data whilst the Agora project focusses on exploring the modelling aspects of historical events and employing the combined results in an event-driven browse and search approach. Furthermore, the historical events are used as a flexible model to identify semantically relevant relationships between objects in highly diverse museum collections, creating meaningful \u2018cause\u2019and \u2018effect\u2019links along the key event dimensions \u2018who\u2019,\u2018what\u2019,\u2018where\u2019and \u2018when\u2019. This should finally support the (re) interpretation process of history research, by allowing end-users to create their own personal narratives, leading to theoretical reflection on the meaning of digitally mediated public history in contemporary society.

With limited funding and limited professional resources, annotation is often lagging behind significantly in terms of quantity and level of detail. Quantity as well as quality of the annotations is the key to finding relevant objects by various groups of users in online collections. As many experiments with cultural heritage data online show, human computation can be useful for collecting large quantities of data. Various of these experimented with a crowd of lay people to help with the annotation of cultural heritage artefacts. However, a common concern relates to the resulting quality.

Thus, each tool is able to extract only a subset of the named entities (NE) mentioned in a given text.

{"title": "Accurator: Nichesourcing for cultural heritage\n", "abstract": " With more and more cultural heritage data being published online, their usefulness in this open context depends on the quality and diversity of descriptive metadata for collection objects. In many cases, existing metadata is not adequate for a variety of retrieval and research tasks and more specific annotations are necessary. However, eliciting such annotations is a challenge since it often requires domain-specific knowledge. Where crowdsourcing can be successfully used for eliciting simple annotations, identifying people with the required expertise might prove troublesome for tasks requiring more complex or domain-specific knowledge. Nichesourcing addresses this problem, by tapping into the expert knowledge available in niche communities. This paper presents Accurator, a methodology for conducting nichesourcing campaigns for cultural heritage institutions, by addressing communities, organizing events and tailoring a web-based annotation tool to a domain of choice. The contribution of this paper is threefold: 1) a nichesourcing methodology, 2) an annotation tool for experts and 3) validation of the methodology and tool in three case studies. The three domains of the case studies are birds on art, bible prints and fashion images. We compare the quality and quantity of obtained annotations in the three case studies, showing that the nichesourcing methodology in combination with the image annotation tool can be used to collect high quality annotations in a variety of domains and annotation tasks.

The annotations are acquired through an open-ended crowd-labeling task, in which participants were asked to provide keywords for each of three sounds. The main goal of this study is to find out (i) whether it is feasible to collect keywords for a large collection of sounds through crowdsourcing, and (ii) how people talk about sounds, and what information they can infer from hearing a sound in isolation. Our main finding is that it is not only feasible to perform crowd-labeling for a large collection of sounds, it is also very useful to highlight different aspects of the sounds that authors may fail to mention. Our data is freely available, and can be used to ground semantic models, improve search in audio databases, and to study the language of sound.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["2101"]}

In order to boost the level of user participation in a SIS, suitable mechanisms capable of discerning reliable users must be designed.

{"title": "Concept-based courseware authoring: An engineering perspective\n", "abstract": " 1. Introduction Concept-based courseware (CBC) generally consists of two main components\u2013concept-based representation of the subject domain covered by the course and a \u2018library\u2019of educational/learning materials/units connected to the domain concepts. The former can be in a form of ontology or a conceptual structure such as a concept map, knowledge map, conceptual graph, etc. The latter can include various types of indexed learning materials such as lectures, examples, slides, exercises, case studies, conference papers, etc., stored both locally and as links to Web documents. In AIMS the links between the \u2018library\u2019and the domain concepts are explicit. We also have an additional conceptual layer-concept-based representation of courses (course structure) over the conceptual representation of the domain. In our further discussion and analysis of the authoring process we use the courseware model adopted in AIMS, which consists of four main models\u2013Domain model (DM), Course model (CM), Learning material & metadata model (LMM) and User model (UM). Authoring of Web CBC, such as AIMS, involves domain-, course-, and library model authoring, which makes the process rather complicated and labor intensive than the process of a \u2018standard\u2019courseware authoring. Apparently this calls for better authoring support. We envisage such support to include semi-automatic performance of some authoring activities, intelligent assistance to the authors in the form of hints, recommendations, etc., as well as supporting collaboration of different instructors in building, sharing, and reuse of domain and course ontologies/conceptual structures\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["2101"]}

In the last decade, different aspects of linguistic encoding of perspectives have been targeted as separated phenomena through different annotation initiatives. We propose an annotation scheme that integrates these different phenomena. We use a multilayered annotation approach, splitting the annotation of different aspects of perspectives into small subsequent subtasks in order to reduce the complexity of the task and to better monitor interactions between layers. Currently, we have included four layers of perspective annotation: events, attribution, factuality and opinion. The annotations are integrated in a formal model called GRaSP, which provides the means to represent instances (eg events, entities) and propositions in the (real or assumed) world in relation to their mentions in text. Then, the relation between the source and target of a perspective is characterized by means of perspective annotations. This enables us to place alternative perspectives on the same entity, event or proposition next to each other.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["2101"]}

For this presentation many systems use hypermedia structures, as that nicely supports the Web-based application. As a consequence, navigation adaptation is also a central issue in system design. Next to modelling domain and adaptation, it is necessary to model the user and what the system knows or assumes of the user.

This paper presents an approach to information handling, which implies conceptual support for both learners and instructors engaged in open-learning and teaching tasks in a web-based course support environment. The proposed approach combines two powerful techniques to support web-based course learning-information retrieval and concept mapping. It involves conceptualisation of the subject domain and representation of the domain structure in an ontological way by a concept map, which is used for knowledge classification and indexing and allows for efficient information search. In addition, it includes strong visual presentation and graphical navigation of the subject domain and information search results and supports adaptive matching of the presentation to particular learners. AIMS-an intelligent tool for task-based information handling support in web-based learning/training/work environments demonstrates the main ideas of this approach.

{"title": "Interactive curating of user tags for audiovisual archives\n", "abstract": " With the rapidly increasing popularity of social sharing sites, the traditional manual indexing techniques are no longer feasible to cope with the growing amount of multimedia content. Emerging folksonomies of user tags through crowdsourcing provide a potential for the collaborative annotation of various types of online multimedia resources. However, the shortcomings of folksonomies still present researchers with challenges to effectively use the collected user tags in professional or public collections. Examples of such challenges are determining how to tackle the quality of tags, to understand tags' meaning and relevance to the resource material, and to define quality parameters of the final (targeted) annotations of multimedia resources. This work addresses such challenges in a concrete use case--the crowdsourcing video annotation game called Waisda?.

{"title": "Television and the future internet: the NoTube project\n", "abstract": " [1st paragraph] 'New technology is transforming the TV industry', Mark Thompson, BBC Director General told the newspaper The Observer. The classic notion of TV being a set in the living room with finite channels and linear programming is already gone: TV has moved into the world of Internet and mobile technology and content is growing exponentially in terms of number and diversity. The notion of channels is being replaced by individual choice and on-demand programming. Distinctions between TV and other streaming content are blurred: both live in a shared connected online world. We expect that as the Future Internet develops, TV will complete this disruptive paradigm shift into becoming ubiquituous, always-available, and increasingly personalized. NoTube is a EU funded project (in the Objective 4.3 Intelligent Information Management) which began February 2009 and runs for three years, with the goal to prepare TV for the Future Internet \u2013 addressing challenges of TV content ubiquity and choice, personalization and integration.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["2101"]}

Web users drive this growth by massively sharing their personal stories on social media platforms as compilations of their daily visual memories, or with animated GIFs and memes based on existing video material. Therefore, it is crucial to gain understanding of the semantics of video stories, ie, what do they capture and how. The remix of visual content is also a powerful way of understanding the implicit aspects of storytelling, as well as the essential parts of audio-visual (AV) material. In this paper we take a digital hermeneutics approach to understand what are the visual attributes and semantics that drive the creation of narratives. We present insights from a nichesourcing study in which humanities scholars remix keyframes and video fragments into micro-narratives ie,(sequences of) GIFs. To support the narrative creation for humanities scholars a specific video annotation is needed, eg,(1) annotations that consider literal and abstract connotations of video material, and (2) annotations that are coarse-grained, ie, focusing on keyframes and video fragments as opposed to full length videos. The main findings of the study are used to facilitate the automatic creation of narratives in the digital humanities exploratory search tool DIVE+ 1.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["2101"]}

By digitizing collections, cultural heritage institutions aim to fulfill their new role as information providers. However, the majority of the digitized collections lack sufficient metadata and provide no context. This makes the collections hard to access and to search through. Prior research [3] shows that enriching metadata of digitized collection items with events helps with providing context, structure collections, and describe relationships between collection items.In general, collections can be significantly enriched through the addition of events. Events can place collection items into context and create structure by linking related items. This improves the accessibility of the items and helps users to understand their context. Both personal events and historical events are relevant for this cause. Personal events can provide an understanding of the day-today lives of people involved in historical events which can further enable large scale data research. However, detecting and extracting such events is a difficult task, as events are very ambiguous. They lack conclusive definition and their position as events is frequently dependent on personal interpretation. In this paper, we create a pipeline that detects, extracts and represents personal and historical events to improve the accessibility of cultural heritage items.

{"title": "Personalization on the Web of Data and New Paradigms for Distributed and Open User Modeling\n", "abstract": " With more personal data being out there on the Web of Data and with an increasing level of personalization in the way data is offered on the Web, the traditional role of user modeling is changing. Traditionally, user modeling was closely aligned with the user-adaptation offered by specific adaptive systems, and the research field of User Modeling reflected this in its assumptions. For the Web of Data the situation has changed, user modeling has become both massively distributed and open, and new assumptions are needed. This has consequences both for the fields of User Modeling and Adaptive Systems, in terms of their assumptions and research questions, but also for Web Science as the role of user model knowledge changes the way the web is used. Therefore, the many new research challenges in engineering and studying distributed and open user modeling have to be approached in the triangle between User Modeling, Adaptive Web-based Systems, and Web Science.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["2101"]}

{"title": "Interoperability between archival and bibliographic metadata\n", "abstract": " Nowadays, due to the growing number of (web) resources, lots of metadata schemas are implemented, especially in the cultural heritage field where there is a rising need for documenting various types of material. In this context, metadata interoperability becomes an important issue so as to provide homogeneous access to users, mainly when there is a need to build collections that include diverse metadata (eg digital libraries). An indicative example is archives, which apart from being encoded in EAD [1](the most widely used metadata for archival description), are also represented through bibliographic metadata, such as MODS [2]. As it is mentioned in [3], bibliographic description can be an excellent companion of archival description, although they have different documentation logic. EAD encompasses different descriptive levels representing the various nested hierarchical components of an archive, such as series, subseries etc that include other subcomponents and often reach the item level. The user can see the material as a whole and, at the same time, get its in-depth indication. The nested structure mentioned allows the inheritance of information from the high level components to their subcomponents and it is fully documented via EAD. In contrast, a bibliographic record gives a flat view of the described object. As a result, EAD and bibliographic metadata can not replace each other; still, their co-existence could facilitate efficient search and retrieval from library systems.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["2101"]}
{"title": "Semantics-based framework for personalized access to TV content: personalized TV guide use case\n", "abstract": " The ICT landscape is developing into a highly-interactive distributed environment in which people interact with multiple devices (eg portable devices such as mobile phones and home equipment such as TV\u2019s) and multiple applications (eg computer programs such as Web browsers and dedicated Web services)[1]. Globally the industry is being driven by the shift away from old models-from physical to digital. New methods emerge for getting content such as TV programs via the Web. Almost half of the people want to watch TV content on their PC\u2019s. They want to make a bridge between a TV and a PC, perhaps even sitting in a home office [2]. The information overload is enormous and the content presented is hardly adapted to the prior knowledge, to the preferences and to the current situation of the user.Personalization in information retrieval and information presentation has therefore become a key issue and a key ingredient of the so-called \u201cWeb 2.0\u201d applications. However, such personalization is still local (eg personalized information is only valid for www. tvgids. nl; it cannot be used for other information services, nor can TVGids cater for different \u201cmodes\u201d of a user, eg when looking for something personal, or when watching together with friends [3].

{"title": "Topical video search: analysing video concept annotation through crowdsourcing games\n", "abstract": " Games with a purpose (GWAPs) are increasingly used in audio-visual collections as a mechanism for annotating videos through tagging. One such GWAP is Waisda?, a video labeling game where players tag streaming video and win points by reaching consensus on tags with other players. The open-ended and unconstrained manner of tagging in the fast-paced setting of the game has fundamental impact on the resulting tags. We find that Waisda? tags predominately describe visual objects and rarely refer to the topics of the videos. In this study we evaluate to what extent the tags entered by players can be regarded as topical descriptors of the video material. Moreover, we characterize the quality of the user tags as topical descriptors with the aim to detect and filter out the bad ones. Our results show that after filtering, game tags perform equally well compared to the manually crafted metadata when it comes to accessing the videos based on topic. An important consequence of this finding is that tagging games can provide a cost-effective alternative in situations when manual annotation by professionals is too costly.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2101"]}

{"title": "Crowdtruth: Machine-human computation framework for harnessing disagreement in gathering annotated data\n", "abstract": " Information Retrieval (IR) systems typically use for training and evaluation gold standard annotations, ie ground truth. Traditionally ground truth is collected by asking domain experts to annotate a number of examples and by providing them with a set of annotation guidelines to ensure an uniform understanding of the annotation task. This process is entirely based on a simplified notion of truth, ie under the assumption that a single right annotation exists for each example. However, in reality we continuously observe that truth is not universal and is strongly influenced by the variety of factors, eg context, background knowledge, points of view, as well as the quality of the examples themselves.Research in IR has started to incorporate crowdsourcing in designing, training and evaluating information retrieval systems [4]. Using crowdsourcing platforms such as Crowd-Flower or Amazon Mechanical Turk for gathering human interpretation on data has become now a mainstream process. However, as we have observed previously [1], the introduction of crowdsourcing has not fundamentally changed the way gold standards are created: humans are still asked to provide a semantic interpretation of data, with the explicit assumption that there is one correct interpretation. Thus, the diversity of interpretation and perspectives is still not taken into consideration-neither in the training, nor in the evaluation of such systems.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2101"]}

{"title": "Towards Cultural Heritage Communities Online\n", "abstract": " Web technology enables cultural heritage institutions to provide access to their collections to anyone interested. However, in order to be able to interpret and analyze collection objects online, a contextual representation is necessary. This research explores whether existing communities can be addressed in order to complement this context, and evaluates an event-centered representation of objects. The first study comprised of a focus group session with 5 people having roots in the Dutch Indies. We collected information about their sense of community, and how they shared their memories with others. In the second study, 22 pairs of high school pupils we asked to answer a historical question using an eventbased collection browser. We analyzed their answers on the question and collected feedback on their experiences. The main results from the focus group indicated that witnesses of historical events have a strong sense of community with their peers. They share their memories by visiting schools, making art, and in books. They see it as their duty to continue doing this both offline and online. Results of the user study show that event-based representation is successful for finding the right objects, as a skeleton for answering a historical question. However, additional contextual background information is necessary for pupils to answer the question sufficiently. To evolve the Agora collection browser into a social platform, the construction of narratives should be emphasized. Enabling users to add, rate and review external sources should provide background information on objects and events.
