{"title": "Probabilistic netkat\n", "abstract": " This paper presents a new language for network programming based on a probabilistic semantics. We extend the NetKATlanguage with new primitives for expressing probabilistic behaviors and enrich the semantics from one based on deterministic functions to one based on measurable functions on sets of packet histories. We establish fundamental properties of the semantics, prove that it is a conservative extension of the deterministic semantics, show that it satisfies a number of natural equations, and develop a notion of approximation. We present case studies that show how the language can be used to model a diverse collection of scenarios drawn from real-world networks.", "num_citations": "70\n", "authors": ["1664"]}

We give here an introduction to the StreamQRE language, which has recently been proposed for the purpose of simplifying the task of programming the desired logic in such stream processing applications. StreamQRE provides natural and high-level constructs for processing streaming data, and it offers a novel integration of linguistic constructs from two distinct programming paradigms: streaming extensions of relational query languages and quantitative extensions of regular expressions. The former allows the programmer to employ relational constructs to partition the input data by keys and to integrate data streams from different sources, while the latter can be used to exploit the logical hierarchy in the input stream for modular specifications.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1664"]}

A lightweight annotation language allows command developers to express key parallelizability properties about their commands. An accompanying parallelizability study of POSIX and GNU commands---two large and commonly used groups---guides the annotation language and optimized aggregator library that PaSh uses.

{"title": "Semantic Foundations for Deterministic Dataflow and Stream Processing\n", "abstract": " We propose a denotational semantic framework for deterministic dataflow and stream processing that encompasses a variety of existing streaming models. Our proposal is based on the idea that data streams, stream transformations, and stream-processing programs should be classified using types. The type of a data stream is captured formally by a monoid, an algebraic structure with a distinguished binary operation and a unit. The elements of a monoid model the finite fragments of a stream, the binary operation represents the concatenation of stream fragments, and the unit is the empty fragment. Stream transformations are modeled using monotone functions on streams, which we call stream transductions. These functions can be implemented using abstract machines with a potentially infinite state space, which we call stream transducers. This abstract typed framework of stream transductions and transducers can be used to (1) verify the correctness of streaming computations, that is, that an implementation adheres to the desired behavior,(2) prove the soundness of optimizing transformations, eg for parallelization and distribution, and (3) inform the design of programming models and query languages for stream processing. In particular, we show that several useful combinators can be supported by the full class of stream transductions and transducers: serial composition, parallel composition, and feedback composition.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1664"]}
{"title": "Extensions of Kleene algebra for program verification\n", "abstract": " Kleene algebra (KA) is an algebraic system that captures completely the laws of equivalence for regular expressions. It is also useful for reasoning about a multitude of computationally interesting structures. Of central interest in KA is a \"star\" operation that typically describes some kind of repetition or iteration. A combination of Kleene algebra with Boolean algebra has been proposed under the name of Kleene algebra with tests (KAT). This logical system can model the conventional programming constructs of imperative iterative programs, e.g. while loops and conditionals, and it has proven useful for various program verification tasks. In this dissertation we investigate variations and extensions of KA and KAT that are useful for program verification and for reasoning about mathematical structures that appear in computer science. At a technical level, we are interested in establishing completeness theorems, which assert that a proposed logical system is strong enough to capture all properties that are true in a mathematical structure or in a class of mathematical structures. Such results assure us of the quality of a logical system, and their proof often (certainly for the systems that we study here) reveals a systematic way of creating proof objects that certify properties of interest. The first part of this thesis explores generic extensions of KA and KAT with extra equational assumptions. Such extensions are meant to capture in the context of program verification some crucial properties of the domain of computation.  We present a very general completeness meta-theorem that instantiates into several useful concrete completeness results. The second part\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1664"]}

We propose StreamQL, a language that facilitates the high-level specification of complex analyses over streaming time series. StreamQL is designed as an algebra of stream transformations and provides a collection of combinators for composing them. It integrates three language-based approaches for data stream processing: relational queries, dataflow composition, and temporal formalisms. The relational constructs are useful for specifying simple transformations, aggregations, and the partitioning of data into key-based groups or windows. The dataflow abstractions enable the modular description of a computation as a pipeline of stages or, more generally, as a directed graph of independent tasks.

The class of Moore machines, a kind of string transducers, is used as a formal model of online monitors. The main result is that there is a compositional construction from formulas to monitors, so that each monitor computes (in an online fashion) the semantic values of the corresponding formula over the input stream. From our Coq formalization, we extract OCaml code for executable online monitors.

The execution trace of such a system typically consists of one or more signals, and a key computational task for safety monitoring is the online processing of these signals in order to identify events that need to be acted upon in a timely manner. There are several existing proposals for the specification of signal monitors: temporal logics, reactive languages, and dataflow formalisms. A shared feature of most of these proposals is that they describe online signal transformations that are causal. The causality requirement enables a real-time implementation, where the input and output signals are perfectly synchronized. We propose a new specification formalism for signal monitors that relaxes the causality restriction and allows the output to depend on a bounded amount of future input.

{"title": "The complexity of social coordination\n", "abstract": " Coordination is a challenging everyday task; just think of the last time you organized a party or a meeting involving several people. As a growing part of our social and professional life goes online, an opportunity for an improved coordination process arises. Recently, Gupta et al. proposed entangled queries as a declarative abstraction for data-driven coordination, where the difficulty of the coordination task is shifted from the user to the database. Unfortunately, evaluating entangled queries is very hard, and thus previous work considered only a restricted class of queries that satisfy safety (the coordination partners are fixed) and uniqueness (all queries need to be satisfied). In this paper we significantly extend the class of feasible entangled queries beyond uniqueness and safety. First, we show that we can simply drop uniqueness and still efficiently evaluate a set of safe entangled queries. Second, we show that as long as all users coordinate on the same set of attributes, we can give an efficient algorithm for coordination even if the set of queries does not satisfy safety. In an experimental evaluation we show that our algorithms are feasible for a wide spectrum of coordination scenarios.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1664"]}
