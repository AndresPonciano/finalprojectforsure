To cope with this business process variability, the proper management of process variants along the entire process lifecycle becomes crucial.ObjectiveThe goal of this paper is to develop a fundamental understanding of business process variability.

To support the mashup construction process several tools have been proposed with easy-to-use functionalities. However, from the research perspective it is dissatisfying that neither a clear definition and classification model for mashups nor a separation between mashups and other forms of application integrations exist.

Yet the contribution of transcript diversity in regulating gene expression remains largely elusive. We perform an integrative analysis of multiple highly synchronized cell-fate transitions and quantitative genomic techniques in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify regulatory functions associated with transcribing alternative isoforms. Cell-fate transitions feature widespread elevated expression of alternative TSS and, to a lesser degree, TES usage. These dynamically regulated alternative TSSs are located mostly upstream of canonical TSSs, but also within gene bodies possibly encoding for protein isoforms. Increased upstream alternative TSS usage is linked to various effects on canonical TSS levels, which range from co-activation to repression. We identified two key features linked to these outcomes: an interplay between alternative and canonical promoter strengths, and distance between alternative and canonical TSSs. These two regulatory properties give a plausible explanation of how locally transcribed alternative TSSs control gene transcription. Additionally, we find that specific chromatin modifiers Set2, Set3, and FACT play an important role in mediating gene repression via alternative TSSs, further supporting that the act of upstream transcription drives the local changes in gene transcription. The integrative analysis of multiple cell-fate transitions suggests the presence of a regulatory control system of alternative TSSs that is important for dynamic tuning of gene expression.

{"title": "Change patterns for process families\n", "abstract": " The increasing adoption of process-aware information systems (PAISs), together with the variability of business processes (BPs), has resulted in large collections of related process model variants (i.e., process families). To effectively deal with process families, several proposals (e.g., C-EPC, Provop) exist that extend BP modeling languages with variability-specific constructs. While fostering reuse and reducing modeling efforts, respective constructs imply additional complexity and demand proper support for process designers when creating and modifying process families. Recently, generic and language-independent adaptation patterns were successfully introduced for creating and evolving single BP models. However, they are not sufficient to cope with the specific needs for modeling and evolving process families. This paper suggests a complementary set of generic and language-independent change patterns specifically tailored to the needs of process families. When used in combination with existing adaptation patterns, change patterns for process families will enable the modeling and evolution of process families at a high-level of abstraction. Further, they will serve as reference for implementing tools or comparing proposals managing process families.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1509"]}

However, a new challenge that has been little handled by some of these methods is the data and functionality integration with third-party systems. Relying on the basic principles of the OMG Model Driven Architecture, we present a solution to achieve this integration at the conceptual modelling level. Therefore, solving the integration problem at this level of abstraction let us (1) give a general solution that is not tied to any particular implementation technology and (2) to handle external components at the conceptual modelling phase.

The resulting profile of factors and chromatin signatures along transcription units provides a \u201cpositional information system\u201d for transcribing RNAPII. Here, we investigate a chromatin-based mechanism that suppresses intragenic initiation of RNAPII transcription. We demonstrate that RNAPII transcription across gene promoters represses their function in plants. This repression is characterized by reduced promoter-specific molecular signatures and increased molecular signatures associated with RNAPII elongation. The FACT histone chaperone complex is required for this repression mechanism. Genome-wide mapping of Transcription Start Sites (TSSs) reveals thousands of discrete intragenic TSS positions in FACT mutants. Histone 3 lysine 4 mono-methylation poises exonic sites to initiate RNAPII transcription in FACT mutants. Uncovering the mechanism for intragenic TSS repression through the act of RNAPII elongation has important implications for understanding pervasive RNAPII transcription and the regulation of transcript isoform diversity.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1509"]}

It seems that the decentralized nature of microservices makes the choreography approach more appropriate to achieve such cooperation, where lighter solutions based on events and message queues are used. However, orchestration through the usage of a process model facilitates the analysis of the composition when this is modified. To benefit from the goodness of these two approaches, this paper presents a hybrid solution based on the choreography of business process pieces that are obtained from a previously defined description of the complete microservice composition.

In addition, the massive end-user adoption and usage of smartphones together with their powerful capabilities turn this type of devices into a promising platform to develop and execute these added-value services compositions. Moreover, end-users are nowadays getting more and more familiar with technology, fact that allows them to participate more actively in the development of new types of applications.

{"title": "Dealing with variability in process-aware information systems: language requirements, features, and existing proposals\n", "abstract": " The increasing adoption of Process-Aware Information Systems (PAISs), together with the variability of Business Processes (BPs) across different application contexts, has resulted in large process model repositories with collections of related process model variants. To reduce both costs and occurrence of errors, the explicit management of variability throughout the BP lifecycle becomes crucial. In literature, several proposals dealing with BP variability have been proposed. However, the lack of a method for their systematic comparison makes it difficult to select the most appropriate one meeting current needs best. To close this gap, this work presents an evaluation framework that allows analyzing and comparing the variability support provided by existing proposals developed in the context of BP variability. The framework encompasses a set of language requirements as well as a set of variability support features. While language requirements allow assessing the expressiveness required to explicitly represent variability of different process perspectives, variability support features reflect the tool support required to properly cover such expressiveness. Our evaluation framework has been derived based on an in-depth analysis of several large real-world process scenarios, an extensive literature review, and an analysis of existing PAISs. In this vein, the framework helps to understand BP variability along the BP lifecycle. In addition, it supports PAISs engineers in deciding, which of the existing BP variability proposals meets best their needs.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1509"]}
{"title": "Feature Modeling to deal with Variability in Business Process Perspectives\n", "abstract": " The construction of Business Process (BP) models entails big challenges, especially when BPs contain many variations. In addition, BPs can be seen from different perspectives, ie, the behavioral (ie, control-flow), the organizational (ie, resources distribution), or the informational (data-flow) perspectives among others. Depending on the context where the BP is taken place, we may found variability in any of these perspectives. Different approaches to model variability in BP perspectives have already been proposed. However, these approaches are highly tight to the modeling language. In addition, they focus mainly on the behavioral perspective. To deal with variability in other BP perspectives in a more flexible manner, this work proposes an approach based on feature models. These models do not only allow enhancing expressiveness regarding BP variability, but also the maintenance and understanding of the resulting process model.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1509"]}
{"title": "Understandability Issues of Approaches Supporting Business Process Variability\n", "abstract": " The increasing adoption of Process-Aware Information Systems, together with the reuse of process knowledge, has led to the emergence of process model repositories with large process families, i.e., collections of related process model variants. For managing such related model collections two types of approaches exist. While behavioral approaches take supersets of variants and derive a process variant by hiding and blocking process elements, structural approaches take a base process model as input and derive a process variant by applying a set of change operations to it. However, at the current stage no framework for assessing these approaches exists and it is not yet clear which approach should be better used and under which circumstances. Therefore, to give first insights about this issue, this work compares both approaches in terms of understandability of the produced process model artifacts, which is fundamental for the management of process families and the reuse of their contained process fragments. In addition, the comparison can serve as theoretical basis for conducting experiments as well as for fostering the development of tools managing business process variability.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1509"]}

In this work we introduce a method for the development of mobile services that can be adapted in terms of obtrusiveness. That is, services can be developed to provide their functionality at different obtrusiveness levels by minimizing the duplication of efforts.

This chapter applies the guidelines and strategies described by these proposals in order to build a methodological approach for the development of pervasive systems. Software factories are based on the definition of software families supported by frameworks. Individual system requirements are specified by means of domain-specific languages. Following this strategy, our approach defines a domain-specific language for pervasive systems (PervML). In order to support our modeling language, we introduce a software architecture for pervasive systems, which is implemented by a software framework using OSGi\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1509"]}

Aunque estas adaptaciones deben gestionarse de forma aut\u00f3noma, la experiencia demuestra que los humanos no pueden excluirse completamente del bucle de adaptaci\u00f3n, ya sea para solucionar conflictos dif\u0131ciles de resolver aut\u00f3nomamente o para mejorar las estrategias de adaptaci\u00f3n con su realimentaci\u00f3n.

{"title": "Moskitt4SPL: Tool support for developing self-adaptive systems\n", "abstract": " Increasingly, software needs to dynamically adapt its behavior at runtime in response to changing conditions in the supporting computing, communication infrastructure, and in the surrounding physical environment [6]. Self-adaptive software systems are able to reconfigure at run-time to adapt to changes. The implementation of ad-hoc solutions to cover all possible system configurations and reconfigurations is not feasible. Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) provide a systematic basis for the engineering of selfadaptive systems [4]. A key characteristic in DSPLs is the intensive use of variability at run-time in order to adapt the system configuration caused by an environment change. Following this approach, a self-adaptive system can be seen as a family of feasible system configurations with a mechanism to move from one configuration to another. The development of self-adaptive systems involves great complexity and becomes a tedious task. We propose Moskitt4SPL (M4SPL) an open-source tool to ease the development of self-adaptive systems. In this tool, we combine model-driven and DSPLs to better cope with the complexities during the construction of self-adaptive systems. M4SPL can be used for modeling systems which make use of variability at run-time in order to adapt the system configuration caused by an environment change. M4SPL provides edition capabilities for Feature Models, Configuration Models and Resolution Models which are part of a self-adaptive system specification. Furthermore, M4SPL incorporates a series of refinements to automatically ensure interesting behavior issues in adaptation specifications.

In this work we propose an extension to the OOWS Web Engineering method for the development of Web applications based on business processes. In this extension we have taken into account both the existence of manual tasks carried out by human participants and the fact that processes within a B2B context usually involve the use of distributed functionality, which is normally provided by means of Web Services. Moreover, the use of model transformation techniques (such as the standard QVT) allows us to obtain from business process specifications both (1) the graphical user interfaces that allow the execution of these\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1509"]}
{"title": "A Code Generation Process for Role Classes. An approach based on Formal Techniques and Design Patterns\n", "abstract": " In this work, we present an automatic code generation process from conceptual models. This process incorporates the use of design patterns in OO-Method [9], an automatic software production method, which is built on a formal object-oriented model called OASIS [10]. Our approach defines a precise mapping between conceptual patterns, design patterns and their implementation. Design patterns make code generation process easy because they bring the problem space to the solution space. In order to understand these ideas, we introduce a complete code generation of conceptual models that have player/role relationships. This proposal can be incorporated into CASE tools, making the automation of the software production process feasible.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1509"]}

{"title": "Procesos de Negocio Auto-Adaptables al contexto\u22c6\n", "abstract": " Cuando los procesos de negocio se ejecutan en entornos altamente din\u00e1micos, los continuos cambios de contexto que se dan en dichos entorno obligan a adaptar constantemente estos procesos. Llevar a cabo esta adaptaci\u00f3n de forma manual no es factible debido a la complejidad y al alto coste que esto conlleva. Por lo tanto se requiere de t\u00e9cnicas m\u00e1s avanzadas basadas en auto-adaptaci\u00f3n. Este tipo de t\u00e9cnicas las encontramos en la Computaci\u00f3n Aut\u00f3noma, la cual ofrece la posibilidad de reconfigurar sistemas en base a cambios en el contexto.
