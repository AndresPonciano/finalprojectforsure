In the approaching ubiquitous ear, many self-adaptive applications are emerging. These can be made to adapt to the environment within which the application operates. Context information is the key to producing self-adaptive applications in ubicomp environments. However, the supporting infrastructure that generates context information can be made dynamically responsive to the environment. Therefore, for the development of self-adaptive applications, it is necessary to demonstrate that valid context information can be created by virtual sensors instead of physical sensors. In this paper we present a context aware simulation system called CASS. In particular, it generates the context information associated with virtual sensors and virtual devices in a smart home domain.

The main characteristic of the service-oriented computing paradigm is that service-oriented applications are developed as loosely coupled services that reflect business concerns.

Therefore, to enhance and support the benefits of the service-oriented computing paradigm, we must consider how to improve flexibility and reusability during the development of service-oriented applications.

{"title": "NSAF: An approach for ensuring application-aware routing based on network QoS of applications in SDN\n", "abstract": " The advent of software-defined networking (SDN) has led to the paradigm of programmable network environments. Conceptually, the structure of SDN is divided into three layers: application, control, and infrastructure. The SDN controller in the control layer can configure and execute the routing of applications to the infrastructure layer consisting of network devices, including hosts and switches. Current studies on SDN have predominantly focused on control layer aspects, such as controller development, performance aspects of the controller, and interaction among different controllers and between controllers and network devices. However, to provide seamless network services and efficiently manage network environments, application-aware routing is essential because applications may have different quality of service (QoS) requirements, such as maximum bandwidth and minimum delay. This study proposes the Network Situation-Aware Framework (NSAF) to more efficiently handle application routing based on the QoS requirements and changing network status. A mechanism for supporting the NSAF consisting of application registration, network status monitoring, violation detection, and routing control is also presented. The applicability and feasibility of the proposed NSAF are verified by implementing a prototype. The NSAF may be used as a reference model for efficiently managing SDN-based networks to ensure application QoS.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["2206"]}

An application consisting of microservice units can be developed independently as a service unit, and it can handle individual logic without being affected by other services. In addition, it is possible to rapidly distribute the configured microservices by a container, and a container orchestration technology that manages the distributed multiple containers can be realized; thus, it is possible to update and distribute the microservices separately. Therefore, many companies are moving away from existing monolithic structures and attempting to switch to microservices. In this paper, we present a method for reconstructing a monolithic application into a container-based microservice unit. The microservices of data units are derived through the collection and analysis of monolithic design data. Furthermore, we propose a method to generate a template script based on deployment design data so that the derived microservice and support distribution can be implemented in a container environment. The results of a case study conducted verified that the container-based microservices deployed in this study work properly. In addition, for the development of monolithic applications and the development of container-based microservices presented in this paper, we confirmed that developing on the basis of microservices is efficient by conducting execution time performance evaluation for API calls at various iterations.
