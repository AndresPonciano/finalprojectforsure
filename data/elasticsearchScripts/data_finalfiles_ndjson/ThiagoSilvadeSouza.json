{"title": "Software Accessibility for Visually Impaired People: a systematic mapping study\n", "abstract": " Software accessibility evaluation for visually impaired people is strongly restricted to the Web platform. Many tools are able to automatically evaluate the accessibility degree of a website according to given Web accessibility guidelines. However, these guidelines are not sufficient to objectively evaluate the accessibility of any software product, including desktop and mobile platforms. On the other hand, the ISO/IEC 25000 standards, which provide a conceptual framework for quality specification and evaluation of software products, proposes measures that while providing some guidance on how to observe and measure aspects related to accessibility are relatively abstract. In this context, this work presents a systematic mapping study that tried to identify in the technical literature the attributes and measures of software accessibility for visually impaired people, take into account that visual impairment is the most\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1310"]}

Areas such as Agriculture and Civil Defense require daily climate information more specific than those provided by TV programs. However, professional weather stations usually have high cost and complexity of operation, which restricts its use. This paper presents the ArdWeather, an integrated hardware and software system composed by a low cost weather station and a web application. The station uses an Arduino board equipped with sensors to measure the temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, wind speed, luminance and rain precipitation. The web application can display the data measured, send alerts via Twitter and manage similar weather stations. The features of the application were developed like RESTful Web Services, enabling other applications to integrate to the system.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1310"]}

Although nontoxic, methane is a flammable gas, which can become highly dangerous for humans. In this paper, we introduce BotCH4, an integrated hardware and software system that aims to automatize methane emission monitoring in landfills and biogas production sites. BotCH4 consists of a robot and an Android application. The robot comprises, among other equipment, an Arduino board, a gas sensor and GSM and Bluetooth modules. Through Android application one can remotely control the robot's movements and measure the methane concentration in certain spots. The result in parts per million (ppm) is sent by SMS. The robot also has line followers sensors making it capable of operating in automatic mode, following a predetermined circuit.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1310"]}
