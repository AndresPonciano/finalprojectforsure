{"title": "A distance-based weighted undersampling scheme for support vector machines and its application to imbalanced classification\n", "abstract": " A support vector machine (SVM) plays a prominent role in classic machine learning, especially classification and regression. Through its structural risk minimization, it has enjoyed a good reputation in effectively reducing overfitting, avoiding dimensional disaster, and not falling into local minima. Nevertheless, existing SVMs do not perform well when facing class imbalance and large-scale samples. Undersampling is a plausible alternative to solve imbalanced problems in some way, but suffers from soaring computational complexity and reduced accuracy because of its enormous iterations and random sampling process. To improve their classification performance in dealing with data imbalance problems, this work proposes a weighted undersampling (WU) scheme for SVM based on space geometry distance, and thus produces an improved algorithm named WU-SVM. In WU-SVM, majority samples are grouped\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "63\n", "authors": ["1097"]}
{"title": "Drifted Twitter spam classification using multiscale detection test on KL divergence\n", "abstract": " Twitter spam classification is a tough challenge for social media platforms and cyber security companies. Twitter spam with illegal links may evolve over time in order to deceive filtering models, causing disastrous loss to both users and the whole network. We define this distributional evolution as a concept drift scenario. To build an effective model, we adopt K-L divergence to represent spam distribution and use a multiscale drift detection test (MDDT) to localize possible drifts therein. A base classifier is then retrained based on the detection result to gain performance improvement. Comprehensive experiments show that K-L divergence has highly consistent change patterns between features when a drift occurs. Also, the MDDT is proved to be effective in improving final classification result in both accuracy, recall, and f-measure.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["1097"]}
{"title": "Predicting heat transfer of oscillating heat pipes for machining processes based on extreme gradient boosting algorithm\n", "abstract": " When machining difficult-to-cut materials, a massive heat will generate and then cause serious thermal damages to both workpiece and cutting tools. Oscillating heat pipes have the potential to enhance heat transfer in machining processes. So as to optimize the design and choose suitable cooling methods of the prototype oscillating heat pipes for machining processes, a novel heat transfer prediction model was proposed based on the extreme gradient boosting algorithm. Through this algorithm, the prediction model can be built based on a small-scale experimental dataset with a good prediction result. Dimensionless numbers, heat flux, target temperature, and geometric parameters were selected as inputs of the model. And the effective heat transfer coefficient was the output. The predicted results showed a great agreement with the experimental data. Within the training set range of 4550\u201322,750\u202fW/m2, the mean\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["1097"]}
{"title": "Multiscale drift detection test to enable fast learning in nonstationary environments\n", "abstract": " A model can be easily influenced by unseen factors in nonstationary environments and fail to fit dynamic data distribution. In a classification scenario, this is known as a concept drift. For instance, the shopping preference of customers may change after they move from one city to another. Therefore, a shopping website or application should alter recommendations based on its poorer predictions of such user patterns. In this article, we propose a novel approach called the multiscale drift detection test (MDDT) that efficiently localizes abrupt drift points when feature values fluctuate, meaning that the current model needs immediate adaption. MDDT is based on a resampling scheme and a paired student t-test. It applies a detection procedure on two different scales. Initially, the detection is performed on a broad scale to check if recently gathered drift indicators remain stationary. If a drift is claimed, a narrow scale\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["1097"]}
{"title": "A multiscale concept drift detection method for learning from data streams\n", "abstract": " Concept drifts can occur in data streams, which disable any models built on static data distribution to fit dynamic or recurrent concepts. If there is a feature that can monitor the stableness of such distribution, then we have a proper reference to adapt the model. Based on this idea, we propose a novel approach named Multiscale Drift Detection Test (MDDT) that localizes abrupt drift points when detection feature values fluctuate. MDDT is based on a resampling scheme and a paired student t-test. It applies a detection procedure on a broad and a narrow scale. This multiscale structure not only reduces massive time of a constant checking process, but also filters noise in the detection features. Experiments are performed via synthetic and real-world datasets. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-art algorithms in terms of computation cost and average accuracy.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1097"]}
{"title": "Mobility irregularity detection with smart transit card data\n", "abstract": " Identifying patterns and detecting irregularities regarding individual mobility in public transport system is crucial for transport planning and law enforcement applications (eg, fraudulent behavior). In this context, most of recent approaches exploit similarity learning through comparing spatial-temporal patterns between normal and irregular records. However, they are limited in utilizing passenger-level information. First, all passenger transits are fused in a certain region at a timestamp whereas each passenger has own repetitive stops and time slots. Second, these differences in passenger profile result in high intra-class variance of normal records and blur the decision boundaries. To tackle these problems, we propose a modelling framework to extract passenger-level spatial-temporal profile and present a personalised similarity learning for irregular behavior detection. Specifically, a route-to-stop embedding is\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1097"]}
