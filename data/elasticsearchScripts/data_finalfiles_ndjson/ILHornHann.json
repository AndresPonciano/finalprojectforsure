{"title": "Price dispersion and differentiation in online travel: An empirical investigation\n", "abstract": " Previous research has examined whether price dispersion exists in theoretically highly efficient Internet markets. However, much of the previous work has been focused on industries with low cost and undifferentiated products. In this paper, we examine the presence of price dispersion and product differentiation using data on the airline ticket offerings of online travel agents (OTAs). We find that different OTAs offer tickets with substantially different prices and characteristics when given the same customer request. Some of this variation appears to be due to product differentiation\u2014different OTAs specialize by systematically offering different trade-offs between ticket price and ticket quality (minimizing the number of connections, matching requested departure and return time).

A distinctive feature of this retailer is that it allows consumers to repeatedly submit offers on one and the same product. While consumers could identify the threshold price (the minimum price for which the retailer is willing to sell) by incrementing their offer in small steps in each consecutive round, such a strategy would require them to go through many additional online transactions. We define frictional cost as the disutility that the consumer experiences when conducting an online transaction, such as submitting an offer. Thus, in our setting, consumers trade off a direct financial value (lower price) for frictional costs. Based on a consumer choice model capturing this trade-off, we use the observed consumer behavior to reconstruct the frictional cost parameters for the consumers in our sample.

An examination of dynamic pricing in name-your-own price markets\n", "abstract": " The enhanced abilities of online retailers to learn about their customers' shopping behaviors have increased fears of dynamic pricing, a practice in which a seller sets prices based on the estimated buyer's willingness-to-pay. However, among online retailers, a deviation from a one-price-for-all policy is the exception. When price discrimination is observed, it is often in the context of customer outrage about unfair pricing. One setting where pricing varies is the name-your-own-price (NYOP) mechanism. In contrast to a typical retail setting, in NYOP markets, it is the buyer who places an initial offer. This offer is accepted if it is above some threshold price set by the seller. If the initial offer is rejected, the buyer can update her offer in subsequent rounds. By design, the final purchase price is opaque to the public; the price paid depends on the individual buyer's willingness-to-pay and offer strategy.

This pricing model allows the name-your-own-price retailer to engage in price discrimination: As haggling is costly for the potential buyer, customers with a high willingness to haggle will achieve lower transaction prices. However, because haggling is costly, it reduces overall welfare and diminishes the benefits of price discrimination.

The setting is one in which sellers market some item through solicitations to potential consumers, who differ in their benefit from the item and suffer harm from receiving solicitations. Concealment by one consumer induces sellers to shift solicitations to other consumers, whereas deflection does not. Solicitations cause two externalities: direct harm on consumers and the (indirect) cost of consumer concealment and deflection. We find that in markets where the marginal cost of solicitation is sufficiently low, efforts by low-benefit consumers to conceal themselves will increase the cost-effectiveness of solicitations and lead sellers to market more. However, concealment by high-benefit consumers leads sellers to market less.

Using detailed transaction data and weblog data from a leading online P2P barter market for books, we examine the role of reciprocal relationships in the initiation and fulfillment of exchanges. We find that avid users with a higher demand for books are more likely to establish and utilize reciprocal relationships compared to non-avid users. In examining the value of reciprocal relationships, we find that the use of reciprocal relationships provides significant value throughout the entire market exchange process. First, reciprocal relationships enable an avid user to find new books and new exchange partners through exploratory browsing, which lowers her search costs. Second, browsing reciprocal partners enables an avid user to discover books in new topics, despite that reciprocal partners share similar book tastes with the user. Lastly, reciprocal relationships help improve the exchange outcome through lower rejection rates and faster delivery speeds. Our findings provide important insights into the role of reciprocal relationships in facilitating exchanges in online markets and provide useful implications for the design of decentralized online P2P markets.", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["893"]}

Click stream data have an interesting temporal structure in which sequences of individual page requests are nested within browsing sessions, and some users return to the web site for multiple sessions. We model sequences of page requests within a session using a hidden Markov mixture of first order Markov chains. A second hidden Markov chain describes variation between consecutive web sessions by the same user. Forward-backward recursions can be employed to simultaneously draw both latent Markov chains directly from their joint posterior distribution. The recursions make MCMC posterior simulation particularly efficient. The model allows probabilities of interest, such as the probability that a web session contains a purchase, to be computed directly from model parameters without resorting to Monte Carlo integration. We apply the model to data collected from a small e-commerce site and find that the session-level and page-level hidden Markov chains play different roles. The session-level model discovers a set of \u201csession types\u201d that correspond to recognizable patterns of user behavior.

{"title": "Disillusion of the Democratization of Finance: Housing Prices and Crowdfunding\n", "abstract": " Access to finance is arguably one of the most critical challenges in starting a new business. In this study, we examine how the difficulty of obtaining bank loans based on housing collateral, which is a form of traditional finance, relates to crowdfunding use by entrepreneurs. We obtained data on housing prices related closely to the cost of accessing such bank loans and matched these data to a 2009-2013 novel data set from a leading crowdfunding market. We adopted the first-difference estimator to address unobserved area-specific effects and used housing supply elasticity as an instrument for housing price changes. We found an increased decline in housing prices leads to a significant increase in the creation of crowdfunding projects. However, we did not find significant differential effects in housing price changes between successful and unsuccessful projects. Finally, the effect of housing prices on crowdfunding projects was more significant for areas with low socioeconomic status. Interestingly, the increase in crowdfunding projects in these low status areas was driven wholly by a significant increase in unsuccessful projects, whereas the effect of housing prices on successful projects was significant only in areas of high socioeconomic status. Numerous additional tests support the robustness of our main findings. Overall, our study suggests that crowdfunding can supplement traditional sources of funding, though socioeconomic status may still prevent disadvantaged people from receiving its full benefits.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["893"]}
{"title": "Information spillovers and strategic behaviors in open innovation crowdsourcing contests: an empirical investigation\n", "abstract": " Designing optimal contests is crucial to the success of online crowdsourcing markets that seek to attract a diverse crowd of high quality participants. While there has been some theoretical work examining the design of different types of contests, there are hardly any empirical studies on the effectiveness of different types of contests for crowdsourcing. This study analyzes data from a large online crowdsourcing market for design tasks, to examine the strategic behavior of participants faced with a trade-off between two competing forces in open innovation contests. Open innovation contests typically, make information about contestants and their submissions visible to all participants, thereby allowing later contestants to imitate or learn from earlier entries, favoring later submissions. On the other hand, early entries are more likely to get valuable feedback from the contest holder\u2013feedback that can help these early entrants to significantly revise their solutions and resubmit. Timing of entry, thus, becomes an important strategic choice for contestants. Our findings show that open innovation contests are subject to significant informational spillovers relating to submissions that benefit later entrants. More interestingly, we find that the benefits of informational spillovers from feedback provided to early entries depend on the type of feedback provided. We contrast these findings with the outcomes of blinded contests that prevent informational spillovers. Our findings have interesting implications for the design of innovation contests, as well as for market makers, and for contest holders in online crowdsourcing markets.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["893"]}
{"title": "Sales and promotions: A more general model\n", "abstract": " We embed the Varian (1980) model in a broader setting that considers how switcher/loyal customer segments are determined. Generally, customer acquisition is deterministic while pricing is randomized. The equilibrium outcome depends on the timing of customer acquisition relative to pricing. If sellers acquire customers before setting prices, the unique equilibrium is asymmetric. If sellers acquire customers and set prices simultaneously, the unique equilibrium is symmetric. Our results provide a fundamental justification for previous analyses that variously assumed the outcome to be asymmetric or symmetric. The comparative statics for the asymmetric and symmetric equilibria are identical.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["893"]}

{"title": "Combating Prerelease Piracy: Modeling the Effects of Antipiracy Measures in P2P Networks\n", "abstract": " The short period right after the release of a song is typically associated with extensive publicity and the highest sales. However, these songs are often found well before the official release date on peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. Not surprisingly, the industry considers this so-called \u201cprerelease\u201d piracy to be extremely damaging to the potential sales of a song. In this paper, we analyze the effect of antipiracy measures on the propagation of unauthorized content in P2P networks. For this purpose, we develop a model that describes the dynamics of demand and supply of piracy from the early stages. Using a unique data set, we quantify the impact of antipiracy measures; specifically, we analyze two antipiracy measures: the reduction of file supply and the reduction of file demand. We find that the impact of a demand reduction on demand is greater than the impact of a supply reduction on supply.

{"title": "The Role of Platforms in Reconciling Logic Pluralism? A Study of Indie App Developers on the iOS Platform\n", "abstract": " The software development field has inherently been identified with two field-level institutional logics: logic of the profession and logic of the markets. Traditionally, information systems development methodologies (ISD) have been utilized to reconcile the competing demands from these two logics. In this paper, we study how these two logics manifest in a platform-centric software development context where significant entrepreneurial opportunities are created for independent third-party app developers (indies). Specifically, we study how indie developers manage the two logics on the iOS platform, under the influence of the platform owner Apple. We first identify practices of indie developers consistent with the two field logics across three entrepreneurial domains: app ideation, execution and marketing. Second, we identify areas where the two field logics may be in conflict as well as in coexistence. We show that indie developers enact logic conflict through disagreement and denunciation of the opposing logic. When logics that are inherently opposed appear to coexist, we investigate how app developers manage these opposing demands through a process that we term logic synthesis. We integrate the platform\u2019s impact on indie developers\u2019 logic enactment and logic synthesis. Using a grounded theory approach, we provide a model of field-level market and professional logics operating in mobile app platforms and the practices reflecting such logics within the indie developer community. Our work contributes to the growing literature on platform governance and platform ecosystems, in addition to furthering the study of institutional logics in technology\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["893"]}

Using detailed transaction data and weblog data from a leading online market for book exchanges, we find that there is a dichotomy in users\u2019 exchange orientations: whereas non-avid users are transaction-oriented, avid users are forward-looking and relation-oriented. We further show that the magnitude of relational orientation for avid users is influenced by the breadth of interests. The differences in exchange relationships are evidenced not only in market participants\u2019 choice of transacting partner, but also in how they search for partners in the market. We discuss the implication of our findings for the design of online peer-to-peer markets.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["893"]}
{"title": "The adoption of multi-generational platforms in the presence of intergenerational services\n", "abstract": " We investigate the impact of intergenerational services on the adoption of multi-generational platforms. We consider mobile Internet platform generations for which users download complementary services from third party providers. These services are often intergenerational: newer platforms are backward compatible with respect to services released under older platform generations. In this paper, we develop a model to identify the main drivers of adoption of subsequent generations of mobile Internet platforms, including (i) the migration from older to newer platform generations,(ii) the indirect network effect between platform users and services, and (iii) the effect of intergenerational services on platform adoption. Using data on mobile Internet platform adoption and services consumption from a major wireless carrier in an Asian country for the time period of 2001-2007, we estimate the three effects noted above. We show that both the migration from older to newer platform generations and the indirect network effect are significant. The surprising finding is that intergenerational services that connect subsequent generations of platforms essentially engender backward compatibility with two opposing effects. While an intergenerational service may accelerate the migration to the subsequent platform generations, it may also, perhaps unintentionally, provide a fresh lease on life for older generation platforms due to the continued use of older generation services on newer platform generations. This' shot in the arm'effect for older generation platforms is due to the users who adopt an older generation platform instead of adopting a newer one.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["893"]}

Under explored in the literature are situations when the two logics are experienced simultaneously by one professional group or even one individual. Using a qualitative approach, this study intends to shed some light on the issue by studying logic synthesis practices of independent (Indie) app entrepreneurs. The opening of and infrastructure support from mobile software platforms has created ample entrepreneurial opportunities for independent third-party developers. In the meantime, it also exposes developers to the challenges of logic tensions.

{"title": "Risk Averse Bidding in Name-Your-Own-Price Channels\n", "abstract": " The Name-Your-Own-Price (NYOP) model has found recent popularity on the internet through many channels such as Priceline. com. In the NYOP setting, a bidder places a single bid that is either accepted or rejected based on the seller\u2019s reservation price. The reservation price is the lowest the firm is willing to accept to sell the item. Unlike second price auctions, where bidders have an incentive to place their true value for the item (which we refer to as their personal indifferent buying price, PIBP), NYOP settings induce bidders to offer less than their PIBP by a certain amount in order to get a \u201cdeal\u201d out of the auction. The exact amount by which bidders reduce their offers depends on their belief about the firm\u2019s reservation price and their attitude towards risk (Oren and Rothkopf, 1975; Rothkopf and Harstad 1994; and Waehrer, Harstad and Rothkopf 1998).While many NYOP auctions restrict bidders to a single offer, some retailers favor a repeat-bidding format. This repeat bidding strategy enables some sophisticated bidders to gain additional benefits from the NYOP auction by acquiring an item at a lower price. The single-bid as well as the repeated-bid has offered researchers a fertile ground. Previous literature has examined the role of frictional costs (Hann and Terwiesch 2003); profit implications of single vs. repeated bid (Fay 2004); optimal threshold price policies for the NYOP retailer (Terwiesch, Savin, Hann 2005), the role of emotion based utilities in addition to economic utility (Ding et al. 2005). Consumer behavior based research, such as the comparison of price naming vs. price selection has been discussed by Chernov (2003).
