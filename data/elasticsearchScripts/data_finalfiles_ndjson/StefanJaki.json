{"title": "Safety and Security in a Smart Production Environment\n", "abstract": " Industry 4.0 is the term which designates an engineering philosophy of a modern, automated manufacturing technology. It includes tight cooperation of robots and humans and a seamless integration of the Information Technology (IT) and the Operation Technology (OT). Wired or wireless interconnection of devices and machinery across the existing manufacturing components plant borders. A data driven product life cycle starts with product concept ideas, and proceeds with the design, production and testing, commercialization and to end with the decommissioning of the product. Industry 4.0 also defines the smart factory where a smart product guides the production process and issues commands to the machinery about the necessary steps to take to produce the desired product. This paper contains the idea and a solution for a smart factory with a mobile robot, operating with secured product configuration\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1680"]}
