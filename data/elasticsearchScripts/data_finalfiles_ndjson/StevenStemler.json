Rather than representing a single concept, different.. statistical methods for computing interrater reliability can be more accurately classified into one of three.. categories based upon the underlying goals of analysis. The three general categories introduced and.. described in this paper are: 1) consensus estimates, 2) consistency estimates, and 3) measurement estimates... The assumptions, interpretation, advantages, and disadvantages of estimates from each of these three.. categories are discussed, along with several popular methods of computing interrater reliability coefficients.. that fall under the umbrella of consensus, consistency, and measurement estimates. Researchers and.. practitioners should be aware that different approaches to estimating interrater reliability carry with them.. different implications for how ratings across multiple judges should be summarized, which may impact the.. validity of subsequent study results.

For National Universities this was the most frequently cited objective across the entire sample, edging out other priorities such as writing, quantitative reasoning, and information literacy. The importance of developing the intercultural competence of students has been emphasized by private-sector businesses as well.

Health care providers have reported that a myopic focus on the results of educational tests may lead students to experience greater levels of psychopathology associated with stress and anxiety (Kadison & DiGeronimo, 2004), and researchers have found that the enormous pressure to do well on these tests has also led to a degradation of moral behavior (eg, increased cheating) not only on the part of students, but also on the part of teachers and administrators (Nichols & Berliner, 2007).

{"title": "Best practices in quantitative methods\n", "abstract": " For example, court cases based on a trial by jury require unanimous agreement from jurors regarding the verdict, life\u2013threatening medical diagnoses often require a second or third opinion from health care professionals, student essays written in the context of high\u2013stakes standardized testing receive points based on the judgment of multiple readers, and Olympic competitions, such as figure skating, award medals to participants based on quantitative ratings of performance provided by an international panel of judges.Any time multiple judges are used to determine important outcomes, certain technical and procedural questions emerge. Some of the more common questions are as follows: How many raters do we need to be confident in our results? What is the minimum level of agreement that my raters should achieve? And is it necessary for raters to agree exactly, or is it acceptable for them to differ from each other so long as their difference is systematic and can therefore be corrected?", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1029"]}

Indeed, most admissions officers, at least in the United States, think about admissions in terms of \u201ccreating a class\u201d of students who will inhabit the institution and who will reflect many different types of diversity (Steinberg, 2002; Stevens, 2009; Zimdars, 2016). Efforts to bring diverse students to campus are prioritized because it is thought that students will benefit from informal interactions that take place outside of class time: in the dorms, at the dining hall, at the gym, in club meetings, at parties, at university events, etc. From an admissions point of view, these informal interactions also bring with them the opportunity for students to develop core competencies such as communication skills, ethical reasoning, and intercultural competence.

{"title": "The assessment of aptitude.\n", "abstract": " The construct of aptitude is often mentioned alongside ability and achievement. Many introductory texts on testing and measurement (eg, Cohen & Swerdlik, 2005; Gregory, 2007; Kaplan & Saccuzzo, 2009) distinguish among these three terms in roughly the following way: Achievements represent past accomplishments or performance, abilities are skills that one can perform right here and now in the present, and aptitude reveals an individual\u2019s capacity for future performance. Although this simple heuristic is relatively useful at a general level, the specific definition of aptitude as well as procedures for assessing it remain hotly contested topics. Thus, the aim of this chapter is twofold. First, it attempts to describe some of the most controversial elements that serve to define aptitude and highlights areas in the literature where researchers differ. Second, it explores current efforts to assess aptitude, particularly in the context\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1029"]}

{"title": "There is More to Teaching Than Instruction: Seven Strategies for Dealing With the Social Side of Teaching\n", "abstract": " Imagine a first-year teacher in a high-school science classroom. The teacher holds a bachelor\u2019s degree in chemistry, and has successfully completed student teaching, passed the state certification examination, and received a teaching license. Two months into the school year, the teacher is beginning to develop a good relationship with the students. One day, a student approaches the teacher after class and asks if the teacher would like to go grab some coffee after school. How should the teacher deal with this situation? Now, think about a middle-school teacher who has been asked by the principal to prepare a teaching portfolio for evaluation. Over the course of several weeks, the teacher devotes a tremendous amount of time and energy outside of the classroom pulling the packet together. The teacher submits the portfolio to the principal thinking that it is a good piece of work and that the principal will really like it. When the teacher receives feedback from the principal, the teacher is disappointed to find that the portfolio received an evaluation of \u201caverage\u201d as opposed to \u201cexcellent\u201d or even \u201cgood.\u201d How should the teacher deal with this situation? Finally, consider an elementary-school teacher who is engaged in a phone call with an angry parent. The teacher called the parent to discuss possible reasons why the parent\u2019s child might have performed so poorly on the last reading exam. In the middle of the conversation, the parent begins launching personal attacks against the teacher. How should the teacher deal with this situation?When most people are asked to think of what it means to teach, their minds immediately conjure up images related to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1029"]}
{"title": "Are creative people better than others at recognizing creative work?\n", "abstract": " It is often assumed that people with high ability in a domain will be excellent raters of quality within that same domain. This assumption is an underlying principle of using raters for creativity tasks, as in the Consensual Assessment Technique. While several prior studies have examined expert-novice differences in ratings, none have examined whether experts\u2019 ability to identify the quality of a creative product is being driven more by their ability to identify high quality work, low quality work, or both. To address this question, a sample of 142 participants completed individual difference measures and rated the quality of several sets of creative captions. Unbeknownst to the participants, the captions had been identified a prior by expert raters as being of particularly high or low quality. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that after controlling for participants\u2019 background and personality, those who scored significantly\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1029"]}
{"title": "Automated Essay Scoring: A human's review.\n", "abstract": " In the technologically oriented 21st century, many routine tasks once performed by humans have become machine-automated. This trend has even reached the field of educational assessment via automated essay scoring. But just how advanced is the computer technology for scoring student essays? Can computer programs designed to score student essays capture the same qualities in their ratings as those captured by humans? And what are the advantages of automating essay scoring, anyway? These are some of the key questions addressed by Shermis and Burstein's edited volume (see record 2003-02475-000). The book provides a fair review of the state of the art of automated essay scoring, with several different chapters discussing the range of available automated scoring programs. The reviewer felt that the biggest problems with the current volume were editorial in nature. To begin with, the target\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1029"]}
{"title": "Rasch Measurement v. Item Response Theory: Knowing When to Cross the Line\n", "abstract": " When students receive the same score on a test, does that mean they know the same amount about the topic? The answer to this question is more complex than it may first appear. This paper compares classical and modern test theories in terms of how they estimate student ability. Crucial distinctions between the aims of Rasch Measurement and IRT are highlighted. By modeling a second parameter (item discrimination) and allowing item characteristic curves to cross, as IRT models do, more information is incorporated into the estimate of person ability, but the measurement scale is no longer guaranteed to have the same meaning for all test takers. We explicate the distinctions between approaches and using a simulation in R (code provided) demonstrate that IRT ability estimates for the same individual can vary substantially in ways that are heavily dependent upon the particular sample of people taking a test whereas Rasch person ability estimates are sample-free and test-free under varying conditions. These points are particularly relevant in the context of standards-based assessment and computer adaptive testing where the aim is to be able to say precisely what all individuals know and can do at each level of ability.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1029"]}

{"title": "Examining the construct and cross-cultural validity of the Teaching Excellence Rating Scale (TERS).\n", "abstract": " Two studies were done to examine the validity of a newly developed rating scale designed to measure teaching excellence. The instrument consists of 23 items that were drawn from an analysis of various \u201cTeacher of the Year\u201d award criteria. In Study 1, school principals in the United States (N= 218) were asked to use the scale to evaluate a target teacher from their school who had agreed to participate in the study. Exploratory factor analysis yielded a two-factor solution (pedagogical orientation and social orientation) that accounted for 73% of variance in the dataset. Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated that a correlated two-factor model fit the data significantly better than competing models that have been proposed in the literature. In Study 2, the cross-cultural equivalence of the instrument was evaluated by comparing the principal ratings of the US teachers to the principal ratings of a sample of Russian\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1029"]}
