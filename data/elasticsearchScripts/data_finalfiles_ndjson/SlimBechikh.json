Feature selection aims at selecting relevant features from the original feature set, which could be less informative to achieve good performance.

In this paper, we propose a bi-level evolutionary approach for efficient feature selection and simultaneous feature construction and feature weighting, called Bi-level Weighted-Features Construction (BWFC).

They may allow not only dimensionality reduction but also classifier accuracy and efficiency improvement. These two techniques are of great importance especially for the case of high-dimensional data. Feature construction for high-dimensional data is still a very challenging topic. This can be explained by the large search space of feature combinations, whose size is a function of the number of features. Recently, researchers have used Genetic Programming (GP) for feature construction and the obtained results were promising. Unfortunately, the wrapper evaluation of each feature subset, where a feature can be constructed by a combination of features, is computationally intensive since such evaluation requires running the classifier on the data sets.

In these problems, the optimal solutions to the lower level problem become possible feasible candidates to the upper level problem. Such a requirement makes the optimization problem difficult to solve, and has kept the researchers busy towards devising methodologies, which can efficiently handle the problem. In recent decades, it is observed that many efficient optimizations using modern advanced EAs have been achieved via the incorporation of domain specific knowledge. In such a way, the embedment of domain knowledge about an underlying problem into the search algorithms can enhance properly the evolutionary search performance.

When several objectives are optimized in each level, the BLOP becomes a multi-objective task and more computationally costly as the optimum corresponds to a whole non-dominated solution set, called the PF (Pareto Front).

In this context, we are interested in this paper to the car-following driving behavior problem, since it alone accounts for almost 70% of road accidents, which they are caused by the incorrect judgment of the driver to keep a safe distance. Thus, we propose in this paper a decision-making model based on bi-level modeling, whose objective is to ensure the integration between road safety and the reducing travel time. To ensure this objective, we used the fuzzy logic approach to model the anticipation concept in order to extract more unobservable data from the road environment.

One of the main difficulties in bi-clustering is the issue of finding the number of bi-clusters, which is usually a user-specified parameter. Recently, in 2017, a new multi-objective evolutionary clustering algorithm, called MOCK-II, has shown its effectiveness in data clustering while automatically determining the number of clusters. Motivated by the promising results of MOCK-II, we propose in this paper a hybrid extension of this algorithm for the case of bi-clustering. Our new algorithm, called MOBICK, uses an efficient solution encoding, an effective crossover operator, and a heuristic mutation strategy. Similarly to MOCK-II, MOBICK is able to find automatically the number of bi-clusters.

In this study, we use three approaches, traditional oversampling technique, traditional undersampling technique, and the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), to reduce the significant difference of imbalance of the number of samples between the majority classes and the minority classes in the dataset.

{"title": "Advances in evolutionary multi-objective optimization\n", "abstract": " Most real world optimization problems involve the simultaneous minimization and/or maximization of multiple (possibly) conflicting objectives while respecting some constraints. Unlike single-objective optimization, the solution of a Multi-objective Optimization Problem (MOP) gives rise to a set of trade-off solutions, each expressing a particular compromise among the different objectives. The image of these trade-off solutions in objective space is called the Pareto Front (PF). The main goal of a multi-objective optimizer is to provide an approximation of the true PF as accurate as possible, while ensuring a uniform distribution of solutions along it. Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) have shown a great success in approximating the PF over more than two decades [1],[4].

Thus, this uncertainty should be taken into account and then processed by detection tools. Unfortunately, these latter usually reject and/or ignore uncertain data that correspond to software classes (ie dataset instances) with uncertain labels.
