{"title": "Rumors, false flags, and digital vigilantes: Misinformation on twitter after the 2013 boston marathon bombing\n", "abstract": " The Boston Marathon bombing story unfolded on every possible carrier of information available in the spring of 2013, including Twitter. As information spread, it was filled with rumors (unsubstantiated information), and many of these rumors contained misinformation. Earlier studies have suggested that crowdsourced information flows can correct misinformation, and our research investigates this proposition. This exploratory research examines three rumors, later demonstrated to be false, that circulated on Twitter in the aftermath of the bombings. Our findings suggest that corrections to the misinformation emerge but are muted compared with the propagation of the misinformation. The similarities and differences we observe in the patterns of the misinformation and corrections contained within the stream over the days that followed the attacks suggest directions for possible research strategies to automatically detect misinformation.", "num_citations": "357\n", "authors": ["2099"]}

Over a ten-month period, we collected tweets related to alternative narratives\u2014for example, conspiracy theories\u2014of mass shooting events. We utilized tweeted URLs to generate a domain network, connecting domains shared by the same user, then conducted qualitative analysis to understand the nature of different domains and how they connect to each other. Our findings demonstrate how alternative news sites propagate and shape alternative narratives, while mainstream media deny them. We explain how political leanings of alternative news sites do not align well with a US left-right spectrum, but instead feature an anti-globalist (versus globalist) orientation where US Alt-Right sites look similar to US Alt-Left sites. Our findings describe a subsection of the emerging alternative media ecosystem and provide insight in how websites that promote conspiracy theories and pseudo-science may function to conduct underlying political agendas.", "num_citations": "226\n", "authors": ["2099"]}

{"title": "Examining the Role of Human and Technical Infrastructure during Emergency Response.\n", "abstract": " Infrastructures\u2014both technical and human\u2014are critical components of emergency response, helping to facilitate and shape both formal work practices and the improvisational work that individuals and organizations take part in as they address emergent challenges during unpredictable events. This research explores the relationships between infrastructure and collaborative work in this context, at a time when the infrastructures themselves are rapidly changing and/or under pressure to change due to the introduction of new technology. We interviewed 17 emergency workers from region that had recently experienced a major emergency response. These interviews illuminate weaknesses in some of the systems designed to support the information and communication needs of emergency workers, and demonstrate emergency workers assembling their own ICT infrastructures using familiar off-the-shelf tools like social media platforms and shared Google documents. These findings also highlight the importance of human infrastructure in supporting improvisation and collaboration among emergency workers.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["2099"]}

{"title": "Language Limitations in Rumor Research? Comparing French and English Tweets Sent During the 2015 Paris Attacks.\n", "abstract": " The ubiquity of social media facilitates widespread participation in crises. As individuals converge online to understand a developing situation, rumors can emerge. Little is currently known about how online rumoring behavior varies by language. Exploring a rumor from the 2015 Paris Attacks, we investigate Twitter rumoring behaviors across two languages: French, the primary language of the affected population; and English, the dominant language of Internet communication. We utilize mixed methods to qualitatively code and quantitatively analyze rumoring behaviors across French and English language tweets. Most interestingly, temporal engagement in the rumor varies across languages, but proportions of tweets affirming and denying a rumor are very similar. Analyzing tweet deletions and retweet counts, we find slight (but not significant) differences between languages. This work offers insight into potential limitations of previous research of online rumoring, which often focused exclusively on English language content, and demonstrates the importance of considering language in future work.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["2099"]}

The process of collecting, analyzing, and reporting on this kind of data is complex and nuanced. It is especially challenging as online actors attempt to undermine their work. Through in-depth interviews with twelve journalists, we explore how they investigate and report on online misinformation and disinformation. Our findings reveal some of the unique challenges of reporting on this beat, as well as the ways in which reporters overcome those challenges.

{"title": "Expressed Uncertainty and Denials as Signals of Online Rumoring\n", "abstract": " Social media platforms are important venues for communication during crisis events; both the public and emergency responders use online platforms to discover and curate event-related information. While many recognize the value of social media as an information source during crisis settings, there is also concern about misinformation [Sutton et al. 2008, Hughes and Palen 2012]. To ground our exploration of misinformation within online spaces, we leverage theories of rumoring behavior\u2014a topic of longstanding interest in the social sciences [Caplow 1947, Allport and Postman 1947, Spiro et al. 2012]. Prior studies of rumoring, both during disasters and under more general circumstances, frame the \u201ccollective sensemaking\u201d process that often occurs as a response to uncertainty within the information space. Such rumoring behavior often occurs during periods of collective stress, such as disasters, and in cases where official sources of news are unavailable (or insufficiently timely)[Shibutani 1966]. We hope that understanding the collective sensemaking process will inform automated methods of detecting rumors on social media platforms during crisis events.1.1 Project Goals: Using Crowd Activity to Detect Misinformation Our research aims to leverage the \u201ccollective intelligence\u201d of the online crowd to identify rumors. Vieweg et al.[2008] and Starbird [2013] used the term \u201ccollective intelligence\u201d to characterize the online crowd\u2019s work to identify, verify and amplify actionable information during crises. Starbird [2013] demonstrated how a network of social media users performed as a collective sensor for \u201cgood\u201d information after a major earthquake\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["2099"]}

{"title": "An agenda for disinformation research\n", "abstract": " In the 21st Century information environment, adversarial actors use disinformation to manipulate public opinion. The distribution of false, misleading, or inaccurate information with the intent to deceive is an existential threat to the United States--distortion of information erodes trust in the socio-political institutions that are the fundamental fabric of democracy: legitimate news sources, scientists, experts, and even fellow citizens. As a result, it becomes difficult for society to come together within a shared reality; the common ground needed to function effectively as an economy and a nation. Computing and communication technologies have facilitated the exchange of information at unprecedented speeds and scales. This has had countless benefits to society and the economy, but it has also played a fundamental role in the rising volume, variety, and velocity of disinformation. Technological advances have created new opportunities for manipulation, influence, and deceit. They have effectively lowered the barriers to reaching large audiences, diminishing the role of traditional mass media along with the editorial oversight they provided. The digitization of information exchange, however, also makes the practices of disinformation detectable, the networks of influence discernable, and suspicious content characterizable. New tools and approaches must be developed to leverage these affordances to understand and address this growing challenge.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["2099"]}
{"title": "Detecting Journalism in the Age of Social Media: Three Experiments in Classifying Journalists on Twitter\n", "abstract": " The widespread adoption of networked information and communications technologies (ie ICTs) blurs traditional boundaries between journalist and citizen. The role of the journalist is adapting to structural changes in the news industry and dynamic audience expectations. For researchers who seek to understand what, if any, distinct role journalists play in the production and propagation of breaking news, it is vital to be able to identify journalists in social media spaces. In many cases, this can be challenging due to the limited information and metadata about social media users. In this work, we use a supervised machine learning model to automatically distinguish journalists from non-journalists in social media spaces. Leveraging Twitter data collected from three crisis events of different types, we examine how profile information, social network structure, posting behavior and language distinguish journalists from others. Additionally, we evaluate how the performance of the journalist classification model varies by context (ie types of crisis events) and by journalism outlets (ie print versus broadcast journalism), and discuss challenges in automatic journalist detection. Implications of this work are discussed; in particular we argue for the value of such methods for scaling analysis in journalism studies beyond the capacity of human coders. Employing classification methods in this context allows for systematic, large-scale studies of the role of journalists online.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["2099"]}

{"title": "Combining interventions to reduce the spread of viral misinformation\n", "abstract": " Misinformation online poses a range of threats, from subverting democratic processes to undermining public health measures. Proposed solutions range from encouraging more selective sharing by individuals, to platform removal of false content and accounts that create or promote it. How, whether, and which strategies to implement depends on their relative and combined ability to reduce viral misinformation spread at practical levels of enforcement. Here we provide a framework to evaluate interventions aimed at reducing viral misinformation online both in isolation and when used in combination. We begin by deriving a generative model of viral misinformation spread, inspired by research on infectious disease. Applying this model to a large corpus of misinformation events that occurred during the 2020 US election, we reveal that commonly proposed interventions--including removal of content, virality circuit breakers, nudges, and account banning---are unlikely to be effective in isolation without extreme censorship. However, our framework demonstrates that a combined approach can achieve a substantial,~ 50%, reduction in the prevalence of misinformation. Our results challenge claims that combating misinformation will require new ideas or high costs to user expression. Instead, we highlight a practical path forward as misinformation online continues to threaten vaccination efforts, equity, and democratic processes around the globe.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["2099"]}

In part due to the public availability of tweets, this study focuses specifically on Twitter activity\u2014and then uses that activity to get some sense of the surrounding information space (using links within tweets). We recognize that this provides a limited view of the broader conversation, but it does provide some insight into the structure and dynamics of online political discourse. For ongoing research, we have been collecting data in real time, using the Twitter streaming API to track specific keyword terms related to breaking news events. The study presented here focuses on tweets that included the term NATO in the text and were sent between February 25, 2018, and June 17, 2018 (a few days after the close of the 2018 NATO summit). We then filtered this dataset to include only English-language tweets, limiting the scope of the investigation to messages written by or for English-speaking audiences. This Spring 2018 NATO Dataset includes 1,353,620 tweets posted from 513,285 distinct accounts.To understand these data, we used a grounded, interpretative, mixed-method approach, integrating qualitative, quantitative, and visual analyses to examine the data from multiple levels\u2014from \u201c10,000 feet\u201d views to tweet-by-tweet analysis.
