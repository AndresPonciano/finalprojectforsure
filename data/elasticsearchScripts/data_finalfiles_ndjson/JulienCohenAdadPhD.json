Nonetheless, unaliasing simultaneously acquired, closely spaced slices with parallel imaging methods can be difficult, leading to high g-factor penalties (i.e., lower SNR). The CAIPIRINHA technique was developed to reduce the g-factor in simultaneous multi-slice acquisitions by introducing inter-slice image shifts and thus increase the distance between aliased voxels. Because the CAIPIRINHA technique achieved this by controlling the phase of the RF excitations for each line of k-space, it is not directly applicable to single-shot EPI employed in conventional diffusion imaging.

Cross-sectional area (CSA) that has been shown to be a marker of lower motor neuron degeneration was measured in cervical and upper thoracic spinal cord from T2-weighted images. Fractional anisotropy (FA), axial/radial/mean diffusivities (\u03bb\u22a5, \u03bb//, MD) and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) were measured within the lateral corticospinal tract in the cervical region. Imaging metrics were compared with clinical scales: Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) and manual muscle testing (MMT) score.  Results At MRI1, CSA correlated significantly (P<0.05) with MMT and arm ALSFRS-R scores. FA correlated significantly with leg ALFSRS-R scores. One year after MRI1, CSA predicted (P<0.01) arm ALSFSR-R subscore and FA predicted (P<0.01) leg ALSFRS-R subscore. From MRI1 to MRI2, significant changes (P<0.01) were detected for CSA and MTR. CSA rate of change (i.e. atrophy) highly correlated (P<0.01) with arm ALSFRS-R and arm MMT subscores rate of change.  Conclusion Atrophy and DTI metrics predicted ALS disease progression.

We recently developed the PropSeg method, which allows for fast, accurate and automatic segmentation of the SC on different types of MRI contrast (e.g., T 1 -, T 2 - and T 2 *-weighted sequences) and any field of view. However, comparing measurements from the SC between subjects is hindered by the lack of a generic coordinate system for the SC. In this paper, we present a new framework combining PropSeg and a vertebral level identification method, thereby enabling direct inter- and intra-subject comparison of SC measurements for large cohort studies as well as for longitudinal studies.

{"title": "Simultaneous brain\u2013cervical cord fMRI reveals intrinsic spinal cord plasticity during motor sequence learning\n", "abstract": " The spinal cord participates in the execution of skilled movements by translating high-level cerebral motor representations into musculotopic commands. Yet, the extent to which motor skill acquisition relies on intrinsic spinal cord processes remains unknown. To date, attempts to address this question were limited by difficulties in separating spinal local effects from supraspinal influences through traditional electrophysiological and neuroimaging methods. Here, for the first time, we provide evidence for local learning-induced plasticity in intact human spinal cord through simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spinal cord during motor sequence learning. Specifically, we show learning-related modulation of activity in the C6\u2013C8 spinal region, which is independent from that of related supraspinal sensorimotor structures. Moreover, a brain\u2013spinal cord functional connectivity analysis demonstrates that the initial linear relationship between the spinal cord and sensorimotor cortex gradually fades away over the course of motor sequence learning, while the connectivity between spinal activity and cerebellum gains strength. These data suggest that the spinal cord not only constitutes an active functional component of the human motor learning network but also contributes distinctively from the brain to the learning process. The present findings open new avenues for rehabilitation of patients with spinal cord injuries, as they demonstrate that this part of the central nervous system is much more plastic than assumed before.

DTI parameters are sensitive to changes in the diseased SC. However, imaging the cord can be technically challenging due to various factors including its small size, patient-related and physiological motion, and field inhomogeneities. Rapid acquisition sequences such as Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) are desirable but may suffer from image distortions.

While several software packages have been proposed, their interface is sometimes limited and/or they are designed to work with a specific modality (e.g., scanning electron microscopy only). Here we introduce AxonSeg, which allows to perform automatic axon and myelin segmentation on histology images, and to extract relevant morphometric information, such as axon diameter distribution, axon density and the myelin g-ratio. AxonSeg includes a simple and intuitive MATLAB-based graphical user interface and can easily be adapted to a variety of imaging modalities. The main steps of AxonSeg consist of: (i) image pre-processing, (ii) pre-segmentation of axons over a cropped image and discriminant analysis to select the best parameters based on axon shape and intensity information, (iii) automatic axon and myelin segmentation over the full image and (iv) atlas-based statistics to extract morphometric information. Segmentation results from standard optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy are presented, along with validation against manual segmentations. Being fully-automatic after a quick manual intervention on a cropped image, we believe AxonSeg will be useful to researchers interested in large throughput histology.

The existence of a comprehensive and structured database of axonal measurements in healthy and disease models could help the validation of results obtained by different researchers. The purpose of this article is to provide such a database on healthy SC WM, to discuss the potential sources of variability and to suggest avenues for robust and accurate quantification of axon morphometry based on novel acquisition and processing techniques. The article is organized in three sections. The first section reviews morphometric results across species according to range of densities and counts of myelinated axons, axon diameter and myelin thickness, and characteristics of unmyelinated axons in different regions. The second section discusses the sources of variability across studies, such as age, sex, spinal pathways, spinal levels, statistical power and terminology in regard to tracts and protocols. The third section presents new techniques and perspectives that could benefit histology studies. For example, coherent anti-stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) imaging can provide sub-micrometric resolution without the need for fixation and staining, while slide scanners and stitching algorithms can provide full cross-sectional area of SC. In combination with these acquisition techniques, automatic segmentation algorithms for delineating axons and myelin sheath can help provide large-scale statistics on axon\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "39\n", "authors": ["887"]}

This generalization gap can be mitigated through some techniques, which are not mutually-exclusive. One common denominator of all deep learning methods is that the more data there is to train a model, the better it will perform. While it is not easy for single sites to generate a large amount of data and manual labels, multi-center initiatives and crowd sourcing are efficient approaches to federate such useful resources (5). Depending on the country, ethical and privacy limitations may occur. Another popular approach to solve the problem of generalization to other sites is to perform a domain adaptation (6), where data from another domain can be transferred to the current distribution thereby improving generalization. Other approaches rely on generative models, however, most prominent generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)(7) usually require a large amount of data and it can take shortcuts to model the underlying distribution. Recent likelihood-based models (8) showed some improvements, however, it is still very difficult to model such highdimensional distributions. Another approach, also leveraging unlabeled data, is the use of semi-supervised (9) learning methods, that can yield improvements even in a small data regime.From a different angle, one way to minimize the burden of creating manual annotations is to use active learning, whereby the most uncertain predictions are selected for manual correction before re-training the model (10).

Here, we assessed the reproducibility of MWF measurements in regional and global white matter in 10 healthy human brains across two sites with two different 3 T magnetic resonance imaging scanner vendors (Philips and Siemens), using a 32-echo gradient and spin echo (GRASE) sequence. A strong correlation was found between the MWF measurements in the global white matter (Pearson\u2019s r = 0.91; p < 0.001) for all participants across the two sites. The mean intersite MWF coefficient of variation across participants was 2.77 % in the global white matter and ranged from 4.47 % (splenium of the corpus callosum) to 17.89 % (genu of the corpus callosum) in white matter regions of interest. Bland-Altman analysis showed a good agreement in MWF measurements between the two sites with small bias of 0.002. Overall, MWF estimates were in good agreement across the two sites and scanner vendors. Our findings support the use of quantitative multi-echo T2 relaxation metrics, such as the MWF, in multicenter studies and clinical trials to gain deeper understanding about the pathological processes\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["887"]}
{"title": "Test-retest reliability of myelin imaging in the human spinal cord: Measurement errors versus region-and aging-induced variations\n", "abstract": " Purpose To implement a statistical framework for assessing the precision of several quantitative MRI metrics sensitive to myelin in the human spinal cord: T1, Magnetization Transfer Ratio (MTR), saturation imposed by an off-resonance pulse (MTsat) and Macromolecular Tissue Volume (MTV).   Methods Thirty-three healthy subjects within two age groups (young, elderly) were scanned at 3T. Among them, 16 underwent the protocol twice to assess repeatability. Statistical reliability indexes such as the Minimal Detectable Change (MDC) were compared across metrics quantified within different cervical levels and white matter (WM) sub-regions. The differences between pathways and age groups were quantified and interpreted in context of the test-retest repeatability of the measurements.   Results The MDC was respectively 105.7ms, 2.77%, 0.37% and 4.08% for T1, MTR, MTsat and MTV when quantified over all WM, while the standard-deviation across subjects was 70.5ms, 1.34%, 0.20% and 2.44%. Even though particular WM regions did exhibit significant differences, these differences were on the same order as test-retest errors. No significant difference was found between age groups for all metrics.   Conclusion While T1-based metrics (T1 and MTV) exhibited better reliability than MT-based measurements (MTR and MTsat), the observed differences between subjects or WM regions were comparable to (and often smaller than) the MDC. This makes it difficult to determine if observed changes are due to variations in myelin content, or simply due to measurement error. Measurement error remains a challenge in spinal cord myelin imaging, but this\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["887"]}

{"title": "Automatic spinal cord localization, robust to MRI contrasts using global curve optimization\n", "abstract": " During the last two decades, MRI has been increasingly used for providing valuable quantitative information about spinal cord morphometry, such as quantification of the spinal cord atrophy in various diseases. However, despite the significant improvement of MR sequences adapted to the spinal cord, automatic image processing tools for spinal cord MRI data are not yet as developed as for the brain. There is nonetheless great interest in fully automatic and fast processing methods to be able to propose quantitative analysis pipelines on large datasets without user bias. The first step of most of these analysis pipelines is to detect the spinal cord, which is challenging to achieve automatically across the broad range of MRI contrasts, field of view, resolutions and pathologies. In this paper, a fully automated, robust and fast method for detecting the spinal cord centerline on MRI volumes is introduced.The algorithm uses a\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["887"]}
{"title": "Investigations on spinal cord fMRI of cats under ketamine\n", "abstract": " Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the spinal cord has been the subject of intense research for the last ten years. An important motivation for this technique is its ability to detect non-invasively neuronal activity in the spinal cord related to sensorimotor functions in various conditions, such as after spinal cord lesions. Although promising results of spinal cord fMRI have arisen from previous studies, the poor reproducibility of BOLD activations and their characteristics remain a major drawback. In the present study we investigated the reproducibility of BOLD fMRI in the spinal cord of cats (N\u00a0=\u00a09) by repeating the same stimulation protocol over a long period (\u223c\u00a02\u00a0h). Cats were anaesthetized with ketamine, and spinal cord activity was induced by electrical stimulation of cutaneous nerves of the hind limbs. As a result, task-related signals were detected in most cats with relatively good spatial specificity\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["887"]}
{"title": "7T MRI of spinal cord injury\n", "abstract": " A man with 25 years of mild left neck, arm, and leg paresthesias had initial MRI in 1996 identifying a left C3-4 dorsal horn cavernous hemangioma. In 1997, hemorrhage (C3-7) and resection induced left arm > leg proprioceptive loss and clumsiness. Three months after surgical resection, left upper-body pain recurred; 2 years later, disabling colocalizing itch recurred.1 In 2012, ultra-high-resolution 7T MRI (figure) localized hemosiderin to specific dorsal horn laminae and detected rostral (C1-3) hypersignal invisible on conventional MRIs, most likely representing wallerian degeneration.2 These new imaging findings demonstrate the benefit of high-field spinal cord MRI and generate the hypothesis that his late-onset central itch might be related to delayed white matter degeneration.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["887"]}
{"title": "MRI atlas-based measurement of spinal cord injury predicts outcome in acute flaccid myelitis\n", "abstract": " BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent advances in spinal cord imaging analysis have led to the development of a robust anatomic template and atlas incorporated into an open-source platform referred to as the Spinal Cord Toolbox. Using the Spinal Cord Toolbox, we sought to correlate measures of GM, WM, and cross-sectional area pathology on T2 MR imaging with motor disability in patients with acute flaccid myelitis.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Spinal cord imaging for 9 patients with acute flaccid myelitis was analyzed by using the Spinal Cord Toolbox. A semiautomated pipeline using the Spinal Cord Toolbox measured lesion involvement in GM, WM, and total spinal cord cross-sectional area. Proportions of GM, WM, and cross-sectional area affected by T2 hyperintensity were calculated across 3 ROIs: 1) center axial section of lesion; 2) full lesion segment; and 3) full cord atlas volume.

{"title": "Characterization of the hemodynamic response in the rat lumbar spinal cord using intrinsic optical imaging and laser speckle\n", "abstract": " Quantifying spinal cord functions is crucial for understanding neurophysiological mechanisms governing the intact and the injured spinal cord. Intrinsic optical imaging (IOI) and laser speckle provides measures of deoxyhemoglobin (HbR) and oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) concentrations, blood volume (BV) and blood flow (BF) at high spatial and temporal resolution. In this study we used IOI and laser speckle to characterize the hemodynamic response to neuronal activation in the lumbar spinal cord of anaesthetized rats (N\u00a0=\u00a09). We report consistent temporal variations of HbR, HbO2, BV and BF located ipsilaterally at L3\u2013L5. Responses were significantly higher when stimulation intensity was increased. Vascular changes extended several millimetres from the epicenter, supporting the venous drainage observed in functional magnetic resonance imaging studies.", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["887"]}
{"title": "Guidelines for the conduct of clinical trials in spinal cord injury: neuroimaging biomarkers\n", "abstract": " Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to immediate neuronal and axonal damage at the focal injury site and triggers secondary pathologic series of events resulting in sensorimotor and autonomic dysfunction below the level of injury. Although there is no cure for SCI, neuroprotective and regenerative therapies show promising results at the preclinical stage. There is a pressing need to develop non-invasive outcome measures that can indicate whether a candidate therapeutic agent or a cocktail of therapeutic agents are positively altering the underlying disease processes. Recent conventional MRI studies have quantified spinal cord lesion characteristics and elucidated their relationship between severity of injury to clinical impairment and recovery. Next to the quantification of the primary cord damage, quantitative MRI measures of spinal cord (rostrocaudally to the lesion site) and brain integrity have demonstrated\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["887"]}
