Here, we determined the genome-wide localization and dynamics of Htz1, the yeast histone H2A variant. Htz1 localizes to hundreds of repressed/basal Pol II promoters and prefers TATA-less promoters. Specific Htz1 deposition requires the SWR1 complex, which largely colocalizes with Htz1. Htz1 occupancy correlates with particular histone modifications, and Htz1 deposition is partially reliant on Gcn5 (a histone acetyltransferase) and Bdf1, an SWR1 complex member that binds acetylated histones. Changes in growth conditions cause a striking redistribution of Htz1 from activated to repressed/basal promoters. Furthermore, Htz1 promotes full gene activation but does not generally impact repression. Importantly, Htz1 releases from purified chromatin in vitro under conditions where H2A and H3\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "611\n", "authors": ["378"]}
