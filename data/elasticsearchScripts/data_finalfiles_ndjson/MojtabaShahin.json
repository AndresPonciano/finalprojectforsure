{"title": "Architectural design decision: Existing models and tools\n", "abstract": " In the field of software architecture, there has been a paradigm shift from describing the outcome of architecting process mostly described by component and connector (know-what) to documenting architectural design decisions and their rationale (know-how) which leads to the production of an architecture. This paradigm shift results in emergence of various models and related tools for capturing, managing and sharing architectural design decisions and their rationale explicitly. This paper analyzes existing architectural design decisions models and provides a criteria-based comparison on tools that support these models. The major contribution of this paper is twofold: to show that all of these models have a consensus on capturing the essence of an architectural design decision; and to clarify the major difference among the tools and show what desired features are missing in these tools.", "num_citations": "124\n", "authors": ["1943"]}
{"title": "How Do Open Source Communities Document Software Architecture: An Exploratory Survey\n", "abstract": " Software architecture (SA) documentation provides a blueprint of a software-intensive system for the communication between stakeholders about the high-level design of the system. In open source software (OSS) development, a lack of SA documentation may hinder the use and further development of OSS, but how much \"architecture\" documentation is enough and appropriate is largely dependent on the contextual factors of development. In order to understand the state of the practice of SA documentation in OSS projects, we conducted a documentation-based survey to explore how SA is documented in OSS projects. Out of 2,000 OSS projects from four major OSS sources, we found that 108 projects have some SA documentation, which shows that the SA documentation is scarce in OSS development. We analyzed these 108 projects to understand what SA information has been documented and how they have\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "52\n", "authors": ["1943"]}
{"title": "The Intersection of Continuous Deployment and Architecting Process: Practitioners\u2019 Perspectives\n", "abstract": " Context: Development and Operations (DevOps) is an emerging software industry movement to bridge the gap between software development and operations teams. DevOps supports frequently and reliably releasing new features and products--thus subsuming Continuous Deployment (CD) practice. Goal: This research aims at empirically exploring the potential impact of CD practice on architecting process. Method: We carried out a case study involving interviews with 16 software practitioners. Results: We have identified (1) a range of recurring architectural challenges (ie, highly coupled monolithic architecture, team dependencies, and ever-changing operational environments and tools) and (2) five main architectural principles (ie, small and independent deployment units, not too much focus on reusability, aggregating logs, isolating changes, and testability inside the architecture) that should be considered when\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "40\n", "authors": ["1943"]}
{"title": "Improving understandability of architecture design through visualization of architectural design decision\n", "abstract": " Concentrating on components and connectors in traditional approaches to document software architecture causes the problems, such as high costs for architecture change and erode during architecture evolution. These problems result in a tendency to record architectural design decisions and their rationale made throughout architecting process. This tendency encourages practitioners and researchers to develop various models and related tools to model, capture, manage, share, and (re) use architectural design decisions. But there still remains a need to visualize and explore architectural design decisions due to the huge number of decisions and relationships among them in large and complex systems development. In this paper, we first make a survey on tools that support visualization of architectural design decisions, their features and deficiencies. Second we investigate how Compendium tool can be\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "40\n", "authors": ["1943"]}

{"title": "Architecting for devops and continuous deployment\n", "abstract": " Development and Operations (DevOps) in the context of Continuous Deployment (CD) have emerged as an attractive software development movement, which tries to establish a strong connection between development and operations teams. CD is defined as the ability to quickly put new releases into production. We believe that DevOps/CD brings new challenges for architects, which considerably impacts both on their (architectural) design decisions and their organizational responsibilities. We assert that there is an important and urgent need of sufficient research work to gain a deep understanding of how DevOps/CD adoption can influence architecting, architectural decision-making processes and their outcomes in an organization. This PhD research is aimed at understanding and addressing new challenges for designing architectures for supporting DevOps in the context of CD.", "num_citations": "27\n", "authors": ["1943"]}
{"title": "Rationale visualization of software architectural design decision using compendium\n", "abstract": " The justification for software architectural design decisions made throughout the architecting process is necessary for understanding,(re) using, communicating, and modifying an architecture design. Although there are many existing tools to capture, store, manage, and share the architectural design decisions explicitly, there still remains a need to visualize and explore architectural design decisions and their underlying rationale.

{"title": "The Impact of a STEM-based Entrepreneurship Program on the Entrepreneurial Intention of Secondary School Female Students\n", "abstract": " Despite dedicated effort and research in the last two decades, the entrepreneurship field is still limited by little evidence-based knowledge of the impacts of entrepreneurship programs on the entrepreneurial intention of students in pre-university levels of study. Further, gender equity continues to be an issue in the entrepreneurial sector, particularly in STEM-focused entrepreneurship. In this context, this study was designed to explore the effects of a one-day female-focused STEM-based entrepreneurship program (for brevity, we call it the OzGirlsEntrepreneurship program) on the entrepreneurial intention of secondary school female students. The study collected data from two surveys completed by 193 secondary school female students, aged 14\u201316 years, who participated in the OzGirlsEntrepreneurship program.
