{"title": "Assessing the quality of reports of randomized clinical trials: is blinding necessary?\n", "abstract": " It has been suggested that the quality of clinical trials should be assessed by blinded raters to limit the risk of introducing bias into meta-analyses and systematic reviews, and into the peer-review process. There is very little evidence in the literature to substantiate this. This study describes the development of an instrument to assess the quality of reports of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in pain research and its use to determine the effect of rater blinding on the assessments of quality. A multidisciplinary panel of six judges produced an initial version of the instrument. Fourteen raters from three different backgrounds assessed the quality of 36 research reports in pain research, selected from three different samples. Seven were allocated randomly to perform the assessments under blind conditions. The final version of the instrument included three items.

The shape of the breast varies hugely between the scenarios of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (patient lies prone, breast hanging down under gravity), X-ray mammography (breast strongly compressed) and ultrasound or biopsy/surgery (patient lies supine), rendering image fusion an extremely difficult task. This paper is concerned with the use of the finite-element method and nonlinear elasticity to build a 3-D, patient-specific, anatomically accurate model of the breast. The model is constructed from MR images and can be deformed to simulate breast shape and predict tumor location during mammography or biopsy/surgery.

Current models are grounded in over fifty years of research in the development of biophysically detailed models of the electrophysiology (EP) of cardiac cells, but one aspect which is inadequately addressed is the incorporation of uncertainty and physiological variability. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is the identification and characterisation of the uncertainty in model parameters derived from experimental data, and the computation of the resultant uncertainty in model outputs. It is a necessary tool for establishing the credibility of computational models, and will likely be expected of EP models for future safety-critical clinical applications.

The function of this membrane is explored here in the context of the epithelial monolayer that lines the colonic crypt, test-tube shaped invaginations that punctuate the lining of the intestine and coordinate a regular turnover of cells to replenish the epithelial layer every few days. To investigate the consequence of genetic mutations that perturb the system dynamics and can lead to colorectal cancer, it must be possible to track the emerging tissue level changes that arise in the crypt. To that end, a theoretical crypt model with a realistic, deformable geometry is required. A new discrete crypt model is presented, which focuses on the interaction between cell- and tissue-level behaviour, while incorporating key subcellular components. The model contains a novel description of the role of the surrounding tissue and musculature, based upon experimental observations of the tissue structure of the crypt, which are also reported. A two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional geometry is considered, and the shape of the crypt is allowed to evolve and deform. Simulation results reveal how the shape of the crypt may contribute mechanically to the asymmetric division events typically associated with the stem cells at the base. The model predicts that epithelial cell migration may arise due to feedback between cell loss at the crypt collar and density-dependent cell division, an hypothesis which can be investigated in a wet lab.

{"title": "Considerations for the use of cellular electrophysiology models within cardiac tissue simulations\n", "abstract": " The use of mathematical models to study cardiac electrophysiology has a long history, and numerous cellular scale models are now available, covering a range of species and cell types. Their use to study emergent properties in tissue is also widespread, typically using the monodomain or bidomain equations coupled to one or more cell models. Despite the relative maturity of this field, little has been written looking in detail at the interface between the cellular and tissue-level models. Mathematically this is relatively straightforward and well-defined. There are however many details and potential inconsistencies that need to be addressed, in order to ensure correct operation of a cellular model within a tissue simulation. This paper will describe these issues and how to address them.Simply having models available in a common format such as CellML is still of limited utility, with significant manual effort being required\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "34\n", "authors": ["20"]}

To better understand the non-specific lateral association of a membrane protein we have characterized the free energy landscape for the dimerization of a bacterial outer membrane protein, NanC, in a phospholipid bilayer membrane. NanC is a member of the KdgM-family of bacterial outer membrane proteins and is responsible for sialic acid transport in E. coli. Umbrella sampling and coarse-grained molecular dynamics were employed to calculate the potentials of mean force (PMF) for a variety of restrained relative orientations of two NanC proteins as the separation of their centres of mass was varied. We found the free energy of dimerization for NanC to be in the range of  to . Differences in the depths of the PMFs for the various orientations are related to the shape of the proteins. This was quantified by calculating the lipid-inaccessible buried surface area of the proteins in the region around the minimum of each PMF. The depth of the potential well of the PMF was shown to depend approximately linearly on the buried surface area. We were able to resolve local minima in the restrained PMFs that would not be revealed using conventional umbrella sampling. In particular, these features reflected the local organization of the intervening lipids between the two interacting proteins.

Microelectrodes typically consist of an electrode embedded (or recessed) in an insulating material. For all such electrodes, numerical simulation is made difficult by the presence of a boundary singularity at the electrode edge (where the electrode meets the insulator), manifested by the large increase in the current density at this point, often referred to as the edge effect. Our approach to overcoming this problem has involved the derivation of an a posteriori bound on the error in the numerical approximation for the current that can be used to drive an adaptive mesh-generation algorithm, allowing calculation of the quantity of interest (the current) to within a prescribed tolerance.

{"title": "High-throughput cardiac science on the Grid\n", "abstract": " Cardiac electrophysiology is a mature discipline, with the first model of a cardiac cell action potential having been developed in 1962. Current models range from single ion channels, through very complex models of individual cardiac cells, to geometrically and anatomically detailed models of the electrical activity in whole ventricles. A critical issue for model developers is how to choose parameters that allow the model to faithfully reproduce observed physiological effects without over-fitting. In this paper, we discuss the use of a parametric modelling toolkit, called Nimrod, that makes it possible both to explore model behaviour as parameters are changed and also to tune parameters by optimizing model output. Importantly, Nimrod leverages computers on the Grid, accelerating experiments by using available high-performance platforms. We illustrate the use of Nimrod with two case studies, one at the cardiac tissue\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["20"]}

However, experimental methods used in these studies may accentuate measured dissociation due to differences in fluorescent emission wavelengths of optical voltage/calcium (Vopt/Caopt) signals. Here, we simulate dual voltage-calcium optical mapping experiments using a monodomain-Luo-Rudy ventricular-tissue model coupled to a photon-diffusion model. Dissociation of both electrical, Vm/Ca, and optical, Vopt/Caopt, signals is quantified by calculating mutual information (MI) for VF and rapid pacing protocols. We find that photon scattering decreases MI of Vopt/Caopt signals by 23% compared to unscattered Vm/Ca signals during VF.

The capacity for a tumour to grow therefore crucially depends on its ability to adjust to hypoxic conditions. It is frequently observed that the hypoxia response pathways, such as angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels) and glycolysis (use of glucose, rather than oxygen, metabolism), are adapted in tumour cells to allow for aggressive growth in hypoxic conditions. The response pathways are also often upregulated in normoxic conditions. The transcription factor Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1 (HIF-1) has been found to control the expression of a battery of genes that are crucially involved in the hypoxic response, including key angiogenic growth factors and glycolytic enzymes.

The mathematical model that is used to derive this ordinary differential equation assumes that the partial pressure of an inert gas (which is proportional to the content of that gas) is a function only of time. This mathematical model does not allow for spatial variations in inert gas partial pressure. This model is also dependent only on the ratio of blood flow to tissue volume, and so does not take account of the shape of the body compartment or of the density of the capillaries that supply blood to this tissue. The partial pressure of a given inert gas in mixed-venous blood flowing back to the lungs is calculated from this ordinary differential equation.In this study, we write down the partial differential equations that allow for spatial as well as temporal variations in inert gas partial pressure in tissue.

Peak lengthening rates and the time constant of iso-volumic relaxation (tau) were not affected by alterations in preload. Absolute values of tau failed to distinguish between ischaemia and control. The ischaemia-induced decrease in peak negative dP/dt was preload dependent and caused mainly by a concomitant decrease in peak left ventricular pressure.

The political right is attracted by workfare because it resents the idea that people might be paid by the state to do nothing. The left, in its turn, is appalled that people who are thrown out of work through no fault of their own should then be required to undertake slave labour to qualify for the benefits that are due to them. This polarisation causes the debate to stall, but in a world where unemployment is unlikely to fall fast or far and where so much work needs doing the idea may be worth exploring further.

{"title": "Model evidence with fast tree based quadrature\n", "abstract": " High dimensional integration is essential to many areas of science, ranging from particle physics to Bayesian inference. Approximating these integrals is hard, due in part to the difficulty of locating and sampling from regions of the integration domain that make significant contributions to the overall integral. Here, we present a new algorithm called Tree Quadrature (TQ) that separates this sampling problem from the problem of using those samples to produce an approximation of the integral. TQ places no qualifications on how the samples provided to it are obtained, allowing it to use state-of-the-art sampling algorithms that are largely ignored by existing integration algorithms. Given a set of samples, TQ constructs a surrogate model of the integrand in the form of a regression tree, with a structure optimised to maximise integral precision. The tree divides the integration domain into smaller containers, which are individually integrated and aggregated to estimate the overall integral. Any method can be used to integrate each individual container, so existing integration methods, like Bayesian Monte Carlo, can be combined with TQ to boost their performance. On a set of benchmark problems, we show that TQ provides accurate approximations to integrals in up to 15 dimensions; and in dimensions 4 and above, it outperforms simple Monte Carlo and the popular Vegas method.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["20"]}

{"title": "Gaussian process emulation for discontinuous response surfaces with applications for cardiac electrophysiology models\n", "abstract": " Mathematical models of biological systems are beginning to be used for safety-critical applications, where large numbers of repeated model evaluations are required to perform uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis. Most of these models are nonlinear both in variables and parameters/inputs which has two consequences. First, analytic solutions are rarely available so repeated evaluation of these models by numerically solving differential equations incurs a significant computational burden. Second, many models undergo bifurcations in behaviour as parameters are varied. As a result, simulation outputs often contain discontinuities as we change parameter values and move through parameter/input space. Statistical emulators such as Gaussian processes are frequently used to reduce the computational cost of uncertainty quantification, but discontinuities render a standard Gaussian process emulation approach unsuitable as these emulators assume a smooth and continuous response to changes in parameter values. In this article, we propose a novel two-step method for building a Gaussian Process emulator for models with discontinuous response surfaces. We first use a Gaussian Process classifier to detect boundaries of discontinuities and then constrain the Gaussian Process emulation of the response surface within these boundaries. We introduce a novel `certainty metric' to guide active learning for a multi-class probabilistic classifier. We apply the new classifier to simulations of drug action on a cardiac electrophysiology model, to propagate our uncertainty in a drug's action through to predictions of changes to the cardiac action\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["20"]}

Epicardial transmembrane potential (Vm) distribution was compared to synthesized Vf distribution to determine light scattering effects on OM recordings of VEP and postshock activity. Results show that small scale VEP is not easily resolved, and thus spatial resolution in OM signals is limited due to fluorescent scattering. Further, shock-induced Vm changes on the epicardium are underestimated in OM recordings, with a shock-end Vf range up to 34% narrower than Vm range.

The primary aim is to apply the chosen algorithm to obtain solutions to the equations governing the operation of membrane-covered oxygen sensors, known as Clark electrodes, which are used for monitoring the oxygen concentration of blood. The boundary conditions of this problem require the development of a singularity correction technique. A brief history of electrochemical sensors leading to the development of the Clark electrode is given, together with the two-dimensional equations and boundary conditions governing its operation. A locally valid series expansion is derived to take care of the boundary singularity, together with a robust method of matching this to the finite difference approximation. Parallel implementations of three representative numerical algorithms applied to a simple model problem are compared by extending Leland's parallel effectiveness model. The chosen parallel algorithm is combined with the singularity correction to obtain a solution to the Clark electrode problem. Numerical experiments show this solution to achieve the required accuracy. Previous one-dimensional models of the Clark electrode are shown to be inadequate before the two-dimensional model is used to examine the variation of operation with design.

{"title": "Inverse sensitivity analysis of mathematical models avoiding the curse of dimensionality\n", "abstract": " 1Abstract Biological systems have evolved a degree of robustness with respect to perturbations in their environment and this capability is essential for their survival. In applications ranging from therapeutics to conservation, it is important to understand not only the sensitivity of biological systems to changes in their environments, but which features of these systems are necessary to achieve a given outcome. Mathematical models are increasingly employed to understand these mechanisms. Sensitivity analyses of such mathematical models provide insight into the responsiveness of the system when experimental manipulation is difficult. One common approach is to seek the probability distribution of the outputs of the system corresponding to a known distribution of inputs. By contrast, inverse sensitivity analysis determines the probability distribution of model inputs which produces a known distribution of outputs. The computational complexity of the methods used to conduct inverse sensitivity analyses for deterministic systems has limited their application to models with relatively few parameters. Here we describe a novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo method we call \u0393\u00c7\u00a3Contour Monte Carlo\u0393\u00c7\u00a5, which can be used to invert systems with a large number of parameters.

Cerebral autoregulation is known to be impaired post ischaemic stroke, after severe head injury, in patients suffering from autonomic dysfunction and under the action of various drugs. Cerebral auto-regulation is a dynamic, multivariate phenomenon. Sensitive techniques are required to monitor cerebral auto-regulation in a clinical setting. This thesis presents 4 related signal processing studies of cerebral autoregulation. The first study shows how consideration of changes in blood gas concentrations simultaneously with changes in blood pressure can improve the accuracy of an existing frequency domain technique for monitoring cerebral autoregulation from spontaneous fluctuations in blood pressure and a transcranial doppler measure of cerebral blood flow velocity. The second study shows how the continuous wavelet transform can be used to investigate coupling between blood pressure and near infrared spectroscopy measures of cerebral haemodynamics in patients with autonomic failure. This introduces time information into the frequency based assessment, however neglects the contribution of blood gas concentrations. The third study shows how this limitation can be resolved by introducing a new time-varying multivariate system identification algorithm based around the dual tree undecimated wavelet transform.

In this study, a computer program has been developed to parameterise large amplitude AC voltammetric data using mathematical optimisation in combination with Bayesian inference algorithms for calculating posterior distributions of parameters and hence uncertainties in parameter values. The computer program has been applied to objective functions, relevant to total AC current, frequency domain data in the form of the power spectrum derived from Fourier transformation and multivariate based methods using the resolved harmonic data. The robustness of the objective functions have been confirmed and Bayesian inference methods have been validated using \u0393\u00c7\u00a3noisy\u0393\u00c7\u00a5 synthetic and experimental data for the [Fe(CN)6]3\u0393\u00ea\u00c6/4\u0393\u00ea\u00c6 reduction process in aqueous 3.0\u0393\u00c7\u00e0M KCl electrolyte at a gold electrode.

{"title": "Using flexible noise models to avoid noise model misspecification in inference of differential equation time series models\n", "abstract": " When modelling time series, it is common to decompose observed variation into a \"signal\" process, the process of interest, and \"noise\", representing nuisance factors that obfuscate the signal. To separate signal from noise, assumptions must be made about both parts of the system. If the signal process is incorrectly specified, our predictions using this model may generalise poorly; similarly, if the noise process is incorrectly specified, we can attribute too much or too little observed variation to the signal. With little justification, independent Gaussian noise is typically chosen, which defines a statistical model that is simple to implement but often misstates system uncertainty and may underestimate error autocorrelation. There are a range of alternative noise processes available but, in practice, none of these may be entirely appropriate, as actual noise may be better characterised as a time-varying mixture of these various types. Here, we consider systems where the signal is modelled with ordinary differential equations and present classes of flexible noise processes that adapt to a system's characteristics. Our noise models include a multivariate normal kernel where Gaussian processes allow for non-stationary persistence and variance, and nonparametric Bayesian models that partition time series into distinct blocks of separate noise structures. Across the scenarios we consider, these noise processes faithfully reproduce true system uncertainty: that is, parameter estimate uncertainty when doing inference using the correct noise model.

In order to use iPSC-CMs for verification of in silico results, we therefore need to tailor the models by fitting to iPSC-CM data in drug-free conditions.

It is well characterised that on single cell level the action potential measured at room temperature has longer duration compared with that obtained at body temperature. The duration of the AP (APD) is a parameter which is related to the ability of cells to cope with faster pacing rates. APD prolongation by drug or disease condition may lead to arrhythmia. However so far, the comparison has been done mostly on data obtained at body and room temperature. One common explanation for the prolongation of the APD at room temperature is the slower kinetics of underlying ion channels, exchangers and pumps (please check for pump).We measured AP from live cardiac ventricular slices after incubating in ice cold solution for over 60min.

{"title": "Efficient numerical methods for the solution of coupled multiphysics problems\n", "abstract": " Multiphysics systems with interface coupling are used to model a variety of physical phenomena, such as arterial blood flow, air flow around aeroplane wings, or interactions between surface and ground water flows. Numerical methods enable the practical application of these models through computer simulations. Specifically a high level of detail and accuracy is achieved in finite element methods by discretisations which use extremely large numbers of degrees of freedom, rendering the solution process challenging from the computational perspective. In this thesis we address this challenge by developing a twofold strategy for improving the efficiency of standard finite element coupled solvers. First, we propose to solve a monolithic coupled problem using block-preconditioned GMRES with a new Schur complement approximation. This results in a modular and robust method which significantly reduces the computational cost of solving the system. In particular, numerical tests show mesh-independent convergence of the solver for all the considered problems, suggesting that the method is well-suited to solving large-scale coupled systems. Second, we derive an adjoint-based formula for goal-oriented a posteriori error estimation, which leads to a time-space mesh refinement strategy. The strategy produces a mesh tailored to a given problem and quantity of interest. The monolithic formulation of the coupled problem allows us to obtain expressions for the error in the Lagrange multiplier, which often represents a physically relevant quantity, such as the normal stress on the interface between the problem components.

{"title": "Towards a computational model of the colonic crypt with a realistic, deformable geometry\n", "abstract": " Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent and deadly forms of cancer. Its high mortality rate is associated with difficulties in early detection, which is crucial to survival. The onset of CRC is marked by macroscopic changes in intestinal tissue, originating from a deviation in the healthy cell dynamics of glands known as the crypts of Lieberkuhn. It is believed that accumulated genetic alterations confer on mutated cells the ability to persist in the crypts, which can lead to the formation of a benign tumour through localised proliferation. Stress on the crypt walls can lead to buckling, or crypt fission, and the further spread of mutant cells. Elucidating the initial perturbations in crypt dynamics is not possible experimentally, but such investigations could be made using a predictive, computational model. This thesis proposes a new discrete crypt model, which focuses on the interaction between cell- and tissue-level behaviour, while incorporating key subcellular components. The model contains a novel description of the role of the surrounding tissue and musculature, which allows the shape of the crypt to evolve and deform. A two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional geometry is considered. Simulation results reveal how the shape of the crypt base may contribute mechanically to the asymmetric division events typically associated with the stem cells in this region. The model predicts that epithelial cell migration may arise due to feedback between cell loss at the crypt collar and density-dependent cell division, an hypothesis which can be investigated in a wet lab.

However, it is more physiologically realistic to allow the oxygen consumption to fall continuously to zero as the oxygen tension falls towards zero for low oxygen tensions. We show that using this more physiologically realistic oxygen consumption in a mathematical model of oxygen transport to tissue gives a significantly different solution to the governing equations when areas of low oxygen tension exist. We then use this method of modelling oxygen consumption to compare the location of regions of low tissue oxygen tension predicted by two previously published mathematical models of oxygen transport.
