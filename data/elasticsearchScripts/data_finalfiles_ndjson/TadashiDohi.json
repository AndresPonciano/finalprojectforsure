{"title": "Gompertz software reliability model: Estimation algorithm and empirical validation\n", "abstract": " Gompertz curve has been used to estimate the number of residual faults in testing phases of software development, especially by Japanese software development companies. Since the Gompertz curve is a deterministic function, the curve cannot be applied to estimating software reliability which is the probability that software system does not fail in a prefixed time period. In this article, we propose a stochastic model called the Gompertz software reliability model based on non-homogeneous Poisson processes. The proposed model can be derived from the statistical theory of extreme-value, and has a similar asymptotic property to the deterministic Gompertz curve. Also, we develop an EM algorithm to determine the model parameters effectively. In numerical examples with software failure data observed in real software development projects, we evaluate performance of the Gompertz software reliability model in terms\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "159\n", "authors": ["459"]}

The random port hopping (RPH) by Badishi et al.

However, the RPH has not been used yet as a standard communication protocol in the real world, because the utility and limitation of RPH against general DoS attack patterns are still unclear. In this paper, we develop quantitative dependability models of RPH by means of the discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) and refine the existing RPH protocol in terms of the communication success rate.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["459"]}

On the other hand, to guarantee high reliability of real-time computing systems, redundancy has been widely applied, which plays an important role in enhancing system reliability. One of commonly used type of redundancy is the standby redundancy. However, redundancy increases not only the complexity of a system but also the complexity of associated problems such as common-mode error. In this paper, we consider the component importance analysis of a real-time computing system with warm standby redundancy in the presence of Common-Cause Failures (CCFs). Although the CCFs are known as a risk factor of degradation of system reliability, it is difficult to evaluate the component importance measures in the presence of CCFs analytically. This paper introduces a Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) model for real-time computing system, and applies the CTMC-based component-wise sensitivity analysis which can evaluate the component importance measures without any structure function of system. In numerical experiments, we evaluate the effect of CCFs by the comparison of system performance measure and component importance in the case of system without CCF with those in the case of system with CCFs.

The model is formulated assuming that the production rate of the machine at stage 1 is greater than that at stage 2 and the time to machine failure and repair time are arbitrarily distributed.

{"title": "Deadlock Detection Scheduling for Distributed Processes in the Presence of System Failures\n", "abstract": " The occurrence of deadlocks should be controlled effectively by their detection and resolution, but may sometimes lead to a serious system failure. This fact implies that deadlock detection scheduling should be designed from the view points of not only the performance trade-off between overall message usage and deadlock persistence time but also the prevention of the system failure. In this paper, we reformulate the Ling et al.'s deadlock detection scheduling problem (2006) in the presence of system failures, and derive the optimal deadlock detection time minimizing the long-run average cost per unit time. By introducing the message complexities of the deadlock detection and resolution algorithms being used, we investigate the asymptotically optimal frequency of deadlock detection scheduling in terms of the number of distributed processes through the wellknown Landau notation.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["459"]}

In order to predict the future fault-occurrence time, we apply three extraordinary auto-regressive models by Singpurwalla and Soyer (1985) as the prediction devices as well as the well-known AR and ARIMA models.

In this paper, we propose a kernel-based approach to estimate the quantitative software reliability, where two cases are considered; multiple software metrics are used and not. In the former case, we combine the kernel regression with the well-known non-homogeneous Poisson process-based software reliability growth model (SRGM), and propose a new metrics-based SRGM.

In fact, the optimal software release problem based on some software reliability growth models has been studied by many authors.

Computer security is to keep security attributes (confidentiality, integrity and availability) of computer systems, which face the threats such as deny-of-service (DoS), virus and intrusion. To ensure high computer security, the intrusion tolerance technique based on fault-tolerant scheme has been widely applied. This paper presents the quantitative performance evaluation of a virtual machine (VM) based intrusion tolerant system. Concretely, two security measures are derived; MTTSF (mean time to security failure) and the effective traffic intensity.

In practice, these security holes or vulnerabilities still remain in the system and applications even if developers carefully execute system testing. Thus it is necessary and important to develop the mechanism to prevent and/or tolerate security intrusions. As a result, the computer systems are often evaluated with confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA) criteria from the viewpoint of security, and security is treated as a QoS (Quality of Service) attribute at par with other QoS attributes such as capacity and performance.

Thus, the PH fitting is helpful for model-based performance evaluation. On the other hand, from the statistical point of view, the PH fitting is categorized as parameter estimation from data. Some efficient PH fitting techniques are based on the maximum-likelihood principle. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate statistical errors, i.e., the variance and covariance of estimators.

In this paper, a stochastic framework composed of a composite stochastic Petri reward net and its resulting non-Markovian availability model is presented to capture the dynamic behavior of an operational software system in which time-based software rejuvenation and checkpointing are both aperiodically conducted. In particular, apart from the software-aging problem that may cause the system to fail, human-error factors (ie, a system operator\u2019s misoperations) during checkpointing are also considered. To solve the stationary solution of the non-Markovian availability model, which is derived on the basis of the reachability graph of stochastic Petri reward nets and is actually not one of the trivial stochastic models such as the semi-Markov process and the Markov regenerative process, the phase-expansion approach is considered. In numerical experiments, we illustrate steady-state system availability and find optimal software-rejuvenation policies that maximize steady-state system availability. The effects of human-error factors on both steady-state system availability and the optimal software-rejuvenation trigger timing are also evaluated. Numerical results showed that human errors during checkpointing both decreased system availability and brought a significant effect on the optimal rejuvenation-trigger timing, so that it should not be overlooked during system modeling.

{"title": "Confidence intervals in optimal checkpoint placement\n", "abstract": " System failures in large scaled computer systems can lead to a huge economic and/or critical social loss. Checkpointing and rollback recovery is a commonly used solution for improving the dependability of computer systems, and is regarded as a low-cost environment diversity technique from the standpoint of fault-tolerant computing. Especially, when the file system to write and/or read data is designed in terms of preventive and proactive fault management, checkpoint generations can back up occasionally or periodically the significant data or processes on the primary medium to safe secondary media, and can play a significant role to limit the amount of data processing for the recovery actions after system failures occur. If checkpoints are frequently taken, a larger overhead by checkpointing itself will be incurred. Conversely, if checkpoints are seldom placed, a larger recovery overhead after a system failure will be required. Hence, it is important to determine the optimal checkpoint sequence taking account of the tradeoff between two kinds of overhead factors above. Since the system failure phenomenon under uncertainty is described by a probability distribution, called the system failure time distribution, the optimal checkpoint sequence should be determined based on any stochastic model [Nicola (1995)].", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["459"]}

{"title": "Two-Dimensional Software Defect Models with Test Execution History\n", "abstract": " In general, the software-testing time may be measured by two kinds of time scales: calendar time and test execution time. In this paper, we develop two-dimensional software reliability models with two-time measures and incorporate both of them to assess the software reliability with higher accuracy. Since the resulting software defect models are based on the familiar nonhomogeneous Poisson processes with two time scales, which are the natural extensions of one-dimensional software defect models, it is possible to treat the time data both simultaneously and effectively. We investigate the dependence of test-execution time as a testing effort on the software reliability assessment and validate quantitatively the software defect models with two-time scales. We also consider an optimization problem when to stop the software testing in terms of two-time measurements.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["459"]}

The dependability assessment of in-vehicle systems from their designed architecture is a challenging issue for automobile industry. However, since modern in-vehicle systems consist of massive components such as ECUs (Electronic Control Units), CAN equipments and software, it is not always easy to evaluate the whole system dependability from their interactions and interdependency. In this paper, with commonly-used architecture description languages such as UML (Unified Modeling Language) and SysML (Systems Modeling Language), we divide the system structure into several components, and give behavioral description of components, where each component corresponds to a state-dependent model in terms of its probabilistic behavior.

The time to failure of themachine, corrective and preventive repair times all are assumed to follow arbitrary discrete probability distributions. The proposed model is formulated based on the netpresent value (NPV) approach, treating the machine production rate as (i) predetermined or,(ii) flexible. The criteria for the existence of a local optimal solution for the NPV model and the long-run average cost model are derived under geometric repair time distributions, when the production rate is predetermined. A hybridized neural network (NN) and branch and bound (BB) algorithm is developed for the associated discrete nonlinear optimization problem when the production rate is treated as flexible.

In the secondary memory medium, such as a floppy disk or an MO disk, the memory capacity is divided equally into N parts.
