The present paper aims at studying the behavior of beam-column junction based on variations in concrete grade at junction. Analysis: To increase the load carrying capacity of a joint, a higher grade of concrete is used at a joint and also up to 1.5 D in the direction of beam from face of column, to shift or relocate the plastic hinge from the interface towards the beam. The different specimens were prepared in a T-shaped mould by changing the grade of concrete at beam-column joint and these samples were tested after 7 and 28 days. Findings: Study reveals that use of M20 or M25 grade of concrete at joint and up to 1.5 D (D is the depth of beam) of length of beam (M15 grade of concrete in rest of mould) increases the load carrying capacity approximately to about 20% when compared with M20 or M25 grade of concrete at junction and M15 grade in the remaining mould. The most important finding is that the use of higher grade of concrete at a joint and up to 1.5 D of length of beam, shifts the failure away from the beam-column interface Thus, a beam hinging mechanism is achieved which is a ductile type of failure compared to beam-column brittle interface failure and there is approximately 15-30% increase in load carrying capacity, in comparison with higher concrete grade only at a joint core. This is a simple and efficient method of preventing the beam-column joint failure.

{"title": "Primitive neuroectodermal tumour of the cervix: a rare diagnosis\n", "abstract": " The human microbiome consists of thousands of different microbial species, and tens of thousands of bioactive small molecules are associated with them. These associated molecules include the biosynthetic products of microbiota and the products of microbial transformation of host molecules, dietary components, and pharmaceuticals. The existing methods for characterization of these small molecules are currently time consuming and expensive, and they are limited to the cultivable bacteria. Here, we propose a method for detecting microbiota-associated small molecules based on the patterns of cooccurrence of molecular and microbial features across multiple microbiomes. We further map each molecule to the clade in a phylogenetic tree that is responsible for its production/transformation. We applied our proposed method to the tandem mass spectrometry and metagenomics data sets collected by the American\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1899"]}
{"title": "Experimental Investigation of Compressive Behaviour of Pier by Partial Replacement of Metakaolin\n", "abstract": " Objectives: The main focus of our experimental investigation is to study the behavior of a pier based on variations in compressive strength due to partial replacement of cement with metakaolin in order to attain maximum stiffness and strength, so as to withstand the shear forces, bending moments and other related structural response parameters efficiently.Analysis: The round and rectangular specimens were prepared by replacing cement with metakaolin up to 15%. The samples were tested after 7 and 28 days.Findings: Study reveals that with the replacement of 10% metakaolin in both circular as well as rectangular moulds, there is an increase in the load carrying capacity approximately about 19%, when compared with plain reinforced concrete moulds after 28 days. The most important finding is that the replacement of cement by metakaolin up to 10% helped us to attain higher strength after 7 as well as 28 days hence providing us a simple and efficient method of preventing the pier failure by attaining higher strengths.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1899"]}

Matrix tablets were prepared by direct compression method by using Hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose K15 (HPMC-K15), Ethyl cellulose (EC) and Sodium carboxy methyl cellulose (Na-CMC) as polymers in different concentrations. A 3-factor 3-level Box-Behnken statistical design was used as an optimization tool having total of 17 experimental runs with 5 central points. All three polymers were selected as independent variables while% age drug release at various time intervals and hardness were used as dependant variables. In vivo studies were conducted on human plasma using Tenoxicam as internal standered. All the detections were made on SYKNM HPLC. Foriour Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Differential Scanning Calorimetery (DSC) studies were conducted and no chemical interaction was found between drug and polymers. The drug release mechanism was mainly governed by non-fickian (anomalous) diffusion and zero-order (case II) transport diffusion. Regression analysis was performed on dissolution data obtained with the selected response variables and polynomial models were constructed. Polynomial models were further validated using one way ANOVA and results indicated that all the polymers used have significant effect on selected response (p> 0.05). Contour plots and three dimensional response surface curves were drawn. In-vivo studies were conducted on two tablet formulation indicating slow and sustained release of the drug from matrix. From Behnken design it is possible to successfully formulate and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1899"]}
{"title": "Structural components of gastro-retentive drug delivery systems\n", "abstract": " Drug administration through oral route is the most preferable route of administration that ensures effortlessness administration, patient compliance, safety, efficacy and low cost of therapy [1]. All the drug candidates are not uniformly absorbed throughout the GIT. It is the main limitation that is associated with orally administered controlled release dosage forms.[2]. Delayed absorption due to instability in the acidic environment of GIT or narrow window of absorption is avoided if the drug have potential to be well absorbed all the way through GIT, also produce enhanced therapeutic effect [1, 3]. GRDDS is the most promising methodology that transports drug to its target site of action and releases its concentration that attain optimal therapeutic response for as much time as it is desired.(14) Gastro retentive dosage form are designed to provide persistence of gastric emptying time (GET), which is 2 to 6 hours in fed state [4-6]. By delivering herefore considerably extend the gastric retention time (GRT) of drugs [9-11]. GRDDS with increased GRT provide enhanced bioavailability, minimized wastage of drug, continuous drug release for longer duration, avoiding fluctuations in plasma drug concentration, improves the solubility of drug that are less soluble in acidic pH of GIT [3-6]. It has been reported that GRT is one of the significant factors that have influence on the bioavailability of drug. Partial release of drug from the drug delivery system (DDS) beyond the zone of absorption due to unpredictable and short gastric emptying time can results in reduced therapeutic efficacy of the administered drug [12-14]. Gastric emptying is an exceptionally inconsistent\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1899"]}

The tests for compressive strength and density were conducted for 7 days, 14 days and 28 days. The mortar mixture is prepared by replacing Portland cement with Styrofoam balls in the ratio of 0%, 0.5% and 1% by weight of cement and silica fume is varied at 10%, 15% and 20% by weight of cement. The combine effect of Styrofoam balls and silica fume is also studied on mortar cubes. Styrofoam balls are the material of low density which effects the strength properties of mortar cubes, to counterbalance this, silica fume is added, which is very fine material which increases the strength of the mortar cubes. Due to the Styrofoam balls, the density decreases upto 25-45%(at an average) as compared to normal mix mortar cubes. From the tests, the compressive strength comes out to be maximum at 15% replacement of cement with silica fume.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1899"]}
{"title": "Comparative prevalence studies of hepatitis c patients in developing vs developed countries\n", "abstract": " Viral hepatitis is one of the common transmissible causes of chronic liver responsible for increased risk of mortality and morbidity. Hepatitis C disease has worldwide high prevalence which is more fatal because of lack of vaccination availability. Present study was conducted with the aim of to address the comparative prevalence and risk factor of hepatitis C. Secondary objective was to evaluate the prevalence of this disease in Pakistan as compared to other countries. Most of the countries in the world do not have significant studies of population infected with Hepatitis C virus (HCV). During 1990-2016, 232 studies were included; containing 117 countries representing that 90% of the world population have 2.3% prevalence. According to studies, developed countries have low HCV prevalence while developing countries have high prevalence. Pakistan being a developing country has second highest HCV prevalence ranging from 4.5 to 8%. The reason of this high prevalence is unawareness about Hepatitis C in community and lack of successful therapies for patients with HCV. In past, developed countries had high prevalence but now they have low incidence because of proper system and awareness. Pakistan needs such kind of public awareness programs and better treatment facilities at affordable price to community.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1899"]}

Niosomes are the drug carriers which provide substitute to liposomes and encapsulate the solutes in a way similar to liposomes. These may be unilamellar or multilamellar vesicles, present more in vitro stability and improved stability of drugs entrapped in comparison with the dosage forms which are conventional.[1] Niosomes can hold amphiphillic as well as lipophilic drugs and have the advantage of being biocompatible, biodegradable and non immunogenic over liposomes. Niosomes are used for targeted as well as controlled release for the treatment of many diseases including cancer, viral and other microbial diseases. Encapsulation of drugs in niosomes results in prolonged existence of drugs in circulation and improved penetration into the tissues targeted.[2] The purpose of this review is to have an overview of preparation, composition, structure and applications of niosomes in pharmacy. The main purpose of development of niosomal preparations is to control the release profile of the drugs by making their release sustained and targeting drugs to the sites desired.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1899"]}
