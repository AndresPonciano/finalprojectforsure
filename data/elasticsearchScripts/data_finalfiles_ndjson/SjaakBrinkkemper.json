{"title": "Situational Method Engineering for Information System Project Approaches\n", "abstract": " The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of Situational Method Engineering, which is a type of method engineering. Situational Method Engineering aims at harmonisation of methods by providing rules to configure project-specific methods out of fragments from existing standard methods. It stems from the need for controlled flexibility, which is a compromise between the ad-hoc tuning of methods and the application of rigid, standard methods. Method fragments are stored in a method base, which constitutes the central repository of a Computer Aided Method Engineering (CAME) tool. The CAME tool is used to manipulate method fragments in order to configure project-specific methods. We present a model of the method base, as well as operations on method fragments and examples of required consistency rules for a configured method. Moreover, we discuss the spectrum of approaches to Situational Method Engineering. The paper is concluded with a description of the CAME tool under development.", "num_citations": "405\n", "authors": ["628"]}

In this paper, we describe the development of the SPM maturity matrix, consisting of (a) identification and description of capabilities, (b) positioning the capabilities at the right levels in the maturity matrix and (c) validating the maturity matrix with expert validation and a survey among 45 product managers and product management experts. The result is a validated maturity matrix that will guide further development of methodical support in SPM.", "num_citations": "48\n", "authors": ["628"]}

The technologicalorganizational-environmental (TOE) framework was adopted as a primary theoretical lens, combined with five innovation characteristics of Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) theory, which incorporated in technological context of the framework. We used a questionnaire to collect data from 147 of Indonesian companies. A logistic regression was carried out to test our hypotheses. The results confirmed that compatibility, observability, market competition, and government have positive relationship with SaaS adoption in Indonesian, while complexity found to be the negative determinant to its adoption. We also found that the organizational context of TOE framework did not contribute to the prediction of SaaS adoption in Indonesian companies. The findings offer valuable insights for researchers of SaaS and innovation adoption, for Indonesian policy makers that want to encourage SaaS adoption, as well as for SaaS vendors that want to develop strategies to persuade companies in Indonesia to adopt SaaS.", "num_citations": "46\n", "authors": ["628"]}

Although social network analysis has been applied in several cases, it has not been evaluated if this approach results in reliable results in terms of findings problems related to knowledge sharing. One might for instance find an isolated person with network analysis, but given the context this might not be necessary a problem. The goal of this research is to validate the use of social network analysis to study knowledge networks. We have selected one particular technique, called Knowledge Network Analysis, to evaluate in this research. The Knowledge Network Analysis technique has been applied in a case study at an international product software developer to find potential barriers in their knowledge networks. To evaluate these results, a qualitative analysis has been executed afterwards by a different researcher. This analysis was based on interviews, document study and observations. To analyze the qualitative data we developed a new model called Knowledge Sharing Environment Model (KSEM), which identifies knowledge sharing bottlenecks in a structured manner.

Second, we use Focus Group interviews to elicit knowledge about carrying out projects conforming to architecture. Based on this empirical research we present seven observations and ten best practices. The best practices point to the fact that project conformance is not only the responsibility of project members, but also of enterprise architects.

In this project the initial process execution time of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection request has been reduced from some 60 days to two days. This has been achieved by the use of a new business process reengineering (BPR) implementation approach that was developed by the Utrecht University. The implementation approach is based on a combination of Enterprise Information Architecture (EIA), Business Process Modeling (BPM), Knowledge Management and Management Control methodologies and techniques. The method has been applied to improve the performance of a Dutch e\u2011government service department (DeGSD). DeGSD is an e\u2011government service department that supports and promotes electronic communication. It can be described as an electronic mail office for consumers that provides the ICT infrastructure to communicate with the government. The goal is to reduce administrative activities for both the government and consumers. Supporting technology and part of the process is outsourced. In our approach we used EIA as a starting point because it describes all relations and information exchange with all stakeholders.

Although useful results can be gained, this approach fails to provide detailed insight in the elements that invoke specific energy consumption behavior. As a result, software vendors are not able to address energy consumption on software level.

It is based in part on two case studies of Dutch software vendors who have successfully outsourced part of their activities to an Eastern European outsourcing vendor, and validated by a panel of six experts from industry and the scientific community. It is concluded that knowledge exchange in global software outsourcing is a by\u2010product of efforts to enhance communication and coordination, rather than specific technical solutions.

Static ACC is focused on the module views of architecture and especially on rules constraining the modular elements. This paper proposes an approach for support of semantically rich modular architectures (SRMAs) in the context of static ACC. An SRMA contains modules of semantically different types, like layers and components, constrained by rules of different types. Our approach is grounded in a metamodel, which enables support of rich sets of module and rule types and which enables extensive support of the semantics of these types.

We use an exploratory case study approach, since the number of publications on this topic is limited. We conducted 12 case studies with cloud service providers in Indonesia, which consisted of interviews and document studies. The analysis of our interviews revealed that the cloud business model adoption in Indonesia is mainly initiated by the local IT services providers. We also found that market demand was the main triggering factor for adopting the cloud business model. One of the key benefits that was mentioned, is the positive trend in revenue gains. The most encountered challenge for Indonesian cloud service providers is the low speed of internet connection in rural areas.

For these SPOs there is a need to constantly release faster to customers in order to preserve customer satisfaction in the form of being able to quickly release new features and provide bug fixes.However, releasing software at a faster pace comes with the need to better align the concerns of stakeholders that reside in the chain of releasing software. In particular, development and operations need to be aligned as these parties traditionally have arranged their processes differently from one another and work in silos. However, in order to create a smooth and fast end-to-end flow when it comes to releasing software, DevOps provides a way to deal with the aforementioned and takes into consideration not only development and operations, but also other stakeholders such as quality assurance (Q/A), product management and information security.", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["628"]}

To lay foundations for such research, this article presents a theoretical framework for defining the Project Architecture (PA) in the context of working with EA.

We start with explicating the context of a PSA in terms of its relation to the EA and DA. Subsequently, we define the PA in terms of three dimensions. The first dimension contains four aspect areas. The second dimension features four abstraction levels. The third dimension contains two project content categories: the PSA (containing prescriptions inherited from the EA and/or DA) and the PED (the Project Exclusive Design, containing the fundamental analysis and design artifacts that have been created specifically for the project). A real-life case is used to help illustrate and validate the theoretical framework. Additionally, a mapping with RUP artifacts is made to further clarify the framework of the PA with examples of well-known analysis and design artifact types.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["628"]}

However, the impact of software on energy consumption has been acknowledged as significant by researchers in software engineering. In spite of that, due to cost and time constraints, many software producing organizations are unable to effectively measure software energy consumption preventing them to include energy efficiency in the product roadmap.In this paper, we apply a software energy profiling method to reliably compare the energy consumed by a commercial software product across two consecutive releases. We demonstrate how the method can be applied and provide an in-depth analysis of energy consumption of software components. Additionally, we investigate the added value of these measurement for multiple stakeholders in a software producing organization, by means of semi-structured interviews. Our results show how the introduction of an encryption module caused a noticeable increase in the energy consumption of the product. Such results were deemed valuable by the stakeholders and provided insights on how specific software changes might affect energy consumption. In addition, our interviews show that such a quantification of software energy consumption helps to create awareness and eventually consider energy efficiency aspects when planning software releases.", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["628"]}

Knowledge about these relationships and reuse methods enables development managers and software architects to make informed decisions on both the managerial and the architectural level, narrowing the gap between business requirements and design.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["628"]}

This paper presents a new APR method that assimilates various research results and empirical experiences. It explains that APR does not automatically return on investment: it is important to use the right method in order to get benefits. APR consists of three main steps: the assessment phase, where information on the applications and the portfolio is gathered, the evaluation phase, where the information is analyzed, and the planning phase, where all actions are planned that improve the portfolio and reduce complexity. A real life case of a financial services company shows the method in practice.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["628"]}

This paper describes a study within a single organization in which the effectiveness of requirements engineering in projects using facilitated workshops is compared with the effectiveness of past projects that used one-on-one interviews to gather requirements instead of facilitated workshops. In the study the duration, effort and satisfaction of 49 DSDM projects using facilitated workshops have been compared with 20 projects that used the Method/1 method, which use one-on-one interviews to gather the requirements. For small projects, Method/I's one-on-one interviews are found to be more efficient, whereas for larger projects the efficiency of one-one-one interviews is surpassed by DSDM's\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["628"]}

Their spectrum is wide and it encompasses, among others, non-profit non-governmental organisations, social economy enterprises and companies with a committed corporate social responsibility. Responsible enterprises face many challeng-es, such as complying with governmental regulations, defining sustainable business models, having a positive social and envi-ronmental impact, and fostering ethical consumption. [OBJEC-TIVE] Our premise is that responsible enterprises need responsi-ble software, which is software that assists enterprises in becom-ing increasingly responsible. We intend to discover the challenges that responsible enterprises face during the process of becoming more sustainable and to envision how enterprise modellers and software developers can use their competences and knowledge repositories to support enterprise missions. [METHODOLOGY] We have conducted a literature review and interviewed relevant stakeholders in the area in order to elicit a number of problemat-ic phenomena related to enterprise responsibility. We then fil-tered the elicited issues to focus on those that are related to and can be tackled by applying software. [RESULTS] We have elabo-rated a roadmap for future research endeavours on responsible software. Interestingly, a core practice to be properly supported is socio-environmental auditing.

Two types of division of work are presented that set different requirements on knowledge integration. Drawing from insights of the fields of IS research (business-IT alignment), organizational theory (knowledge-based theory of the firm) and sociology (boundary objects) we arrive at a conceptual model linking knowledge integration mechanisms to types of division of work. We test this conceptual model in three cases.

{"title": "Determining the Quality of Enterprise Architecture Products\n", "abstract": " Enterprise Architecture (EA) is a maturing field that helps an enterprise to build up its agility and integration in order to deal with internal and external change. To achieve this products are made that tangibly reflect the ideas about how the enterprise can become more agile and integrated in a coherent and consistent way.Both science and practice can benefit greatly from an instrument that measures the quality of these EA products. This thesis describes the steps taken to develop and validate such an instrument, as well as an extensive description of the theoretical framework underlying it. The theoretical framework consists of a basic principle and a quality model based on an literature study. The basic principle describes the view on EA products and quality as developed for this research. The quality model is a two by two quadrant model that creates boundaries for measuring the quality of an EA product. A list of attributes was created from many different quality methods in related fields. These attributes are measurable qualities of the EA product. Measuring an attribute is done qualitatively in the instrument, by using items that describe the perfect state of an attribute. A reviewer scores an item by stating if and how much he agrees that an item is applicable to the EA product under scrutiny on a customized Likert scale. This resulting instrument was tested in practice by 26 respondents and statistically validated. After some adjustments the instrument has shown reliability and validity.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["628"]}

Organizations are recognizing the potential benefits and importance of developing a product for a market. Product software is defined as a packaged configuration which consists of software components or a software-based service, with auxiliary materials, which is released for and traded in a specific market (Xu & Brinkkemper, 2005). Also organizations which develop software specifically for one customer have identified a need to change their software into a standard product. But how can these organizations transform their software and create a standard software product? Yet, there are few scientific studies reported on such transformation. This study stipulates the need for more exploratory research on the transformation by identifying a productization process.This research presents several concepts and models, which are developed and validated within this research. The first result which we present in this study is an overview of twenty differences between customized software development and standardized development. The second result is the productization process, which we created as a result of the identified differences and a literature study. The productization process describes the transformation from a customer-specific software development to a standard software product for an entire market.

Recent developments like a national authentication mechanism and system integration tools (called mid-office) have made it more possible than ever to realise decent electronic services. Already, quite some municipalities have started experimenting with offering several electronic services using different software solutions. However, there seems not to be a single methodology to create a roadmap in witch a municipality can stage its development towards full electronic services. Part of this absence lies in the complexity in options a municipality has to deal with, like national government policies and public demands. This paper addresses this problem by describing a framework to generally guide the development of electronic services. This framework is based on Business IT Alignment (BITA) and the use of Enterprise Architecture Modeling to visualize and support changes based on decisions from business goals of an organisation.

Beside sociology and management science, this field requires knowledge from various areas of computer science: data-communication, human-computer interfaces, information systems design.CSCW is an area in which social and technical sciences meet. It is an area in which scientists truly attempt to bridge the gap between disciplines. In this paper we make an attempt to do just that.

This paper argues that firms\u2019 EA-driven dynamic capabilities lead to innovative value-creating actions and, ultimately, improve organizational benefits. Hence, we propose a theoretical model that explains how these dynamic capabilities enable the innovativeness of firms. Moreover, we explain the contingent role of an organic firm structure and its relation to firm innovativeness. Data within this study is collected from 299 CIOs and IT managers. This study uses a variance-based approach and a complementary fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to analyze the model\u2019s hypothesized relationships. Our study outcomes demonstrate a positive relationship between EA-driven dynamic capabilities and firms\u2019 innovativeness as well as between innovation and organizational benefits. Our post-hoc analyses using fsQCA reveal various circumstances in which organic firm structure and valuable, rare, inimitable, and non-substitutional (VRIN) firm resources are particularly relevant for firms to obtain high levels of firm innovativeness.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["628"]}
{"title": "A resource utilization score for software energy consumption\n", "abstract": " Software as the true consumer of power and its potential contribution to reach sustainability goals is increasingly being acknowledged. Studies so far have presented successful results and methods to address the energy consumption of the software, indicating that different stakeholders striving for green software have different information needs with respect to their goals. However, currently there is no uniform manner to communicate measurements to the different stakeholders such that key findings are clearly identifiable and easy to understand, which is likely to hamper green software practices. In this paper we propose a metric that expresses a score for the resource utilization, such as power consumption, of a software product. The metric is designed to be a single score and is flexible to encompass those aspects that a stakeholder considers relevant in the context of software energy consumption. The metric was applied on two applications and allowed for objective comparison of application configurations and versions. Also the behavior of these applications across different hardware configurations could be analyzed. In addition to the metric we investigate means to visualize measurements which enhances communication and helped with highlighting the key findings.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["628"]}

The so-called productization process enables software companies to perform a business transformation from customer specific service-driven to a product business. This research aims to evaluate to what extent the proposed productization process is applicable in a service-oriented company using seven theory-testing case studies within the context of one IT service firm. The results indicate that the productization process cannot be applied to its full extent, since most of the product-driven processes are not mature, which is largely caused by a lack of knowledge about the productization process in service firms.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["628"]}

Numerous empirical studies are available, but systematic reviews that accumulate the results are not abundant.Meta-analysis is a way to accumulate the results of scientific research. Usually, a meta-analysis study focuses on investigating collected empirical results with regard to a single hypothesis. In this research we take a broader perspective by adding principles of network analysis to the basics of meta-analysis. This encompasses that we consider the concepts (or variables) in the hypotheses of relevant scientific papers and use them as the nodes in a network. Moreover, the presupposed relations between the concepts (also depicted in the hypotheses) are the links between nodes. The concept network that emerges can subsequently be analyzed in terms of eg density and degree. In order to test the robustness of a theory we compare the network of theoretically posed relations to the network of relations that are empirically validated and found significant. The paper describes the use of this approach towards meta-analysis as well as a tool that supports the approach: the Open Knowledge Infrastructure (OpenKI). This publicly accessible online database allows storage and retrieval of hypotheses and meta-information of scientific papers.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["628"]}

We do this by taking into account the type of innovation, specifically product and process innovation. We carried out a meta-analysis of 35 IT innovation adoption studies. The results show that five factors consistently affect the adoption decision for both product and process innovations, namely relative advantage, compatibility, top management support, organizational readiness, and competition. Two factors, namely organizational size and external pressure, showed significant effect for product innovations, but not for process innovations. Accordingly, we conclude that distinguishing product and process innovations can be useful in studying the influence of TOE factors in IT innovation adoption.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["628"]}

{"title": "A Shared Vision for Digital Transformation: Codification of The Operating Model Canvas Approach\n", "abstract": " Digital transformations are essential for organisations to stay competitive in modern economy. A digital transformation demands the business and IT departments of an organisation to be aligned and have a shared vision on the organisation\u2019s future. To aid the generation of a shared vision as a basis for digital transformation, we propose the Operating Model Canvas (OMC) Approach. Its result is the OMC, a model that visualises the organisation\u2019s value propositions, primary and supporting business activities, channels, and actors. We have performed a retrospective case study to codify the process and deliverables of the OMC Approach, to define its scientific fundamentals, and demonstrate its results. We found that the OMC provides a shared language for business and IT departments and subsequently generates them a shared vision. The key elements for generating a shared vision during the approach are the usage of existing client documentation and the active client participation throughout the entire process. We think the OMC can therefore be a solid starting point for a digital transformation project. The scientific contribution of this paper is to add to the theory of digital transformation design by codifying the OMC Approach.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["628"]}

This research addressed the problem consisting of the difficulties encountered by process participants when interacting with flexible process aware information systems. In order to overcome these difficulties, several approaches for guiding or supporting the process participants during enactment, based on process mining, have been proposed. However, these solutions lacked the suitable semantics for humans reasoning and decision making during enactment as they provided recommendations at a low granularity level. Consequently, the objective of this research was twofold. First, the implications for agents, process participant and process administrator, of integrating flexible processes into process aware information systems were analyzed through a systematic literature study. Secondly, using design science, two artifacts were created to solve the problematic situation: 1) an innovative process mining technique that discovers the intentional model of the executable process in an unsupervised manner, and 2) a recommendation tool that formulates recommendations as intentions and confidence factors, based on partial traces and probabilistic calculus. The artifacts were evaluated in a case study with a Childcare application supporting flexible process enactment with a datadriven approach. The experiments revealed that the intention mining technique had a precision of 0.69 in discovering the correct intentions\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["628"]}
{"title": "A typology based approach to assign responsibilities to software layers\n", "abstract": " In software architecture, the Layers pattern is commonly used. When this pattern is applied, the responsibilities of a software system are divided over a number of layers and the dependencies between the layers are limited. This may result in benefits like improved analyzability, reusability and portability of the system. However, many layered architectures are poorly designed and documented. This paper proposes a typology and a related approach to assign responsibilities to software layers. The Typology of Software Layer Responsibility (TSLR) gives an overview of responsibility types in the software of business information systems; it specifies and exemplifies these responsibilities and provides unambiguous naming. A complementary instrument, the Responsibility Trace Table (RTT), provides an overview of the TSLR-responsibilities assigned to the layers of a case-specific layered design. The instruments aid the design, documentation and review of layered software architectures. The application of the TSLR and RTT is demonstrated in three cases.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["628"]}

In practical cases individual diagrams may be large and complex; another complicating factor is that different diagrams are interrelated because they portray the same or closely related concepts within different contexts, eg Entity-Relationship diagrams and Data Flow diagrams. The present paper describes the techniques that are used for reducing the complexity in diagramming techniques in com-mercially available CASE tools. Maintenance of compatibility between different dia-grams, so-called modelling transparency, has also been evaluated for these CASE tools.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["628"]}

Additionally, there is a big gap be-tween state of the art and practice in software architecture. For enterprise software customisation, not only do these issues apply, but additional challenges exist too. Instead of one standard soft-ware product, vendors often have to deal with customised ver-sions with additional maintenance challenges. In this research, we apply the Requirements Engineering for Software Architecture (RE4SA) model via a multi-case study to show how the require-ments engineering and software architecture disciplines can be linked, and in doing so provide improvements to both areas. Our multi-case study regards enterprise software customisation and shows improvements in requirements management and higher alignment between the software architecture and requirements.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["628"]}

Looking at the Organizational Aspect\n", "abstract": " The aim of this paper is to investigate the influence of three organizational factors on the adoption of SaaS in Indonesian companies, namely top management support, organizational readiness, and organizational size. We conducted interviews with 15 case companies. Our results show that top management support has a positive influence on SaaS adoption, while organizational readiness and organizational size have an inverse effect. This is surprising, since it contradicts existing research on IT innovation adoption. We also found that the SaaS awareness level of our interviewees remains low, especially among the non-adopters. These findings have implications for IT service providers that want to formulate strategies to increase the intention to adopt SaaS in Indonesian companies; as well as for IT innovation researchers who have an interest in SaaS adoption in developing countries.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["628"]}

The accuracy of these analyses, however, is greatly dependent on the quality of the training sets used for building the machine learning models. We propose that unsupervised exploratory methods should first be applied to the data set to gain a better insight into the quality of the data. This improves the selection and labeling of data for creating training sets before the application of machine learning. We demonstrate this using a high-content genome-wide small interfering RNA screen. We perform an unsupervised exploratory data analysis to facilitate the identification of four robust phenotypes, which we subsequently use as a training set for building a high-quality random forest machine learning model to differentiate four phenotypes with an accuracy of 91.1% and a kappa of 0\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["628"]}

Government organizations are no different. Application Portfolio Rationalization can be used to reduce the size and complexity of the application portfolio, resulting in cost reduction. This paper focuses on rationalizing the application portfolio of small municipalities in order to reduce overall IT costs. It is shown that rationalization is a continuously ongoing process and the optimization of the portfolio, as well as managing changes made to the portfolio is key to keeping the portfolio rationalized. Case studies have been executed at four small municipalities to determine the problem areas of small municipalities with their application portfolio, as well as key focus points for rationalization. This is combined with an intensive literature research to provide an Application Portfolio Rationalization method for small municipalities. The main goal of this method is to reduce the size and complexity ofthe application portfolio, but it also focuses on optimization and the management of portfolio change. This research will show that these two are also key to optimizing and rationalizing the application portfolio. It is important for municipalities that the method can be applied easily and quickly in in order to be as useful as possible, this has been done by creating an online assessment, that small municipalities can fill out online.

Wrong investment decisions, lacking product information, inefficient use of resources and above all a misfit with strategy are just few of the consequences of bad portfolio management. But product portfolio management is not a clear cut, one time implementation of tools. Instead it is a dynamic decision process where processes, products and projects are constantly updated and revised. Another difficulty is posed by the fact that also project portfolio management and product lifecycle management are strongly related to product portfolio management.For all of the subjects methods, best practices and models exist, but as far as known no method exists to implement the entire process within software organizations while the relation between each subject has been agreed upon. Also, whilst often maturity situations are described, no concrete actions are presented to actually reach these maturity situations.

Different databases use different ways of storing the same data, resulting in undesired redundancy and restrained information transfer.

{"title": "Limitations of network analysis for studying efficiency and effectiveness of knowledge sharing\n", "abstract": " To identify possible deficiencies in knowledge sharing several authors proposed to apply a network perspective. In this perspective, the knowledge transfer relations between people are studied. The proposition in these researches is that the position of an individual in a network or the specific clustering of people into groups serves as an indicator concerning the efficiency or effectiveness of knowledge sharing. However, previous research learned that a network perspective might not reveal all deficiencies as it mainly focuses on the tacit dimension of knowledge. In this research, we seek to validate one of the network approaches to study the tacit dimension of knowledge sharing, which is called Knowledge Network Analysis. To validate the Knowledge Network Analysis technique we conducted a case study, at an international product software supplier. A knowledge network analysis was conducted and the outcome of this analysis is compared with a qualitative study based on interviews and direct observations that focused on the tacit as well as the explicit dimension of knowledge. To analyze the qualitative data we developed a new model called Knowledge Sharing Environment Model (KSEM), which is capable of identifying and quantifying knowledge sharing bottlenecks. A total of eight bottlenecks identified by KNA were analyzed by means of the KSEM. Hence, six out of eight bottlenecks were validated. This case study demonstrates that Knowledge Network Analysis is a good tool for the identification of bottlenecks.

This information can be integrated in an offshore readiness assessment aimed at assessing an IT organization for readiness in offshoring their application development. Risk described in literature was validated in expert interviews and related to project success in an online survey. From a scientific perspective a delicate extension of specific risk impacts is given to the undifferentiated manner in which risks are often described in scientific literature. An outsourcing IT organization or consultancy firm can use the results (to advice) on risk prioritization prior to offshoring application development.A focused literature study was conducted to derive risk (factors) and a risk categorization framework. A distinction was made between basic, residual, controllable and incontrollable risk variables leading to a total of 81 risk variables distributed among categories and integrated in an online survey. This survey was sent to project managers in offshore application development project from which 44 were returned. In order to derive a more comprehensible and manageable set of risk variables, PCA factor analyses were performed for the different risk variable categories and residual factor loadings were used as input for a linear regression analysis to explain project success.

Automating continuous updating enables vendors and customers to flexibly define release, delivery and deployment policies, and subsequently reduce time to market with minimum effort. Such flexibility enables customers to be in full control of how and when product knowledge and updates are delivered, tested, and deployed.

We will discuss the industrial practices of Requirements Engineering and Requirements Management, and illustrate these with the RM methods and tools for the development of the Baan ERP products. We will end with an overview of research opportunities in Requirements Engineering motivated\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["628"]}

When dealing with this vast amount of requirements, the notion of deciding which requirements will be addressed first, and which will be addressed later, is an important decision. To support software development teams in decision-making, different prioritization techniques are discussed in previous literature. In this paper, two existing prioritization techniques called Analytical Hierarchy Processing (AHP) and Bubblesort are investigated in order to measure their outcome in terms of usability, time consumption and perceived reliability. By conducting an experiment among Dutch Master students, we discovered that Bubblesort outpaced AHP on all aspects, although this could not be supported statistically. However, based on our findings, we can conclude that there is a strong indication that Bubblesort is considered favorable compared to AHP even though it receives less attention in current literature.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["628"]}

However, they rarely address all issues completely. Only 50% of the Enterprise Architecture products are judged readable. The Enterprise Architecture products are very explicit about their status but do not mention a clear time span for the architecture to be valid or how the architecture should link to the existing enterprise. These are some of the results of a study to assess the quality of Enterprise Architecture products, we conducted in 2005.For many, the term Enterprise Architecture conjures up visions of colorful models and fat documents with guidelines. These products of the Enterprise Architecture process are indeed its most tangible result. Most architects can intuitively tell which models are the most readable and which guidelines are the strongest but that intuition is not objective enough to produce an independent measure of the quality of an architecture product. Until recently, no such measurement existed.

The software product is defined based on the market success, customer satisfaction and meeting the internal business goals. Software projects are defined based on the delivery time, the quality and the cost incurred from the project development. Product and project managers are characterized upon their role specific qualifications as well as their positioning within the organizational structure of a software product vendor.The research is a dedicated theory oriented research. It concludes with some theory propositions as the result of both a qualitative and a quantitative analysis. The theory propositions describe the relationships between Software Product Management and Software Project Management. The findings show that project\u2019s quality is the most influential factor for the product\u2019s market success as well as for the customer satisfaction. Product managers are proved to be more business oriented, focusing on Strategic and Tactical decision-making. Project managers need more technical skills and they are more involved with Operational and Tactical decisions.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["628"]}
{"title": "Impacts of implementing Enterprise Content Management Systems\n", "abstract": " This paper presents the results of a case study on the impacts of implementing Enterprise Content Management Systems (ECMSs) in an organization. It investigates how these impacts are influenced by the functionalities of an ECMS and by the nature of the ECMS-supported processes. The results confirm that both factors do influence the impacts. Further, the results indicate that the implementation of an ECMS can change the nature of ECMS-supported processes. It is also demonstrated that the functionalities of an ECMS need to be aligned with the nature of the processes of the implementing organization. This finding confirms previous research from the Workflow Management domain and extends it to the ECM domain. Finally, the case study results show that implementing an ECMS to support rather \u2018static\u2019 processes can be expected to cause more and stronger impacts than the support of \u2018flexible\u2019 processes.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["628"]}
{"title": "An Approach to Creating Design Methods for the Implementation of Product Software: The Case of Web Information Systems\n", "abstract": " Development of a new software product is a complex process, in which requirements, release deadlines, and technical challenges fight for priority. These products are designed with the first release in mind which can sometimes cause software developers to have to make extensive design changes in subsequent releases. This paper presents an approach that creates design methods for product software design projects. The resulting design method is used to create a complete, maintainable, and durable product design. The approach has been applied in a practical case study of a series of web information system design projects. In this paper we describe the part of the case where key features were gathered and associated to method fragments, and how they were validated by an expert group.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["628"]}

{"title": "Customized Assumption Planning in Business Planning\n", "abstract": " Conventional business planning methods operate on the premise that entrepreneurs can extrapolate future results from a well-understood base of information from present and past. However, for new businesses this way of planning does not comply. Most of the time there is no past-knowledge available and if there is, predicting the future out of it is nearly impossible. The entrepreneurs\u2019 solution to this problem is to make assumptions. There are several known assumption based planning methods used to reduce and test the uncertainty in a business plan. These methods however are often pinpointed to a particular situation and goal, addressing only partially the entrepreneurs\u2019 needs to prepare for the future. In this paper we formalize three assumption based planning methods and codify them into method fragments, which entrepreneurs can use to engineer their own customized assumption based planning method\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["628"]}

The aim of the research was to document the CCU process of GX, and to uncover strengths and weaknesses. The case study was performed by doing interviews and examining development documentation, software, and internally used tools. The results of the case study are organizational descriptions, software descriptions, and the descriptions of the CCU and development processes. The main conclusions of the case study are twofold. First the case study shows that explicit software knowledge management can automate parts of the CCU process. Secondly, the case study uncovers complex issues that are specific to content management system vendors.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["628"]}
{"title": "Modeling multi-party web-based business collaborations\n", "abstract": " To remain competitive, enterprises have to mesh their business processes with their customers, suppliers and business partners. Increasing collaboration includes not only a global multi-national enterprise, but also an organization with its relationship to and business processes with its business partners. Standards and technologies permit business partners to exchange information, collaboration and carry out business transaction in a pervasive Web environment. There is however still very limited research activity on modeling multi-party Web-based business collaboration underlying semantics. In this paper, we demonstrate that an in-house business process has been gradually outsourced to third-parties and analyze how task delegations cause commitments between multiple business parties. Finally we provide process semantics for modeling multi-party Web-based collaborations.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["628"]}
{"title": "Een instrument voor de kwaliteitsmeting van het enterprise architectuur ontwikkelproces\n", "abstract": " Kwaliteit en kwaliteitsmeting zijn nog onontgonnen gebieden binnen het vakgebied van de enterprise architectuur. Voor het meten van volwassenheid zijn inmiddels wel instrumenten beschikbaar, maar tot zeer recent bestond er geen gestructureerde en betrouwbare manier om de kwaliteit van architectuur en haar processen te meten. Daar is verandering in gekomen toen in de tweede helft van 2005 vanuit de Universiteit van Utrecht, onder begeleiding van Sogeti Nederland BV, een afstudeeronderzoek is uitgevoerd naar de kwaliteit van het architectuurproces. Dit artikel beschrijft de resultaten van dit onderzoek: de ontwikkeling van een kwaliteitsinstrument voor het architectuur ontwikkelproces. Parallel hieraan is een tweede onderzoek verricht, waarin de kwaliteit van architectuurproducten centraal stond. Deze beide onderzoeken vullen de leemte binnen de enterprise architectuur op het gebied van kwaliteitsmeting.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["628"]}
{"title": "Managing Natural Language Requirements in Large-Scale Software Development\n", "abstract": " An increasing number of market-and technology-driven software development companies face the challenge of managing several thousands of requirements written in natural language. The large number of requirements causes bottlenecks in the requirements management process and calls for increased efficiency in requirements engineering. This thesis presents results from empirical investigations of using linguistic engineering techniques to alleviate three requirements management activities in large-scale software development: identification of duplicate requirements, linkage of related requirements, and consolidation of different sets of requirements. The activities rely on one common activity: finding requirements that are semantically similar, ie, refer to the same underlying functionality. Three case studies are presented, in which three different companies, comprising three different requirements management challenges, are investigated. Simulation is used to explore process bottlenecks and two different sets of industrial requirements are used for evaluating suggested solutions. A controlled experiment is also presented, evaluating a new open source support tool for semi-automatic identification of similar requirements. The results show that, for the investigated activities, lexical similarity between requirements may be a sufficient approximation of their semantic similarity. It is also shown that automatic calculation of this similarity may support the activities and give valuable time-savings. The results from the presented research point in one direction: that simple, robust, and cost-efficient linguistic engineering techniques can give effective\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["628"]}

In this paper we use ME with a somewhat unusual perspective, that is, an educational one. We introduce a procedure for the evaluation of information systems curricula within an ME framework. Using this approach it is possible to quantitatively characterise and compare information systems curricula, showing their relative strengths and weaknesses. As an example we evaluate three model curricula (IS\u201990, IS\u201997 and ISCC\u201999) and analyse their differences and similarities.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["628"]}
