Fortunately, most of the malware are composed of well-known pieces of code, thus can be grouped into families sharing the same malicious behaviour. One interesting approach, which makes use of Image Classification techniques, proposes to convert the malware binaries to images, extract feature vectors and classifying them with supervised machine learning models. Realizing that researchers usually evaluate their solutions on private datasets, it is difficult to establish whether a model can be generalized on another dataset, making it difficult to compare the performance of the various models. This paper presents a comparison between different combination of feature vector extraction methods and machine learning models. The methodology aimed to evaluate feature extractors and supervised machine learning algorithms, and it was tested on more than 20 thousand images of malware, grouped into 10 different malware families. The best classifier, a combination of GIST descriptors and Random Forest classifiers, achieved an accuracy of 0.97 on average.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["361"]}

{"title": "A data life cycle modeling proposal by means of formal methods\n", "abstract": " Data usually evolve according to specific processes, with the consequent possibility to identify a profile of evolution: the values it may assume, the frequencies at which it changes, the temporal variation in relation to other data, or other constraints that are directly connected to the reference domain. A violation of these conditions could be the signal of different menaces that threat the system, as well as: attempts of a tampering or a cyber attack, a failure in the system operation, a bug in the applications which manage the life cycle of data. To detect such violations is not straightforward as processes could be unknown or hard to extract. In this paper we propose an approach to model the data life cycle by observing the data evolution in its life cycle. Thus, we represent users able to alter data through timed automata. Through model checking, the obtained profile of evolution can be used to detect anomalies in relational\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["361"]}
{"title": "Investigating Mobile Applications Quality in Official and Third-party Marketplaces.\n", "abstract": " One of the winning factors of Android was the use of the Java programming language and the XML language for application development. Furthermore, the open-source license and the availability of reverse engineering tools stimulated the proliferation of third-party markets where users can download for free repackaged version of commercial app, facilitating the phenomenon of plagiarism. In this paper we present an empirical study aimed to define whether there are differences from the quality point of view in Android applications available in the official market and in third-party ones, investigating whether supervised and unsupervised models built with a set of features belonging to four categories (ie, dimensional, complexity, object oriented and Android) are effective in app store detection.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["361"]}

The main issue in human behaviour modeling is represented by the diverse nature of human activities and the nature in which they are performed by the individual makes them challenging to recognize. In this paper we propose a method aimed to recognize human activities and detect users using features gathered from accelerometer sensors widespread in wearable and mobile devices. We exploit machine learning aimed to build models with the ability to discriminate between a set of user activities: sitting, sitting down, standing, standing up and walking. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed method is able to distinguish between different users and to identify the user genre.

{"title": "Formal modeling for magnetic resonance images tamper mitigation\n", "abstract": " The picture archiving and communication system is a medical imaging technology used primarily in healthcare organizations to store and digitally transmit electronic images and clinically-relevant reports. As demonstrated, these systems can be exploited by malicious users: in fact, considering that medical images are not digitally encrypted, any medical image modifications would be difficult to detect for a radiologist. To mitigate this aspect, in this paper a formal modelisation for picture archiving and communication system systems is proposed. The main aim is to avoid illegal writing and reading from components that should not do it, by representing the system components in terms of automa.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["361"]}
{"title": "Dunuen: A user-friendly formal verification tool\n", "abstract": " Formal verification allows checking the design and the behaviour of a system. One of the main limitations to the adoption of formal verification techniques is the process of model creation using specification languages. For this reason a tool supporting this activity is necessary. Actually, there are several tools allowing analysts to verify models expressed into specification languages. These tools provide support for automatically checking whether a system satisfies a property. However, to use such tools it is important to deeply know a precise notation for defining a system, i.e., the Calculus of Communicating Systems. Since systems are often expressed as time-series, to overcome this problem, we provide an user-friendly tool able to automatically generate a system model starting from the CSV - Comma-Separated Values format (the most widespread format considered to release dataset). In this way we hide the details\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["361"]}

Automated formal verification of safety critical systems has been mostly focused on analysing high-level abstract models which, however, are significantly different from real implementations written in programming languages. In this paper we propose a technique that links model checking verification closer to real implementations, with particular regard to financial environment, in order to identify possible causes of data breaches. A formal model starting from execution traces is retrieved. Thus, the discovered model can be analysed to verify it respects the defined properties. A real safety critical system has been used as a case study to evaluate the proposed methodology.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["361"]}
{"title": "VizMal: A Visualization Tool for Analyzing the Behavior of Android Malware.\n", "abstract": " Malware signature extraction is currently a manual and a time-consuming process. As a matter of fact, security analysts have to manually inspect samples under analysis in order to find the malicious behavior. From research side, current literature is lacking of methods focused on the malicious behavior localization: designed approaches basically mark an entire application as malware or non-malware (ie, take a binary decision) without knowledge about the malicious behavior localization inside the analysed sample. In this paper, with the twofold aim of assisting the malware analyst in the inspection process and of pushing the research community in malicious behavior localization, we propose VizMal, a tool for visualizing the dynamic trace of an Android application which highlights the portions of the application which look potentially malicious. VizMal performs a detailed analysis of the application activities showing for each second of the execution whether the behavior exhibited is legitimate or malicious. The analyst may hence visualize at a glance when at to which degree an application execution looks malicious.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["361"]}
{"title": "Identifying Insecure Features in Android Applications using Model Checking.\n", "abstract": " Nowadays Android is the most widespread operating system. This is the reason why malware writers target it. Both researchers and commercial antimalware provide several solutions to fix and detect this phenomenon. They analyze one single application per time using combinations of static, dynamic and behavior based techniques. However, one of the last new threats is the collusion attack. In order to perpetrate this attack the malicious behaviour is divided between two or more applications: collusion refers to multiple applications that accomplish their fragment of malicious behaviour and then communicate using the Inter Component Communication mechanism provided by Android platform. Basically the colluded applications intentionally put in view private and sensitive information. The aim of this paper is to investigate whether legitimate and malware applications share private data. One way to exchange data between different applications in Android environment is through Shared Preferences. In this preliminary work we investigate whether an application transfers data using Shared Preferences with public visibility.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["361"]}
{"title": "Let\u2019s gossip: Exploring malware zero-day time windows by social network analysis\n", "abstract": " The detection mechanism provided by current antimalware technologies expects that security researchers build a signature to uniquely identify the malicious samples. Once obtained, the signature will made available to final users using the update mechanism. This time window, which begins when malware is released and it lasts until the malware is identified, it is called zero-day window and represents the time period in which the malware is able to cause the worst damages because it is undiscovered. In this paper we propose a backward analysis methodology aiming to provide a preliminary estimation of this time window width, mining search engine trend and social network and by applying natural language processing and text analysis.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["361"]}

To assist pathologists and radiologists in the detection of the novel coronavirus, in this paper we propose a two-tiered method, based on formal methods (to the best of authors knowledge never previously introduced in this context), aimed to (i) detect whether the patient lungs are healthy or present a generic pulmonary infection;(ii) in the case of the previous tier, a generic pulmonary disease is detected to identify whether the patient under analysis is affected by the novel Coronavirus disease. The proposed approach relies on the extraction of radiomic features from medical images and on the generation of a formal model that can be automatically checked using the model checking technique. We perform an experimental analysis using a set of computed tomography medical images obtained by the authors, achieving an accuracy of higher than 81% in disease detection.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["361"]}
{"title": "Detection of Malicious Software by Analyzing Distinct Artifacts Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms\n", "abstract": " Malware is one of the most significant threats in today\u2019s computing world since the number of websites distributing malware is increasing at a rapid rate. Malware analysis and prevention methods are increasingly becoming necessary for computer systems connected to the Internet. This software exploits the system\u2019s vulnerabilities to steal valuable information without the user\u2019s knowledge, and stealthily send it to remote servers controlled by attackers. Traditionally, anti-malware products use signatures for detecting known malware. However, the signature-based method does not scale in detecting obfuscated and packed malware. Considering that the cause of a problem is often best understood by studying the structural aspects of a program like the mnemonics, instruction opcode, API Call, etc. In this paper, we investigate the relevance of the features of unpacked malicious and benign executables like mnemonics, instruction opcodes, and API to identify a feature that classifies the executable. Prominent features are extracted using Minimum Redundancy and Maximum Relevance (mRMR) and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Experiments were conducted on four datasets using machine learning and deep learning approaches such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Na\u00efve Bayes, J48, Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost. In addition, we also evaluate the performance of the collection of deep neural networks like Deep Dense network, One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN), and CNN-LSTM in classifying unknown samples, and we observed promising results using APIs and system calls.

{"title": "Can machine learning predict soccer match results?\n", "abstract": " Sport result prediction proposes an interesting challenge considering as popular and widespread are sport games, for instance tennis and soccer. The outcome prediction is a difficult task because there are a lot of factors that can afflict the final results and most of them are related to the player human behaviour. In this paper we propose a new feature set (related to the match and to players) aimed to model a soccer match. The set is related to characteristics obtainable not only at the end of the match, but also when the match is in progress. We consider machine learning techniques to predict the results of the match and the number of goals, evaluating a dataset of real-world data obtained from the Italian Serie A league in the 2017-2018 season. Using the RandomForest algorithm we obtain a precision of 0.857 and a recall of 0.750 in won match prediction, while for the goal prediction we obtain a precision of 0.879 in the number of goal prediction less than two, and a precision of 0.8 in the number of goal prediction equal or greater to two.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["361"]}

The ultimate goal is twofold: the reduction of costs and of resource consumption and the increasing number of services offered to citizens. As drawback, smart cities become more vulnerable from the point of view of safety, security, and preservation of citizen privacy. In this paper, we propose a fog-computing based infrastructure to manage the sharing of information among vehicles and smart traffic lights in a urban network, with the aim of improving the safety of end-users of the network. For this purpose, our infrastructure provides to drivers several services to retrieve information in a private and secure way.

As a matter of fact, they contain an ecosystem of several electronic units able to exchange data using the serial communication provided by the CAN bus. CAN packets are broadcasted to all components and it is in charge of the single component to decide whether it is the receiver of the packets, in addition the protocol does not provide source identification of authentication: these are the reasons why the CAN bus is exposed to attacks. In this paper we design a method to identify CAN bus targeting attacks. The proposed method takes into account deep learning algorithms ie, the Neural Network and the MultiLayer Perception. We evaluated our method using CAN messages gathered from a real vehicle injecting four different attacks (ie dos, fuzzy, gear and rpm), obtaining encouraging results in attacks identification.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["361"]}
{"title": "Malware and formal methods: Rigorous approaches for detecting malicious behaviour\n", "abstract": " The crucial aim of software security is malware detection. A malware is a program with malicious intents. The predominate anti-malware solutions are signature-based. These detectors compute the signature starting from the syntactic characteristics of the malicious code. Unfortunately, the signature-based techniques are ineffective against the code obfuscations, ie, trivial transformations that alter the syntax of the code preserving the normal behaviour of the program. To address this limitation, formal methods are used in software security. Formal methods are rigorous techniques used to verify the behaviour of a system. This paper aims to make an overview on behavioural based techniques developed to detect malware programs. The illustrated approaches are based on different formal techniques.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["361"]}
