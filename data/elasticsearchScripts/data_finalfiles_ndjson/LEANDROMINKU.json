{"title": "Ensemble learning for data stream analysis: A survey\n", "abstract": " In many applications of information systems learning algorithms have to act in dynamic environments where data are collected in the form of transient data streams. Compared to static data mining, processing streams imposes new computational requirements for algorithms to incrementally process incoming examples while using limited memory and time. Furthermore, due to the non-stationary characteristics of streaming data, prediction models are often also required to adapt to concept drifts. Out of several new proposed stream algorithms, ensembles play an important role, in particular for non-stationary environments. This paper surveys research on ensembles for data stream classification as well as regression tasks. Besides presenting a comprehensive spectrum of ensemble approaches for data streams, we also discuss advanced learning concepts such as imbalanced data streams, novelty detection, active\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "627\n", "authors": ["196"]}

Due to the large scale of current software projects, many studies have investigated the use of optimization algorithms to find good software project schedules.

Moreover, the changing environments of software companies mean that software project scheduling is a dynamic optimization problem.

Although a few methods have been proposed to handle such problems, most of them focus on two-class cases. Multi-class imbalance imposes additional challenges in learning. This paper studies the combined challenges posed by multiclass imbalance and online learning, and aims at a more effective and adaptive solution. First, we introduce two resampling-based ensemble methods, called MOOB and MUOB, which can process multi-class data directly and strictly online with an adaptive sampling rate. Then, we look into the impact of multi-minority and multi-majority cases on MOOB and MUOB in comparison to other methods under stationary and dynamic scenarios. Both multi-minority and multi-majority make a negative impact. MOOB shows the best and most stable G-mean in most stationary and dynamic cases.", "num_citations": "47\n", "authors": ["196"]}
{"title": "Online ensemble learning in the presence of concept drift\n", "abstract": " In online learning, each training example is processed separately and then discarded. Environments that require online learning are often non-stationary and their underlying distributions may change over time (concept drift). Even though ensembles of learning machines have been used for handling concept drift, there has been no deep study of why they can be helpful for dealing with drifts and which of their features can contribute for that. The thesis mainly investigates how ensemble diversity affects accuracy in online learning in the presence of concept drift and how to use diversity in order to improve accuracy in changing environments. This is the first diversity study in the presence of concept drift. The main contributions of the thesis are: - An analysis of negative correlation in online learning. - A new concept drift categorisation to allow principled studies of drifts. - A better understanding of when, how and why ensembles of learning machines can help to handle concept drift in online learning. - Knowledge of how to use information learnt from the old concept to aid the learning of the new concept. - A new approach called Diversity for Dealing with Drifts (DDD), which is accurate both in the presence and absence of drifts.", "num_citations": "38\n", "authors": ["196"]}

The clustering method also ensures that different neural networks specialize in different regions of the input space, working in a divide-and-conquer way, to maintain and improve the accuracy.

It is the only Cross-Company (CC) approach able achieve that while treating the online learning nature of the SEE problem, ie, the fact that new projects arrive over time and that SEE models must be able to adapt to any changes that could affect the effort required to develop software projects. In order to use CC projects for SEE, Dycom splits the CC projects into different subsets according to their productivity. Specifically, pre-defined productivity thresholds are used to decide the number of CC subsets and their composing projects. As each subset contains projects within the same productivity range, each subset is expected to contain projects that are more homogeneous to each other. These subsets are thus used to create different CC SEE models. Mapping functions are then learned to dynamically map the estimations given by the CC models to estimations reflecting the current context of a given company. These mapping functions are learned by using a small number of WC projects received over time. However, it is unclear how the CC splits affect Dycom\u2019s predictive performance.

{"title": "Chameleon: uma ferramenta de programa\u00e7\u00e3o gen\u00e9tica orientada a gram\u00e1ticas\n", "abstract": " A Computa\u00e7\u00e3o Evolucion\u00e1ria \u00e9 uma \u00e1rea recente de pesquisa baseada na Teoria da Evolu\u00e7\u00e3o de Darwin. Como exemplo de t\u00e9cnica de Computa\u00e7\u00e3o Evolucion\u00e1ria podemos citar a Programa\u00e7\u00e3o Gen\u00e9tica (PG), que utiliza programas como indiv\u00edduos que comp\u00f5em uma popula\u00e7\u00e3o sobre a qual s\u00e3o realizadas opera\u00e7\u00f5es a fim de encontrar a solu\u00e7\u00e3o de um problema. Recentemente foi introduzida a PG orientada a gram\u00e1ticas. O uso de gram\u00e1ticas auxilia na defini\u00e7\u00e3o do espa\u00e7o de busca, reduz algumas limita\u00e7\u00f5es da PG e facilita a gera\u00e7\u00e3o de programas v\u00e1lidos, bem como a generaliza\u00e7\u00e3o da solu\u00e7\u00e3o encontrada para diversos tipos de problemas. A Chameleon, descrita nesse artigo, \u00e9 uma ferramenta de Programa\u00e7\u00e3o Gen\u00e9tica Orientada a Gram\u00e1ticas que gera como sa\u00edda um programa de acordo com as especifica\u00e7\u00f5es do usu\u00e1rio. A entrada consiste de par\u00e2metros iniciais, entradas e sa\u00eddas esperadas do programa a ser gerado (usados para avalia\u00e7\u00e3o dos programas gerados por PG) e uma gram\u00e1tica para a linguagem de sa\u00edda a ser utilizada. A partir da gram\u00e1tica s\u00e3o criados os indiv\u00edduos (programas), ela tamb\u00e9m restringe os programas gerados, fazendo com que algumas produ\u00e7\u00f5es da linguagem sejam ou n\u00e3o permitidas al\u00e9m de fazer com que n\u00e3o ocorram erros de compila\u00e7\u00e3o. O artigo tamb\u00e9m apresenta um exemplo de utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o e resultados de um experimento realizado com a Chameleon.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["196"]}
