{"title": "An evaluation of the MOOD set of object-oriented software metrics\n", "abstract": " This paper describes the results of an investigation into a set of metrics for object-oriented design, called the MOOD metrics. The merits of each of the six MOOD metrics is discussed from a measurement theory viewpoint, taking into account the recognized object-oriented features which they were intended to measure: encapsulation, inheritance, coupling, and polymorphism. Empirical data, collected from three different application domains, is then analyzed using the MOOD metrics, to support this theoretical validation. Results show that (with appropriate changes to remove existing problematic discontinuities) the metrics could be used to provide an overall assessment of a software system, which may be helpful to managers of software development projects. However, further empirical studies are needed before these results can be generalized.", "num_citations": "508\n", "authors": ["549"]}
{"title": "Retrieving and analyzing mobile apps feature requests from online reviews\n", "abstract": " Mobile app reviews are valuable repositories of ideas coming directly from app users. Such ideas span various topics, and in this paper we show that 23.3% of them represent feature requests, i.e. comments through which users either suggest new features for an app or express preferences for the re-design of already existing features of an app. One of the challenges app developers face when trying to make use of such feedback is the massive amount of available reviews. This makes it difficult to identify specific topics and recurring trends across reviews. Through this work, we aim to support such processes by designing MARA (Mobile App Review Analyzer), a prototype for automatic retrieval of mobile app feature requests from online reviews. The design of the prototype is a) informed by an investigation of the ways users express feature requests through reviews, b) developed around a set of pre-defined\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "352\n", "authors": ["549"]}

The Coupling Between Objects (CBO) metric of Chidamber and Kemerer (1991) is evaluated empirically using five OO systems, and compared with an alternative OO design metric called SAS, which measures the number of associations between a class and its peers. The NAS metric is directly collectible from design documents such as the Object Model of OMT. Results from all systems studied indicate a strong relationship between CBO and NAS, suggesting that they are not orthogonal. We hypothesised that coupling would be related to understandability, the number of errors and error density. So relationships were found for any of the systems between class understandability and coupling. Only limited evidence was found to support our hypothesis linking increased coupling to increased error density. The work\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "154\n", "authors": ["549"]}
{"title": "Evolution in software systems: foundations of the SPE classification scheme\n", "abstract": " The SPE taxonomy of evolving software systems, first proposed by Lehman in 1980, is re\u2010examined in this work. The primary concepts of software evolution are related to generic theories of evolution, particularly Dawkins' concept of a replicator, to the hermeneutic tradition in philosophy and to Kuhn's concept of paradigm. These concepts provide the foundations that are needed for understanding the phenomenon of software evolution and for refining the definitions of the SPE categories. In particular, this work argues that a software system should be defined as of type P if its controlling stakeholders have made a strategic decision that the system must comply with a single paradigm in its representation of domain knowledge.

He argues that the European heritage is based less on a universalistic conception of culture than on a plurality of interconnecting narratives.

Currently this is a difficult task, particularly when an information system is deeply embedded in an organisation's business processes. Although previous work, notably by Lehman et al., has shown that the evolution of such embedded software systems can be characterised as a complex feedback process, more work is needed to solve the practical problems of managing software evolution. In this paper we present an approach to understanding software evolution that is based around the quantifiable concept of evolvability. This concept brings together the study of software product quality, the software evolution process, and their relationships with the organisational environment. We assess the opportunities for analysing and measuring evolvability at pre-design, architectural, and source code stages in the development of software. We also describe work in progress on models of software evolution. We present a definition of software product evolvability in terms of a software quality model. We have also proposed a set of metrics derived from our model, which will enable objective assessments to be made of the evolutionary history and evolvability of software products. In order to validate these metrics we need a model of software evolution dynamics and we present some initial results on developing predictive models of software product evolution.", "num_citations": "38\n", "authors": ["549"]}

This paper proposes a new method called datamorphic testing, which consists of three components: a set of seed test cases, a set of datamorphisms for transforming test cases, and a set of metamorphisms for checking test results. With an example of face recognition application, the paper demonstrates how to develop datamorphic test frameworks, and illustrates how to perform testing in various strategies, and validates the approach using an experiment with four real industrial applications of face recognition.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["549"]}

Advanced technology potentially supports such activities but requires consideration of psychological and behavioral constructs and usability issues. Economic factors and health care provider capacity influence access and uptake of advanced technology. Previous reviews have focused upon clinical outcomes or were descriptive or have synthesized studies on adults with those on children and young people where human factors are different.Objective: This review described and examined the relationship between human factors and adherence with technology for data logging processes in adults with T1D.Methods: A systematic literature search was undertaken by using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Quality appraisal was undertaken and data were abstracted and categorized into the themes that underpinned the human factor constructs that were examined.Results: A total of 18 studies were included. A total of 6 constructs emerged from the data analysis: the relationship between adherence to data logging and measurable outcomes; satisfaction with the transition to advanced technology for self-management; use of advanced technology and time spent on diabetes-related activities; strategies to mediate the complexities of diabetes and the use of advanced technology; cognition in the wild; and meanings, views, and perspectives from the users of technology.Conclusions: Increased treatment satisfaction was found on transition from traditional to advanced\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["549"]}

We investigated the aspects of a medium-scale software package developed in industry and measured the maintenance effort that was spent on this software as the number of changed lines throughout the history of each aspect. This measure of maintenance effort was correlated with size and several of the coupling metrics. Our results seem to suggest that some coupling measures indeed can be considered as possible indicators of maintainability. However, our data also suggests that size is a better indicator of maintenance effort than any other metric we studied.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["549"]}

It offers the idea of a new modular unit that encapsulates crosscutting concerns which would otherwise be scattered across multiple modules. Aspect-oriented measurement is a research area that has gained an increasing amount of attention lately due to the definition of several suites of measures designed to support aspect-oriented key features.

Statistical correlation between four inheritance metrics and a set of dependent variables (non-comment source lines, software understandability, known errors and error density) provide evidence for this claim.It is also not clear that systems using inheritance will necessarily be more maintainable than those that do not.

By empirical evaluation we refer to the study of software in order to characterize, predict, control, manage or improve through qualitative or quantitative analysis.

This book re-imagines architecture and urbanism by allowing the forest to be a prominent consideration in the language of design, thus recognizing the forest as essential rather than just incidental to human well-being. In Architecture and the Forest Aesthetic, forest is a large-scale urban construct that is far more extensive and nuanced than trees and shrubbery. The forest aesthetic opens designers to the forest as a model for an urban architecture of permeable floors, protective canopies, connected food chains, beneficial decomposition, and resilient ecologies. Much can be learned about these features of the forest from the natural sciences; however, when they are given due consideration technically and metaphorically in the design of urban habitat, the places in which humans live become living forests. What is present here in Architecture and the Forest Aesthetic is both a review of many ingenious ways in which the forest aesthetic has already been expressed in design and urbanism, and an encouragement to further use the forest aesthetic in design language and design outcomes.

{"title": "Practitioners views on Web development: an industrial survey by semi-structured interviews\n", "abstract": " Several companies with experience in web development were interviewed about aspects of software engineering (SE) when developing Web applications. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to investigate their development processes, quality assurance (including metrics used) and tool support. The interviews are a first stage of empirical assessment. Among research observations identified are the lack of methods, activities and artefacts to reflect hypermedia characteristics (structure, content and navigation) of web applications. Another finding highlights the difficulties and lack of rigour when planning web-based applications because of the novelty of this type of application. In general, quality is assessed in an ad-hoc manner, without following any process or guidelines. Equally, reuse is also carried out in an ad-hoc manner and sometimes components are developed from scratch because developers do not trust the quality of the components or the sources. Last but not least, there is a lack of quantitative feedback to quality improvements of both processes and products related to web development. Future work will investigate some of the issues raised from the interviews. Investigations will consist of evaluating different hypermedia methods and processes to model Web applications (eg, extending UML) by means of sound quality models such as ISO9216, ISO15504, etc. Further, our approach will incorporate quality metrics in the development processes by which could be automated and analysed to estimate and enhance quality characteristics of the software process itself and those of the product.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["549"]}

{"title": "Design Metrics in the Reengineering of Object-Oriented Systems\n", "abstract": " Various sets of OO metrics have recently been proposed as a way of identifying problem areas before they permeate to the latter development stages. However, these metrics are often only amenable to collection at the code level, often too late to prevent excessive maintenance costs being incurred. OO design metrics can be used to ease extraction of the design, thus facilitating reengineering. They also facilitate quantication of the extracted design, permitting reengineering decisions to be made more eectively. The OO metrics we developed helped us to extract essential characteristics of OO analysis and design such as inheritance, coupling, cohesion etc. We dened seven class metrics. The number of methods per class and the depth in the inheritance tree of a class are just two examples. As well as these class metrics, eleven system metrics were dened to give a system-wide view of OO features, for example the number of associations in the system and number of classes in the system. Data from a number of C++ systems of varying sizes and application domains was collected, for example, CRS: a commercial retail system consisting of about 23.8 KLOC 57 classes and GNU: a C++ Class Library, consisting of 53.5 KLOC 96 classes. Correlation analyses of the metrics were performed against dependent variables such as non-comment source lines NCSL and a measure of subjective understandability. Analysis revealed a strong positive relationship between the number of methods per class and NCSL for the majority of systems studied; similarly for the number of attributes per class.

Harrison Department of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Hampshire, UK ABSTRACT We present a way in which structured analysis and structured design can be used together with functional languages to produce a complete declarative development technique. We also examine the use of prototyping in the software development process by considering the use of functional languages for evolutionary prototyping. Our main conclusion is that the combination of structured analysis and structured design, evolutionary prototyping and functional languages produces a powerful methodology which facilitates the development of quality software. Keywords: rapid prototyping, specification, functional languages INTRODUCTION In this paper we demonstrate how structured analysis and structured design [1, 2] can be used together with functional languages to produce a complete declarative development technique.

{"title": "Maram: Tool support for mobile app review management\n", "abstract": " Mobile apps today have millions of user reviews available online. Such reviews cover a large broad of themes and are usually expressed in an informal language. They provide valuable information to developers, such as feature requests, bug reports, and detailed descriptions of one\u2019s interaction with the app. Due to the overwhelmingly large number of reviews apps usually get associated with, managing and making sense of reviews is difficult. In this paper, we address this problem by introducing MARAM, a tool designed to provide support for managing and integrating online reviews with other software management tools available, such as GitHub, JIRA and Bugzilla. The tool is designed to a) automatically extract app development relevant information from online reviews, b) support developers\u2019 queries on (subsets of) the user generated content available on app stores, namely online reviews, feature requests, and bugs, and c) support the management of online reviews and their integration with other software management tools available, namely GitHub, JIRA or Bugzilla.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["549"]}

{"title": "Evolution in software systems: Foundations of the SPE classification\n", "abstract": " The primary aim of this work is to contribute to the development of the theory of software evolution by re-examining and clarifying Lehman's SPE taxonomy of evolving software systems. The SPE classification scheme has had mixed fortunes since it was first proposed in 1980. The E (Evolving) category, which includes most software systems, has been influential and has become widely accepted. In contrast, the S (Specified) and P (Problem) categories have not been studied in detail, and the taxonomy's rationale has received little attention. It has been known from empirical studies, for example,(Lawrence 1982; Godfrey and Tu 2000; Cook et al. 2001; Siebel et al. 2003), that software systems are not uniform in their patterns of evolution. However, studies of such differences have made little use of either theory-based classifications such as SPE, or classifications based on observed properties of systems such as development process, application domain and so on. The juxtaposition of these developments raises some interesting questions. Do the same general principles of evolution apply to all software systems? Can the \u2018Laws of Software Evolution', which were based on empirical data obtained from E-type sys-tems, be modified or extended to apply more generally, or even universally? What would constitute a sound basis for classifying evolving software systems?", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["549"]}
{"title": "Acknowledging the Implications of Requirements.\n", "abstract": " The traditional software requirements specification (SRS) used as the principal instrument for management and planning and as the foundation for design can play a pivotal role in the successful outcome of a project. However this can be compromised by uncertainty and time-to-market pressures. In this paper we recognise that the SRS must be kept in a practical and useful state. We recognise three prerequisites to this end and introduce a programme of research aimed at developing a Requirements Profile that changes the emphasis of requirements engineering from defining the requirements to defining what is known about the requirements. The former (being a subset of the latter) leaves the traditional idea of a SRS unaffected whereas the latter adds much to the avoidance of misunderstanding.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["549"]}

Under the pressures typical of time-constrained projects its benefits are not accessible. This is because of the effort and time needed to create the graph and because reading the results can be difficult owing to the effects of crosscutting concerns. Here we introduce an adaptation of KAOS to meet the needs of rapid turn around and clarity. The main aim is to help the stakeholders gain an insight into the larger issues that might be overlooked if they make a premature start into implementation. The method emphasises the use of obstacles, accepts under-refined goals and has new methods for managing crosscutting concerns and strategic decision making. It is expected to be of value to agile as well as traditional processes.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["549"]}

Recommender systems have been demonstrated to be effective for supporting patient self-management of type 1 diabetes by providing recommendations for insulin doses. Recent studies have expanded on this approach by incorporating case based reasoning within existing recommender systems for type 1 diabetes, to provide a more flexible and personalised approach to making recommendations. However, recommendations made by such systems may be ignored, even when users consider the system\u2019s performance to be good. To address this, we propose a complimentary approach to increase the transparency of such systems through the provision of explanatory summaries that expose the reasoning process for making the recommendation. Greater transparency may increase recommendation acceptance rates and improve users\u2019 trust and acceptability of these systems.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["549"]}

An incremental prototyping lifecycle is adopted in which each increment is categorised by an effort type and a project component.

Project components include data models and process models expressed in an OO modelling language and process algebra respectively as well as C++ classes and function templates and build components including source files and data files. This categorisation is independent of incremental prototyping and equally applicable to other software lifecycles. The process support tool (PWI) is responsible for ensuring the consistency between the models and the C++ source. It also supports the interaction between multiple developers and multiple metric-collectors.

Similarly, the peroxisome volume density was elevated significantly above that in the controls by trenbolone acetate (P<0\u2019001); although the inclusion of oestradiol in the implant significantly reduced this level (P<0 001) it was still greater than the control values (P<0 05).
