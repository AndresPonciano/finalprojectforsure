{"title": "Measuring user influence in Twitter: The million follower fallacy\n", "abstract": " Directed links in social media could represent anything from intimate friendships to common interests, or even a passion for breaking news or celebrity gossip. Such directed links determine the flow of information and hence indicate a user's influence on others\u2014a concept that is crucial in sociology and viral marketing. In this paper, using a large amount of data collected from Twitter, we present an in-depth comparison of three measures of influence: indegree, retweets, and mentions. Based on these measures, we investigate the dynamics of user influence across topics and time. We make several interesting observations. First, popular users who have high indegree are not necessarily influential in terms of spawning retweets or mentions. Second, most influential users can hold significant influence over a variety of topics. Third, influence is not gained spontaneously or accidentally, but through concerted effort such as limiting tweets to a single topic. We believe that these findings provide new insights for viral marketing and suggest that topological measures such as indegree alone reveals very little about the influence of a user.", "num_citations": "4209\n", "authors": ["1192"]}

{"title": "Detecting Spammers on Twitter\n", "abstract": " With millions of users tweeting around the world, real time search systems and different types of mining tools are emerging to allow people tracking the repercussion of events and news on Twitter. However, although appealing as mechanisms to ease the spread of news and allow users to discuss events and post their status, these services open opportunities for new forms of spam. Trending topics, the most talked about items on Twitter at a given point in time, have been seen as an opportunity to generate traffic and revenue. Spammers post tweets containing typical words of a trending topic and URLs, usually obfuscated by URL shorteners, that lead users to completely unrelated websites. This kind of spam can contribute to de-value real time search services unless mechanisms to fight and stop spammers can be found. In this paper we consider the problem of detecting spammers on Twitter. We first collected a large dataset of Twitter that includes more than 54 million users, 1.9 billion links, and almost 1.8 billion tweets. Using tweets related to three famous trending topics from 2009, we construct a large labeled collection of users, manually classified into spammers and non-spammers. We then identify a number of characteristics related to tweet content and user social behavior, which could potentially be used to detect spammers. We used these characteristics as attributes of machine learning process for classifying users as either spammers or nonspammers. Our strategy succeeds at detecting much of the spammers while only a small percentage of non-spammers are misclassified.

{"title": "Panas-t: A psychometric scale for measuring sentiments on twitter\n", "abstract": " Online social networks have become a major communication platform, where people share their thoughts and opinions about any topic real-time. The short text updates people post in these network contain emotions and moods, which when measured collectively can unveil the public mood at population level and have exciting implications for businesses, governments, and societies. Therefore, there is an urgent need for developing solid methods for accurately measuring moods from large-scale social media data. In this paper, we propose PANAS-t, which measures sentiments from short text updates in Twitter based on a well-established psychometric scale, PANAS (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule). We test the efficacy of PANAS-t over 10 real notable events drawn from 1.8 billion tweets and demonstrate that it can efficiently capture the expected sentiments of a wide variety of issues spanning tragedies, technology releases, political debates, and healthcare.", "num_citations": "57\n", "authors": ["1192"]}

This ability to spread information rapidly has led to high expectations for word-of-mouth and viral campaigns in online social networks. However, a recent study of the Flickr social network has shown that popular photos do not spread as quickly as one might expect, but show a steady linear growth of popularity over several years. In this paper, we investigate possible reasons for this delay in word-of-mouth propagation by studying the behavior of Flickr users. We identify two factors of a social network that can alter how information spreads: the burstiness of user login times and content aging. We study the impact of these factors using an epidemiological model that was adapted to allow us to investigate the speed of propagation in word-of-mouth propagation.

In this study, we aim to provide a better understanding of the Facebook advertising ecosystem, focusing on how it is being used by advertisers. We first analyze the set of advertisers and then investigate how those advertisers are targeting users and customizing ads via the platform. Our analysis is based on the data we collected from over 600 real-world users via a browser extension that collects the ads our users receive when they browse their Facebook timeline, as well as the explanations for why users received these ads. Our results reveal that users are targeted by a wide range of advertisers (e.g., from popular to niche advertisers); that a non-negligible fraction of advertisers are part of potentially sensitive categories such as news and politics, health or religion; that a significant number of advertisers employ targeting strategies that could be either invasive or opaque; and that many advertisers use a variety of targeting parameters and ad texts. Overall, our work emphasizes the need for better mechanisms to audit ads and advertisers in social media and provides an overview of the platform usage that can help move towards such mechanisms.", "num_citations": "44\n", "authors": ["1192"]}

The deployment of a virtual server allow the consolidation of multiple operational systems and applications on a single hardware platform, reducing the number of servers of an enterprise, increasing resource utilization, simplifying infrastructure organization, reducing management costs and allowing the creation of an environment able to adapt to changes on application workloads. However, before migrating applications from physical machines to virtualized environments, one needs to be able to understand the behavior of the applications on the new environment. The performance of such applications on virtual environments may differ considerably from their performance on real systems due to interactions with the software layer which simulates the hardware and due to the need of sharing some with other virtual machines. Moreover, the configuration of a virtual environment has a significant impact on system performance. For instance, in the Xen virtual environment, I/O device drivers execute in privileged virtual machines called isolated driver domains (IDDs). A configuration choice that critically affects system performance is the assignment of multiple virtual machines and IDDs to the CPUs in a multiprocessor server. In this context, understanding the sources of virtualization overhead and quantify this overhead is crucial for the deployment and configuration of applications on virtual environments.This work presents two techniques to measure and monitor performance in virtual environments\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1192"]}

The news media constitute a particular type of discourse and has become a central part of the modern-day lives of millions of people. In this context, it is important to study how the news industry affects human life and how it works. To support such a study, our approach estimates tension levels (polarities) along the news narrative, revealing the communication patterns used. To achieve this goal, we combine audio and visual cues extracted from news participants (e.g., reporters and anchors), by using methods for: (1) emotion recognition from facial expressions, (2) field size estimation and (3) extraction of audio features (e.g., chroma and spectral features), as well as textual cues obtained from the (4) sentiment analysis of the speech transcriptions.

Airbnb and Couchsurfing are examples of sharing economy, where users offer hosting service in their own houses to the public. In both services, guests can review accommodations. In hosting services of the sharing economy, there is personal contact between those who offer and contract the accommodation, which can affect users' decision to make negative reviews. This is because negative reviews can damage the offered services. To evaluate this issue, we collected reviews from two sharing economy platforms, Airbnb and Couchsurfing, and from one platform of the formal economy that works mostly with hotels, Booking. com, for some cities in the United States and Brazil.

{"title": "An experimental study of opinion influenceability\n", "abstract": " Humans, like many other animal species, often make choices under social influence. Experiments in ants and fishes have shown that individuals choose according to estimations of which option to take given private and social information. Principled approaches based on probabilistic estimations by agents give mathematical formulas explaining experiments in these species. Here we test whether the same principled approaches can explain social influence in humans. We conduct a large online field experiment in which we measure opinion influenced by public comments about short movies in the most popular video-sharing website. We show that the basic principles of social influence in other species also apply to humans, with the added complexity that humans are heterogenous. We infer influenceability of each participant of the experiment, finding that individuals prone to social influence tend to agree with social feedback, read less comments, and are less educated than the persons who resist influence. We believe that our results will help to build a mathematical theory of social influence rooted in probabilistic reasoning that show commonalities and differences between humans and other species.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1192"]}

However, disseminating information to all vehicles in vehicular networks is not a trivial task because of their specific characteristics like high dynamic topology and different density values along time and space. The proposals found in literature focused on improved flooding schemes that, in realistic scenarios, may cause unnecessary overhead and redundant data. This work addresses the dissemination to all vehicles problem by assuming that some vehicles are more appropriate to be good disseminators than others.

Worryingly, the QAnon conspiracy theory has implications in the real world, with supporters of the theory participating in real-world violent acts like the US capitol attack in 2021. At the same time, the QAnon theory started evolving into a global phenomenon by attracting followers across the globe and, in particular, in Europe. Therefore, it is imperative to understand how the QAnon theory became a worldwide phenomenon and how this dissemination has been happening in the online space. This paper performs a large-scale data analysis of QAnon through Telegram by collecting 4.5M messages posted in 161 QAnon groups/channels. Using Google's Perspective API, we analyze the toxicity of QAnon content across languages and over time. Also, using a BERT-based topic modeling approach, we analyze the QAnon discourse across multiple languages. Among other things, we find that the German language is prevalent in QAnon groups/channels on Telegram, even overshadowing English after 2020. Also, we find that content posted in German and Portuguese tends to be more toxic compared to English. Our topic modeling indicates that QAnon supporters discuss various topics of interest within far-right movements, including world politics, conspiracy theories, COVID-19, and the anti-vaccination movement. Taken all together, we perform the first multilingual study on QAnon through Telegram and paint a nuanced overview of the globalization of the QAnon theory.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1192"]}

In addition, we provide the first robust dataset of this kind for the Brazilian Portuguese language. The corpus was collected from Instagram posts of political personalities and manually annotated, being composed by 7,000 annotated documents according to three different layers: a binary classification (offensive versus non-offensive language), the level of offense (highly offensive, moderately offensive, and slightly offensive messages), and the identification regarding the target of the discriminatory content (xenophobia, racism, homophobia, sexism, religious intolerance, partyism, apology to the dictatorship, antisemitism, and fatphobia).
