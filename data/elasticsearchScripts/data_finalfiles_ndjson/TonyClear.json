There are many different models for such courses and conducting these courses is a complex task. This report is intended to assist instructors of capstone courses, particularly those new to the model of teaching and learning inherent in the capstone course. This paper discusses important issues that must be addressed when conducting capstone courses. These issues are addressed through a series of questions, with answers reflecting the way that different institutions have chosen to handle them, and commentary on the impact of these different choices.

Scaffolding learners to acquire professional attributes which transcend the solely technical places stress on traditional curriculum models. This paper analyses an Open Ended Group Project Framework (OEGP) situated in an action research program applied within the IT in Society course at Uppsala University. The approach results in conscious evolution of the course as an integral element of its design. It enables flexible planned educational change informed by a combination of learning theories and stakeholder input. In this paper we discuss the role of the research program in addressing the educational challenges we faced assisting students to develop global collaboration skills. The implications of combining this course with one at a partner institution in the USA and developing a global collaboration are also addressed. The paper concludes by summarizing the benefits of adopting an integrated action research and OEGP framework to support flexible course delivery in a global professional engineering context.", "num_citations": "103\n", "authors": ["1550"]}

We analyse that discussion, exploring how the CS community debates the issue and whether contributors' positions are supported by the research literature on novice programmers. We applied four distinct research methods to the discussion: cognitive science, rhetorical analysis in the critical tradition, phenomenography and biography. We identify the cognitive claims made in the email discussion and find there is not a consensus in the research literature as to whether the objects first approach or the imperative approach is harder to learn. From the rhetorical analysis, we find that the discussion was not so much a debate between OO-first versus imperative-first, but instead was more for and against OO-first.

The first action research cycle analysed data in terms of the SOLO taxonomy. From think-aloud responses, the authors found that educators tended to manifest a SOLO relational response on small reading problems, whereas students tended to manifest a multistructural response. Furthermore, those students who manifested a relational response tended to do better overall in the exam than students who manifested a multistructural response.

The literature on student motivation is briefly reviewed and related to observed student motivation over a two-year period of collaborative trials. Identifiable patterns of behaviour have emerged, for which some underlying causes can be discerned.

A framework for assessing the complexity of introductory programming exams\n", "abstract": " Student performance on examinations is influenced by the level of difficulty of the questions. It seems reasonable to propose therefore that assessment of the difficulty of exam questions could be used to gauge the level of skills and knowledge expected at the end of a course. This paper reports the results of a study investigating the difficulty of exam questions using a subjective assessment of difficulty and a purpose-built exam question complexity classification scheme. The scheme, devised for exams in introductory programming courses, assesses the complexity of each question using six measures: external domain references, explicitness, linguistic complexity, conceptual complexity, length of code involved in the question and/or answer, and intellectual complexity (Bloom level). We apply the scheme to 20 introductory programming exam papers from five countries, and find substantial variation across the exams for all measures. Most exams include a mix of questions of low, medium, and high difficulty, although seven of the 20 have no questions of high difficulty. All of the complexity measures correlate with assessment of difficulty, indicating that the difficulty of an exam question relates to each of these more specific measures. We discuss the implications of these findings for the development of measures to assess learning standards in programming courses.", "num_citations": "34\n", "authors": ["1550"]}

The work is set in the context of a longer term action research programme into collaborative computing and global virtual teams, initiated by Auckland University of Technology in New Zealand and Uppsala University in Sweden.  Over the period since 1998, global virtual collaborations involving teams of students from both universities have been conducted annually.  This thesis investigates the 2004 collaboration cycle, in which participants from St Louis University Missouri joined the collaboration.  This was the first triadic collaboration, and covered Northern, Southern and Western aspects of the globe while traversing three widely divergent time-zones.  In spite of the extensive experience in collaboration possessed by the coordinators at all three sites, the results of the global virtual trial were at best mixed.  This repeated experience of dissatisfaction in our global virtual collaborations, in spite of the technology being in place has been a primary motivator for this work.  Why is global virtual collaboration difficult?  What roles and activities are critical?  How can we do it better?

{"title": "Exploring the notion of'cultural fit'in global virtual collaborations\n", "abstract": " Working in global virtual teams (GVTs), raises a number of issues variously relating to technology, tasks and people working in their different locations and institutional contexts. Achieving alignment across these elements can be challenging. Collaborative Technologies inherently require the participants to work in collaboration and globally distributed settings can place strain on these arrangements. An added complication comes from the need to work not only across boundaries of time and place but also across cultures. This paper reports the findings from a study of a global virtual collaboration between three universities in New Zealand, Sweden and USA. It discusses the complex and multi-layered concept of 'culture' and presents a means of mapping \"cultural fit\" across a global virtual team context.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["1550"]}

These continued problems occur in spite of a considerable amount of attention to the development and applications of certain forms of risk assessment (which will be discussed in Section 18.2). The narrow form of risk analysis and its limited understanding of the scope of a software project and information systems has contributed to significant software failures. Section 18.3 will introduce an expanded risk analysis process that expands the concept of information system risk to include social, professional, and ethical risks that lead to software failure. Using an expanded risk analysis will enlarge the project scope considered by software developers. This process is further refined by incorporating it into an inspection model and illustrated by its application to a national information system. A tool to develop Software Development Impact Statements (SoDIS) is also discussed. Informaticians have been evolving and refining techniques to mediate risks of developing software products that meet the needs of their clients. The risks focused on include missed schedule, over budget, and failing to meet the system s specified requirements (Boehm, 2006; Hall, 1998; Jones, 1994). This focus was later expanded to address software security as the highest risk (Stoneburner et al., 2002).

We examine the current state of GSE research using a new Systematic Snapshot Mapping (SSM) technique. We analysed 275 papers published between January 2011 and June 2012 in peer-reviewed conferences, journals and workshops. Our results provide a coarse-grained overview of the very recent literature addressing GSE, by classifying studies into predefined categories. We also follow and extend several prior classifications to support our synthesis of the data. Our results reveal that currently GSE studies are focused on Management and Infrastructure related factors. Most of the studies are conducted at the organizational level using methods such as interviews, surveys, field studies and case studies. We use inter-country network analysis to confirm that the USA and India are major players in GSE, with USA-India collaborations being the most frequently studied, followed by USA-China. Specific groups of countries have dominated the reported GSE project locations. In contrast, regions including Central Asia, South Asia (except India), Africa and South East Asia have not been covered in these studies. While a considerable number of GSE-related studies have been published they are currently quite narrowly focused on exploratory research and explanatory theories.

One key dichotomy for higher education is that between the \u201cdiscourse of enterprise\u201d and the \u201cdiscourse of community\u201d. The discourse of enterprise comes from a neo-liberal interpretation of society, in which the economically rational or self-interested human being is primary.

{"title": "Developing novice researchers understandings of research\n", "abstract": " This paper reports progress from an action research programme to develop an active research community amongst New Zealand computing educators. Since 1998 the National Advisory Committee on Computing Qualifications (NACCQ) has sponsored a number of \"Getting Started in Research Workshops\". Topics addressed in the workshops have included definitions of research, the maturity profiles of researchers and the nature of research conducted under different research paradigms. The workshops have developed from an initial educative and developmental focus for novice researchers, to one that now embodies more of a critical perspective, in which participants reflect upon and collectively discuss their own beliefs and understandings as educators and researchers within the NACCQ sector. This has required the development of specific self-assessment instruments. These include an instrument for assessing researcher maturity and a further instrument for self-assessment of paradigm preferences in curriculum development and research. Preliminary results from these self-assessments have been reported (Clear & Young, 2001) which give some insights into the understandings about research of computing educators and novice researchers in the sector. But developing and refining these self-assessment instruments is a continuing process. Since this self-assessment process has been undertaken as a means of actively modelling use of the critical method in research, determining forms of analysis that are consonant with this paradigm is a current issue for the authors. This paper will discuss the context, the instruments developed, review\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1550"]}

These continue to arise as the discipline and the profession increasingly encompass broader global and business focused dimensions. Extending that line of argument, this column turns to the phenomenon of software ecosystems. What are software ecosystems, and what implications do they have for our students? What will they need to learn and how may they practice as future developers of software within a software ecosystem? We can think generally of a software ecosystem as an entity where an ecosystem owner provides not simply a software product but an underpinning platform. This platform offers a set of APIs through which external developers can connect and build applications.

{"title": "The Contradiction of Agile Measures: Customer as Focus, but Process as Measured?\n", "abstract": " Performance measures are being used in the agile approach as a powerful tool to understand the customer's impact of a software delivery. However, it is common to find measures related to the process instead of the customer, which would cause the team to forget the customer value delivery.  This research study adopts a systematic mapping process to understand which agile approach is related to performance measures, what kind of measures are being used, and if the papers are focused on product measures or process measures.  The analyzed articles showed that Scrum is the most frequently referenced agile approach that mentions measures. However, the review shows that the focus was on process measurements, while, despite the rhetoric about customer focus and agility, product measurements appear less important.  This result opens the way for future research to explore the consequences of adopting performance measures that are related to this high emphasis on the process.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1550"]}

Framing a research study also poses a challenge for educators, who must find quick and simple ways to scaffold learning to help students understand the research process. This is especially true when the aim is to complete a shorter study within a postgraduate or senior undergraduate course. Some postgraduate programs will have a specialized research methods [5] course as part of the curriculum, which may ease the task. However, in many cases, students quite new to research may be required to undertake a research study lacking any clear notion of process or method. So often some form of apprenticeship model is operated where the research design is laid out by the educator for the student to follow (eg, a given experimental design or a set of predefined simulation scenarios to run).
