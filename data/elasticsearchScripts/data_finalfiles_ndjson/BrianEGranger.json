{"title": "Characterization and remediation of sample index swaps by non-redundant dual indexing on massively parallel sequencing platforms\n", "abstract": " Here we present an in-depth characterization of the mechanism of sequencer-induced sample contamination due to the phenomenon of index swapping that impacts Illumina sequencers employing patterned flow cells with Exclusion Amplification (ExAmp) chemistry (HiSeqX, HiSeq4000, and NovaSeq). We also present a remediation method that minimizes the impact of such swaps. Leveraging data collected over a two-year period, we demonstrate the widespread prevalence of index swapping in patterned flow cell data. We calculate mean swap rates across multiple sample preparation methods and sequencer models, demonstrating that different library methods can have vastly different swapping rates and that even non-ExAmp chemistry instruments display trace levels of index swapping. We provide methods for eliminating sample data cross contamination by utilizing non-redundant dual indexing for complete filtering of index swapped reads, and share the sequences for 96 non-combinatorial dual indexes we have validated across various library preparation methods and sequencer models. Finally, using computational methods we provide a greater insight into the mechanism of index swapping. Index swapping in pooled libraries is a prevalent phenomenon that we observe at a rate of 0.2 to 6% in all sequencing runs on HiSeqX, HiSeq 4000/3000, and NovaSeq. Utilizing non-redundant dual indexing allows for the removal (flagging/filtering) of these swapped reads and eliminates swapping induced sample contamination, which is critical for sensitive applications such as RNA-seq, single cell, blood biopsy using circulating tumor DNA, or\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "142\n", "authors": ["836"]}

{"title": "Altair: interactive statistical visualizations for Python\n", "abstract": " Altair is a declarative statistical visualization library for Python. Statistical visualization is a constrained subset of data visualization focused on the creation of visualizations that are helpful in statistical modeling. The constrained model of statistical visualization is usually expressed in terms of a visualization grammar (Wilkinson, 2005) that specifies how input data is transformed and mapped to visual properties (position, color, size, etc.).Altair is based on the Vega-Lite visualization grammar (Satyanarayan, Moritz, Wongsuphasawat, & Heer, 2017), which allows a wide range of statistical visualizations to be expressed using a small number of grammar primitives. Vega-Lite implements a view composition algebra in conjunction with a novel grammar of interactions that allow users to specify interactive charts in a few lines of code. Vega-Lite is declarative; visualizations are specified using JSON data that follows the Vega-Lite JSON schema. As a Python library, Altair provides an API oriented towards scientists and data scientists doing exploratory data analysis (Tukey, 1977). Altair\u2019s Python API emits Vega-Lite JSON data, which is then rendered in a user-interface such as the Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or nteract using the Vega-Lite JavaScript library. Vega-Lite JSON is compiled to a full Vega specification (Satyanarayan, Russell, Hoffswell, & Heer, 2016), which is then parsed and executed using a reactive runtime that internally makes use of D3. js (Bostock, Ogievetsky, & Heer, 2011).", "num_citations": "94\n", "authors": ["836"]}

As a result, making advanced, scalable algorithms and large-scale computational resources available to end-users is necessary to advancing our understanding of microbial ecology. One challenge many face when developing software for the first time is the gap between writing a script that can run on a single processor and writing a script that will scale to a larger cluster.
