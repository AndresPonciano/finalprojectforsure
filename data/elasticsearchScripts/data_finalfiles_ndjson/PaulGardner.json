{"title": "On the application of domain adaptation in structural health monitoring\n", "abstract": " The application of machine learning within Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has been widely successful in a variety of applications. However, most techniques are built upon the assumption that both training and test data were drawn from the same underlying distribution. This fact means that unless test data were obtained from the same system in the same operating conditions, the machine learning inferences from the training data will not provide accurate predictions when applied to the test data. Therefore, to train a robust predictor conventionally, new training data and labels must be recollected for every new structure considered, which is significantly expensive and often impossible in an SHM context. Transfer learning, in the form of domain adaptation, offers a novel solution to these problems by providing a method for mapping feature and label distributions for different structures, labelled source and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "37\n", "authors": ["1424"]}

Better predictions of the power curve allow increased insight into the operation of the turbine, aid operational decision making, and can be a key feature of online monitoring and fault detection strategies. This work proposes the use of a heteroscedastic Gaussian Process model for this task. The model has a number of attractive properties when modelling power curves. These include, removing the need to specify a parametric functional form for the power curve and automatic quantification of the variance in the prediction. The model exists within a Bayesian framework which exhibits built-in protection against over-fitting and robustness to noisy measurements.

However, it is not realistic to obtain data for every possible damage state in an individual structure. Examining a population of structures gives a much larger pool of data to work with. Machine learning can then potentially allow inferences across the population using algorithms from transfer learning. The degree of similarity between structures determines the level of possible knowledge transfer between different structures.

Increasing the use of automation quickly leads to the gathering of large quantities of data, which makes it inefficient, perhaps even infeasible, for a human to parse the information contained in them. This paper presents a solution to this problem by making the process of NDT data acquisition an autonomous one as opposed to an automatic one. In order to achieve this, the robotic data acquisition task is treated as an optimisation problem, where one seeks to find locations with the highest indication of damage. The resulting algorithm combines damage detection technology from the field of data-driven Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) with novel ideas in uncertainty quantification which enable the optimisation routine to be probabilistic.

{"title": "On novel approaches to model-based structural health monitoring\n", "abstract": " Structural health monitoring (SHM) strategies have classically fallen into two main categories of approach: model-driven and data-driven methods. The former utilises physics-based models and inverse techniques as a method for inferring the health state of a structure from changes to updated parameters; hence defined as inverse model-driven approaches. The other frames SHM within a statistical pattern recognition paradigm. These methods require no physical modelling, instead inferring relationships between data and health states directly. Although successes with both approaches have been made, they both suffer from significant drawbacks, namely parameter estimation and interpretation difficulties within the inverse model-driven framework, and a lack of available full-system damage state data for data-driven techniques. Consequently, this thesis seeks to outline and develop a framework for an alternative category of approach; forward model-driven SHM. This class of strategies utilise calibrated physics-based models, in a forward manner, to generate health state data (i.e. the undamaged condition and damage states of interest) for training machine learning or pattern recognition technologies. As a result the framework seeks to provide potential solutions to these issues by removing the need for making health decisions from updated parameters and providing a mechanism for obtaining health state data.  In light of this objective, a framework for forward model-driven SHM is established, highlighting key challenges and technologies that are required for realising this category of approach.

{"title": "Towards the development of an operational digital twin\n", "abstract": " A digital twin is a powerful new concept in computational modelling that aims to produce a one-to-one mapping of a physical structure, operating in a specific context, into the digital domain. The development of a digital twin provides clear benefits in improved predictive performance and in aiding robust decision making for operators and asset managers. One key feature of a digital twin is the ability to improve the predictive performance over time, via improvements of the digital twin. An important secondary function is the ability to inform the user when predictive performance will be poor. If regions of poor performance are identified, the digital twin must offer a course of action for improving its predictive capabilities. In this paper three sources of improvement are investigated;(i) better estimates of the model parameters,(ii) adding/updating a data-based component to model unknown physics, and (iii) the addition of more physics-based modelling into the digital twin. These three courses of actions (along with taking no further action) are investigated through a probabilistic modelling approach, where the confidence of the current digital twin is used to inform when an action is required. In addition to addressing how a digital twin targets improvement in predictive performance, this paper also considers the implications of utilising a digital twin in a control context, particularly when the digital twin identifies poor performance of the underlying modelling assumptions. The framework is applied to a three-storey shear structure, where the objective is to construct a digital twin that predicts the acceleration response at each of the three floors given an unknown\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1424"]}
{"title": "Overcoming the problem of repair in structural health monitoring: Metric-informed transfer learning\n", "abstract": " Structural repairs alter the physical properties of a structure, changing its responses, both in terms of its normal condition and of its different damage states. This difference in responses manifests itself as a shift between the pre- and post-repair data distributions, which can be problematic for conventional data-driven approaches to structural health monitoring (SHM), and limits their effectiveness in industrial applications. This limitation occurs typically because approaches assume that the data distribution is the same in training as appears in testing; with an algorithm failing to generalise when this assumption is not true; that is, pre-repair labels no longer apply to the post-repair data. Transfer learning, in the form of domain adaptation, proposes a solution to this issue, by mapping the pre- and post-repair data distributions onto a shared latent space where their distributions are approximately equal, allowing pre-repair\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1424"]}

In these contexts it is useful to transfer knowledge obtained from known damage state data to different, but related contexts (or domains) of interest. By utilising transfer learning, knowledge obtained from different structures and/or damage scenarios can be used to improve learners in various target domains.
