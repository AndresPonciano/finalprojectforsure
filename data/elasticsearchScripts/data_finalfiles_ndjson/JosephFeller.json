{"title": "Open innovation and public administration: transformational typologies and business model impacts\n", "abstract": " Extant research demonstrates that e-Government initiatives often fall short of achieving innovative forms of government and governance due to a techno-centric focus that limits such initiatives to minor improvements in service delivery. While it is evident that innovation is central to modernising and transforming governmental organisations, and that the co-creation of services by public authorities and community groups is an essential component of realising the benefits of investment in information and communication technology, there is little research focusing on the nature of innovation in transforming governmental organisations and services. Addressing this gap in the literature, this paper explores how open innovation strategies can transform public administration by examining how a network of municipalities in Sweden transforms value creation and service delivery by collaborating with each other and with\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "188\n", "authors": ["897"]}

Rather IP can be acquired from individuals and firms with whom an organization has no prior relationship. In such cases, an intermediary, operating as an innovation exchange or brokerage, frequently facilitates the development and acquisition of IP. This paper examines one type of innovation intermediary, the \u2018Solver Brokerage,\u2019 which enables innovation exchanges between organizations and unknown external firms and individuals (i.e. a crowdsourcing process). While the commercial success of Solver Brokerages indicates the potency of arguments concerning the potential of crowdsourcing, little is known about the operation of such brokerages or the crowdsourcing processes that they enable.

However, the diverse approaches to crowdfunding that have emerged, as well as the uncertain relationship of these approaches to the umbrella concept of crowdsourcing, means it is not clear to what extent crowdfunding presents theoretically novel behaviours, nor what those behaviours may be. This study addresses this lack of clarity through a metatriangulation of 120 peer-reviewed studies on crowdfunding. These studies are distributed across the four dominant categories of crowdfunding, namely crowd lending, crowd equity, crowd patronage, and crowd charity. Research for each category is analysed separately to determine the topics of interest, the dominant theoretical perspectives, the methods employed, and the typical focus of analysis. We bridge these categories to identify three common variables relating to funding behaviours\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "118\n", "authors": ["897"]}

For charities, crowdfunding presents novel donation behaviors, including those where donors may proactively seek out causes and give (often anonymously) to help others with whom they share little social connectivity. Understanding these behaviors is challenging compared to traditional fundraising behaviors, where charitable giving is partly explained by factors such as guilt avoidance, reciprocity, image, vicarious enjoyment, and group-level benefits. This suggests that some subset of charitable motivations is brought uniquely into focus in crowdfunding marketplaces. These marketplaces are often inhabited by fundseeking individuals and larger formal organizations.

The Oculus Rift had significant success on Kickstarter fundraising and generating interest in virtual reality. However, they also caused controversy when the company was subsequently sold to Facebook for US $2 billion, a move that some argued contradicted the principles of crowdfunding.

It is a prevailing business model in the software industry. The model could be a long-awaited solution for software providers suffering from sustainability and retention problems. However, software providers are still experiencing low conversion rates from free users to paid users. Satisfactory services do not guarantee additional spending by free users for services. User satisfaction with core services has been considered a key component of user loyalty. However, this belief is being challenged. This study investigates the effect of satisfaction on loyalty intentions (continuance intention and intention to purchase) of freemium software. The study develops a research model based upon the use context framework including user characteristics, relational characteristics, and marketplace characteristics. The results from a series of regressions show that satisfaction affects continuance intention but does not influence purchase intention although it indirectly affects purchase intention by interacting with various characteristics. The results suggest several strategies that freemium software providers can pursue according to their objectives.

{"title": "Conceptualizing the Commons-Based Peerproduction of Software: an Activity Theoretic Analysis\n", "abstract": " Commons-based peer-production (CBPP), as exemplified by community-based open source software (OSS) development, has been posited by Yochai Benkler as an alternative to hierarchies and markets for organizing the production of information goods. This study seeks to conceptualize viable CBPP through an Activity Theoretic analysis of 524 peer-reviewed OSS research artifacts. The analysis reveals the reliance of peer-production communities on complex systems of interrelated tools, rules, and roles as mediating components enabling communities to (i) exploit the two theorized advantages of CBPP (resource allocation and information processing) and (ii) overcome the two theorized challenges associated with this mode of production (motivation and organization). The study clarifies and extends extant understanding of CBPP in several significant ways, and concludes that in order for CBPP to be viable, participants must operate in a sustainable fashion that both enhances the commons and leaves the community intact.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["897"]}

The offer of tokens or rewards is often used to entice potential donors to donate to a cause. This study investigates when it is beneficial to offer rewards in a charitable crowdfunding campaign. Three design principles are developed from the current literature which aim to help in the creation of a successful crowdfunding campaign. Important factors identified were types of donations a charitable organization usually receives, the groups of donors associated with that organization and the need for one time considerably large donations.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["897"]}
{"title": "Large crowds or large investments? how social identity influences the commitment of the crowd\n", "abstract": " Equity crowdfunding is increasing in popularity as an alternative to traditional financing for start-ups and growth companies to raise money for their business. This study discusses how equity crowdfunding is different from traditional financing, such as angel investors and venture capitalists. We argue this difference is brought further into focus when large numbers of crowd members invest small amounts, as opposed to fewer individuals making large investments. Building on existing research on Social Identity Theory, we look at why some crowdfunding campaigns are more likely to attract these contrasting types of investment (numerous small investments or fewer large investments). A model is presenting linking different characteristics of campaigns to total investment and average investment. This proposed model will be tested using public data gathered from Crowdcube, a leading UK-based equity crowdfunding platform. This study has significant implications for fundraisers who may wish to target different types of crowds according to the nature of their business, ie smaller numbers of passionate investors to provide informed input or larger numbers of casual investors to help create awareness and spread positive word of mouth.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["897"]}

{"title": "Re-Engineering a Financial Information Supply Chain with XBRL: An Exploration of Co-Operative IOS Design and Development.\n", "abstract": " Financial markets worldwide have been experiencing dramatic changes since the mid-1990s. It has been claimed that XBRL, an XML vocabulary for business reporting, is capable of introducing greater integration and transparency into financial information systems, and thus addressing some of the challenges presented by these changes. This paper presents an exploratory case study of the cooperative design, development and implementation of an XBRL-enabled inter-organisational system (IOS) by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), the Reserve Bank of Australia (central bank) and the Australian Bureau of Statistics to revolutionise reporting by financial institutions in Australia. The study describes how the three agencies modernised and harmonised reporting requirements through a gradual review of the reporting returns required by each agency. This harmonisation enabled the reengineering of the reporting process, as each financial institution now has to submit just one set of figures to meet the needs of all three agencies. The findings illustrate that the complexity of data consumption patterns drove increased interdependence within the financial information supply chain requiring the co-operative development of context sensitive data exchanges and commodity-like IT infrastructures. The paper concludes that the co-operative approach to IOS development exhibited in this study is likely to be more suited to the development of XBRL-enabled systems for financial information supply chains than the \u2018hub and spoke\u2019model characteristic of IOS developments in other industrial sectors.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["897"]}

The objective of this exploratory study is therefore to explore the peer production of innovation; specifically the challenges in leveraging the collective intelligence of online communities. Through an analysis of the crowdsourced innovation activities of Studio Wikitecture, a virtual community operating within and beyond an immersive social virtual world, we reveal six challenges associated with leveraging a peer production innovation model. These include the challenges of (1) the participatory unit;(2) orchestration;(3) granularity;(4) filtration;(5) attribution; and (6) reward.

{"title": "Human-centred design: existing approaches and a future research agenda\n", "abstract": " This paper presents an analysis of Human-Centred Design (HCD), using a metatriangulation of scientific literature. This metatriangulation comprises a systematic overview of recent HCD research, in which literature is categorised and analysed using both engineering lens and cognitive science paradigmatic lenses. The study reveals that the most popular HCD approaches do not accommodate software aimed at a broad or anonymous user-base. This shortcoming can be attributed, at least in part, to the popularity of HCD approaches focusing on highly-conscious user cognition based on conceptual models. These forms of cognition rely upon learned conventions and accumulated understanding and, as a result, design approaches focusing upon them are fundamentally limited to catering for a specific subset of the human population. We identify an emerging HCD approach, which we label'Foundational Design'. This approach focuses on cognitive regularities which exist in less-conscious processing, independent of culture or individual experience, and thus possibly offers a solution to the dilemma described above. Thus a future research agenda focused on the Foundational Design approach and the emerging NeuroIS research stream is proposed and discussed.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["897"]}

{"title": "Reviewing the contributing factors and benefits of distributed collaboration\n", "abstract": " Distributed collaboration has become increasingly common across domains ranging from software development to information processing, the creative arts, and entertainment. As of early 2020, distributed collaboration has entered the limelight as the COVID-19 pandemic has forced employees across the world to work from home. However, while researchers have applied myriad terms to define these operations, we first address this issue by defining distributed collaboration in a way that represents all its forms. Existing research has identified several factors that contribute to distributed collaborations\u00e2   success. Yet, researchers and practitioners typically discuss these factors in modular theoretical terms, which means that they often struggle to identify and synthesize literature that spans multiple domains and perspectives. In this paper, we systematically review the literature to synthesize core findings into one amalgamated model. This model categorizes the contributing factors for distributed collaboration along two axes 1) whether they are social or material and 2) whether they are endemic or relational. We also explicitly discuss the relationships between factors in the model. The model further links these contributing factors to different collaborative outcomes, specifically mutual learning, relationship building, communication, task completion speed, access to skilled personnel, and cost savings.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["897"]}

Its decentralized environment allows for the mining of Bitcoins by miners either independently or in groups. The community of miners have faith in the integrity of each other to sustain the network, through mining pools remaining at a reasonable level of mining power. Blockchain's decentralized system is one of its main selling points and is a source of great attraction for users. However, when these mining pools start to grow and increase their mining power to dangerous levels it can result in a shift towards a centralized environment.

Two factors have emerged as being highly important in social internet media (SIM): community feedback and individual user reputation. This paper reports on a quantitative empirical study exploring the impact of reputation and user feedback on perceived information quality in SIM contexts. The paper presents a theoretical model derived from the literature, and the results of regression analysis of data gathered from a web-based knowledge sharing community. The findings support several prior studies but challenge others, and provide stimulus for fruitful avenues of further research. The study makes several contributions, including a refined conceptualization of PIQ and feedback and an improved understanding of the relationships between feedback, reputation, and PIQ.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["897"]}
{"title": "Personal transparency and unexpected information sharing in peer-to-peer lending success: an empirical study\n", "abstract": " Internet technologies underpin a variety of systems enabling collective action (eg open source software), collective intelligence (eg innovation marketplaces), and the aggregation of collective resources (eg crowdfunding). In the latter category, peer-to-peer lending has emerged as a rapidly growing phenomenon in society, and an object of interest for researchers in information systems and cognate disciplines. The saliency of social identity and personal transparency in such environments has been the focus of frequent inquiry, however we argue that the current state of knowledge is limited by biases towards particular lending platforms. In this paper, we report on the findings of a study of a large but underresearched platform. Through an analysis of 116,669 loan records, and a subsequent analysis of 1000 records manually coded through a content analysis process, we theorize the impact of personal transparency (both hard financial data and soft biographical data) on multi-party success (loan acquisition and loan repayment) in such environments. Our findings reveal relationships and behaviors that frequently contradict the findings from prior research on other platforms. In the paper, we discuss the contributions of our work towards a more complete and heterogeneous picture of peer-to-peer lending behavior, and highlight the implications of our work for both future research and practice.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["897"]}

However, entrepreneurship is evolving, as more and more novel digital technologies are introduced into our lives. Accordingly, this paper focuses on digital entrepreneurs, who are defined as the entrepreneurs, who utilize innovation based on digital technology to create economic or social value by starting new ventures or transform existing ones (European Commission, 2015), and the relevant ecosystem that supports them. The change in the relationship between digital entrepreneurs and an entrepreneurial ecosystem, as they evolve towards digital products and customer engagement is the focus of this research. We reviewed the literature on the topic of digital entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial ecosystem using a concept-centric matrix, capturing 14 elements of an entrepreneurial ecosystem. These elements include networks, policy and government, professional and support services, capital services, human capital, culture, markets, knowledge sources, intermediaries, informal networks, leadership, physical infrastructure, engagement, and cooperative companies. The identified elements were then used to develop a conceptual framework, which will form the basis for the research strategy. This study sets out to establish the existence of these elements in the ecosystems and the extent of their usefulness. Therefore, this paper seeks to address the research gap of how digital entrepreneurs utilize each ecosystem element to understand their importance in the conceptual framework.

{"title": "Jumping the Fence: How Consumer Sentiment on Social Media Changes after Crowdfunding\n", "abstract": " Crowdfunding has helped thousands of entrepreneurs to finance their innovative products by engaging with large numbers of potential investors. The most effective way for fundraisers to engage with potential backers, is through social media. If used in the right way, social media can enable fundraisers to raise awareness of their campaign, engage with potential investors, and will ultimately have a positive impact on a crowdfunding campaign. Through social media, fundraisers are able to gauge how the public feels about their product or company, which is the main focus of this study. This study brings together research around organisational and marketing image, suggesting that as consumers invest, they move from external consumers to investors that are within the boundary of the company. This brings into question whether consumer sentiment towards the company changes after fundraising, as they become stakeholders. Thus, we use social media to investigate the public sentiment towards a company during different stages of their equity crowdfunding campaign.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["897"]}

This is because crowdfunding has become a viable alternative to traditional capital investment and thus a threat to investors in that sector. Various platforms exist which allow fundraisers to pitch an idea and spread awareness with the intention of acquiring backers. Most backers of crowdfunding campaigns come to the platform with the fundraiser rather than from the platform itself [25]. Fundraisers must find and engage a crowd and not rely on the platform for provision of the crowd. This paper sets out four action design principles for identifying and engaging a crowd.

As user interfaces are frequently visual, it is unsurprising that prior research has often focused on optimising visual interfaces for user processing.

We seek to address this deficiency by developing a set of design hypotheses that draw upon the neuroscience of visual perception to increase the visual perceptibility of interface items.
