{"title": "User acceptance of multi-criteria decision support systems: The impact of preference elicitation techniques\n", "abstract": " Previous research indicates that decision makers are often reluctant to use potentially beneficial multi-criteria decision support systems (MCDSS). Prior research has not examined the specific impact of preference elicitation techniques on user acceptance of MCDSS. The present research begins to fill this gap by examining the effect on users\u2019 MCDSS evaluations of two commonly used preference elicitation techniques, absolute measurement and pairwise comparisons, while holding constant all other aspects of the MCDSS and decision making task. Experimental results (N\u00a0=\u00a0153) indicate that users consider MCDSS with pairwise comparisons to be higher in decisional conflict, more effortful, less accurate, and overall less desirable to use than MCDSS with absolute measurements. Thus, any potential normative superiority of a preference elicitation technique must be balanced against its potentially adverse effects\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "63\n", "authors": ["1270"]}
{"title": "Nonprofit and public sector human resources management: A comparative analysis\n", "abstract": " Centralto this paper is the task of identifying and understanding what differentiatesnonprofit human resources management from that practiced in public sectoragencies (eg, federal, state, and local governments). The key differences highlighted here arevolunteer employment, the presence and role of a board of directors, and theemphasis nonprofit organizations place on strategic planning. Understanding these unique areas is arguablyvaluable if it leads to more effective human resource management practices, enhanced techniques, and uniquely tailored approaches to the administration ofnonprofit organizations. The analysisincludes an overview and discussion of topics (eg, strategic human resourcesmanagement, employee motivation, and compensation) essential to enhancing ourunderstanding of human resources management in the nonprofit sector. Finally, existing literature is surveyed toidentify current trends and inform our discussion of future considerations fornonprofit human resources management.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["1270"]}
{"title": "Trends in commercial-off-the-shelf vs. proprietary applications\n", "abstract": " This study examines factors valued by IS managers in deciding if COTS software is a viable alternative to proprietary software. The results indicate managers who anticipate increased usage of COTS packages in 5 years used the same top three factors in the formation of their decisions to adopt COTS as their colleagues who anticipated either zero change in COTS usage or an increased usage of proprietary software used in deciding not to adopt COTS software. Managers anticipating increased COTS usage had a statistically significant higher value for each of those items compared to managers not anticipating growth in COTS software.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1270"]}
{"title": "Technological Infrastructure Needs in Rural Nebraska\n", "abstract": " Firms in rural communities need to work together to share the cost of their technological infrastructural needs. One of the first steps that must be taken in order for businesses in a community to work together is to identify key areas that offer the most potential for satisfying unmet needs. An instrument was developed and a survey conducted of businesses in 3 rural Nebraska communities to identify which areas where a lack of information technology is currently placing the communities at a competitive disadvantage. Results indicate that rural Nebraska businesses generally believe that that will grow over the next X years. They are making effective use of the Internet to disseminate information but are not utilizing it for ecommerce. After the cost of technology, the two biggest hindrances businesses in non-metropolitan areas perceive are the lack of knowledge about current technology and supplying new employees who have an understanding of new and emerging technologies and how to use them.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1270"]}
