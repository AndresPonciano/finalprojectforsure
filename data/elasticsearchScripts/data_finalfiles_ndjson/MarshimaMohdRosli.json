{"title": "Fault Prediction Model for Web Application Using Genetic Algorithm\n", "abstract": " The biggest challenge in the software development industry is to deliver an application with 100% defects free. However, this challenge is difficult to achieve by the software industries because it involve humans and is not an automated process done by applications, which having faults is a common things. Fault prediction is identified as one major area to predict the probability that the software contains faults. The objective of the fault prediction is to classify the software modules in the categories of faulty and non-faulty modules as early as possible in software development life cycle. In this paper, we propose fault prediction model using object oriented metrics values from web application as input values to the genetic algorithm to predict the fault probability. The aim of the proposed design model is to develop an automated tool for software development group to discover the most likely software modules in web applications to be high problematic in the future.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["2011"]}
{"title": "Security issues and framework of electronic medical record: A review\n", "abstract": " The electronic medical record has been more widely accepted due to its unarguable benefits when compared to a paper-based system. As electronic medical record becomes more popular, this raises many security threats against the systems. Common security vulnerabilities, such as weak authentication, cross-site scripting, SQL injection, and cross-site request forgery had been identified in the electronic medical record systems. To achieve the goals of using EMR, attaining security and privacy is extremely important. This study aims to propose a web framework with inbuilt security features that will prevent the common security vulnerabilities in the electronic medical record. The security features of the three most popular and powerful PHP frameworks Laravel, CodeIgniter, and Symfony were reviewed and compared. Based on the results, Laravel is equipped with the security features that electronic medical record currently required.

As a powerful influential medium, the Web has been able to provide users with instant and global access to a massive amount of information. Since people are free to send and receive information, some of the information may be fake or intentionally used for immoral purposes. Nowadays, there are many cases where people take advantage of these social media to involve in activities that lead to crime cases. Information can be manipulated. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the influential factors within the information that affect users\u2019 minds. In digital communication, the conversation of these people take place without any support of physical movement like in face to face environment, hence, the strength of using digital elements appear to be effective in influencing people\u2019s perception. In this paper, we discuss our study on identifying influential digital elements in the information which is conveyed through digital communication. For finding such factors, each type of digital elements is examined in terms of its attributes and usage. Analyses are performed to investigate the strength of such digital elements by understanding the existing guidelines, psychological or mental models and theories. It is important to look into such models and theories to justify how digital presentation can relate to the human perception. By identifying the influential factors, information can be constructed using the effective digital elements so that the social media are used in a\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["2011"]}
{"title": "Visualizing Patterns of Preference and Trusted Media for Managing Strategic Communication\n", "abstract": " In managing strategic communication, media plays an important role for delivering and communicating information. Communicating and retrieving information using common media that include traditional (eg newspapers, television, radio, telephone) and online media (eg online news paper, blog, YouTube, Facebook, Yahoo Messenger and e-mails) are among the common activities of young IT literate generation. In this paper, we present an exploratory study to investigate the common and online media perception of undergraduate students relating to their preference and trust for retrieving information and communicating activities. Participants comprise of thirty eight Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Malaysia, undergraduate students who were computer literate as well as regular computer users. Data was analyzed using multidimensional proximity scaling and multiple response techniques. The results indicated that male and female students differ in their preferences and trust for common and online media activities. Female students were consistent whilst the males were rather inconsistent. Nevertheless, these findings contradict with Media Richness Theory (MRT) in which the one-way communication media are more preferred and trusted by the Malaysian young generation of IT literate.

Incorporating intelligent component has achieved promising results in many applications, including in education. Intelligence modules in a tutoring system would bring the application and its capability closer to a human's ability to serve its human users and to solve problems. However, the majority of the online learning provided in the literature review especially in Malaysia, normally only provide the lecture notes, assignments and tests and rarely suggest or give feedbacks on what the students should study or do next in order to fully understand the subjects. Hence, the researchers propose an online learning environment called Intelligent Online Assessment and Revision (I-OnAR). It facilitates the learning process at multiple learning phases such as test creation, materials revision, feedback for improvement and performance analysis. These components are incorporated into the tutoring system to assist selfpace learning at anytime and anywhere. The intelligent agent uses a Rulebased Machine Learning method for the adaptive capabilities such as automated test creation and feedbacks for improvement. The system has been tested on a group of students and found to be useful to support learning process. The results have shown that 60% of the subjects\u2019 performance have improved with the help of the system. The students were given feedbacks on the topic they did poorly as well as how to improve their performance.
