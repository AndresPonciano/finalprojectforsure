{"title": "Designing Personas with Empathy Map.\n", "abstract": " A software product\u2019s acceptance depends on the user experience that it provides to its users. The software product must meet the user needs, and one way to understand those needs is through creation of Personas. The Personas technique allows describing the users\u2019 characteristics, goals and skills. The Empathy Map (EM) method can be used to describe personas. The EM\u2019s goal is to create a degree of empathy with the user so the product developing team starts to understand more deeply the users and become more aware of their real needs. To assess the EM effects on the creation of personas, we conducted a feasibility study with 20 subjects. Initially, the subjects learned how to describe personas in textual form. After that, they applied the EM to create personas. After using the EM, the subjects answered a questionnaire about their perceptions regarding the EM\u2019s ease of use and its usefulness. The results showed that majority of subjects considered EM useful and easy to create personas. Furthermore, this majority also said that they would use the EM for the creation of personas again.", "num_citations": "91\n", "authors": ["1141"]}

We believe that using models and artifacts to represent the interaction in a systematic way during systems design may prevent such difficulties.

While both artifacts are supposed to promote the understanding of user goals and the designer\u2019s reflection on alternative solutions and decisions regarding the interaction, we have not found evidence of their usage impacts on quality. Thus, this paper presents an experimental study on the joint usage of MoLIC interaction diagrams and mockups during systems design, aiming both to identify participants\u2019 perceptions on the joint use of the two artifacts and to analyze the quality of the generated artifacts by observing which types of defects would occur. The results show that, although some participants found that MoLIC diagrams were not very easy to build, most participants considered the creation of mockups based on MoLIC diagrams useful. In addition, the number of defects found in the MoLIC diagrams points to the need of developing techniques to evaluate the artifact before proceeding with the design process.", "num_citations": "23\n", "authors": ["1141"]}

While the number of defects in MOLIC diagrams was higher, there was no significant difference between the number of defects in MoLIC and CTDM diagrams. 60% of the participants pointed out that MoLIC is more useful and easier to use for designing interaction. And 56% of them indicated MoLIC as the more complete model in comparison\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1141"]}

{"title": "Are scale-based techniques enough for learners to convey their UX when using a Learning Management System?\n", "abstract": " As technology evolves, learning institutions have sought to invest in new learning technologies. Many universities have been adopting platforms designed to support the learning process, called Learning Management Systems (LMSs), to complement face-to-face learning, as well as to support distance learning. This widespread adoption of LMSs raises the need for evaluating them regarding aspects related to quality in use, such as User eXperience (UX). UX is very important in e-learning context, given that it may influence learner\u2019s attitude towards the use of the LMS. Despite its importance, few studies evaluated the UX of LMSs. Moreover, researchers have been using generic techniques to evaluate them. In this context, there is no evidence of studies conducted to identify whether these techniques can fully capture the experience conveyed by these platforms. This paper presents an analysis of two UX evaluation techniques (User Experience Questionnaire, and Integrated Experience Acceptance Model) applied to an LMS called Edmodo. We carried out a study with 34 students, divided into two groups, to evaluate the UX of Edmodo and obtain their perceptions about the technique they used. We also gathered the difficulties faced by the students during the execution of the tasks on the platform, while correlating those difficulties with learning issues. In addition, we performed a qualitative analysis in order to better understand the results. Regarding Edmodo, the results showed that the students perceived its UX as positive. Regarding the techniques, both groups considered them easy to use and useful. However, around 41% of the students in\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1141"]}

In Web applications, usability is crucial because it determines their acceptance. Researchers have proposed many Usability Inspection Methods (UIMs) to improve the usability of Web applications. However, we identified that these UIMs are mostly applied in later stages of the development process, which can increase the cost of correcting the identified usability problems. Correcting problems in later stages can be costly since most of the source code will have already been written. To improve the quality of Web applications by ensuring usability in earlier stages of their development process, we proposed the Web Design Usability Evaluation technique and its tool support, which allow the evaluation of low fidelity prototypes or mockups. In this paper, we present the results from empirical studies evaluating these technologies. The quantitative and qualitative results provided indicators of their feasibility and also allowed us to identify improvement opportunities.

Software engineers need to gather domain knowledge to be able to successfully deliver a software system. In particular, novice software engineers need to acquire enough knowledge to perform their tasks. This means that knowledge transfer to novice software engineers must be quickly and effectively performed to facilitate the onboarding process. One way to understand the knowledge transfer process is by analyzing the software development context and the involved team members. Such analysis enables the development team to determine key aspects that can influence knowledge acquisition by novice software engineers. This can also allow the identification of possible strategies that minimize the effort employed by the team members during this process. This paper presents a qualitative study about knowledge transfer in a small software organization from the point of view of software practitioners. Our results suggest that software developers have several knowledge sources and novice engineers learn when they observe organizational procedures and when the tasks have detailed guidelines.

Many Usability Inspection Methods (UIMs) have been proposed to guarantee that Web applications provide a friendly, direct and easy to understand interface to their users. Nevertheless, some of these methods are not being used due to the lack of information about them. In this paper we describe the actual state of UIMs for Web applications through the extension of a systematic mapping study about Usability Evaluation Methods. Besides providing background knowledge to UIMs, our results showed that in order to meet the actual needs of the software development industry, emerging UIMs should:(a) find problems in early stages of the development process;(b) find specific problems and suggest solutions; and (c) provide automation. Using these features and usability criteria from other UIMs, we developed the Web Design Usability Evaluation (Web DUE) technique. The Web DUE aims to improve the quality of Web applications by allowing the usability evaluation of paper based prototypes by using pieces of Web pages called Web page zones.

However, to achieve highly accurate ML systems, it is necessary to train the ML model with data carefully labeled by specialists in the problem domain. In the context of ML and Human Computer Interaction (HCI), there are studies that propose interfaces that facilitate interactive labeling by domain specialists, in order to minimize effort and maximize productivity. This paper extends a previous secondary study that discusses some labeling systems. This paper proposes a catalog of design elements for the interface development of this type of system.

{"title": "How Novice Software Engineers Apply User Interface Design Patterns: An Empirical Study\n", "abstract": " Conveying a positive User eXperience (UX) is essential for the success of any application, as it affects use a product. Nevertheless, novice software engineers may have difficulties in finding an appropriate solution for UX problems due to their lack of knowledge in interface design. User interface design patterns are well-working solutions to user problems that occur repeatedly which can help new developers solve interface problems. Although several studies investigated the effectiveness of applying design patterns in real development projects, few studies evaluate the difficulties that novice software engineers face when applying user interface design patterns for the first time. To understand how novice software engineers apply design patterns in the correction of UX problems, we carried out an empirical study with four small novice development teams redesigning mobile applications interfaces. We collected data on factors affecting the applicability of the employed design patterns, through questionnaires. Our results suggest that novice software engineers find this type of patterns useful but require means to find and select an adequate pattern to solve a problem.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1141"]}
