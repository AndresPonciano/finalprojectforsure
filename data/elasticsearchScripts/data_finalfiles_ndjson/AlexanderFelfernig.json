{"title": "Recommender systems: an introduction\n", "abstract": " In this age of information overload, people use a variety of strategies to make choices about what to buy, how to spend their leisure time, and even whom to date. Recommender systems automate some of these strategies with the goal of providing affordable, personal, and high-quality recommendations. This book offers an overview of approaches to developing state-of-the-art recommender systems. The authors present current algorithmic approaches for generating personalized buying proposals, such as collaborative and content-based filtering, as well as more interactive and knowledge-based approaches. They also discuss how to measure the effectiveness of recommender systems and illustrate the methods with practical case studies. The final chapters cover emerging topics such as recommender systems in the social web and consumer buying behavior theory. Suitable for computer science researchers and students interested in getting an overview of the field, this book will also be useful for professionals looking for the right technology to build real-world recommender systems.", "num_citations": "1882\n", "authors": ["1504"]}
{"title": "Constraint-based recommender systems: technologies and research issues\n", "abstract": " Recommender systems support users in identifying products and services in e-commerce and other information-rich environments. Recommendation problems have a long history as a successful AI application area, with substantial interest beginning in the mid-1990s, and increasing with the subsequent rise of e-commerce. Recommender systems research long focused on recommending only simple products such as movies or books; constraint-based recommendation now receives increasing attention due to the capability of recommending complex products and services. In this paper, we first introduce a taxonomy of recommendation knowledge sources and algorithmic approaches. We then go on to discuss the most prevalent techniques of constraint-based recommendation and outline open research issues.", "num_citations": "357\n", "authors": ["1504"]}
{"title": "Consistency-based diagnosis of configuration knowledge bases\n", "abstract": " Configuration problems are a thriving application area for declarative knowledge representation that currently experiences a constant increase in size and complexity of knowledge bases. Automated support of the debugging process of such knowledge bases is a necessary prerequisite for effective development of configurators. We show that this task can be achieved by consistency-based diagnosis techniques. Based on the formal definition of consistency-based configuration we develop a framework suitable for diagnosing configuration knowledge bases. During the test phase of configurators, valid and invalid examples are used to test the correctness of the system. In case such examples lead to unintended results, debugging of the knowledge base is initiated. Starting from a clear definition of diagnosis in the configuration domain we develop an algorithm based on conflicts. Our framework is general enough\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "248\n", "authors": ["1504"]}

In order to accomplish this task, domain specific, formal description languages and knowledge-based systems are employed. From the viewpoint of the industrial software development process, it is important to integrate the construction and maintenance of these systems into standard software engineering processes. In addition, the descriptions should be comprehensible for the domain experts in order to facilitate the review process.         For the realization of product configuration systems, we show how these requirements can be met by using a standard design language (UML-Unified Modeling Language) as notation in order to simplify the construction of a logic-based description of the domain knowledge.

Effective knowledge acquisition is needed since the product and the corresponding configuration system have to be developed in parallel. In this paper, we show how to employ a standard design language (Unified Modeling Language, UML) for modeling configuration knowledge bases. The two constituent parts of the configuration model are the component model and a set of corresponding functional architectures defining which requirements can be imposed on the product. The conceptual configuration model is automatically translated into an executable logic representation. Using this representation we show how to employ model-based diagnosis techniques for debugging faulty configuration knowledge bases, detecting infeasible\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "221\n", "authors": ["1504"]}

{"title": "An efficient diagnosis algorithm for inconsistent constraint sets\n", "abstract": " Constraint sets can become inconsistent in different contexts. For example, during a configuration session the set of customer requirements can become inconsistent with the configuration knowledge base. Another example is the engineering phase of a configuration knowledge base where the underlying constraints can become inconsistent with a set of test cases. In such situations we are in the need of techniques that support the identification of minimal sets of faulty constraints that have to be deleted in order to restore consistency. In this paper we introduce a divide and conquer-based diagnosis algorithm (FastDiag) that identifies minimal sets of faulty constraints in an overconstrained problem. This algorithm is specifically applicable in scenarios where the efficient identification of leading (preferred) diagnoses is crucial. We compare the performance of FastDiag with the conflict-directed calculation of hitting sets\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "182\n", "authors": ["1504"]}
{"title": "Recommender systems: An overview\n", "abstract": " Recommender systems are tools for interacting with large and complex information spaces. They provide a personalized view of such spaces, prioritizing items likely to be of interest to the user. The field, christened in 1995, has grown enormously in the variety of problems addressed and techniques employed, as well as in its practical applications. Recommender systems research has incorporated a wide variety of artificial intelligence techniques including machine learning, data mining, user modeling, case-based reasoning, and constraint satisfaction, among others. Personalized recommendations are an important part of many on-line e-commerce applications such as Amazon. com, Netflix, and Pandora. This wealth of practical application experience has provided inspiration to researchers to extend the reach of recommender systems into new and challenging areas. The purpose of the articles in this special issue is to take stock of the current landscape of recommender systems research and identify directions the field is now taking.

These systems support the configuration of complex products and services in shorter time with fewer errors and, therefore, reduce the costs of a mass-customization business model. The European Union-funded project entitled CUSTOMER-ADAPTIVE WEB INTERFACE FOR THE CONFIGURATION OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WITH MULTIPLE SUPPLIERS (CAWICOMS) aims at the next generation of web-based configuration applications that cope with two challenges of today's open, networked economy:(1) the support for heterogeneous user groups in an open-market environment and (2) the integration of configurable subproducts provided by specialized suppliers. This article describes the CAWICOMS WORKBENCH for the development of configuration services, offering personalized user interaction as well as distributed configuration of products and services in a supply chain. The developed tools and techniques rely on a harmonized knowledge representation and knowledge-acquisition mechanism, open XMLbased protocols, and advanced personalization and distributed reasoning techniques.

{"title": "Developing constraint-based recommenders\n", "abstract": " Traditional recommendation approaches (content-based filtering [48] and collaborative filtering[40]) are well-suited for the recommendation of quality&taste products such as books, movies, or news. However, especially in the context of products such as cars, computers, appartments, or financial services those approaches are not the best choice (see also Chapter 11). For example, apartments are not bought very frequently which makes it rather infeasible to collect numerous ratings for one specific item (exactly such ratings are required by collaborative recommendation algorithms). Furthermore, users of recommender applications would not be satisfied with recommendations based on years-old item preferences (exactly such preferences would be exploited in this context by content-based filtering algorithms).", "num_citations": "104\n", "authors": ["1504"]}

We argue that this is due to the specifics of benchmarking criteria in medical scenarios and the multitude of drastically differing end-user groups and the enormous context-complexity of the medical domain. Here both risk perceptions towards data security and privacy as well as trust in safe technical systems play a central and specific role, particularly in the clinical context. These aspects dominate acceptance of such systems. By using a Doctor-in-the-Loop approach some of these difficulties could be mitigated by combining both human expertise with computer efficiency.
