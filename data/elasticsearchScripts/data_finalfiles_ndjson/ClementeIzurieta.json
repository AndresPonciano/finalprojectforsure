Here we applied a spatially explicit, three-dimensional hydrologic model to simulate surface and subsurface flow within the 16-km2 Nyack Floodplain on the Middle Fork Flathead River in northwest Montana, USA. We ran the model for four years and simulated nine conservative particle releases across a range of river discharges.

Particle tracking simulations revealed when river discharge was below bankfull, mean residence time of surface water decreased with river discharge.

The Role Based Metamodeling Language (RBML) is a visually oriented language defined in terms of a specialization of the UML metamodel that is used to verify and specify generic or domain specific design patterns. The evolution of increasingly complex computer applications is mandating the development of technologies and tools that can validate the intended design and can alert developers of potential changes that were not intended by the original designers. Deviations from design patterns occur as a result of a lack of understanding of intended designs or through evolutionary changes of the software; thus an automated tool is needed to inform developers when design patterns no longer conform to their original intended design. Herein, we present an automated software tool that compares the UML class diagrams of instances of design patterns with their RBML representations and reports back if said UML diagram is compliant. The tool can identify which classifiers (classes or associations) of the design pattern are in violation with their RBML description. Furthermore, the tool produces a score that is indicative of the level of compliance.

The persuasive power of narratives is theorized to reside, in part, in narrative transportation.   Purpose This study seeks to advance the science of stories in risk communication by measuring real-time affective responses as a proxy indicator for narrative transportation during science messages that present scientific information in the context of narrative.   Methods This study employed a within-subjects design in which participants (n = 90) were exposed to eight science messages regarding flood risk. Conventional science messages using probability and certainty language represented two conditions. The remaining six conditions were narrative science messages that embedded the two conventional science messages within three story forms that manipulated the narrative mechanism of character selection. Informed by the Narrative Policy Framework, the characters portrayed in the narrative science messages were hero, victim, and victim-to-hero. Natural language processing techniques were applied to identify and rank hero and victim vocabularies from 45 resident interviews conducted in the study area; the resulting classified vocabulary was used to build each of the three story types.

This study focuses on avoidance as it pertains to the design of microchips. The lifecycle of a microchip is centered on the design of every block that makes up the hierarchy of the design. Early in the lifecycle the emphasis is on obtaining clean and fault free blocks for every CAD (Computer Aided Design) tool that the block is subjected to. A block is either a schematic or the artwork of a given functional circuit. As a block evolves, a regression of already released CAD tools is run to obtain predetermined levels of quality. Without running these regression suites, developers risk delaying the appearances of faults; which in the field of microchip development can prove extremely costly, especially when entering the manufacturing stages where the costs of making masks and test chips can be prohibitive. This study uses traditional data mining techniques to follow the evolution of a number of legacy blocks in a microchip and track the number of failures encountered per block and per tool over a period of time.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1317"]}
{"title": "Method for linking non-object oriented data models to object oriented data models using a technique to achieve zero-size object mapping\n", "abstract": " A method and apparatus for linking non-object oriented data models to object oriented data models without incurring any additional memory. Non-object oriented data is loaded into memory and represented by a C-structure. The structure definition contains information about the data. In the object oriented model, instead of creating another memory for the data located in the structure, the object oriented model maps onto the non-object oriented structure. As a result, the programmer abstraction and object encapsulation benefits of an object oriented model without adding to the memory size.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1317"]}
{"title": "Technical Debt Reduction Using a Game Theoretic Competitive Source Control Approach\n", "abstract": " The management of technical debt and the use of productivity games are important aspects of developing software projects. A productivity game was created in the form of a competitive source control plug-in that rewards technical debt-reducing actions. The plug-in was tested by simulating source control usage with in a small sample project. Analysis showed that the plug-in appropriately assigned scores to developers for debt-reducing and debtincreasing actions. The plug-in has potential practical applications in the management of technical debt in workplace environments. The approach described in this paper is promising, and in future work we plan to test the Build Game plug-in with a wider variety of existing and simulated projects. Additional research is also planned to investigate the impact of the Build Game plug-in on workplace productivity.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1317"]}
