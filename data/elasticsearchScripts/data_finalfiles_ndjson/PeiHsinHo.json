Typical examples of hybrid systems are embedded systems, timing-based communication protocols, and digital circuits at the transistor level. Due to the rapid development of microprocessor technology, hybrid systems directly control much of what we depend on in our daily lives. Consequently, the formal specification and verification of hybrid systems has become an active area of research. This dissertation presents the first general framework for the formal specification and verification of hybrid systems, as well as the first hybrid-system analysis tool--HyTech. The framework consists of a graphical finite-state-machine-like language for modeling hybrid systems, a temporal logic for modeling the requirements of the hybrid systems, and a computer procedure that verifies modeled hybrid systems against modeled requirements. The tool HyTech is the implementation of the framework using C++ and Mathematica. More specifically, our hybrid-system modeling language,  Hybrid Automata, is an extension of timed automata with discrete and general continuous variables whose dynamics are governed by differential equations.  Our requirement modeling language, ICTL, is a branching-time temporal logic, and is an extension of TCTL with stop-watch variables. Our verification procedure is a symbolic model-checking procedure that verifies linear hybrid automata against ICTL formulas.

{"title": "Model checking strategies for linear hybrid systems\n", "abstract": " Linear hybrid systems are dynamical systems whose variables change both discretely and continuously along piecewise linear trajectories; they are useful for modeling digital real-time programs that are embedded in analog environments. Model checking is an algorithmic technique for anlayzing finite- state systems that has recently been extended to certain infinite-state systems, including linear hybrid systems.  The method has been implemented in HyTech (The Cornell Hybrid Technology Tool), a symbolic model checker for linear hybrid systems.  We report on a new implementation and several experiments with HyTech. The core of HyTech is a semidecision procedure that, given a linear hybrid automaton describing a system and a temporal formula describing a requirement, computes the so-called target region-the linear set of system states that satisfy the requirement.  Unfortunately, the verification procedure may not return the target region using a reasonable amount of time and space, or it may not terminate in principle.  Thus we have reimplemented the model checker using more efficient data structures that represent linear state sets geometrically, as unions of convex polyhedra, and we have experimented with several strategies that are designed to improve the performance of the model checker further: we (1) simultaneously compute the target region from different directions, (2) encode data as finite-state control, (3) approximate the target region by dropping constraints, and (4) iteratively refine the approximation until sufficient precision is obtained.

{"title": "Clock tree synthesis for low power and low susceptibility to variation\n", "abstract": " Power is one of the biggest concerns of IC designs today. For consumer electronics the energy consumption of the ICs limits the time between charging the batteries. For high-frequency computers the power density of the ICs limits the performance of the ICs. Clock distribution networks typically contribute more than one third of the total power consumption, including both leakage and dynamic power consumption.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1789"]}
