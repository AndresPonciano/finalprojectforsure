{"title": "Factors of safety for Richardson extrapolation\n", "abstract": " A factor of safety method for quantitative estimates of grid-spacing and time-step uncertainties for solution verification is developed. It removes the two deficiencies of the grid convergence index and correction factor methods, namely, unreasonably small uncertainty when the estimated order of accuracy using the Richardson extrapolation method is greater than the theoretical order of accuracy and lack of statistical evidence that the interval of uncertainty at the 95% confidence level bounds the comparison error. Different error estimates are evaluated using the effectivity index. The uncertainty estimate builds on the correction factor method, but with significant improvements. The ratio of the estimated order of accuracy and theoretical order of accuracy  instead of the correction factor is used as the distance metric to the asymptotic range.

Capability of RS model to predict anisotropy is shown for a solid/free-surface juncture and demonstrated for ship flow (DTMB 5415) at Fr= 0.28. No significant anisotropy effect is observed for DTMB 5415 due to the weaker anisotropy and insufficient grid resolution. KVLCC2 at drift angle 0, 12, 30, and 60 degrees are investigated neglecting the effect of free surface. Results of using BKW and RS RANS models for 0 and 12 degrees show that RS model significantly improves the predictions of the resistance coefficients, axial velocity, and turbulent kinetic energy distributions at the propeller plane. For drift angle 30 degrees, BKW and RS RANS models show steady solutions whereas BKW-DES and RS-DES models show unsteady solutions.

First, a wall function approach has been introduced for wall-layer modeling based on the immersed boundary method and the one-equation Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model. Second, in order to develop more advanced wall-layer modeling schemes, an orthogonal curvilinear grid solver based on the Cartesian grid solver has been implemented and tested. Third, a coupled level set volume-of-fluid method has been developed to substantially improve the volume conservation properties of the interface tracking/capturing schemes. In addition, fluid-structure interactions for ship motions in the framework of current Cartesian grid solver are also discussed. Finally, domain decomposition using MPI in all three directions has been included, parallel I/O becomes fully functional, and a new high-performance Poisson solver has been implemented. A series of cases ranging from the NACA0024 hydrofoil, Wigley hull, surface combatant DTMB model 5512, bow waves by a wedge, and surface-piercing circular cylinder, etc., have been carried out to validate the accuracy and demonstrate the scalability of the current method.

{"title": "Experimental and Numerical Investigations on Flow Characteristics of the KVLCC2 at 30 Drift Angle\n", "abstract": " Investigations of flow characteristics around ship hulls at large drift angle are very important for understanding the motion behavior of ships during maneuvers. At large drift angles, the flow is dominated by strong vortical structures and complex three-dimensional separations. An accurate prediction of these flow structures is still a challenge for modern computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers. Hull forms with high block coefficients are blunt and have strong curvatures, which leads to large area flow separations over smooth surfaces. These areas are sensitive to the relative angle between the flow and the ship motion direction. The paper is concerned with a collaborative computational study of the flow behavior around a double model of KVLCC2 at 30 degrees drift angle and Fr= 0 condition, including analysis of numerical methods, turbulence modeling and grid resolution, and their effects on the mean flow and separation onset as well as formation of the vortical structures. This research is an outcome of a multi-year collaboration of five research partners from four countries. The overall approach adopted for the present study combines the advantages of CFD and EFD with the ultimate goal of capturing the salient details of the flow around the bluff hull form. The experiments were performed at the low-speed wind tunnel of the Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH). The main features of the global and local flow were captured in the experimental study.

Current Richardson-extrapolation solution verification procedures [2\u20137] are restricted to monotonic convergent solutions 0< R< 1.

Previous studies have shown that flow in an aneurysm exhibits complex flow structures that are correlated with its inflow conditions. Therefore, the objective of this study was to demonstrate the application of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) to study the impact of different inflow conditions on energetic flow structures and their temporal behavior in an aneurysm. To achieve this objective, experiments were performed on an idealized rigid sidewall aneurysm model. A piston pump system was used for precise inflow control, i.e., peak Reynolds number (Rep) and Womersley number (\u03b1) were varied from 50 to 270 and 2 to 5, respectively. The velocity flow field measurements at the midplane location of the idealized aneurysm model were performed using particle image velocimetry (PIV).

{"title": "Monitoring lung mechanics during mechanical ventilation using machine learning algorithms\n", "abstract": " Evaluation of lung mechanics is the primary component for designing lung protective optimal ventilation strategies. This paper presents a machine learning approach for bedside assessment of respiratory resistance (R) and compliance (C). We develop machine learning algorithms to track flow rate and airway pressure and estimate R and C continuously and in real-time. An experimental study is conducted, by connecting a pressure control ventilator to a test lung that simulates various R and C values, to gather sensor data for validation of the devised algorithms. We develop supervised learning algorithms based on decision tree, decision table, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques to predict R and C values. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms achieve 90.3%, 93.1%, and 63.9% accuracy in assessing respiratory R and C using decision table, decision tree, and SVM\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1400"]}
{"title": "Simulations of an air-ventilated strut crossing water surface at variable yaw angles\n", "abstract": " Hydrodynamic devices intended to produce lift, control actions, or propulsion can be prone to air ventilation when operating near the free water surface. The atmospheric air may propagate to the low-pressure zones around these devices located under the nominal water level. This often leads to performance degradation of hydrodynamic systems. Modeling of air-ventilated flows is challenging due to complex flow nature and many factors in play. In this study, the computational fluid dynamics simulations are carried out for a surface-piercing strut at different yaw angles. At small yaw angles, the strut underwater surfaces remain wetted, whereas at large yaw and sufficiently high Froude numbers the suction side becomes air ventilated. At the intermediate yaw angles, both wetted and ventilated flow regimes are possible, and the existence of a specific state depends on the history of the process.

The question of how mobile devices will impact students\u2019 learning and instructors\u2019 effective teaching is unanswered. The objective of the current study is to investigate theeffectiveness of mobile technology in enhancing students\u2019 class engagement and learningoutcomes. A pilot activity for integrating Blackboard Mobile Learn (BML) into an introductorylevel Fluid Mechanics course in the Fall semester of 2010 is undertaken. The BML is used toprovide classroom announcements, group discussions, exam solution keys, grades, blogs, classroster, journals, media, and tasks. The BML will be used in the classroom when the instructorinteracts with the students during the lecture time such as review of homework and exams anduse of images and video clips to enhance students\u2019 understanding of course concepts. Outside theregular class time, students will use the BML as their portable 24/7 classroom with on-timeaccess to course materials and tools and real-time assistance from the instructor. Students and theinstructor will evaluate the effectiveness of the BML on students\u2019 learning outcomes throughspecific surveys, homework and exam grades.

{"title": "Vortical and turbulent structures and instabilities in unsteady free-surface wave induced separation\n", "abstract": " Free-surface wave-induced separation caused by interactions of free-surface waves and wall boundary layers has relevance to ship and platform hydrodynamics with regard to resistance and propulsion, stability, and signatures. This paper uses URANS and DES with complimentary EFD to investigate the separation patterns and Strouhal numbers for the different instability mechanisms on a surface piercing NACA0024 foil for Fr= 0.37 and 0.55. Instability studies include laminar cases too. Frequency analysis and vortex core detection reveal the nature of freesurface wave induced separation. Normalized Strouhal numbers for shear layer instability (St\u03b8 scaled by momentum thickness at separation \u03b8), Karman instability (Sth scaled by wake thickness h), and flapping instability (StR scaled by mean reattachment length XR) show the effects of free surface and Fr on the instability mechanisms. St\u03b8 (~ 0.013) for the laminar cases compare well with existing values for airfoils. St\u03b8 for the turbulent cases have lower values that decrease with Fr. St\u03b8= 0.0077 and 0.0052 for Fr= 0.37 (Re= 1.5 e6) and 0.55 (Re= 2e6) respectively. Sth for free-surface Karman shedding lies in a reduced range 0.065-0.069 compared to flows without free surface (0.07-0.09). StR= 0.2 lies in similar range as that for backward facing steps and blunt cylinders. A theoretical model constructed based on simple harmonic motion gives a good prediction of the flapping frequency. Unlike RANS, DES predicts nonreattaching separation for Fr= 0.37. DES captures the same frequency for shear layer instability along with a much broader range of frequencies. DES provides a broader range of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1400"]}

{"title": "Numerical Study of Hydrodynamics of Heavily Loaded Hard-Chine Hulls in Calm Water\n", "abstract": " Hard-chine boats are usually intended for high-speed regimes where they operate in the planing mode. These boats are often designed to be relatively light, but there are special applications that may occasionally require fast boats to be heavily loaded. In this study, steady-state hydrodynamic performance of nominal-weight and overloaded hard-chine hulls in calm water is investigated with computational fluid dynamics solver program STAR-CCM+. The resistance and attitude values of a constant-deadrise reference hull and its modifications with more pronounced bows of concave and convex shapes are obtained from numerical simulations. On average, 40% heavier hulls showed about 30% larger drag over the speed range from the displacement to planing modes. Among the studied configurations, the hull with a concave bow is found to have 5\u201312% lower resistance than the other hulls in the semi-displacement regime and heavy loadings and 2\u201310% lower drag in the displacement regime and nominal loading, while this hull is also capable of achieving fast planing speeds at the nominal weight with typical available thrust.

{"title": "Numerical study of high-lift hydrofoil near free surface at moderate Froude number\n", "abstract": " Shallow hydrofoils are known to produce lower lift in normal operating conditions in comparison with deep hydrofoils. However, the maximum lift capability of shallow hydrofoils at moderate speeds, which is important for transitional regimes of hydrofoil boats, is studied insufficiently. In this work, two-dimensional flow around a high-lift hydrofoil at a moderate Froude number is numerically simulated in a broad range attack angles up to the stall occurrence in both single-phase fluid and in the vicinity of free surface. It is found that nearly the same maximum lift coefficient can be produced by the shallow foil in the modeled condition as by the deep foil, but much higher attack angle is required near the free surface, which also results in larger drag. Additionally, it is shown that higher Reynolds numbers lead to higher lift coefficients, especially at large attack angles.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1400"]}

{"title": "Effect of cavitation on vortex dynamics in a submerged jet\n", "abstract": " The effects of cavitation on vortex dynamics in a submerged planar laminar forced jet were studied numerically. A locally homogeneous cavitation model that accounts for nonlinear bubble dynamics and bubble/bubble interactions within spherical bubble clusters was employed. The effects of varying key flow and cavitation model parameters on flow-cavitation interactions were investigated. The parameters varied include the cavitation number (vapor pressure), the bubble number density, the bubble-cluster radius, and the Reynolds number. The results showed cavitation occurring in the cores of primary vortical structures when the local pressure fell below the vapor pressure. Low levels of void fraction caused significant vortex distortion, with the details depending on the model parameters. For higher Reynolds numbers and small values of the bubble cluster radius, cavitation inhibited vortex pairing and resulted in\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1400"]}
