{"title": "Predictive value of progression-related gene classifier in primary non-muscle invasive bladder cancer\n", "abstract": " While several molecular markers of bladder cancer prognosis have been identified, the limited value of current prognostic markers has created the need for new molecular indicators of bladder cancer outcomes. The aim of this study was to identify genetic signatures associated with disease prognosis in bladder cancer. We used 272 primary bladder cancer specimens for microarray analysis and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Microarray gene expression analysis of randomly selected 165 primary bladder cancer specimens as an original cohort was carried out. Risk scores were applied to stratify prognosis-related gene classifiers. Prognosis-related gene classifiers were individually analyzed with tumor invasiveness (non-muscle invasive bladder cancer [NMIBC] and muscle invasive bladder cancer [MIBC]) and prognosis. We validated selected gene classifiers using RT-PCR in the original (165) and independent (107) cohorts. Ninety-seven genes related to disease progression among NMIBC patients were identified by microarray data analysis. Eight genes, a progression-related gene classifier in NMIBC, were selected for RT-PCR. The progression-related gene classifier in patients with NMIBC was closely correlated with progression in both original and independent cohorts. Furthermore, no patient with NMIBC in the good-prognosis signature group experienced cancer progression. We identified progression-related gene classifier that has strong predictive value for determining disease outcome in NMIBC. This gene classifier could assist in selecting NMIBC patients who might benefit from more\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "281\n", "authors": ["2228"]}

We refactored GENT2 with recent technologies such as Apache Lucene indexing for fast search and Google Web Toolkit (GWT) framework for a user-friendly web interface. Now, GENT2 contains more than 68,000 samples and has several new useful functions. First, GENT2 now provides gene expression across 72 different tissues compared to 57 in GENT. Second, with increasing importance of tumor subtypes, GENT2 provides an option to study the differential expression and its prognostic significance based on tumor subtypes. Third, whenever available, GENT2 provides prognostic information of a gene of interest. Fourth, GENT2 provides a meta-analysis of survival information to provide users more reliable prognostic value of a gene of interest. In conclusion, with these significant improvements, GENT2 will continue to be a useful tool to a wide range of researchers.

{"title": "A four-gene signature predicts disease progression in muscle invasive bladder cancer\n", "abstract": " There are no reliable criteria to handle disease progression of muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), which strongly influences patient survival. Therefore, an accurate predicting method to identify progressive MIBC patients is greatly needed. The aim of this study was to identify a genetic signature associated with disease progression in MIBC. To address this issue, we analyzed three independent cohorts (a training set, test set 1 and test set 2) comprising a total of 128 MIBC patients. Microarray gene expression profiling, including gene network analysis, was performed in the training set to identify a gene expression signature associated with disease progression. The prognostic value of the signature was validated in test set 1 and test set 2 by microarray and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively. The determination of gene expression patterns by microarray data analysis identified 1,320 genes associated with disease progression. Gene network analysis of the 1,320 genes suggested that IL1B, S100A8, S100A9 and EGFR were important mediators of MIBC progression. We validated this putative four-gene signature in two independent cohorts (log-rank test, P < 0.05 each, respectively) and estimated the predictive value of the signature by multivariate Cox regression analysis (hazard ratio (HR), 6.24; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.58-24.61; P= 0.009). Finally, signature-based stratification demonstrated that the four-gene signature was an independent predictor of MIBC progression.

Gene expression profiles of the tissue samples were investigated using cDNA microarrays that contained 103 non-muscle invasive bladder cancers (NMIBC), 62 muscle invasive bladder cancers (MIBC), 58 samples of histologically normal-looking surrounding tissues, and 10 normal, healthy subjects who served as the control cohort for comparison. We grouped the data-sets according to biological characterizations and focused on immune response genes with at least 2-fold differential expression in MIBC vs. controls. The experimental data-set identified 36 immune-related genes that were significantly altered in MIBC samples. In addition, 10 genes were up-regulated and 26 genes were down-regulated in MIBC samples compared with the normal tissues. Among the 10 up-regulated molecules examined, the capacity for both wound-healing migration and invasion was enhanced in response to IL-5, IL-20, and IL-28A in bladder cancer cell lines (253J and EJ cells), compared with untreated cells. The expression levels of IL-5, IL-20, and IL-28A were increased in patients with MIBC. All 3 cytokines and their receptors were produced in bladder cancer cell lines, as determined by real-time PCR, immunoblot analysis and confocal immunofluorescence. Up-regulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was found after IL-5, IL-20, and IL-28A stimulation in both cell types. Moreover, an EMSA assay showed that treatment with IL-5, IL-20, and IL-28A induced activation of the transcription factors NF-\u03baB and AP-1 that regulate the MMP-9 promoter.
