Our characterization of over 35 million read, write, and administrative requests spanning a 28-day period is done from three different blogosphere perspectives. The server view characterizes the aggregate access patterns of all users to all blogs; the user view characterizes how individual users interact with blogosphere objects (blogs); the object view characterizes how individual blogs are accessed. Our findings support two important conclusions. First, we show that the nature of interactions between users and objects is fundamentally different in blogspace than that observed in traditional web content.

We propose the City Image visualization technique, which builds a transition graph mapping people's movements between location categories, and demonstrate its use to identify similarities and differences of human dynamics across cities by clustering cities according to their citizens' routines. We also analyze centrality metrics of the transition graphs built for different cities, considering transitions between specific venues.

{"title": "Demand-driven tag recommendation\n", "abstract": " Collaborative tagging allows users to assign arbitrary keywords (or tags) describing the content of objects, which facilitates navigation and improves searching without dependence on pre-configured categories. In large-scale tag-based systems, tag recommendation services can assist a user in the assignment of tags to objects and help consolidate the vocabulary of tags across users. A promising approach for tag recommendation is to exploit the co-occurrence of tags. However, these methods are challenged by the huge size of the tag vocabulary, either because (1) the computational complexity may increase exponentially with the number of tags or (2) the score associated with each tag may become distorted since different tags may operate in different scales and the scores are not directly comparable. In this paper we propose a novel method that recommends tags on a demand-driven basis according to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "53\n", "authors": ["1198"]}

One alternative is use traditional wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, WSNs have their limitations, for instance in the sensing of large areas, such as metropolises, because it incurs in high costs to build and maintain such networks. The ubiquity of smart phones associated with the adoption of social media websites, forming what is called participatory sensing systems (PSSs), enables unprecedented opportunities to sense the environment. Particularly, the data sensed by PSSs is very interesting to study city dynamics and urban social behavior. The goal of this work is to survey approaches and models applied to PSSs data aiming the study city dynamics and urban social behavior.

However, relevance by itself may not be enough to guarantee recommendation usefulness. Promoting novelty and diversity in tag recommendation not only increases the chances that the user will select \u201csome\u201d of the recommended tags but also promotes complementary information (i.e., tags), which helps to cover multiple aspects or topics related to the target object. Previous work has addressed the tag recommendation problem by exploiting at most two of the following aspects: (1) relevance, (2) explicit topic diversity, and (3) novelty. In contrast, here we tackle these three aspects conjointly, by introducing two new tag recommendation methods that cover all three aspects of the problem at different levels.

{"title": "Capacity planning for vertical search engines\n", "abstract": " Vertical search engines focus on specific slices of content, such as the Web of a single country or the document collection of a large corporation. Despite this, like general open web search engines, they are expensive to maintain, expensive to operate, and hard to design. Because of this, predicting the response time of a vertical search engine is usually done empirically through experimentation, requiring a costly setup. An alternative is to develop a model of the search engine for predicting performance. However, this alternative is of interest only if its predictions are accurate. In this paper we propose a methodology for analyzing the performance of vertical search engines. Applying the proposed methodology, we present a capacity planning model based on a queueing network for search engines with a scale typically suitable for the needs of large corporations. The model is simple and yet reasonably accurate and, in contrast to previous work, considers the imbalance in query service times among homogeneous index servers. We discuss how we tune up the model and how we apply it to predict the impact on the query response time when parameters such as CPU and disk capacities are changed. This allows a manager of a vertical search engine to determine a priori whether a new configuration of the system might keep the query response under specified performance constraints.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["1198"]}

When two WSNs are deployed at the same place and their sensors cooperate with the other networks forwarding their packets, the distance of the transmissions decreases and, therefore, the power consumption as well. The goal of this work is to examine the extent to which different WSNs can cooperate and save their energy. Simulation results reveal that different densities and data collecting rates among WSNs, the routing algorithm and the path loss exponent have major impact in the establishment of cooperation.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["1198"]}

Our characterization of over 35 million read, write, and management requests spanning a 28-day period is done at three different levels. The user view characterizes how individual users interact with blogosphere objects (blogs); the object view characterizes how individual blogs are accessed; the server view characterizes the aggregate access patterns of all users to all blogs. The more-interactive nature of the blogosphere leads to interesting traffic and communication patterns, which are different from those observed for traditional web content. We identify and characterize novel features of the blogosphere workload, and we show the similarities and differences between typical web server workloads and blogosphere server workloads. Finally, based on our main characterization results, we build a new synthetic blogosphere workload generator called GBLOT, which aims at mimicking closely a stream of requests originating from a population of blog users.

As a consequence of its large popularity, the Internet has suffered from various performance problems, such as network congestion and overloaded servers. With regard to the WWW, performance is critical, because users want fast and easy access to all objects (ie, documents, graphics, audio, and video) available on the net. When a server is overloaded, it performs poorly, with long response times and many connections refused. Thus, it is important to understand WWW performance issues. This paper focuses on the performance analysis of Web servers. In the first part of the paper, we discuss the main steps to carry out a WWW performance analysis effort.

First, we collect data from a popular online live video sharing service, and perform a characterization of key aspects of its workload. Next, driven by some of our findings, we propose two variations of a new hybrid content delivery architecture, which combine elements from the traditional centralized client\u2013server and Peer-to-Peer architectures.

This paper describes WebMonitor, a tool for evaluating and understanding server performance, and presents new results for realistic workloads. WebMonitor measures activity and resource consumption, both within the kernel and in HTTP processes running in user space. WebMonitor is implemented using an efficient combination of sampling and event-driven techniques that exhibit low overhead. Our initial implementation is for the Apache World-Wide Web server running on the Linux operating system. We demonstrate the utility of WebMonitor by measuring and understanding the performance of a Pentium-based PC acting as a dedicated WWW server. Our workloads use file size distributions with a heavy tail. This captures the fact that Web servers must concurrently handle some requests for large audio and video files, and a large number of requests for small documents, containing text or images. Our results show that in a Web server saturated by client requests, up to 90% of the time spent handling HTTP requests is spent in the kernel. These results emphasize the important role of operating system implementation in determining Web server performance. It also suggests the need for new operating system implementations that are designed to perform well when running on Web servers.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1198"]}

We analyze reachability disruptions, caused by failures of RNP's interdomain links, that block all international traffic. We also analyze performance disruptions, caused by simultaneous failure of multiple RNP intradomain links, which result in congestion and performance degradation. We study the impact of disruptions on traffic, application mix, and user behavior. Our results show that users adapt their behavior when some applications become unavailable and when network performance degrades. For example, users tend to migrate to Youtube when Facebook becomes unavailable during reachability disruptions; similarly, users migrate to Facebook when congestion during performance disruptions severely degrade Youtube experience.

Time-based pricing schemes could be used to address this problem giving users the opportunity to choose when they desire to spend their own resources to access the Internet.

Thus, a time-based pricing approach could create an undesirable situation to users who happen to be in a region covered by a base station that is currently overloaded. This paper presents a workload-aware dynamic time-based pricing scheme which uses historical workload of each base station to differentiate prices in order to foster the geographically distribution of the Internet accesses over the ISP's network.

For instance, to incentivize contributions, file-sharing systems based on the BitTorrent protocol equate value with volume of contributed content and use a prioritization mechanism to reward users who contribute more. This approach and similar techniques used in resource-sharing systems rely on the fact that the physical resources shared among users are easily quantifiable. In contrast, information-sharing systems, like social tagging systems, lack the notion of a physical resource unit (e.g., content size, bandwidth) that facilitates the task of evaluating user contributions.

Our recommendation approach takes into account information of two different layers, namely, an upper layer composed by cities and a lower layer composed by attractions of each city. It consists of first building a social network among users, where the edges are weighted by the similarity of interests between pairs of users, and then using this network as a component of a collaborative filtering strategy to recommend cities.

Thus, the textual features of this content (eg, the title, description, and tags) can directly impact the view count of a particular content item, and ultimately the advertisement generated revenue. More importantly, the textual features can generally be optimized to attract more search traffic. This study makes progress on the problem of automating tag selection for online video content with the goal of increasing viewership. It brings two key insights: first, based on evidence that existing tags for YouTube videos can be improved by an automated tag recommender, even for a sample of well curated movies, it explores the impact of using information mined from repositories created by different production modes (eg, peer-and expert-produced); second, this study performs a preliminary\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1198"]}

These scenarios are commonly observed in real streaming media server workloads. In reply to these results, a number of extensions to the original protocols, optimized for interactive access, have been proposed and evaluated, indicating significant server bandwidth savings even under highly interactive scenarios.

We show that while structural characteristics typical of other social networks are shared to a large extent by the legitimate component they are not characteristic of antisocial traffic. Interestingly, opportunistic patterns of behavior do create nontrivial graphs with certain general characteristics that we identify. To complement the graph analysis, which suffers from incomplete knowledge of users external to the domain, we study temporal patterns of communication to show that the dynamical properties of email traffic can, in principle, distinguish different types of social relations.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1198"]}

Usually, countries and cities invest a huge amount of money in planning and preparation in order to welcome (and profit from) tourists. An accurate prediction of the number of visits in the following days or months could help both the economy and tourists. Prior studies in this domain explore forecasting for a whole country rather than for fine-grained areas within a country (eg, specific touristic attractions). In this work, we suggest that accessible data from online social networks and travel websites, in addition to climate data, can be used to support the inference of visitation count for many touristic attractions. To test our hypothesis we analyze visitation, climate and social media data in more than 70 National Parks in US during the last 3 years. The experimental results reveal a high correlation between social media data and tourism demands; in fact, in over 80\\% of the parks, social media reviews and visitation counts are correlated by more than 50\\%. Moreover, we assess the effectiveness of employing various prediction techniques, finding that even a simple linear regression model, when fed with social media and climate data as input features, can attain a prediction accuracy of over 80\\% while a more robust algorithm, such as Support Vector Regression, reaches up to 94\\% accuracy.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1198"]}

Yet, content sharing leads to multiple downloads of a single content for synchronizing devices. These downloads contribute to bandwidth wastage and create workload to servers. To which extent this occurs? Would network caches alleviate the problem? We address these questions by investigating the traffic generated by a popular cloud storage service\u2013Dropbox. Using data collected from four networks, we show that a large fraction of downloads generated by Dropbox users (57\u201370%) is associated with content shared among multiple devices. Moreover, despite optimizations such as the LAN Sync protocol, up to 25% of Dropbox download traffic is owing to content replicas.

In particular, we study the impact of failures on traffic, user, and application behavior. The failures are interesting in that they persist for several hours and impact only international links, so destinations hosted in Brazil remain reachable. Our results show that although failures in international links have negligible impact on the performance of national traffic, users do adapt their behavior to the unavailability of services hosted abroad. For example, entertainment traffic migrates from Facebook to YouTube, which remains reachable during the analyzed failures; and the fraction of interactive traffic gradually decreases during failures, indicating that users may leave the campus early. We also show that asynchronous applications hosted abroad, like Dropbox and SMTP, queue up tasks during the failure and cause traffic bursts when the failure is restored.Resumo.
