The experimental container with P. sansibaricus showed maximum mineralization and decomposition rate than that of P. excavatus. Except for exchangeable K (it was higher (P = 0.004) in a container with P. excavatus), the domestic waste processed by P. sansibaricus showed about 6% more total nitrogen (P = 0.002) and about 7% more available P (P = 0.269) at the end than by P. excavatus. As compared with the initial level organic C content as well as C:N ratio showed a considerable reduction that was noted higher in substrate with P. sansibaricus than those by P. excavatus (organic C, t-test: P = 0.870; C:N ratio, t-test: P = 0.002).

{"title": "Review of research work in sinking EDM and WEDM on metal matrix composite materials\n", "abstract": " Metal matrix composites (MMCs) are newly advanced materials having the properties of light weight, high specific strength, good wear resistance and a low thermal expansion coefficient. These materials are extensively used in industry. Greater hardness and reinforcement makes it difficult to machine using traditional techniques, which has impeded the development of MMCs. The use of traditional machinery to machine hard composite materials causes serious tool wear due to the abrasive nature of reinforcement. These materials can be machined by many non-traditional methods like water jet and laser cutting but these processes are limited to linear cutting only. Electrical discharge machining (EDM) shows higher capability for cutting complex shapes with high precision for these materials.

Salicylic acid indeed initiates pathogenesis-related gene expression and synthesis of defensive compounds involved in local resistance and systemic acquired resistance. Salicylic acid may thus be used against pathogen virulence, heavy metal stresses, salt stress, and toxicities of other elements. Applied salicylic acid improves photosynthesis, growth, and various other physiological and biochemical characteristics in stressed plants. Salicylic acid antagonizes the oxidative damaging effect of metal toxicity directly by acting as an antioxidant to scavenge the reactive oxygen species and by activating the antioxidant systems of plants and indirectly by reducing uptake of metals from their medium of growth.
