By miRNA deep sequencing, we identified 40 miRNAs that are differentially expressed upon ectopic overexpression of the splicing factor SF2/ASF.

Although previous studies have reported the presence of human, mouse and zebrafish tissue-specific miRNAs, there have been no detailed reports of rat tissue-specific miRNAs. In this study, Home-made rat miRNA microarrays which established in our previous study were used to investigate rat neural tissue-specific miRNAs, and mapped their target genes in rat tissues. This study will provide information for the functional analysis of these miRNAs. In order to obtain as complete a picture of specific miRNA expression in rat neural tissues as possible, customized miRNA microarrays with 152 selected miRNAs from miRBase were used to detect miRNA expression in 14 rat tissues. After a general clustering analysis, 14 rat tissues could be clearly classified into neural and non-neural tissues based on the obtained expression profiles with p values < 0.05. The results indicated that the miRNA profiles were different in neural and non-neural tissues. In total, we found 30 miRNAs that were specifically expressed in neural tissues.

Here we used the next generation sequencing platform to delineate miRNA transcriptome changes in the hippocampus at 24 hours and 7 days following TBI in the rat controlled cortical impact injury (CCI) model, and developed a bioinformatic analysis to identify cellular activities that are regulated by miRNAs differentially expressed in the CCI brains. The results of our study indicate that distinct sets of miRNAs are regulated at different post-traumatic times, and suggest that multiple miRNA species cooperatively regulate cellular pathways for the pathological changes and management of brain injury. The distinctive miRNAs expression profiles at different post-CCI times may be used as molecular signatures to assess TBI progression. In addition to known pathophysiological changes, our study identifies many other cellular pathways that are subjected to modification by differentially expressed miRNAs in TBI brains.

Results In this work, human serum of non-diabetic and diabetic cohorts was analyzed by proteomic approach. To analyze total 1377 high-confident serum-proteins, we developed a computing strategy called localized statistics of protein abundance distribution (LSPAD) to calculate a significant bias of a particular protein-abundance between these two cohorts. As a result, 68 proteins were found significantly over-represented in the diabetic serum (p<0.01). In addition, a pathway-associated analysis was developed to obtain the overall pathway bias associated with type 2 diabetes, from which the significant over-representation of complement system associated with type 2 diabetes was uncovered. Moreover, an up-stream activator of complement pathway, ficolin-3, was observed over-represented in the serum of type 2 diabetic patients, which was further validated with statistic significance (p = 0.012) with more clinical samples.  Conclusions The developed LSPAD approach is well fit for analyzing proteomic data derived from biological complex systems such as plasma proteome.

Time delay is the time lag during which expression change of the regulator is transmitted to change in target gene expression. Regulation coefficient expresses the regulation effect: a positive regulation coefficient indicates activation and negative indicates repression.

For understanding the mechanisms of drug action, researchers traditionally focused on the molecular structures in the context of interactions with targets. The newly emerged high-throughput \"omics\" technology opened a new dimension to study the structure\u2013function relationship of chemicals. Previous studies made attempts to introduce transcriptomics data into chemical function investigation. But little effort has been made to link structural fingerprints of compounds with defined intracellular functions, i.e. expression of particular genes and altered pathways. By integrating the chemical structural information with the gene expression profiles of chemical-treated cells, we developed a novel method to associate the structural difference between compounds with the expression of a definite set of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["861"]}

{"title": "Applying informatics in tissue engineering\n", "abstract": " Objective:    To facilitate tissue engineering strategies determination with informatics tools.          Methods:    Firstly, tissue engineering experimental data were standardized and integrated into a centralized database; secondly, we used data mining tools (e.g. artificial neural networks and decision trees) to predict the outcomes of tissue engineering strategies; thirdly, a strategy design algorithm was developed, and its efficacy was validated with animal experiments; lastly, we constructed an online database and a decision support system for tissue engineering.          Results:    The artificial neural networks and the decision trees respectively predicted the outcomes of tissue engineering strategies with the predictive accuracy of 95.14% and 85.26%. Following the strategies generated by computer, we cured 18 of the 20 experimental animals with a significantly lower cost than usual.

{"title": "Analysis of the mRNA expression similarity of genes in the same gene expression regulatory pathway\n", "abstract": " In this work we analysed the relationship of gene expression from the point of view of gene expression regulatory pathway. Using seven sets of Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene chip expression profile data, and information from two pathway database (KEGG and CYGD), we analysed the mRNA expression similarity of genes in the same gene expression regulatory pathway by Genehub software, that involved totally 16 pathways with more than 495 genes. From the calculation of two different similarity measures-Pearson correlation coefficient and Spearman correlation coefficient, we found that about 94 percent of gene expression regulatory pathways are correlatively expressed in more than 4 (including 4) sets of expression profile data, and it presents additional evidence for the correlation between gene function and its expression in the view of gene expression regulatory pathways.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["861"]}
{"title": "cGRNexp: a Web Platform for Building Combinatorial Gene Regulation Networks based on user-uploaded gene expression datasets\n", "abstract": " While we witness rapid progresses in development of methodologies/algorithms for constructing and analyzing the combinatorial regulation network which includes both TF regulators and miRNA regulators, we find a lack of tools or servers available for facilitating related works. A web service is especially needed that allows user to upload their own expression datasets and mine the combinatorial gene reglatory networks regarding the particular experimental context. Herein we report cGRNexp, a web platform for building combinatorial gene regulation networks based on user-uploaded gene expression datasets. In cGRNexp, we deposit three types of sequence-matching-based regulatory relationships and implement two functional modules for processing microRNA-perturbed gene expression datasets and parallel miRNA/mRNA expression datasets.

{"title": "Feature selection for clustering disease samples based on gene ontology\n", "abstract": " The observation that the disease subtypes can be clustered well based on the top 10% genes expression with the highest variations across disease samples was demonstrated by analyzing two microarray datasets of both leukemia and lymphoma. It was showed that the feature genes containing strong clustering information have different distribution characteristics in the two disease datasets. Based on above observations, a new method combining gene expression profiles with gene functional knowledge to select feature genes for disease samples clustering, was proposed. After each individual gene was annotated to defined functional classes in Gene Ontology, the disease relevant functional classes enriched significantly with differentially expressed genes were identified and then the disease samples were clustered by the differentially expressed genes contained in these identified functional classes. The experimental results showed that the performance of new clustering procedure is better than that of traditional procedure. Besides, biological function comprehensions can be achieved directly with this new approach. Two feature gene sets, which may be functionally relevant to leukemia and lymphoma respectively, are extracted.[Fund]: \u56fd\u5bb6\u81ea\u7136\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u91d1\u9879\u76ee (30370798 30170515 30370388);; \u56fd\u5bb6 863 \u8ba1\u5212\u8bfe\u9898 (2003AA2Z2051; 2002AA2Z2052);; \u9ed1\u9f99\u6c5f\u79d1\u6280\u653b\u5173\u91cd\u70b9\u9879\u76ee (GB03C602-4);; \u54c8\u5c14\u6ee8\u5e02\u79d1\u6280\u653b\u5173\u9879\u76ee (2003AA3CS113);; \u9ed1\u9f99\u6c5f\u81ea\u7136\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u91d1\u9879\u76ee (F0177);; \u54c8\u533b\u5927 211 \u5de5\u7a0b \u201c\u5341\u4e94\u201d \u5efa\u8bbe\u9879\u76ee", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["861"]}
