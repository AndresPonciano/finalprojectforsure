CARMA is a stochastic process algebra equipped with linguistic constructs specifically developed for modelling and programming systems that can operate in open-ended and unpredictable environments. This class of systems is typically composed of a huge number of interacting agents that dynamically adjust and combine their behaviour to achieve specific goals. A CARMA model, termed a collective, consists of a set of components, each of which exhibits a set of attributes. To model dynamic aggregations, which are sometimes referred to as ensembles, CARMA provides communication primitives that are based on predicates over the exhibited attributes. These predicates are used to select the participants in a communication. Two communication mechanisms are provided in the CARMA language: multicast-based and unicast-based. In this paper, we first introduce the basic principles of CARMA and then we show how our language can be used to support specification with a simple but illustrative example of a socio-technical collective adaptive system.", "num_citations": "46\n", "authors": ["1604"]}

The online version of this discussion was not exempted by the presence of misinformation campaigns, but, differently from what already witnessed in other debates, the COVID-19 -intentional or not- flow of false information put at severe risk the public health, possibly reducing the efficacy of government countermeasures. In this manuscript, we study the effective impact of misinformation in the Italian societal debate on Twitter during the pandemic, focusing on the various discursive communities. In order to extract such communities, we start by focusing on verified users, i.e., accounts whose identity is officially certified by Twitter. We start by considering each couple of verified users and count how many unverified\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["1604"]}

However, the dynamism and uncertainty of cloud environments may require the change over time of both application requirements and service capabilities. The current service\u2010level agreement (SLA) management solutions cannot easily guarantee a trustworthy, distributed SLA adaptation due to the centralized authority of the cloud provider who could also misbehave to pursue individual goals. To address the above issues, we propose a novel SLA management framework, which facilitates the specification and enforcement of dynamic SLAs that enable one to describe how, and under which conditions, the offered service level can change over time. The proposed framework relies on a two\u2010level blockchain architecture.

Behavioral equivalences have been mainly developed in the context of process algebras, mathematically rigorous languages that have been used for describing and verifying properties of concurrent communicating systems. By relying on the so called structural operational semantics (SOS), labelled transition systems, are associated to each term of a process algebra. Behavioral equivalences are used to abstract from unwanted details and identify those labelled transition systems that react \u201csimilarly\u201d to external experiments. Due to the large number of properties which may be relevant in the analysis of concurrent systems, many different theories of equivalences have been proposed in the literature. The main contenders consider those systems equivalent that (i) perform the same sequences of actions, or (ii) perform the same sequences of actions and after each sequence are ready to accept the same sets of actions, or (iii) perform the same sequences of actions and after each sequence exhibit, recursively, the same behavior.

Tailored linguistic support to specify MRSs is a major step towards this goal. Indeed, reducing the gap between typical features of an MRS and the linguistic primitives used to model them would simplify both the specification of these systems and their verification. With the aim of reducing this gap, in this work we identify some key features of MRSs.

{"title": "Implementing a distributed mobile calculus using the IMC framework\n", "abstract": " In the last decade, many calculi for modelling distributed mobile code have been proposed. To assess their merits and encourage use, implementations of the calculi have often been proposed. These implementations usually consist of a limited part dealing with mechanisms that are specific of the proposed calculus and of a significantly larger part handling recurrent mechanisms that are common to many calculi. Nevertheless, also the \u201cclassic\u201d parts are often re-implemented from scratch. In this paper we show how to implement a well established representative of the family of mobile calculi, the distributed \u03c0-calculus, by using a Java middleware (called IMC - Implementing Mobile Calculi) where recurrent mechanisms of distributed and mobile systems are already implemented. By means of the case study, we illustrate a methodology to accelerate the development of prototype implementations while concentrating\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1604"]}

With concurrent interpretations in mind, we study the effect of removing the idempotence law X+X=X and distribution law X\u00b7(Y+Z)=X\u00b7Y +X\u00b7Z from Kleene Algebras. We propose an operational semantics that is sound and complete w.r.t. the new set of axioms and is fully abstract w.r.t. a denotational semantic based on trees. The operational semantics is based on labelled transition systems that keep track of the performed choices and on a preorder relation (we call it resource simulation) that takes also into account the number of states reachable via every action.An important property we exhibit is that resource bisimulation equivalence can be obtained as the kernel of resource simulation.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1604"]}

Even if this process may bring benefits to users while browsing, it also raises concerns on the selection of the search results. In particular, users may be unknowingly trapped by search engines in protective information bubbles, called \"filter bubbles\", which can have the undesired effect of separating users from information that does not fit their preferences. This paper moves from early results on quantification of personalization over Google search query results. Inspired by previous works, we have carried out some experiments consisting of search queries performed by a battery of Google accounts with differently prepared profiles. Matching query results, we quantify the level of personalization, according to topics of the queries and the profile of the accounts. This work reports initial results and it is a first step a for more extensive investigation to measure Web search personalization.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1604"]}

For the first preorder, called uncoordinated, we allow only sets of parallel observers that use different parts of the interface of a given service and have no possibility of intercommunication.

For every equivalence under study, we examine the discriminating power of three variants stemming from three approaches that differ for the way probabilities of events are compared when nondeterministic choices are resolved via deterministic schedulers. We show that the first approach - which compares two resolutions relatively to the probability distributions of all considered events - results in a fragment of the spectrum compatible with the spectrum of behavioral equivalences for fully probabilistic processes. In contrast, the second approach - which compares the probabilities of the events of a resolution with the probabilities of the same events in possibly different resolutions - gives rise to another fragment composed of coarser equivalences that exhibits several analogies with the spectrum of behavioral equivalences for fully nondeterministic processes. Finally, the third approach - which only compares the extremal probabilities of each event stemming from the different resolutions - yields even coarser equivalences that, however, give rise to a hierarchy similar to that stemming from the second approach.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1604"]}

{"title": "State to function labelled transition systems: a uniform framework for defining stochastic process calculi\n", "abstract": " Process Algebras are one of the most successful formalisms for modeling concurrent systems and proving their properties. Due to the growing interest in the analysis of shared-resource systems, stochastic process algebras have received great attention. The main aim has been the integration of qualitative descriptions with quantitative (especially performance) ones in a single mathematical framework by building on the combination of Labeled Transition Systems and Continuous-Time Markov Chains. In this paper a unifying framework is introduced for providing the semantics of some of the most representative stochastic process languages; aiming at a systematic understanding of their similarities and differences. The used unifying framework is based on so called State to Function Labelled Transition Systems, FuTSs for short, that are state-transition structures where each transition is a triple of the form (s, \u03b1, P). The first and the second components are the source state and the label of the transition while the third component, P, is the continuation function associating a value of a suitable type to each state s. A non-zero value may represent the cost to reach s from s via \u03b1. The FuTSs framework is used to model representative fragments of major stochastic process calculi and the costs of continuation function do represent the rate of the exponential distribution characterizing the execution time of the performed action.

{"title": "Analysis of online misinformation during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemics in Italy\n", "abstract": " During the Covid-19 pandemics, we also experience another dangerous pandemics based on misinformation. Narratives disconnected from fact-checking on the origin and cure of the disease intertwined with pre-existing political fights. We collect a database on Twitter posts and analyse the topology of the networks of retweeters (users broadcasting again the same elementary piece of information, or tweet) and validate its structure with methods of statistical physics of networks. Furthermore, by using commonly available fact checking software, we assess the reputation of the pieces of news exchanged. By using a combination of theoretical and practical weapons, we are able to track down the flow of misinformation in a snapshot of the Twitter ecosystem. Thanks to the presence of verified users, we can also assign a polarization to the network nodes (users) and see the impact of low-quality information producers and spreaders in the Twitter ecosystem.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1604"]}

{"title": "A behavioural theory for interactions in collective-adaptive systems\n", "abstract": " We propose a process calculus, named AbC, to study the behavioural theory of interactions in collective-adaptive systems by relying on attribute-based communication. An AbC system consists of a set of parallel components each of which is equipped with a set of attributes. Communication takes place in an implicit multicast fashion, and interaction among components is dynamically established by taking into account \"connections\" as determined by predicates over their attributes. The structural operational semantics of AbC is based on Labeled Transition Systems that are also used to define bisimilarity between components. Labeled bisimilarity is in full agreement with a barbed congruence, defined by simple basic observables and context closure. The introduced equivalence is used to study the expressiveness of AbC in terms of encoding broadcast channel-based interactions and to establish formal relationships between system descriptions at different levels of abstraction.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1604"]}
{"title": "A quantitative approach to the design and analysis of collective adaptive systems\n", "abstract": " Reasoning about quantitative properties of collective adaptive systems is made difficult by the typically massive size of the models used for the analysis. In this paper, we present our envisaged approach to the prediction and control of the behaviour of large-scale systems, based on formal methods for their rigorous and unambiguous specification, and an array of scalable and accurate underlying analytical tools.Collective adaptive systems (CAS) consist of a large number of spatially distributed heterogeneous entities with decentralised control and varying degrees of complex autonomous behaviour. It is of fundamental importance that a thorough a priori analysis of their design is carried out to investigate all aspects of their behaviour, including quantitative and emergent aspects, before they are put into operation. This is to avoid costly re-designs or re-deployments that are necessitated if an envisaged solution does not turn out to fulfil the desired quality of service. Therefore, performing analysis as early as possible in the development lifecycle gives designers high confidence that, once operational, CAS can adapt to changing requirements autonomously without operational disruption. Unfortunately, the defining characteristics of these systems mean that their behaviour is often highly unpredictable or counter-intuitive. Formal, scalable, quantitative analysis, which provides multiple perspectives on system behaviour while being based on well-established reasoning techniques, is therefore imperative to master such complex systems. Our main objective is the development of an innovative design framework that provides a formal specification\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1604"]}

{"title": "Tree-functors, determinacy and bisimulations\n", "abstract": " We study the functorial characterisation of bisimulation-based equivalences over a categorical model of labelled trees. We show that in a setting where all labels are visible, strong bisimilarity can be characterised in terms of enriched functors by relying on the reflection of paths with their factorisations. For an enriched functor F, this notion requires that a path (an internal morphism in our framework) \u03c0 going from F(A) to C corresponds to a path p going from A to K, with F(K) = C, such that every possible factorisation of \u03c0 can be lifted in an appropriate factorisation of p. This last property corresponds to a Conduch\u00e9 property for enriched functors, and a very rigid formulation of it has been used by Lawvere to characterise the determinacy of physical systems. We also consider the setting where some labels are not visible, and provide characterisations for weak and branching bisimilarity.

{"title": "Divergence in testing and readiness semantics\n", "abstract": " Many variants of must-testing semantics have been put forward that are equally sensitive to deadlock, but differ for the stress they put on divergence, i.e. on the possibility for systems of getting involved in infinite internal computations. Safe-testing is one such variant, that naturally pops up when studying the behavioural pre-congruences induced by certain basic observables. Here, we study the relationship between safe-testing and Olderog's readiness semantics, a semantics induced by a natural process logic. We show that safe-testing is finer than readiness, and coincides with a refinement of readiness obtained by tuning Olderog's definition. For both safe-testing and the original readiness semantics we propose simple complete axiomatizations, which permit a fuller appreciation of their similarities and differences.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1604"]}

Moreover, there is a general agreement that the main vehicle of fakes news are malicious software robots (bots) that automatically interact with human users.In previous work we have considered the problem of tagging human users in Online Social Networks as credulous users.

{"title": "Transparency in keyword faceted search: An investigation on google shopping\n", "abstract": " The most popular e-commerce search engines allow the user to run a keyword search, to find relevant results and to narrow down the results by mean of filters. The engines can also keep track of data and activities of the users, to provide personalized content, thus filtering automatically out a part of the results. Issues occur when personalization is not transparent and interferes with the user choices. Indeed, it has been noticed that, in some cases, a different ordering of search results is shown to different users. This becomes particularly critical when search results are associated with prices. Changing the order of search results according to prices is known as price steering. This study investigates if and how price steering exists, considering queries on Google Shopping by users searching from different geographic locations, distinguishable by their values of Gross Domestic Product.

The starting point is a novel process calculus AbC (for Attribute-based Communication) introduced for modelling collective-adaptive systems. It is shown how to refine the model by introducing a translator from AbC into UML-like state machines that can be analyzed by UMC. In order to execute the specification, another translator is introduced that maps AbC terms into ABEL, a domain-specific framework that offers faithful AbC-style programming constructs built on top of Erlang.

{"title": "Twitlang (er): interactions modeling language (and interpreter) for Twitter\n", "abstract": " Online social networks are widespread means to enact interactive collaboration among people by, e.g., planning events, diffusing information, and enabling discussions. Twitter provides one of the most illustrative example of how people can effectively interact without resorting to traditional communication media. For example, the platform has acted as a unique medium for reliable communication in emergency or for organising cooperative mass actions. This use of Twitter in a cooperative, possibly critical, setting calls for a more precise awareness of the dynamics regulating message spreading. To this aim, in this paper, we propose Twitlang, a formal language to model interactions among Twitter accounts.

In this work, we continue this line of research, by proposing a novel SWSs composition procedure driven by the SWSs reputation.

The established relationships are summarized in a so-called spectrum. However, the equivalences we consider in that paper are only a small subset of those considered in the original spectrum of equivalences for nondeterministic systems introduced by Rob van Glabbeek. In this companion paper we we enlarge the spectrum by considering variants of trace equivalences (completed-trace equivalences), additional decorated-trace equivalences (failure-trace, readiness, and ready-trace equivalences), and variants of bisimulation equivalences (kernels of simulation, completed-simulation, failure-simulation, and ready-simulation preorders).

{"title": "CAS-SCEL semantics and implementation\n", "abstract": " At the end of the first year of the QUANTICOL project, we identified the linguistic primitives and the interaction patterns (such as broadcast communication or anonymous interaction) that are needed to model the QUANTICOL case studies and, more generally, in Collective Adaptive Systems (CAS) design.Starting from these primitives and interaction patterns, in the second reporting period, we have worked on the definition of syntax and semantics of the CAS-SCEL language that we named CARMA (Collective Adaptive Resource-sharing Markovian Agents). CARMA is a language specifically developed for the specification and analysis of CAS, with the specific objective to support quantitive evaluation and verification. CARMA combines the lessons learnt from other stochastic process algebras such as PEPA [21], EMPA [2], MTIPP [20] and MoD-EST [3], with those learnt from languages specifically designed to model CAS, such as SCEL [13], the AbC calculus [1], PALOMA [14], and the Attributed Pi calculus [22], which feature attribute-based communication and explicit representation of locations.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1604"]}

A basic process calculus, named AbC, is introduced whose primary primitive for interaction is attribute-based communication. An AbC system consists of a set of parallel components each of which is equipped with a set of attributes. Communication takes place in an implicit multicast fashion, and interactions among components are dynamically established by taking into account\\connections\" as determined by predicates over the attributes exposed by components. First, the syntax and the semantics of AbC are presented, then expressiveness and effectiveness of the calculus are demonstrated both in terms of the ability to model scenarios featuring collaboration, reconfiguration, and adaptation and of the possibility of encoding a process calculus for broadcasting channel-based communication and other communication paradigms. Behavioral equivalences for AbC are introduced for establishing formal relationships between different descriptions of the same system.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1604"]}

We introduce dimming relations which are able to relate two models if they can mimic each other by using actions from the same partition block. Moreover, we discuss the necessary requirements for guaranteeing compositional verification. We show how our new relations and results can be exploited when seemingly heterogeneous systems exhibit analogous behaviours manifested via different actions. Dimming relations make the models more homogeneous by collapsing such distinct actions into the same partition block. With our examples, we show how these abstractions may considerably reduce the state-space size, in some cases from exponential to polynomial complexity.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1604"]}

{"title": "Verification of Distributed Systems via Sequential Emulation\n", "abstract": " Sequential emulation is a semantics-based technique to automatically reduce property checking of distributed systems to the analysis of sequential programs. An automated procedure takes as input a formal specification of a distributed system, a property of interest and the structural operational semantics of the specification language and generates a sequential program whose execution traces emulate the possible evolutions of the considered system. The problem as to whether the property of interest holds for the system can then be expressed either as a reachability or as a termination query on the program. This allows to immediately adapt mature verification techniques developed for general-purpose languages to domain-specific languages, and to effortlessly integrate new techniques as soon as they become available. We test our approach on a selection of concurrent systems originated from different contexts from population protocols to models of flocking behaviour. By combining a comprehensive range of program verification techniques, from traditional symbolic execution to modern inductive-based methods such as property-directed reachability, we are able to draw consistent and correct verification verdicts for the considered systems.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1604"]}

Due to the number of involved actors and their strong dependence on mobility and interaction, performance and dependability issues are of utmost importance for this class of systems. To model these systems many specification languages have been proposed in the literature. One of these is KLAIM; an experimental language specifically designed to program distributed systems consisting of several mobile components that interact through multiple distributed tuple spaces. A stochastic extension of KLAIM, named STOKLAIM, has been proposed to facilitate the incorporation of random phenomena. Moreover, to address key functional aspects of STOKLAIM systems such as distribution awareness, mobility, and security and their integration with performance and dependability guarantees, the temporal logic MoSL has been introduced. In this chapter we show how STOKLAIM and MoSL can be used to specify and verify quantitative properties of distributed systems.

{"title": "Contractual testing\n", "abstract": " Variants of must testing approach have been successfully applied in Service Oriented Computing for capturing compliance between (contracts exposed by) a client and a service and for characterising safe replacement, namely the fact that compliance is preserved when a service exposing a \u2019smaller\u2019 contract is replaced by another one with a \u2019larger\u2019 contract. Nevertheless, in multi-party interactions, partners often lack full coordination capabilities. Such a scenario calls for less discriminating notions of testing in which observers are, e.g., the description of uncoordinated multiparty contexts or contexts that are unable to observe the complete behaviour of the process under test. In this paper we propose an extended notion of must  preorder, called contractual preorder, according to which contracts are compared according to their ability to pass only the tests belonging to a given set. We show the generality of our framework by proving that preorders induced by existing notions of compliance in a distributed setting are instances of the contractual preorder when restricting to suitable sets of observers.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1604"]}

{"title": "Virtual Machine Technologies: Core Software Framework v2\n", "abstract": " This document discusses the progress in the implementation of the MIKADO Core Software Framework, that we call IMC (Implementing Mobile Calculi). The framework has been developed to build run-time support for languages oriented aiming at programming global computing applications. It enables platform designers to customize communication protocols and network architectures and guarantees transparency of name management and code mobility in distributed environments. A first version of the IMC framework was delivered last year [BFN+04]. The version described here has been completely re-designed and implemented with the aims of guaranteeing better usability and additional features. The actual changes have been prompted by the actual use of the framework by two units of the project. The IMC framework has been used to re-engineer the KLAVA package (the runtime support for KLAIM) and to implement two variants of D\u03c0, one of the reference calculi for the mikado domain based model. Investigation have started to consider the embedding the concept of membrane within IMC that have lead to guidelines that will be used for further implementations. The framework presented here will be released as open source software.

{"title": "P:= nil aP| P1 P2|* P\n", "abstract": " Klaim has proved to be suitable for programming a wide range of distributed appli-cations with agents and code mobility [5, 6] and it has originated an actual programming language, X-KLAIM [1], that has been implemented by exploiting Java [2]. The main drawback of Klaim is that it is not an actual programming language, nor a process calculus. The main aim of some our recent works (grouped together in (131) has been the definition of a process calculus derived from Klaim that retains all its distinctive features and expressive power, and develop over it the type theoretic and semantical foundations of the language. The resulting calculus has been called uKLAIM and, in [8], we have proved that it can reasonably encode KLAIM. In this paper, we first describe uKLAIM (Section 2). Then, in Section 3, we present some recent enhancements of the basic formalism to deal with some low-level features, namely inter-node connections and failures. In Section 4, we argue on alternative forms of pattern matching for retrieving tuples. So far, Klaim and its variants have used LINDA'S original pattern matching, because of its simplicity. Nevertheless, other variants could be adopted without compromising language implementability, actually enhancing the overall expressive power. A novel contribution of this paper is the informal examination of this topic. Section 5 concludes the paper.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1604"]}

{"title": "Formal modeling and quantitative analysis of KLAIM-based mobile systems.\u2014Full Version\u2014\n", "abstract": " KLAIM is an experimental language designed for modeling and programming distributed systems composed of mobile components where distribution awareness and dynamic system architecture configuration are key issues, like most web-based service implementations. In this paper we propose STOcKLAIM, a STOchastic extension of cKLAIM, the core subset of KLAIM. cKLAIM includes process distribution, process mobility, and asynchronous communication. The extension makes it possible to integrate the modeling of quantitative aspects of mobile systems\u2014eg performance\u2014with the functional specification of such systems. At the conceptual level, our proposal is based on the assumption that any action of a process in a cKLAIM network takes some time to be executed. At the technical level, the time associated to the execution of an action is determined by a continuous random variable with an exponential distribution. Consequently, process actions in STOcKLAIM are equipped with the rate of such distributions. We present a formal operational semantics of STOcKLAIM, which associates a labeled transition system to each STOcKLAIM network and a translation from such labeled transition systems to Continuous Time Markov Chains for quantitative analysis. We also show how STOcKLAIM can be used by means of two simple examples: namely a distributed mobile service and the spreading of a virus.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1604"]}

This characterization permits relying on algebraic techniques for proving systems properties and reduces equivalence checking of two systems to studying the relationships among the elements of their structures. Different algebraic characterizations of bisimulation-based equivalences in terms of particular transition systems homomorphisms have been proposed in the literature. Here we show, by an example, that trace-based equivalences are not locally characterizable and thus that the above results cannot be extended to these equivalences.

{"title": "A Symbolic Semantics for the pi-Calculus\n", "abstract": " We use symbolic transition systems as a basis for providing the \u03c0-calculus with an alternative semantics. The latter is more amenable to automatic manipulation and sheds light on the logical differences among different forms of bisimulation over algebras of name-passing processes. Symbolic transitions have the form P \u03b8, \u03b1\u2192 P\u2032, where \u03b8 is a boolean combination of equalities on names that has to hold for the transition to take place, and \u03b1 is standard a \u03c0-calculus action. On top of the symbolic transition system, a symbolic bisimulation is defined that captures the standard ones. Finally, a sound and complete proof system is introduced for symbolic bisimulation.\u00a9 1996 Academic Press, Inc.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1604"]}

An NMS consists of the finite and infinite computations (ordered by prefix) of a transition system. The label of a node is the observation performed on the corresponding computation. A notion of NMS observational equivalence is introduced as the maximal bisimulation. Depending on the labels we can capture different equivalences. Milner's CCS is used as a test case for our approach. Both an interleaving and a partial ordering observation for CCS computations are defined, thus inducing two equivalences on CCS agents. In the former case the induced equivalence coincides with Milner's observational equivalence, while in the latter case it is finer exactly in that it distinguishes interleaving of sequential nondeterministic processes from their concurrent execution.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1604"]}

RT Ss facilitate the compositional definition of such semantics exploiting operators on the next state functions which are the functional counterpart of classical process algebra operators. We apply this framework to representative fragments of major stochastic process calculi including TIPP, EMPA, PEPA and IML and show how they solve the issue of transition multiplicity in a simple and elegant way. We, moreover, show how RT Ss help describing different languages, their differences and their similarities. For each calculus, we also show the formal correspondence between the RT Ss semantics and the standard SOS one.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1604"]}

However, due to their complexities, it is quite burdensome to process their sentences by machines in a seamless and standardised way. Controlled Natural Languages are subsets of natural languages that are obtained by restricting the grammar and vocabulary, in order to reduce-or even eliminate-ambiguity and complexity. These languages hold two major characteristics: they look informal and easy to read and write by humans, quite like natural languages, but they can be easily transformed into machine-readable forms. Social networks providers usually describe the terms of data storage, usage, and sharing, by adopting natural languages. To automatically evaluate such terms of use, to understand, analyse, and enforce rights and obligations over the users\u2019 data, it is of uttermost importance to translate them in a machine readable\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1604"]}

{"title": "a Kernel Language for Agents Interaction and Mobility\n", "abstract": " We investigate the issue of designing a kernel programming language for Mobile Computing and describe Klaim, a language that supports a programming paradigm where processes, like data, can be moved from one computing environment to another. The language consists of a core Linda with multiple tuple spaces and of a set of operators for building processes. Klaim naturally supports programming with explicit localities. Localities are rst-class data (they can be manipulated like any other data), but the language provides coordination mechanisms to control the interaction protocols among located processes. The formal operational semantics is useful for discussing the design of the language and provides guidelines for implementations. Klaim is equipped with a type system that statically checks access rights violations of mobile agents. Types are used to describe the intentions (read, write, execute, etc.) of processes in relation to the various localities. The type system is used to determine the operations that processes want to perform at each locality, and to check whether they comply with the declared intentions and whether they have the necessary rights to perform the intended operations at the speci c localities. Via a series of examples, we show that many mobile code programming paradigms can be naturally implemented in our kernel language. We also present a prototype implementation of Klaim in Java.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1604"]}
{"title": "Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming\n", "abstract": " What you have in your hands, or on the screen of your device, is the third life of a journal that was founded in 1984 by JA Robinson from Syracuse University, shortly after Logic Programming had started attracting a great deal of attention worldwide. The journal was named The Journal of Logic Programming and, first with JA Robinson and then JL Lassez from IBM\u2013TJ Watson Research Center as editors in chief, continued until December 2000. In January 2001, after the great success of algebraic methods in process specifications the name was changed into The Journal of Logic and Algebraic Programming and the journal was led by two editors in chief, JA Bergstra from the University of Amsterdam and JV Tucker from Swansea University. Since then, logical and algebraic methods have become increasingly important and mentioning just logic and algebraic programming in the title of the journal, without stressing methodologies, began to seem belittling. This is why, when I was asked by Elsevier to take charge as the editor in chief of the journal, I thought it was worth reflecting the new spirit of the journal through a new name: The Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming (J-LAMP). It is a new publication outlet that we are offering to the research community working on programming models, program specification and verification, on qualitative and quantitative analysis, and on security, amongst others. In general, we would like to provide a venue for contributing to trustworthy programming, in the sense of guaranteeing correctness and quality of programs and systems despite environmental disruption, human interaction, and attacks\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1604"]}

{"title": "Network-aware Evaluations of Reputation Systems\n", "abstract": " Reputation systems are nowadays widely used to support decision making in networked systems. Parties in such systems rate each other and use shared ratings to compute reputation scores that drive their interactions. The existence of many reputation systems with remarkable differences calls for software frameworks for describing, implementing and comparing their performances while taking into account the architecture of the network where the systems have to be deployed. We tackle this problem through a software framework for network-aware evaluations of reputation systems based on the notion of probabilistic trust. Specifically, we describe a tool for rapid prototyping and evaluation of reputation system models, which takes explicitly into account the networked execution environment. To implement specific models we just enrich Klava (a network-aware extension of Java) with additional classes. To assess performances of the resulting reputation systems, their implementations are analysed by a control manager that performs experiments according to user-specified parameters. The developed framework relies on the formal foundations of Klaim, a networkaware coordination language, and its Java implementation Klava. Feasibility and effectiveness of our proposal is demonstrated by reporting on the analysis of two simple models of reputation systems.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1604"]}

In this thesis we illustrate this approach by focussing on COWS, a process calculus expressly designed for specifying and combining service-oriented applications, while modelling their dynamic behaviour. We show that COWS can model all the phases of the life cycle of service-oriented applications, such as publication, discovery, negotiation, orchestration, deployment, reconfiguration and execution.
