{"title": "A home energy management system using Gray Wolf Optimizer in smart grids\n", "abstract": " In recent years, real-time pricing has become so popular and give the residents the benefit of reducing the energy cost by scheduling appliances. However, scheduling appliances manually is so time taking and may not result in users' satisfaction. Automatic scheduler and Energy Management Systems are one of the solutions developed by the researchers in recent year. In this paper, authors propose a method based on Gray Wolf Optimization and Genetic Algorithm to achieve the optimal schedule for appliances in terms of cost and PAR.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1119"]}
