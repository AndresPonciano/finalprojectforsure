{"title": "Is mutation score a fair metric?\n", "abstract": " Comparing the mutation scores achieved for test suites, one is able to judge which test suite is more effective. However, it is not known if the mutation score is a fair metric to do such comparison. In this paper, we present an empirical study, which compares developer-written and automatically generated test suites in terms of mutation score and in relation to the detection ratios of 7 mutation types. Our results indicate fairness on the mutation score.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["2053"]}
{"title": "A Large Scale Study On the Effectiveness of Manual and Automatic Unit Test Generation\n", "abstract": " Recently, an increasingly large amount of effort has been devoted to implementing tools to generate unit test suites automatically. Previous studies have investigated the effectiveness of these tools by comparing automatically generated test suites (ATSs) to manually written test suites (MTSs). Most of these studies report that ATSs can achieve higher code coverage, or even mutation coverage, than MTSs, particularly when suites are generated from defective code. However, these studies usually consider a limited amount of classes or subject programs, while the adoption of such tools in the industry is still low. This work aims to compare the effectiveness of ATSs and MTSs when applied as regression test suites. We conduct an empirical study, using ten programs (1368 classes), written in Java, that already have MTSs and apply two sophisticated tools that automatically generate test cases: Randoop and EvoSuite\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2053"]}
