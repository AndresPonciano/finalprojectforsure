{"title": "Microwave Individual and Combined Pre-Treatments on  Lignocellulosic Biomasses\n", "abstract": " Lignocellulosic Biomass is considered to be the best option for biofuels production, due to the energy and food security concerns comparative to the use of other wastes, but this biomass has limited digestibility due to many factors like particle size, crystallinity of cellulose, lignin content etc. Pre-treatments enhance the digestibility by reducing the effect of these factors. Different pretreatment types exist, but now microwave pretreatment (individual or combined with other pretreatments) is becoming common due to its better results. This paper reviews the advantages of using lignocellulosic biomass in terms of the biofuels obtained from it, common pretreatments applied on it, and the effects of microwave pretreatments (individual and combined) over it.", "num_citations": "32\n", "authors": ["2257"]}

{"title": "Conceptual Fuzzy Temporal Relational Model (FTRM) for Patient Data\n", "abstract": " Classical relational model offer very little built-in support for managing time varying data. Relational model mainly deal with crisp data and not with imprecise data. Managing temporal data in the relational environment keeping the imprecise and fuzzy nature of the data requires the extension of the relational model. Small numbers of extended models at conceptual level are proposed and there is no significant implementation of such model exists. Importance of developing ontological framework for imprecise data and temporal data is required in many applications such as health and patient databases. In this paper we propose a temporal fuzzy ontology for patient data in a hospital environment. On the basis of the ontology defined we propose a conceptual fuzzy temporal relational model (FTRM) for handling time varying attributes and fuzzy attributes in the relational database environment. The proposed model is easy to define, manage and incorporates the important and relevant features in the target fuzzy temporal relational model.", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["2257"]}

It is the most emerging technology these days which is becoming the alternate for barcode. Hence this technology is receiving lot of attention comparatively over past few years. RFID technology is used to automatically identify any item or a package. Automatic identification can be done with the help of RFID Tags and RFID Reader units. An RFID tag contains the transponder that can transmit wireless information over short distance. This information is then received by the device called RFID Reader and further processed through middleware infrastructure. Billions of RFID tags are successfully installed worldwide. Tons of RFID Applications are being developed in the various fields like Healthcare, Engineering, Agri-food, Live-stocks etc. for traceability purpose. Familiarization with the benefit and the risk of RFID is important before using this technology. The shadow of this technology has made a huge impact on our daily lives.

Overall treatment efficiency of FeCl3, FeSO4, Alum and Ash adsorbent was determined by 57%, 20%, 63% and 58% respectively. Hybrid process of FeCl3-CFA, FeSO4-CFA and Alum-CFA have reduced the concentration of pollutants by approximately 73%, 60% and 68% respectively. The adsorptive capacity and adsorption percent of Ash adsorbent was determined. The adsorptive capacity of adsorbent declined on the ever-increasing adsorbent quantity. The adsorption behavior of Ash adsorbent in dyes wastewater pollutants removal was measured using Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models.

{"title": "Imposing Software Traceability and Configuration  Management for Change Tolerance in Software Production\n", "abstract": " The presence of change in any production process, especially in software development, is usually intolerant and highly resistive as it creates confusions among developers and breaks the confidence of customers resulting in non-reliable production. Change is inevitable especially while software is built. There could be several reasons for such confusions likely deployment of the application on multiple variant platforms or having multiple releases, or distinct support tools for simultaneous testing, or developers with deputation over multiple projects at the same time, or following bad or weak practices of undertaking frequent modifications over any certified post-release. Such confusions are indeed needed to be managed in a highly organized manner with recording the traces in the case for the post inspective backpropagation for quick determination of any error causing the software failure. Business ventures are operating in a highly competitive arena globally, where such practices are extremely risky and annoying. Software configuration management, SCM fulfils the objective to avoid such confusions when change is requested, where keeping maximum trace record of development ie software traceability highly help to determine the timely error for correction without any hassle. In this paper, we have tried best to give awareness to all software development stakeholders understanding trouble of change, maintaining traceability with a quality focus, where practices of change and configuration management are explored.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["2257"]}
{"title": "Effect of Change in Orientation of Enhanced Dynamic Wedges on Radiotherapy Treatment Dose\n", "abstract": " Enhanced Dynamic Wedges are used in radiotherapy treatment to modify the dose distribution in target volume so that a desired dose distribution is achieved. The technique being highly advanced and computer controlled, requires enhanced degree of quality assurance. The investigation aimed to verify the constancy of treatment dose, when the orientation of the enhanced dynamic wedge (EDW) is reversed. It has been noted that there is a slight change in the monitor units with the reversal of EDW orientation. The calculated dose for two opposite orientations of EDW has been compared for 6 and 10 MV photon beams, by two different calculation systems (Pencil Beam & Collapsed Cone) to assure the quality of EDW technique as well as to increase its reliability. The difference in the calculated dose for Y1-IN and Y2-OUT orientation, for three different field sizes and all seven wedge angels, is very small and hence not enough to change the wedge factor significantly.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["2257"]}

The monomer was prepared by a general method by Marvel and Torkoy by treating it with 1, 3, 5-trioxane by addition of H2SO4 and CH3COOH respectively. The solubility level of reported polymers was found poor in organic solvents, and attributed to its quality of being a hindrance. The structure of Schiff bases was confirmed by CHN, FTIR, UV-Visible Spectroscopy, TGA/DTA and Viscosity measurements. All the Schiff base polymers revealed a qualitative change or a shift in band position as compared to monomer due to conversion of Carbonyl to Azomethine group. An observable increase was found in the values of reduced and intrinsic viscosities than the corresponding monomer that could be due to the formation of polymers.
