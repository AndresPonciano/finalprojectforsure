{"title": "Regulation of apoptosis and differentiation by p53 in human embryonic stem cells\n", "abstract": " The essentially infinite expansion potential and pluripotency of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) makes them attractive for cell-based therapeutics. In contrast to mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), hESCs normally undergo high rates of spontaneous apoptosis and differentiation, making them difficult to maintain in culture. Here we demonstrate that p53 protein accumulates in apoptotic hESCs induced by agents that damage DNA. However, despite the accumulation of p53, it nevertheless fails to activate the transcription of its target genes. This inability of p53 to activate its target genes has not been observed in other cell types, including mESCs. We further demonstrate that p53 induces apoptosis of hESCs through a mitochondrial pathway. Reducing p53 expression in hESCs in turn reduces both DNA damage-induced apoptosis as well as spontaneous apoptosis.

In upper crustal settings, igneous rocks are often altered by hydrothermal fluids such that the original textures and compositions of igneous magnetite may be partly or completely obliterated, posing interpretive problems in petrological and geochemical studies. In this paper, we present textural and compositional data of magnetite from variably albitized granitoid rocks in the Handan-Xingtai district, North China Craton to characterize the hydrothermal reequilibration of igneous magnetite.Four types of magnetite have been identified in the samples studied: pristine igneous magnetite (type 1), reequilibrated porous magnetite (type 2), reequilibrated nonporous magnetite (type\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "46\n", "authors": ["1016"]}

The results show that the embryos were enclosed in a thin capsule with an ornament of cell-like polygons on the surface. Moreover, each elongated specimen consists of two blastomeres inside the sculptured capsule, and the geometric relationship of the two blastomeres in each specimen suggests that these specimens probably represent cleaving embryos during different phases of cytokinesis.

However, existing web service trust models either do not consider users' preferences for different quality of service (QoS) attributes, or ignore the impact of vicious ratings on trust evaluation. To address these gaps, PHAT, a dynamic trust evaluation model with dual consideration of users' preferences and false ratings, is proposed in this paper. The model introduces an approach to automatically mine users' preferences from their requirements. The preferences are then used to determine the weight of each QoS attribute when integrating trust into multi-dimensional QoS attributes. The \u201clocal\u201d trust on a service is derived by combining the trust on QoS attributes and the user's subjective ratings.

Most uranium ore deposits in South China are strictly fault-hosted and associated with mid-late Mesozoic granitic intrusions and volcanic rocks, which formed under transpression and transtension regimes, respectively.

Among techniques studied in this field, program spectrum based fault localization is a promising approach. To perform spectrum based fault localization, a set of test oracles should be provided, and the effectiveness of fault localization depends highly on the quality of test oracles. Moreover, their effectiveness is usually affected when multiple simultaneous faults are present. Faced with multiple faults it is difficult for developers to determine when to stop the fault localization process. To address these issues, we propose an iterative fault localization process, i.e., an iterative process of selecting test cases for effective fault localization (IPSETFUL), to identify as many faults as possible in the program until the stopping criterion is satisfied.

It is very important in object-oriented software integration testing or regression testing, because different test orders need different test cost to construct corresponding test stubs. However, the current solutions to the ICITO problem lack an effective coupling measure technique to estimate test stub complexity, and lack an effective algorithm to break cycles. Thus, this paper uses an improved coupling measure technique to estimate test stub complexity, and designs a random iterative algorithm to break cycles. Simulation experimental results show that the overall test stub complexity can be reduced by 15.5\\% and the speed can be increased by 5.8 times, using our improved coupling measure technique and random iterative algorithm.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["1016"]}

In this paper, the way of spatial data analysis, such as spatial correlation analysis and spatial interpolation were used. The overall evaluation of LCSDI in Beijing is 63.8, which means that most of the residents are getting comfort from the livable conditions in Beijing. The spatial distribution of the LCSDI shows that residents in the inner city have a better degree than those living in the suburbs. Sub-districts in the suburbs have obvious difference in LCSDI. Those sub-districts that were planned to be huge residential areas have bad conditions on commute, and their LCSDI is lower than that of those sub-districts with comprehensive functions. To get a better understanding of the spatial pattern of the LCSDI, we used the Moran I to measure the spatial autocorrelation. The results also show that there is spatial autocorrelation in the LCSDI. Those indices related with the natural environment have stronger spatial autocorrelation than those indices related with human resources. The Moran I of LCSDI changes in different scales. The analysis of the spatial heterogeneity of LCSDI indicates that there is a decreasing trend in LCSDI from the center of Beijing to the suburban areas, which is the reflection of urban development in Beijing. As the administrative division is a limitation in the analysis of LCSDI, the Ordinary Kriging was used to model the spatial distribution of LCSDI in Beijing.

The analysis can be driven by identifying the impact caused by the changes on the trust of other component services as well as the composite service. In this paper, we propose a trust impact analysis model to analyze the impact of two kinds of evolution operations performed on a composite service: binding changes and business process changes. First, trust dependency graph is introduced to analyze the impact on the trust of component services. It not only identifies the affected component services but also quantifies the impact degree on the trust of them. Then we introduce control flow graph to evaluate the impact on the trust of the composite service. Three metrics are introduced to evaluate the impact of these evolution operations.

This paper presents a framework for CPS modeling and verification. In the framework, CPS are modelled by HybridUML and then the generic model is transformed to a formal model that is suitable for reasoning with the help of formal methods. The formal method adopted is differential dynamic logic (dL) whose operational model is hybrid program (HP). When transforming a HybridUML model to its corresponding HP presentation, transformation rules are defined according to semantic consistency. After transformation, CPS properties are specified on the basis of the resulting HP, and finally, the properties are automatically verified through the theorem prover KeYmaera.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1016"]}

Regression test selection addresses the problem of reducing testing cost through selecting a subset of the existing test cases or rerun.

The current regression test selection strategies or cost analysis seldom consider hierarchy, which is an inherent characteristic of object-oriented program. In addition, selecting test cases at different levels influences the precision and efficiency of selection.

In this study, Fe isotope systematics in whole-rocks and Fe-bearing minerals coupled with S isotope compositions of Fe-sulfides are investigated for the early Cretaceous Tongshankou porphyry Cu-Mo deposit from Eastern China. The results show that altered ore-hosting granodiorite porphyries display a small \u03b456Fe variation (0.04\u2030 to 0.17\u2030) with an average of 0.10\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.08\u2030 (2SD, n\u202f=\u202f10), indistinguishable from the values for global igneous rocks.

{"title": "The impacts of techniques, programs and tests on automated program repair: An empirical study\n", "abstract": " Manual program repair is notoriously tedious, error-prone, and costly, especially for the modern large-scale projects. Automated program repair can automatically find program patches without much human intervention, greatly reducing the burden of developers as well as accelerating software delivery. Therefore, much research effort has been dedicated to design powerful program repair techniques. To date, although various program repair techniques have been proposed, to our knowledge, there lacks extensive study on the impacts of repair techniques, subject programs, and test suites on the repair effectiveness and efficiency. In this paper, we perform such an extensive study on repairing 180 seeded and real faults from 17 small to large sized programs.

{"title": "Research on health assessment technique of tunnel lining based on power spectrum density characteristics of microtremors\n", "abstract": " A large number of tunnels in the world have been in service for several decades, and their health conditions deteriorate with the increasing service ages. Therefore, effective inspection methods are essential to accurately assess the health conditions of tunnels. Visual inspection method has been commonly utilized to investigate the integrity of lining concrete, however, this method is incapable of providing sufficient information about the inner state of the lining concrete, such as the existence of cracks and cavities. Since the microtremor characteristics of a concrete structure are significantly affected by its damage degree, this feature may serve as an effective method to investigate the health condition of a lining concrete. In this study, in-situ microtremor measurements were conducted on three spans of a road tunnel with varying damage degrees, and the power spectra density of the microtremors were analyzed. Then the microtremor behavior of the tunnel lining was simulated by using the two-dimensional finite difference code of FLAC. The results of both field measurements and numerical simulations indicate that the ratio of power spectrum density (RPSD) in the range of 0-110 Hz, can be used as a indicator for the damage location, type and degree. For the damaged lining where voids exist, the RPSD values are smaller than 0; for the circumferential cracks, the RPSD values are larger than 0. Therefore, as an initial step, this study gives clear evidence that the microtremor intensity characteristics have strong relation with the health conditions of lining concrete, which has the potential to be used in engineering practices.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1016"]}

{"title": "Technique of software fault localization based on hierarchical slicing spectrum\n", "abstract": " A commonly-used software fault localization technique mainly utilizes testing coverage information to calculate the suspiciousness of each program statement to find the faulty statement. However, this technique does not fully take dependences of the program into account; thus, its capacity for precisely locating faults is limited. This paper proposes a more effective hierarchical slicing spectrum-based software fault localization (HSS-SFL) technique for object-oriented programs. HSS-SFL first analyzes the dependence among the elements at different granularity levels including package level, class level, method level and statement level, and deletes some elements which are unrelated to the failed testing outputs. Next, the technique builds the hierarchical slicing spectrum model for these hierarchical slices obtained from the previous step, and further defines a suspiciousness method for each slice element. Finally, the faulty statement is located according to the suspiciousness results. Experimental results on real application programs show that HSS-SFL is more effective to locate the fault than program spectrum-based Tarantula technique, Union technique and Intersection technique.[Fund]: \u56fd\u5bb6\u81ea\u7136\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u91d1 (60973149 61202006);; \u9ad8\u7b49\u5b66\u6821\u535a\u58eb\u5b66\u79d1\u70b9\u4e13\u9879\u79d1\u7814\u57fa\u91d1 (20100092110022);; \u4e2d\u56fd\u79d1\u5b66\u9662\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u56fd\u5bb6\u91cd\u70b9\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u5f00\u653e\u57fa\u91d1 (SYSKF1110)", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1016"]}

{"title": "Clustering classes in packages for program comprehension\n", "abstract": " During software maintenance and evolution, one of the important tasks faced by developers is to understand a system quickly and accurately. With the increasing size and complexity of an evolving system, program comprehension becomes an increasingly difficult activity. Given a target system for comprehension, developers may first focus on the package comprehension. The packages in the system are of different sizes. For small-sized packages in the system, developers can easily comprehend them. However, for large-sized packages, they are difficult to understand. In this article, we focus on understanding these large-sized packages and propose a novel program comprehension approach for large-sized packages, which utilizes the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to cluster large-sized packages. Thus, these large-sized packages are separated as small-sized clusters, which are easier for developers to comprehend. Empirical studies on four real-world software projects demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The results show that the effectiveness of our approach is better than Latent Semantic Indexing- (LSI-) and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis- (PLSA-) based clustering approaches. In addition, we find that the topic that labels each cluster is useful for program comprehension.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1016"]}

Given the proposed changes, most commonly used CIA techniques apply reachability analysis on the graphical representation of the software to identify their effects. They often compute a large set of potentially impacted elements with many false-positives, which will waste resource in later analysis. In addition, these techniques do not consider the interference among the proposed changes, which does exist in practice. Faced with these problems, this paper proposed a new call graph-based CIA technique, which takes the interference among multiple proposed changes into account to improve the precision of the impact results.

{"title": "A Systematic State-Based Approach to Regression Testing of Component Software.\n", "abstract": " Today, component-based software engineering has been widely used in software construction to reduce project cost and speed up software development cycle. Due to software changes in new release or update of components, regression testing is needed to assure system quality. When changes made to a component, the component could be affected, moreover, the changes could bring impacts on the entire system. We firstly identify diverse changes made to components and system based on models, then perform change impact analysis, and finally refresh regression test suite using a state-based testing practice. Related existing research did not address the issue of systematic regression testing of component-based software, especially at system level. The paper also reports a case study based on a realistic component-based software system using a, which shows that the approach is feasible and effective.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1016"]}

{"title": "Using cognitive easiness metric for program comprehension\n", "abstract": " Program comprehension is one of the most critical phases in software maintenance. During program designing, the codes having related function and behavior are often scattered in different parts of program, which increases the difficulty of understanding program, and further obfuscates programmers. In this paper, we propose an approach to assisting comprehension process using cognitive easiness metric, which can predicate the easiness degree of a method to understand in various comprehension phases. The approach uses coarse-grained call graph slicing technique and intra-procedural coarse-grained slicing technique to compute the cognitive easiness of non-understood methods based on those understood methods in the program. It can not only guide programmers to investigate the non-understood codes in the program from the easier parts to the harder parts, but also support different guidance for\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1016"]}
{"title": "Mineralization and genesis of the Fanjiabu gold deposit in the Sulu ultrahigh pressure metamorphic terrane, with a comparison to the gold mineralization in the Jiaobei terrane\n", "abstract": " The quartz vein-type Fanjiabu gold deposit is economically the most important gold deposit in the Sulu ultrahigh pressure metamorphic terrane, Jiaodong Peninsula. Cathodoluminescence images and trace element and U-Pb isotope compositions by laser ICP-MS indicate that zircons extracted from auriferous quartz veins are exclusively inherited magmatic zircons from wall rocks of gold veins, namely the Neoproterozoic biotite monzogranite. A total of 22 analyses on 22 zircon grains were made, and a concordant homogeneous group was formed by 15 analyses, and a weighted mean 206Pb/238U age of (726\u00b114) Ma (MSWD= 4.6) was yielded. The remaining 7 analyses are plotted in a discordia, with an upper intercept U-Pb age of (758\u00b125) Ma and lower intercept age of (123\u00b111) Ma (MSWD= 0.45). The lower intercept age is consistent with 40Ar/39Ar hornblende ages of (118.8\u00b11.6) Ma to (117.5\u00b11.5) Ma of lamprophyre dikes closely associated with gold veins, and is therefore interpreted as the timing of mineralization at the Fanjiabu gold deposit. Results of this investigation and previous studies suggest that gold mineralization in the Sulu and Jiaobei terranes were contemporaneous, taking place at ca. 120 Ma and coincident temporarily with lithospheric thinning of the North China craton. This indicates that the Fanjiabu gold deposit and, by inference, other coeval deposits in the Sulu terrane were formed as a result of thinning of lithosphere mantle beneath the North China craton. Fluid inclusion and stable isotope data show that ore-forming fluids in the Fanjiabu gold deposit were characterized by middle to high temperature, high salinity (15\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1016"]}

The model introduces an approach to automatically mine user's preferences from their requirements, the preferences are used to determine the weights of each QoS attribute when integrating local trust into the multi-dimensional QoS attributes.

{"title": "Accurate design pattern detection based on idiomatic implementation matching in java language context\n", "abstract": " Design patterns (DPs) are widely accepted as solutions to recurring problems in software design. While numerous approaches and tools have been proposed for DP detection over the years, the neglect of language-specific mechanism that underlies the implementation idioms of DPs leads to false or missing DP instances since language-specific features are not captured and similar characteristics are not distinguished. However, there is still a lack of research that emphasizes the idiomatic implementation in the context of a specific language. A vital challenge is the representation of software systems and language mechanism. In this work, we propose a practical approach for DP detection from source code, which exploits idiomatic implementation in the context of Java language. DPs are formally defined under the blueprint of the layered knowledge graph (LKG) that models both language-independent concepts of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1016"]}

Mineralization occurs at the contact between Eocene igneous rocks and Cretaceous carbonates. The silicate-dominant prograde skarn stage consists of garnet and clinopyroxene, whereas the retrograde stage is dominated by magnetite associated with minor hematite, phlogopite, pyrite, and chalcopyrite. Phase equilibria and mineral chemistry studies reveal that the skarn formed within a temperature range of \u223c375\u00b0 to 580\u00a0\u00b0C and that the mineralizing fluid evolved from a hot, low oxygen fugacity, alkaline fluid during the silicate-dominant stage to a fluid of relatively lower temperature and higher oxygen fugacity at the magnetite-dominant stage.

{"title": "CLPS-MFL: Using concept lattice of program spectrum for effective multi-fault localization\n", "abstract": " Fault localization (FL) is an important but challenging task during software testing. Among techniques studied in this field, using program spectrum as a bug indicator is a promising approach. However, its effectiveness may be affected when multiple simultaneous faults are present. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel approach, CLPS-MFL, which combines concept lattice with program spectrum to localize multiple faults. Our approach first uses formal concept analysis to transform the obtained program spectrum into a concept lattice. Then, it uses three strategies to identify the failure root causes based on the properties of the concept lattice. Our empirical studies on three subject programs validate the effectiveness of the CLPS-MFL approach for localizing multiple faults.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1016"]}
{"title": "A technique of multiple fault localization based on conditioned execution slicing spectrum\n", "abstract": " Program spectrum-based software fault localization (PS-SFL) has become one of the hottest research directions due to its high efficiency of localizing faults. It usually localizes program faults by computing the suspiciousness of program statements according to the test coverage information. However, the efficiency of this technology will decrease with the increase of the number of faults in the program. One reason is that the suspiciousness of program statement is computed by counting the number of failed tests and passed tests, but the failed tests that covered the program statement may be caused by different faults. This paper proposes a multiple fault localization (CESS-MFL) technique, which is based on conditioned execution slicing spectrum to alleviate the above problem and improve the efficiency of localizing multiple faults. The CESS-MFL technique firstly constructs a spectrum matrix of fault-related conditioned execution slice according to the predicates of input variables, then computes the suspiciousness of elements (statements or blocks of statements) in fault-related conditioned execution slice and generates a suspiciousness report. The experiment shows that the CESS-MFL technique has higher efficiency than the popular program spectrum-based Tarantula technique, program slicing-based Intersection technique and Union technique in the multiple-fault program, and can be implemented in effective space and time complexity.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1016"]}

{"title": "Profiling all paths\n", "abstract": " Path profiling, an important technique in dynamic program analysis, which collects the execution times of different paths, has been widely used in a variety of areas. However, existing intra-procedural profiling techniques have inadequate abilities in loops, ie, they can only either solve profiling acyclic paths, or limit loop iterations to a certain number first, and then profile paths under such a limitation. This paper presents a new profiling technique called PAP (profiling all paths), which can profile finite-length paths inside a procedural. PAP consists of two basic phases: one is the probe instrumentation which assigns a unique pathid for each path, and the other is backwalk which uses the pathids to determine the corresponding executed paths. Furthermore, breakpoints are introduced to store the probe value which may overflow during long executions, and the probe amount is reduced base on the integration of PAP with an existing profiling technique. Besides, this paper also discusses how to use PAP to profile executed sequences on the method level. As shown in the results of the case study and experiments, PAP is effective and efficient in profiling cyclic paths.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1016"]}

Most current methods have not paid enough attention to the user specific trust requirement for composite services. However, Trust is an important metric to judge whether a composite service can behave as user expected. In this work, firstly, a multifactor concept of trust of composite service is defined based on the trust of component services, interface compatibility and optimal binding schemes. Secondly, a trustworthy Web service composition and optimization framework called TWSCO is proposed to guarantee the trust of composite service and efficiency of Web service composition process. The interface-matching problem among component services and user preference are considered in TWSCO, which firstly uses component services filter to remove untrusted component\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1016"]}
{"title": "Exploring the impact of code smells on fine-grained structural change-proneness\n", "abstract": " Code smells are used to describe the bad structures in the source code, which could hinder software maintainability, understandability and changeability. Nowadays, scholars mainly focus on the impact of smell on textual change-proneness. However, in comparison to textual changes, structural changes could better reveal the change nature. In practice, not all code change types are equally important in terms of change risk severity levels, and software developers are more interested in particular changes relevant to their current tasks. Therefore, we investigate the relationship between smells and fine-grained structural change-proneness to solve these issues. Our experiment was conducted on 11 typical open source projects. We first employed Fishers exact test and Mann\u2013Whitney test to explore whether smelly files (affected by at least one smell type) had higher structural change-proneness than other files, and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1016"]}

{"title": "Directory-Based Dependency Processing for Software Architecture Recovery\n", "abstract": " Directory structure contains a wealth of software design information; it is used to transfer thoughts of architects to developers. Information extracted from directory paths should play an important role in architecture recovery techniques, but it has been proved that modules or components directly represented by directories are not accurate due to the inconsistency between stages of development and design. To make better use of information extracted from directories, we propose a directory-based dependency processing technique to utilize the information of directories in the process of structure-based architecture recovery. The technique groups the selected inter-coupling files and intra-coupling files in the same directory into a submodule and generates submodule-level dependency graph based on file-level dependency graph. We apply both manual and automatic architecture recovery techniques on submodule\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1016"]}

Many researchers have studied the relationships between CC and LOC, between CC and basic testing paths, and between CC and code maintainability etc. However, few researchers studied how software evolution affects CC. In this paper, we propose a methodology based on source code change analysis and develop a supporting tool, called CCEvaluator, to evaluate CC variation during software evolution. By empirical studies on six pieces of typical open source projects, a series of interesting findings including six commonness and five differences have been obtained. To explain why these commonness and differences are produced during software evolution, code change information among successive versions are captured and used in this paper.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1016"]}

CPS are mainly applied in some critical domains, so it is very essential to ensure the correctness of CPS. As a very important method for verifying system correctness, formal verification has been successfully applied in the verification of CPS; however, the high theoretical level of formal modeling techniques in formal verification and the lack of generality of formal models make it difficult to integrate formal verification with enterprise standard system development process. In this paper, we model CPS by HybridUML, an extension of UML which is now the de facto standard modeling language in system development practice, and then transform HybridUML model into the input language of theorem prover KeYmaera-QHP(Quantified Hybrid Program), and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1016"]}
{"title": "Incremental verification of evolving BPEL-based web composite service\n", "abstract": " Web composite services inevitably evolve to meet various requirements. However, most researchers only considered the verification of single versions. Simply reapplying the original verification techniques on subsequent versions of composite service as they evolve is costly, especially for large-scale services. In this paper, a new approach called Incremental verification (ICV) is proposed to incrementally verify the non-conflict property of evolved versions of Business process execution language (BPEL) based composite service. With a kind of eXtensible control flow graph (XCFG) as the formal model to describe the BPEL process, ICV compares the new version with the old one to identify the process changes which bring threats to the non-conflict property. Then it concentrates on the changed elements to perform the verification, which reduces the cost by skipping the analysis of unchanged elements.

{"title": "Profiling selected paths with loops\n", "abstract": " Path profiling records the frequency of each path in an executed program. To accomplish profiling, probes are instrumented in the program and executed as the program runs. So, the number of probes has a significant impact on the efficiency of a profiling technique. By profiling only the interesting paths, existing techniques try to improve the profiling efficiency by reducing the number of probes and optimize path encodings for efficient storage. However, they lack accuracy, waste time on running uninteresting paths, and can mainly deal with acyclic paths. In this article, a novel technique called Profiling Selected Paths (PSP) is introduced to profile selected paths, which enables custom selection for both acyclic and cyclic paths and increases the execution efficiency by early termination on uninteresting paths. Theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation indicate that PSP performs better than existing\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1016"]}

This paper focuses on guaranteeing the interaction correctness between cloud application and users. In general, the main methods to do this are testing and verification. But in the cloud environment, testing is costly and the operation is extremely difficult, while the verification can avoid these shortcomings, and be suitable for cloud application. In this paper, we use SoaML (Service-Oriented Architecture Modeling Language) to model cloud application, apply hierarchical automaton to formalize ServiceInterface of SoaML, and translate SeviceInterface into PROMELA according to the semantics of automaton; Meanwhile, describe the ServiceContract of SoaML using linear temporal logic (LTL).

Users are usually interested in their meaningful groupings of entities and properties. Formal concept analysis (FCA) is a powerful technique to deal with the binary relation between entities and entity properties to infer a hierarchy of concepts. The output of FCA is the concept lattice, where higher-level concepts represent general properties shared by many entities, while lower-level concepts represent the entity-specific properties.

In this paper, first, an extended SOA model is proposed for improving the reliability of web services. Then, a reliability model is presented to evaluate the reliability of web services based on the birth-death process.

One phase was YVO4, which is tetragonal according with the JCPDS-Card (17-0341); the other phase was YTaO4, which is according with the JCPDS-Card (72-2018). The spectrum property of the sample was studied under the VUV. The effects of Ta doped on the luminescent properties of sample were investigated and it was found that some Ta doped could highlight the absorption of matrix in VUV region.

This paper studies an approach to reflection realization from the point of view of model layers and language and presents a prototype framework incarnating reflection ideas. Reflection can be obtained from modeling languages that can change model elements structure and behavior with changed condition. Existing meta models stress specification of structure of languages and care little about their behavior.

{"title": "SRM: a staged reliability model for Web service\n", "abstract": " SOA (Service-oriented Architecture) is becoming the major architecture for building complex Web service systems. In SOA, the lifecycle of Web services consists of four stages: service publication, service discovery, service binding and service execution. Faults may occur in any stage and cause a failure of service. The reliability of services depends on not only the faults of the remote services itself, but also the faults that may occur in any SOA stage. Designing an effective and accurate reliability prediction model for Web services has become an important and necessary task. This study first proposes a staged reliability model for atomic services, which structures the reliability estimation based on the faults that may occur at each stage. Then, the reliability of composite services or service systems can be estimated based on this staged model.

{"title": "Data depedency based trust evaluation for bpel processes\n", "abstract": " Composite services implement value-added functionality by composing service components with smaller granularity. Trust is an important criterion to judge whether a composite service can behave as expected. A feasible trust evaluation method for composite services is needed, which can guide service selection for users and the trust-based optimization and evolution for composite services. In this paper, a data dependency based trust evaluation approach for composite services in Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) is proposed. Firstly, we derive define-use pairs of variables to describe data dependency between service components in BPEL processes modeled by extensible BPEL Flow Graph (XBFG), in addition, dependency links including both direct and indirect data dependencies are used to evaluate the trust values of these service components, furthermore, on the basis of BPEL structure and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1016"]}

The model and verification for cyber physical systems are two important and challenge problems because CPS has not only heterogeneous nature but also very complicated structure and relationships among its components. In this paper, a unified framework is proposed to model and verify CPS, where CPS is modeled in forms of HybridUML models, then these HybridUML models are transformed to different operating models of Differential Dynamic Logic (DL), and finally some CPS properties are specified using DDL equations and verified using DDL reasoning rules.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1016"]}

This research intends to provide a unified framework for change analysis, which includes dependencies extraction, change impact analysis, changeability assessment, etc. We expect that our change analysis framework will contribute directly to the improvement of the accuracy of these predictive measures before change implementation, and thus provide more accurate change analysis results for software maintainers\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1016"]}

The Raman spectrum of the implanted SiC displays not only Si\u2014C bonds vibration peaks, but also homonuclear Si\u2014Si and C\u2014C bond vibration peaks. Si\u2014C bond vibration peaks gradually strengthen with increasing temperature. When annealing at 1000\u2103, the peak intensity of Raman spectrum is close to that of virgin specimen. It is found that crystal Si\u2014Si bond vibration peaks do not change when annealing, but amorphous Si\u2014Si bond vibration peaks disappear with increasing annealing temperature. The Relative Raman Intensity (RRI) values decrease with increasing fluence and tend to saturate, but the saturation fluences is different for various anneal temperature.

Based on the Guangdong meteological Bureau of precipitation observations, combined with cumulative probability of precipitation, and usied percentile method, precipitation intensity was divided into six levels. This article analyze the relative trend of rain days and rain intensity and the contribution of rain days and intensity to the general trend of precipitation, and draw the following conclusions, first, in the past 50 years, weak and weaker precipitation days reduced, heave precipitation and heaveier and heavest rainfall days increased. The change in the I district is bigger than II district in Guangdong Province. Second, Change of the rainfall intensity was not obvious. Third, for the Guangdong as a whole, the increase of precipitation is mainly caused by the number of rain days, especially the increasing number in summer. Contribution of intensity change to the increasing precipitation was not big. The contribution of rain days to the precipitation general trend is more than rain intensity. I district, the number of summer heavy rain days increasing may lead to occurrence of landslide and debris flow in the mountain areas and waterlogging on Pearl River Delta. The reduced number of rain days in autumn will make the autumn, winter and spring drought.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1016"]}

Our work has demonstrated that the clustering results could be invalid if we use SA for Ensemble Clustering without a good understanding of the behaviour of cooling functions. Therefore this paper aims to present the findings of how different cooling functions may affect the performance of Ensemble Clustering methods that use SA.

Trust is an important criterion to judge whether a composite service can behave as expected. There is a great need for a flexible trust evaluation method for composite services. In this paper, a data dependency-based trust evaluation approach for composite services is proposed. Firstly, we derive define-use pairs of variables to identify data dependency between service components in BPEL processes modelled by an extensible BPEL flow graph (XBFG); then, dependency links including both direct and indirect data dependencies are used to evaluate the trust of these service components; furthermore, on the basis of BPEL structure and XBFG, reduction rules are proposed to evaluate the global trust of BPEL processes.

{"title": "Software multiple-level change detection based on two-step mpat matching\n", "abstract": " During software evolution, change detection plays an important role in software maintenance. For example, according to the changes, developers need to verify whether the evolved contents are consistent with the evolution plan, and making a regression testing plan. Right now, the text-based method and the AST-based matching method are widely used to detect changes. However, the text-based method cannot identify updating and renaming, so the accuracy of its detecting result is not high enough; the AST-based matching method only reflects the changes between files, so its detecting result is incomplete for understanding software evolution from an overall perspective. In order to solve the above problems, we propose a software multiple-level change detection method based on two-step MPAT (multilevel program analysis tree) matching, which detects changes between two programs from multiple levels to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1016"]}

Due to complex interactions between multi-threads, concurrent programs are often harder to understand and test than single threaded programs. To facilitate understanding and testing of concurrent programs, we developed a new profiling method called TCP (Thread Control Profiling). Outputs of TCP presents frequencies of control dependence, which includes thread creation, thread synchronization, interruption, and so on, of the executed thread. TCP first performs static analysis of detailed concurrency syntax and semantics of Java to construct the profiling graph model TCDG (Thread Control Dependence Graph). TCDG is then used for instrumentation and for generating profiles. We have evaluated TCP using a case study and a few experiments.

{"title": "A multilevel analysis method for architecture erosion\n", "abstract": " During the evolution of software, improper change operations may cause architecture erosion. Architecture erosion creates problems on evolutionary costs, software performance and software quality. Many methods have been proposed to analyze architecture erosion. Architecture depends on the implementation of code, that is, architecture erosion is caused by code. However, few methods analyze the reasons for architecture erosion based on code. Besides, architecture is eroded with software evolution, but most methods do not analyze architecture erosion based on the change of software. In this paper, we propose a multilevel analysis method for architecture erosion. Our method contains three steps. Firstly, we detect the changed pairs based on two architectures by performing a multilevel change detection method. Secondly, we detect whether the corresponding code elements of changed pairs are erosion points by calculating erosion degree. Thirdly, we establish a cost-benefit model of repairing architecture erosion for repairing architecture erosion more effectively with repaired few erosion points. We illustrate our method through an open source project, and the experimental results indicate that our method can detect the erosion points of each level and the cost-benefit model is effectively.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1016"]}
{"title": "Are Smell-Based Metrics Actually Useful in Effort-Aware Structural Change-Proneness Prediction? An Empirical Study\n", "abstract": " Bad code smells (also named as code smells) are symptoms of poor design choices in implementation. Existing increases the likelihood of subsequent changes (i.e., change-proness). However, to the best of our knowledge, no prior studies have leveraged smell-based metrics to predict particular change type (i.e., structural changes). Moreover, when evaluating the effectiveness of smell-based metrics in structural change-proneness prediction, none of existing studies take into account of the effort inspecting those change-prone source code. In this paper, we consider five smell-based metrics for effort-aware structural change-proneness prediction and compare these metrics with a baseline of well-known CK metrics in predicting particular categories of change types. Specifically, we first employ univariate logistic regression to analyze the correlation between each smell-based metric and structural change\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1016"]}

In this paper, we built a new model called two coupled phase oscillators system (CPOS), and found that, under the appropriate initial conditions, it will meet a critical phenomenon in the phase space as the coupling strength increases. We also found the critical state by introducing the Poincar\u00e9 section technique. We established a new formula for the critical coupling strength by analyzing the HS model, and extended this formula to the CPOS. The numerically analytical results show the reason why the measure synchronization of CPOS does not exist.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1016"]}

{"title": "A preference and honesty aware trust model for web services\n", "abstract": " Trust is one of the most critical factors for a service requestor when selecting the best one from a large pool of services. However, existing web service trust models either do not focus on satisfying customer's preference for different quality of service (QoS) attributes, or do not pay enough attention to the impact of malicious ratings on trust evaluation. To address these gaps, a dynamic trust evaluation model considering customer's preference and false ratings is proposed in this paper. The model introduces an approach automatically mining customer's preference from their requirements. The preference is used to determine the weights on each QoS attribute when integrating trust of the multi-dimensional QoS attributes. The local trust of a service for the customer is derived by combining trust of QoS attributes and customer's ratings. Then, the customers are divided into different groups according to their preferences\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1016"]}

Based on the matrix modeling of state transition, this paper analyzed the energy consumption within all states and between the state transitions, and established their energy-consumption models respectively, and then revealed the energy consumption features of node modules. Moreover, considering in event-driven mechanism, this paper established a unified energy-consumption model by defining a clear correlation among the modules of a node, and then tested the reliability and usefulness of this model in the OPNET.

However, the existing researches about data collection based on mobile sink mainly focus on path-constrained mobile sink. Hence, a path-controlled traversal model for mobile sink data collection was constructed, and a data collection algorithm for mobile sink based on optimal-path traveling was proposed. The algorithm discretized the continuous path problem by local Voronoi grid, used the amount of data collected and system energy consumption as performance metric, combined taboo search algorithm to achieve the maximum amount of data collected and the minimum of network energy consumption traversing. Theoretically and experimentally, it is concluded that the proposed algorithm is able to solve the optimal-path traveling of data collection problem using path-controlled mobile sink.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1016"]}

{"title": "Problems and strategies for the marketoreiented collection and disposal of catering wastes in China\u2019s urban areas\n", "abstract": " Urban catering industries in China are producing huge amount of catering wastes every day. Recently, most of cities in China have stipulated that the catering wastes are prohibited for feeding livestocks. Therefore, the management and disposal of the catering wastes have become a social problem. Taking Shanghai as study area, and based on data from both statistic yearbooks and field survey, this paper systematically discusses the problems existed in the process of catering wastes claim, rubbish fee collection, reduction of rubish sources, and disposal ways. The resolts show that there is about (20 000) restaurants in study area and only (5 958) are on the list of government administration. The recorded total amount of catering wastes discharge is 335.86 tons per day while the surveyed amount of catering wastes is about (1 100) tons per day. About 70 percent of restaurants did not declare their catering wastes to the municipal administration. A small money was collected from the restaurants for their catering wastes treatment, and about 50 percent of restaurants treated the catering wastes as ordinary solid waste so as to elude relevant charges. As a result, the total charge for rubbish treatment do not cover actual cost of wastes treatment. About 75 percent restaurants leave the catering wastes treated by enterprises subordinated with the municipal administration, while only 10 percent deal the catering wastes in open market. The restaurants mainly depend on the municipal administration to treat the catering wastes. In response to above problems, the authors propose some preliminary countermeasures for the collection and disposal of catering\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1016"]}

{"title": "Job-shop Scheduling with Multi-objectives Based on Genetic Algorithms\n", "abstract": " The technology of production planning and scheduling is one of the critical technologies that decide whether the automated manufacturing systems can get the expected economy. Job shop scheduling belongs to the special class of NP-hard problems. Most of the algorithms used to optimize this class of problems have an exponential time; that is, the computation time increases exponentially with problem size. In scheduling study, makespan is often considered as the main objective. In this paper, makespan, the due date request of the key jobs, the availability of the key machine, the average wait-time of the jobs, and the similarities between the jobs and so on are taken into accotmt based on the application of mechanical engineering. The job shop scheduling problem with multi-objectives is analyzed and studied by using genetic algorithms based on the mechanics of genetics and natural selection. In this research, the tactics of the coding and decoding and the design of the genetic operators, along with the description of the mathematic model of the multi-objective functions,are presented. Finally an illu-strative example is given to testify the validity of this algorithm.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1016"]}

It computes the slice, which is a part of program and contains all the statements related to the given slicing criterion. The more accurate a slicing technique could be, the smaller the slice is.ObjectiveThis paper aims to improve the current slicing accuracy for object-oriented programs. The slicing accuracy is mainly related to three factors, the dependency graph (which extracts the inner relationships of source code), the slicing criterion (which determines the slicing requirement), and the slicing algorithm (which computes the slice for the criterion from the dependency graph).MethodOur method consists of three parts. First, we present a Sub-Statement Level Dependence Graph (SSLDG), which computes finer-grained dependences for object-oriented programs than mostly-used statement level graph.

The numerous toolkits result in a problem on NLP library selection. The selection of NLP library in current work commonly misses some objective reasons, which may pose threats to validity. And it is also not clear that whether the existing guideline on selection still works for the latest versions. In this work, we propose a solution for NLP library selection when the effectiveness is unknown. We use the NLP libraries together in a combined method. Our combined method can utilize the strengths of different NLP libraries to obtain accurate results. The combination is conducted through two steps, i.e., document-level selection of NLP library and sentence-level overwriting. In document-level selection of primary library, the results are obtained from the library that has the highest overall accuracy.

{"title": "Distinguishing Similar Design Pattern Instances through Temporal Behavior Analysis\n", "abstract": " Design patterns (DPs) encapsulate valuable design knowledge of object-oriented systems. Detecting DP instances helps to reveal the underlying rationale, thus facilitates the maintenance of legacy code. Resulting from the internal similarity of DPs, implementation variants, and missing roles, approaches based on static analysis are unable to well identify structurally similar instances. Existing approaches further employ dynamic techniques to test the runtime behaviors of candidate instances. Automatically verifying the runtime behaviors of DP instances is a challenging task in multiple aspects. This paper presents an approach to improve the verification process of existing approaches. To exercise the runtime behaviors of DP instances in cases that test cases of legacy systems are often unavailable, we propose a markup language, TSML (Test Script Markup Language), to direct the generation of test cases by\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1016"]}

Sex is a strongly taboo area and is normally a forbidden topic in the public domain; therefore, careful and meticulous consideration before speaking of it seems to be a must. Paradoxically and interestingly, language users euphemize or dysphemize sexual topics in social interactions, and it is thus both significant and worthwhile to explore how and why people use sexrelated euphemisms and dysphemisms.This is what Sex in Language wants to do.

In this study, the sorption kinetic, thermodynamics and effect parameters on partition behavior of perfluoroctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) at low initial concentration were investigated. The results showed that the equilibrium time was achieved within 48h. The sorption isotherms of PFOS and PFOA could be described by Freundlich equation. The surface area and composition of sediment particles as well as solution pH values and ion strength strongly influenced the sorption of PFOA and PFOS. Both PFOA and PFOS exhibited higher sorption capacity on the sediments with high organic matter content. These results indicated that multiple driving forces such as hydrophobic exclusion, specific chemical interaction and electrostatic attraction contributed to the nonlinear sorption of PFOA and PFOS on sediments.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1016"]}

Three metrics are introduced to evaluate the impact of these evolution operations.

Existing studies already ensure accurate results of CCE, but they use stack to store the encoding when recursive calls happen. This may cost much for cyclic call graphs with deep recursive calls. This paper presents a novel approach (called RCCE) to address this problem. With a modified strategy for encoding, it requires less frequent access of the stack and gives more succinct representation of contexts on deep recursion. Experimental results show that compared to Precise Calling Context Encoding, RCCE is more practical and efficient on calling contexts with recursions.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1016"]}

{"title": "A Model-Based Framework to Support Complexity Analysis Service for Regression Testing of Component-Based Software\n", "abstract": " Today, software components have been widely used in software construction to reduce the cost of project and speed up software development cycle. During software maintenance, various software change approaches can be used to realize specific change requirements of software components. Different change approaches lead to diverse regression testing complexity. Such complexity is one of the key contributors to the cost and effectiveness of software maintenance. However, there is a lack of research work addressing regression testing complexity analysis service for software components. This paper proposes a framework to measure and analyze regression testing complexity based on a set of change and impact complexity models and metrics.

All the heterogeneous catalysts exhibited high selectivity for sulfoxide (over 99.0%) in the selective oxidation of thioanisole under mild reaction conditions. The vanadium nanospheres exhibited higher turnover frequency than the counterparts of SBA-15 and SBA-16, which is attributed to the fact that the small nanoparticles would facilitate the diffusion of the products and reactants, as well as the exposure of catalytic active sites. The catalysts could be reused several times with little loss of their activity and selectivity.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1016"]}

The strength and the cavitation mass loss of the steel were measured. The morphology and microstructure of the steel after cavitation erosion were observed by SEM and TEM. The results reveal that, compared with 304 ss, cobalt-containing steel has higher strength, and longer incubation time to cavitation erosion, which indicates an improved cavitation erosion resistance for the Co-containing steel. A morphology with equilateral triangles was observed on the Cr-Co-Ni-Mn steel surface after cavitation erosion by SEM, epsilon-martensite induced by the deformation of cavitation corrosion layer was observed by TEM and alpha-martensite was also found. This kind of deformed microstructures can absorb strain energy and thus leads to an improved cavitation erosion resistance.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1016"]}

It aims to avoid the biases of individual clustering algorithms. However, it is still a challenge to develop an efficient and robust method for Ensemble Clustering. Based on an existing ensemble clustering method, Consensus Clustering (CC), this paper introduces an advanced Consensus Clustering algorithm called Multi-Optimisation Consensus Clustering (MOCC), which utilises an optimised Agreement Separation criterion and a Multi-Optimisation framework to improve the performance of CC. Fifteen different data sets are used for evaluating the performance of MOCC.

It is found that a well-defined peak appears at the formal potential of 1.075 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) controlled by the diffusion process. And another adsorption-controlled peak appears gradually on the ITO electrode with increasing progressively voltammetric sweeping numbers. DHP in the absence or presence of SWCNTs can enhance the diffusion coefficient of [Ru (bpy) 2tatp] 2+ in buffer solution and prompt its electrochemical assembly on the ITO electrode in the DHP concentration range from 0.05 to 0.22 mmol/L. However, SWCNTs dispersed with DHP can weaken the DHP-enhanced assembly. In addition, the assembled mechanism of [Ru (bpy) 2tatp] 3+/2+ mediated by DHP and SWCNTs on the ITO surface is discussed in detail.

Univariate analysis showed that Child-Pugh classification, indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min (ICGR15), platelet count, tumor size, number of tumors, and radical resection were significant prognostic factors. Cox multivariate proportional hazard model indicated that Child-Pugh classification and radical resection were independent prognostic factors. CONCLUSION: Correct preoperative assessment of liver function reserve can increase the safety of radical surgical resection for HCC patients with severe cirrhosis.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1016"]}

{"title": "A formal software development approach based on COOZ and refinement calculus\n", "abstract": " Including refinement calculus into COOZ complements its disadvantage during design and implementation. The separation between design and implementation for construct and notation is removed as well. Then the software can be developed smoothly in the same frame. There is no corresponding object oriented construct in existing refinement calculus. The combination of COOZ and refinement calculus can build an object oriented frame in which the specification in COOZ is refined stepwise to code by calculus. Two development models are discussed which are based mainly on COOZ and the refinement calculus respectively. The first model is first discussed and then the data refinement and operation refinement is analyzed by example. The two methods of operation refinement for OO formal specification are outlined, and the frame transition rule from COOZ to C++ is examined.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1016"]}
