Compliance to the GDPR is a problem for organizations, it imposes strict constraints whenever they deal with personal data and, in case of infringement, it specifies severe consequences such as legal and monetary penalties. Such organizations frequently are complex systems, where personal data is processed by humans and technical services. Therefore, it becomes fundamental to consider privacy from the social perspective when designing such system, i.e., when relations between different components are specified. This is, indeed, also specified in the GDPR, which encourages to apply privacy-by-design principles.

{"title": "Modeling and reasoning about contextual requirements: Goal-based framework\n", "abstract": " Most of requirements engineering (RE) research ignores, or presumes a uniform nature of, the context in which the system operates. This assumption is no longer valid in emerging computing paradigms, such as Ambient, Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing, where it is essential to monitor and adapt to an inherently varying context. There is a strong relationship between  requirements and context.  Context  might be considered to determine the set of requirements relevant to a system, to derive the alternatives the system can adopt to reach these requirements, and to assess the quality of each alternative. A RE framework that explicitly captures and analyzes this relationship is still missing.  Before influencing the behavior of  software, context influences the behavior of users. It influences users' goals and their choices to reach these goals. Capturing this latest influence is essential for  a software developed to meet users' requirements in different contexts. In this thesis, we propose a goal-oriented RE modeling and reasoning framework for systems operating in  and reflecting varying contexts. To this end, we develop a conceptual modeling language, the \\emph{contextual goal model}, that captures the relationship between context and requirements at the goal level and provides constructs to analyze context. We develop a set of reasoning mechanisms to analyze contextual goal models addressing various problems: the consistency of context, the derivation of requirements in different contexts, the detection of conflicts between requirements happening as a consequence of changes in the context they lead to, and the derivation of a set of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["1449"]}

Implicit Culture is the relation between a set and a group of agents such that the elements of the set behave according to the culture of the group.

Supporting Implicit Culture phenomena can be useful for both artificial and human agents that is the kind of agents (miners and learners) that are involved in the data mining process. The architecture of a SICS relies on the solution of two learning problems:(i) induction of a cultural theory on the behavior patterns of the group and (ii) prediction of a scene such that the elements of the set will behave consistently with the cultural theory. An implemented SICS solves the latter problem exploiting a generalization of a Collaborative Filtering algorithm.

In spite of that, most requirements engineering (RE) research ignores, or presumes a uniform nature of, the context where the system operates. A RE framework specialized for systems reflecting their context is still missing. Before influencing the behavior of software, context influences the behavior of users. It influences user's goals and their choices to reach these goals. Capturing this latest influence is an essential step towards software developed to meet user's requirements in different contexts. In this report, we develop a goal-based RE modeling framework for systems operating in and reflecting varying contexts.

It becomes more significant if the software system is operated in a critical system (e.g., air traffic control, nuclear plant). It is because in this domain the software system is expected to be always dependable all the time of its operation. The system is dependable when all its risks are suppressed until acceptable level. Therefore, in such setting analysts must carefully analyze the socio-technical system (i.e., organizational-setting and software systems) and understand how uncertain events may affect the systems. By means of the Tropos Goal-Risk, we model the socio-technical system including its risks. Essentially, the framework consists of goal, event, and treatment modeling. The goal layer represents what the stakeholders' interests are and how to achieve them. The event layer depicts how uncertain events occur and impact the goals of stakeholders.

{"title": "From Early Requirements to Late Requirements: A goal-based approach\n", "abstract": " At present, the software engineering community places emphasis on the relevance of understanding the organizational context before starting the development of an information system. In this context, several research works focus on proposing mechanisms to generate information systems from early requirements specifications in an agent-based approach. However, only a few research works offer a guided process for carrying out the equivalence between the organizational and requirements models. In this paper, a methodological approach for deriving the software system functionality from organizational models is presented. In the proposed method, the organizational goals are the basis for determining the relevant plans to be automated with a software system. A pattern language is also used to systematically carry out the equivalence between the organizational and late requirements models. The Tropos Framework (which is one of the most well-founded, agent-oriented methodologies) is used to represent the organizational environment. By proposing rules to perform the model transformation process, we go a step further in the process of including organizational modeling as a key piece in the software production process", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1449"]}

In this paper, we propose a goal-based approach to model and analyze contextual requirements. We adopt Tropos goal modeling framework where we introduce contextual variation points and provide a set of constructs to hierarchically analyze contexts.

Most of these scholars have attempted to put together two major elements: the need for people to move from a place to another, and the resources used to accomplish this action. Based on the use of location and available car seats, Car sharing systems allowed a substantial number of people to share car rides. These systems would, among other advantages, rationalize energy consumption, save money, and decrease traffic jams and human stress, and eventually make a significant improvement in human life. This paper proposes the initial phase of Smart Ride Seeker (SRS), which is a Car Pooling-like technique for distributing resources among a community that shares the same goals. This SRS technique will be developed through a mobile-based application that allows the mapping of ride seekers\u2019 locations along with the locations of available cars on a graphical interface/map, giving the possibility to calculate the fastest and simplest path for both the ride giver and seeker to meet and fulfill their demand.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1449"]}

This introduces at design time the need of considering humans as part of the system and consequently dependability becomes a critical issue to take into consideration during the development of the system. Traditionally, dependability is measured in terms of availability, reliability, and integrity of the system. However, in this new scenario dependability of a software system has to be closely related with the organizational-setting where the system will operate. In this paper, we briefly introduce a framework, based on Tropos methodology, to model/analyse risk and assess the dependability of a system in a particular organizational-setting.

In such a setting, privacy has emerged as a key concern since companies often neglect or even misuse personal data. In response to multiple massive breaches of personal data, governments around the world have enacted laws and regulations for privacy protection. These laws dictate privacy requirements for any system that acquires and manages personal data. Unfortunately, these requirements are often incomplete and/or inaccurate as many RE practitioners are insufficiently versed with privacy requirements and how are they different from other requirements, such as security.

Tracing and integrating security requirements throughout the development process is a key challenge in security engineering. In socio-technical systems, security requirements for the organizational and technical aspects of a system are currently dealt with separately, giving rise to substantial misconceptions and errors. In this paper, we present a model-based security engineering framework for supporting the system design on the organizational and technical level. The key idea is to allow the involved experts to specify security requirements in the languages they are familiar with: business analysts use BPMN for procedural system descriptions; system developers use UML to design and implement the system architecture. Security requirements are captured via the language extensions SecBPMN2 and UMLsec. We provide a model transformation to bridge the conceptual gap between SecBPMN2 and UMLsec. Using UMLsec policies, various security properties of the resulting architecture can be verified.

Given a group of autonomous agents acting in an environment it should be useful to exploit information about their actions in order to improve the single agent's knowledge and behavior, and guarantee the realization of the requirements. In this paper, we introduce the concept of implicit culture and propose a general architecture for Systems for Implicit Culture Support (SICS).

{"title": "Distributed knowledge elicitation through the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence: a simulation study\n", "abstract": " This paper reports the results of an experiment carried on MASSIM, a specific multi-agent simulation testbed. There are two files, one containing true propositions and the other containing their correspective negations. Five agents in turn access one of these files. Each agent has a \u201ccapacity\u201d that will be used as the frequency with which the agent accesses the file with the correct knowledge. Agents randomly exchange information with the others. Since they have limited degrees of capacity, their knowledge bases quickly become inconsistent. Each agent is equipped with the same belief revision mechanism to detect and solve these contradictions. This embodies the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence to evaluate the credibility of the various pieces of information and estimate the reliability of the other agents. In this way, the agents learn from the others and about the others\u2019 trustworthiness and capability. We call this global process \u201cDistributed Knowledge Elicitation\u201d. The purpose of the experiments was that of evaluating on a statistical basis, the emergent global performances of the local belief revision mechanism. This Distributed Knowledge Elicitation increases the amount of information available at each agent and flattens their degree of correctness.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1449"]}
{"title": "From Secure Business Process Modeling to Design-Level Security Verification (long version)\n", "abstract": " Tracing and integrating security requirements throughout the development process is a key challenge in security engineering. In socio-technical systems, security requirements for the organizational and technical aspects of a system are currently dealt with separately, giving rise to substantial misconceptions and errors. In this paper, we present a model-based security engineering framework for supporting the system design on the organizational and technical level. The key idea is to allow the involved experts to specify security requirements in the languages they are familiar with: business analysts use BPMN for procedural system descriptions; system developers use UML to design and implement the system architecture. Security requirements are captured via the language extensions SecBPMN2 and UMLsec. We provide a model transformation to bridge the conceptual gap between SecBPMN2 and UMLsec. Using UMLsec policies, various security properties of the resulting architecture can be verified. In a case study featuring an air traffic management system, we show how our framework can be practically applied.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1449"]}
{"title": "An Ontology for Privacy Requirements via a Systematic Literature Review\n", "abstract": " Privacy has emerged as a key concern for business and social computing as security breaches have compromised personal data for millions. Despite this, much of existing work on privacy requirements deal with them as a special case of security requirements, thereby missing essential traits of such requirements. In this context, wrong design decisions may be made due to an insufficient understanding of privacy. The main contribution of this paper is an ontology for privacy requirements that subsumes whatever proposals exist in the literature. The ontology was obtained through a systematic literature review concerning the literature on privacy, conducted in two phases, and followed by a consolidation phase where similar concepts were combined. The proposed ontology has been developed to be used by software engineers when dealing with privacy requirements, and since it is based on a systematic literature\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1449"]}
{"title": "Applying Acceptance Requirements to Requirements Modeling Tools via Gamification: A Case Study on Privacy and Security\n", "abstract": " Requirements elicitation, analysis and modeling are critical activities for software success. However, software systems are increasingly complex, harder to develop due to an ever-growing number of requirements from numerous and heterogeneous stakeholders, concerning dozens of requirements types, from functional to qualitative, including adaptation, security and privacy, ethical, acceptance and more. In such settings, requirements engineers need support concerning such increasingly complex activities, and Requirements Engineering (RE) modeling tools have been developed for this. However, such tools, although effective, are complex, time-consuming and requiring steep learning curves. The consequent lack of acceptance and abandonment in using such tools, by engineers, paves the way to the application of RE techniques in a more error-prone, low-quality way, increasing the possibility to have failures\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1449"]}

The mission of Trentino Riscossioni SpA 1, a company owned by the Autonomous Province of Trento, is to promote simplification processes and harmonize the activity of more than 250 public entities in the province, creating policies for fair taxation and for operating costs reduction. The need for consistent and contextual use of the heterogeneous information sources between its offices, the municipalities and the other public bodies is a fundamental requirement for the implementation of an accurate and balanced taxation system. In this paper we want to focus on the possibility offered by matching technology [1] to enhance the in the present day data integration architecture and increase its flexibility in managing hundreds of new data sources with reduced software development for each new sources added. Besides, even if the data integration has been extensively studied in the database community, according to some recent research works [2, 3, 4, 5], the issue to improve the automatic schema matching in a data integration scenario for the Tax and Revenue market is a relative new ground of application. The contribution of this paper includes a specific scenario focusing several of the basic requirements that have to be considered in order to build a data integration system capable to support dynamically hundreds of data sources.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1449"]}

However, the negotiation protocols intelligent agents use are hardly considering several of the requirements evolved after the increasing reliance on mobility. In this paper we present a new negotiation protocol that avoids the use of mediating agents and applies a voting-like mechanism to handle service requests of nomadic users in wireless networks. We examine our approach in a scenario where it is essential for a multi-agent system to establish a chain of mutually attracted agents seeking to fulfill different bartering desires.

{"title": "Applying Tropos to Socio-Technical System Design and Runtime Configuration\n", "abstract": " Recent trends in Software Engineering have introduced the importance of reconsidering the traditional idea of software design as a socio-tecnical problem, where human agents are integral part of the system along with hardware and software components. Design and runtime support for Socio-Technical Systems (STSs) requires appropriate modeling techniques and non-traditional infrastructures. Agent-oriented software methodologies are natural solutions to the development of STSs, both humans and technical components are conceptualized and analyzed as part of the same system. In this paper, we illustrate a number of Tropos features that we believe fundamental to support the development and runtime recon\ufb01guration of STSs. Particularly, we focus on two critical design issues: risk analysis and location variability. We show how they are integrated and used into a planning-based approach to support the designer in evaluating and choosing the best design alternative. Finally, we present a generic framework to develop self-recon\ufb01gurable STSs.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1449"]}

Literature proposes many approaches to deal with uncertainty, mainly in the area of risk management and safety&reliability engineering. However, what is still missing is a clear understanding of the nature of uncertainty that very often has produced mistreatments in the design. In this paper, we propose a conceptual model for uncertainty that can be used to deal with systems\u2019 qualities such as security and dependability.
