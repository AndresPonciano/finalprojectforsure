Platform-Based designs and communication synthesis are important components of the paradigm shift we advocate. Communication synthesis is a fundamental productivity tool in a design methodology where reuse is enforced. Communication design in a reuse methodology starts with a set of functional requirements and constraints on the interaction among components and then proceeds to build protocols, topology, and physical implementations that satisfy requirements and constraints while optimizing appropriate measures of efficiency of the implementation. Maximum efficiency can be reached when the communication specifications are entered at high levels of abstraction and the design process optimizes the implementation from this specification.

In this paper we give a formal definition of the syntax and semantics for the proposed interchange format. In doing so, we clearly separate the structure of a hybrid system from the semantics attached to it. The semantics can be considered an \u201cabstract semantics\u201d in the sense that it can be refined to yield the model of computation, or \u201cconcrete semantics\u201d, which, in turn, is associated to the existing languages that are used to specify hybrid systems.

A mission specification is divided into three parts: a temporal logic formula defined over state propositions, the choice of the primary cost, and constraints on the remaining secondary costs. The planning problem is formulated as finding the optimal policy of a Constrained Markov Decision Process with above mission specification.

Based on the profiling measures, we build various alternative embedded platforms by combining different embedded processors, memory modules and network interfaces. In particular, we consider the choice of two possible network technologies: ARCnet and Ethernet. After deriving an analytical model of the network costs, we use it to complete an exploration of the design space as we scale the number of video cameras in an hypothetical building. We compare our results with those obtained for two real buildings of different characteristics. We conclude discussing the results of our case study in the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["700"]}
