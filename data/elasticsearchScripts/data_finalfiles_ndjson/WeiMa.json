{"title": "An equivalence of fully connected layer and convolutional layer\n", "abstract": " This article demonstrates that convolutional operation can be converted to matrix multiplication, which has the same calculation way with fully connected layer. The article is helpful for the beginners of the neural network to understand how fully connected layer and the convolutional layer work in the backend. To be concise and to make the article more readable, we only consider the linear case. It can be extended to the non-linear case easily through plugging in a non-linear encapsulation to the values like this  denoted as .", "num_citations": "26\n", "authors": ["2045"]}
{"title": "CompNet: Neural networks growing via the compact network morphism\n", "abstract": " It is often the case that the performance of a neural network can be improved by adding layers. In real-world practices, we always train dozens of neural network architectures in parallel which is a wasteful process. We explored $CompNet$, in which case we morph a well-trained neural network to a deeper one where network function can be preserved and the added layer is compact. The work of the paper makes two contributions: a). The modified network can converge fast and keep the same functionality so that we do not need to train from scratch again; b). The layer size of the added layer in the neural network is controlled by removing the redundant parameters with sparse optimization. This differs from previous network morphism approaches which tend to add more neurons or channels beyond the actual requirements and result in redundance of the model. The method is illustrated using several neural network structures on different data sets including MNIST and CIFAR10.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["2045"]}
