Yet software organizations struggle with determining the adequacy of their measurement practices, and they usually seek guidance to improve them. Existing methods for assessing measurement capability mainly use wellestablished capability models like CMMI or SPICE as a foundation. Organizations that follow dynamic approaches like agile methodologies hesitate to implement these process-centric models. The authors are proposing a method that focuses on individual measures instead of the measurement process for assessing the measurement capability of software organizations.

Starting from its introduction with the original Function Point Analysis method in 1979, functional size has been a favored input to estimation and productivity models. As a result of the search for solutions to emerging measurement needs and the advancements in the discipline of software measurement, FSM concepts have been redefined and measurement methods have matured with notable contributions from the ISO standardization process.

A linear relation between the parameters of the hyperboloidal mirror is determined as well. Conducted research and findings are instrumental for calibration of such imaging systems. The resolution problem due to the up-sampling while transferring the pixels from ODI to the panoramic image is defined. Enhancing effects of standard interpolation methods on the panoramic images are analyzed and edge detection-based techniques are developed for improving the resolutional quality of the panoramic images.

Firstly, an exploratory case study is performed by using one of the surveys in order to determine the expected features of an agile maturity self-assessment survey. Then, a comprehensive case study is conducted to measure the sufficiency of the mostly referenced agile maturity self-assessment surveys according to the determined features.

The integrated software design environment consists of a number of tools integrated for capturing, presenting and exercising software design information. A design representation language which provides high level constructs for encoding design knowledge is introduced into the environment as a uniform basis for integrating different phases of the development process. This paper includes a detailed analysis of the structure of the software design environment and its language as well as its prototype that has been built. A design example is also\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1355"]}
{"title": "An Assessment of BIM-CAREM Against the Selected BIM Capability Assessment Models\n", "abstract": " Although various BIM capability and maturity models have been developed to meet different BIM capability/maturity assessment purposes, there has not been a model which is broadly used and commonly accepeted in the literature. A Reference Model for BIM Capability Assessment (BIM-CAREM) was developed based on the meta-model of ISO/IEC 33000 to be used for assessing BIM capability levels of AEC/FM processes. This paper aims to compare the components of BIM-CAREM with the assessment questions of the identified models from the literature. Moreover, data collected from a previously performed case study was used to carry out self-assessments by using these models. Then, these assessment results were compared with the findings gathered from assessments performed with BIM-CAREM. The comparison indicated that, BIM-CAREM has more detailed and specified questions for assessing\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1355"]}
{"title": "Measuring change in software projects through an earned value lens\n", "abstract": " Earned Value Management (EVM) is a common performance management tool for project management. EVM enables depicting the project progress in terms of scope, cost and schedule and provides future predictions based on trends and patterns. Even though EVM is widely used in various disciplines like manufacturing and construction, it is not common in software industry. One reason for this underutilization is the mismatch of an inherent nature of the software projects and the traditional EVM. Traditional EVM ignores change effort but it is predominant in software projects. We have developed cEVM as an extension to the traditional EVM to incorporate change and subsequent rework and evolution costs to measure earned value in software development projects more accurately. In this study, we focus on two applications of cEVM we performed to explore the usability of cEVM and to compare cEVM with\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1355"]}

{"title": "The Effect of Highlighting Error Categories in FSM Training on the Accuracy of Measurement\n", "abstract": " As various software management activities including cost estimation and project control are conducted based on the software size measurement, achieving high accuracy in functional size measurement (FSM) is critical. Several studies examined the relation between FSM training and improvement in the accuracy of FSM. However, those studies propose comprehensive frameworks and approaches that require fundamental changes in the training content. In this study, we analyzed the effect of highlighting error categories during training by extracting the errors throughout four years. We showed that, highlighting the frequent error categories during the same training period without a fundamental change in the content would significantly decrease the error rate. The results of the research we conducted are promising about the improvement of measurement accuracy.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1355"]}

The organizations prefer to use one of the modeling methods and notations according to its features like tool support, size of user base, ease of use. On the other hand, prevalent methods (formalisms) to model these processes change over time. Furthermore, some modeling tools and/or methods might be pulled out of the market completely. In order to handle these kinds of changes easily, migration methods has to be defined. In this work, model transformation is proposed as a method to migrate from eEPC to S-BPM. Direct mapping rules are defined to transform models and the application of these rules is demonstrated by on a real world case study.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1355"]}
