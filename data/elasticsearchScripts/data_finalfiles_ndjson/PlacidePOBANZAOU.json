Considering the levels of IT investment and adoption in primary care medical practices, a deeper understanding is needed of the factors leading to greater performance outcomes from EMR systems in primary care. To address this issue, we developed and tested a research model centered on the concept of Extended EMR Use. An online survey was conducted of 331 family physicians in Canadian private medical practices to empirically test seven research hypotheses using a component-based structural equation modeling approach. Five hypotheses were partially or fully supported by our data. Family physicians in our sample used 67% of the clinical and 41% of the communicational functionalities available in their EMR systems, compared to 90% of the administrative features. As expected, extended use was associated with significant improvements in perceived performance benefits. Interestingly, the benefits derived from system use were mainly tied to the clinical support provided by an EMR system. The extent to which physicians were using their EMR systems was influenced by two system design characteristics: functional coverage and ease of use. The more functionalities that are available in an EMR system and the easier they are to use, the greater the potential for exploration, assimilation and appropriation by family physicians. Our study has contributed to the extant literature by proposing a new concept: Extended EMR Use.

Using data from 616 manufacturing SMEs, and considering a wide range of various AMT (20 different types of AMT grouped into 5 categories), we derived three AMT assimilation patterns through a cluster analysis procedure combining hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering algorithms. The analysis of the relationship between AMT assimilation patterns and product innovation performance shows a rather unexpected picture: in spite of the existence of clearly distinct patterns of AMT assimilation, we find no significant relationship between any pattern and product innovation performance. Instead, we find the organizational and environmental context of SMEs to be more determinant for product innovation performance than any of the AMT assimilation patterns.

However, our empirical knowledge of these configurations and their associated performance implications is very limited because they have mostly been studied in isolation.Objective: This study aims to pursue 3 objectives:(1) characterize general practitioners (GPs) by uncovering the typical profiles of combinations of 4 major CIS capabilities,(2) identify physician and practice characteristics that predict cluster membership, and (3) assess the variation in the levels of performance associated with each configuration.Methods: We used data from a survey of GPs conducted throughout the European Union (N= 5793). First, 4 factors, that is, EHRs, HIE, PHRs, and Telehealth, were created. Second, a cluster analysis helps uncover clusters of GPs based on the 4 factors. Third, we compared the clusters according to five performance outcomes using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a Tamhane T2 post hoc test. Fourth, univariate and multivariate multinomial logistic regressions were used to identify predictors of the clusters. Finally, with a multivariate multinomial logistic regression, among the clusters, we compared performance in terms of the number of patients treated (3 levels) over the last 2 years.Results: We unveiled 3 clusters of GPs with different levels of CIS capability profiles: strong (1956/5793, 37.36%), medium (2764/5793, 47.71%), and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["870"]}
{"title": "Information Technology Resources and Manufacturing SMEs\u2122 Export Commitment: An Empirical Investigation\n", "abstract": " In the context of economy and business globalization, the capacity of small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) to embrace international markets and seize opportunities beyond the boundaries of their local markets is based on some prerequisites including the acquisition and/or development of specific resources. Drawing on a sample of 202 Canadian manufacturing SMEs, and using the resource-based view as a theoretical lens, this study analyzes the effects of different configurations of the adoption of back-end information technology (IT) resources on the levels of export commitment. The results show that there are four well-separated profiles of SMEs with regard to the adoption levels of back-end IT resources, and that the profiles with higher levels of back-end IT resources adopted are most likely to be exporters, particularly to the near-by international markets. The study contributes to theoretically bridging the gaps in information system literature concerning the role of back-end IT resources in sustaining SMEs\u2019 export commitment and has practical implications as well.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["870"]}
{"title": "Health Information Exchange and Related IT-security Practices in European Hospitals.\n", "abstract": " Alongside other health information technologies (HIT), several projects aimed at implementing electronic health information exchange (HIE) have been initiated in European countries, with the hope of improving the coordination, safety, and efficiency in healthcare systems. However, the electronic exchange exposes health data to information technology (IT)-related vulnerabilities and threats, raising concerns among patients, health care providers, and policy-makers. Drawing on data from a sample of 1123 European hospitals, we conducted a cluster analysis to determine to what extent hospitals do live up to the IT security and privacy challenges of electronic HIE. We produced two sets of clusters, one related to HIE usage and another related to the implementation of IT-security practices. Through a cross-comparison, we proceeded to a match/mis-match analysis. The results of this study depict a mixed situation: even though most of surveyed hospitals (79.2%) have implemented IT-security practices consistent with their HIE usage levels, hospitals that have failed to do so (20.8%) pose a threat to the entire healthcare system which is becoming more and more interconnected.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["870"]}
{"title": "Electronic Health Record in Hospitals: A Theoretical Framework for Collaborative Lifecycle Risk Management\n", "abstract": " In doing so, this essay attempts to draw researchers\u2019 attention to the following issue: How should hospitals manage the risk of EHR throughout the entire system lifecycle? Drawing from Poba-Nzaou [1] and Poba-Nzaou and Raymond [2], I articulate a conceptual framework for addressing this issue and framing important questions for future research as well as generating insights for improving hospitals\u2019 practices.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["870"]}
{"title": "The contribution of office-based EMR systems to the performance of family physicians and primary care medical practices\n", "abstract": " In this study we sought to better understand how EMR systems are actually being used by family physicians and what they perceive to be the performance outcomes for themselves and their medical practices. To achieve our objectives, we conducted a survey of family physicians in Quebec, Canada and obtained responses from 331 user physicians. Key findings reveal that EMR systems \"as-used\" vary from one physician to another in terms of the EMR capabilities that are actually mobilized by them. Two user profiles were identified, that is, Meaningful and Basic users. Significant differences between the two groups were found in terms of physician demographics and system characteristics. In terms of perceived outcomes, physicians were clustered under three profiles that could be clearly distinguished from one another, namely Highly Impacted, Slightly Impacted and Non Impacted users. Findings show that Highly\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["870"]}
{"title": "An Empirical Taxonomy Of Business Value Underlying Motivations for E-HRM adoption\n", "abstract": " Although the use of IT to create business value (BV) has been debated for years (Melville, Kraemer and Gurbaxani, 2004), little is known about electronic human resource management (e-HRM) BV and particularly strategic BV and investigations are lacking (Ruel and Bondarouk, 2014; Marler and Fisher, 2013). We adopt a configurational approach and use factor and cluster analysis methods to identify and characterize BV underlying the motivations for e-HRM adoption by organizations. Based on a combination of the traditional sub-functional view of HRM (Wright and Snell, 1991) and Zuboff (1988) and Mooney et al.\u2019s (1996) concepts of automate, informate, and transform, nine factors are derived from HRM and IS literature; and drawing on data from 146 firms\u2019 online case stories of e-HRM adoption a seven-configuration solution is suggested, showing asymmetry in the consideration of strategic business value\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["870"]}
