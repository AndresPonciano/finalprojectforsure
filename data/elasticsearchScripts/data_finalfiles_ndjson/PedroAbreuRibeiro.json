{"title": "Critical Success Aspects in Project Management: Similarities and Differences Between the Construction and the Software Industry.\n", "abstract": " Original scientific paper Project success is highly dependent on the project management process, and there are several aspects that need to be carefully considered. This article aims at responding to the research question: are there similarities in different industries in what concerns the critical aspects for the success of project management? Throughout a comprehensive survey applied to medium and large companies of the construction and software industries, we came to the conclusion that the two currently most important project management success aspects are common to both industries:\" project planning\" and\" well defined objectives and requirements\". The\" project manager efficiency\" is also in the top of the critical success aspects. On the other hand, other aspects show major differences in the studied industries.", "num_citations": "89\n", "authors": ["1386"]}
{"title": "Success evaluation factors in construction project management\u2014some evidence from medium and large Portuguese companies\n", "abstract": " The construction industry plays a very important role in the Portuguese economy. In 2009, it was among the top five economic sectors, representing 13% of total employment. Nevertheless, project failures are still frequent mainly due to inadequate management practices and to the intrinsic characteristics of projects of the construction industry. Even though Portuguese construction has improved in recent years, cost and schedule overruns, low productivity and final product quality problems are still common. In this context, project management is a crucial tool for improving construction operations and for the overall success of projects. The aim of this article is to contribute to the discussion on success evaluation factors in a field where little has been written \u2014 the construction industry.

The influence of practitioners\u2019 characteristics in the choice of project management practices and their use in groups are also analyzed. The results show that the most used project management practices are kick-off meetings, activity lists, progress meetings, Gantt charts, and baseline plans; however, differences between activity sectors and practitioners\u2019 characteristics were found. The results also indicate that the most used project management practices are, in fact, used as toolsets.", "num_citations": "57\n", "authors": ["1386"]}

The widely quoted CHAOS Reports of the Standish Group, whose first results were released in 1994, find that while this situation has improved, deviations from the plan continue to be present in a majority of projects. In this paper we study the current state of success in software development projects, contrasting their results with those of civil engineering projects.

Preliminary results show that, with a small increase of the management effort, this enables a precise definition of what really means success in the context of a project, a better understanding of the different perspectives of the participating stakeholders, a greater focus in what is most important for achieving the project success, the unbiased identification and definition of criteria for evaluating success, and the definition of milestones to carry out the evaluation.", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["1386"]}

However, with the advent of agile methodologies in organizations of software development (the case of many information systems and technologies (IST)) no longer value the traditional PMO. It needs to be changed according to the agile values, so the organizations can extract benefits from such structure. These need to be fundamental changes in the responsibilities, practices and roles that a PMO should have. Also, it seems appropriate to rename it to something more descriptive and we chose to name it Agile Coordination Office (ACO).

{"title": "Key aspects in the assessment of success in software development projects. Is there a relationship with what is considered in other industries?\n", "abstract": " The perception of success reached in the execution of a project is largely related to the set of aspects that are considered in its evaluation. Usually, success factors comprise schedule, budget and scope achievements. However, other aspects like project approval by the client or final product quality, for instance, frequently have a significant impact on success. The identification and the understanding of the most relevant success aspects in the evaluation of software development projects is very important, allowing project managers to focus their efforts on them. In this work, the main aspects currently considered for the evaluation of the success of software development projects are identified. Furthermore, it is aimed to verify if these aspects are common in other industries, in particular in the construction one, viewed as a more traditional and consolidated engineering area than software development.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1386"]}

The analysis of the questionnaires indicated that implementing CMMI is problematical due to bureaucracy and lack of detailed protocols. Based on the difficulties encountered we developed a detailed documentation with standard processes where the employer has a more prominent role in controlling the processes.

However, with the advance of years, we found that stakeholders have also something to say about success evaluation. Each stakeholder has an impact, its own interests and expectations about the project development. Therefore, what for some can be considered a success, for others can be considered a failure, because each one has a different perspective on the same project. This short paper proposes a flexible success evaluation model for an Information Technology project, called Success Breakdown Structure (SBS). In this model, the various stakeholders present in a project are presented, as well as their success assessment criteria over three different visions: after the completion of the project, after a few months and last, after a few years.

In more developed economies, governments encourage, by finance, collaboration and the exchange of knowledge between private industry and universities. However, it is still a challenge for organizations and universities to identify the best practices adopted to establish and sustain collaboration. This has led to the growing need to establish practices and principles to guide the initiation, implementation and assessment of successful collaboration. Therefore, maturity models can be a way of establishing and sustaining collaboration as it helps organizations and universities to evaluate their processes against best practices and propose actions for improvement.
