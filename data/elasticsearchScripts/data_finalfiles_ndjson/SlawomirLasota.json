The complexity of the problem has remained unsettled since the 1960s, and it is one of the most prominent open questions in the theory of verification.

As a prominent example, emptiness is decidable for alternating automata with one clock or register, both with non-primitive recursive complexity. This is not by chance. This work confirms that there is indeed a tight relationship between the two models.

Based on the above features, PIF/Harbinger-like elements were identified in several plant genomes and divided into several evolutionary lineages. Availability of a significant portion of Medicago truncatula genomic sequence allowed for mining PIF/Harbinger-like elements, starting from a single previously described element MtMaster. Twenty two putative autonomous, i.e. carrying an ORF coding for TPase and complete terminal inverted repeats, and 67 non-autonomous PIF/Harbinger-like elements were found in the genome of M. truncatula.

This process is crucial for subepithelial fibrosis and bronchial wall remodeling in asthma. However, this process evades current therapeutic asthma treatment strategies. Since our previous studies showed the attenuation of the TGF-\u03b2 1-induced FMT in response to lipid-lowering agents (eg, statins), we were interested to see whether a corresponding effect could be obtained upon administration of hypolipidemic agents. In this study, we investigated the effect of fenofibrate on FMT efficiency in populations of bronchial fibroblasts derived from asthmatic patients. Fenofibrate exerted a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the FMT, even though it did not efficiently affect the expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA; marker of myofibroblasts); however, it considerably reduced its incorporation into stress fibers through connexin 43 regulation. This effect was accompanied by disturbances in the actin cytoskeleton architecture, impairments in the maturation of focal adhesions, and the fenofibrate-induced deactivation of TGF-\u03b2 1/Smad2/3 signaling. These data suggest that fenofibrate interferes with myofibroblastic differentiation during asthma-related subepithelial fibrosis.

Additionally, there is no research addressing the question on the difference in electrotactic motility of cells representing various strategies of cell movement\u2014specifically blebbing vs. lamellipodial migration. In the current study we constructed a unique experimental model which allowed for the investigation of electrotactic movement of cells of the same origin but representing different modes of cell migration: weakly adherent, spontaneously blebbing (BC) and lamellipodia forming (LC) WC256 cells. We report that both BC and LC sublines show robust cathodal migration in a physiological EF (1\u20133 V/cm). The directionality of cell movement was completely reversible upon reversing the field polarity. However, the full reversal of cell direction after the change of EF polarity was much faster in the case of BC (10 minutes) than LC cells (30 minutes). We also investigated the distinct requirements for Rac, Cdc42 and Rho pathways and intracellular Ca2+ in electrotaxis of WC256 sublines forming different types of cell protrusions. It was found that Rac1 is required for directional movement of LC to a much greater extent than for BC, but Cdc42 and RhoA are more crucial for BC than for LC cells. The inhibition of ROCK did not affect electrotaxis of LC in contrast to BC cells. The results also showed that intracellular Ca2+ is essential only for the electrotactic reaction of BC cells.

Those steps can involve using web-services, invoking software tools, some quick-and-dirty scripts or even manual processing. The process itself is usually data-centered and is designed to analyze large amounts of heterogeneous data, eg protein folding prediction or analysis of proteome. There already are systems developed to assist the researcher in the construction and the execution of such workflows, like Taverna [4] and Kepler [2]. They provide graphical user interfaces for designing workflows, with the possibility of reuse of previously constructed workflows, of storing the result of an execution and even of storing the intermediate results [4].At present those systems do not provide a formal model for the representation of workflows. The designed workflows are interpreted in an imperative way in the sense that what has been constructed is going to be executed in exactly the specified way. There is a lack of an abstraction level at which the workflow could be analyzed and possibly automatically optimized in specified parts where for instance the order of execution doesn\u2019t affect the result.

We complement these two decidability result by showing undecidability when the number of clocks available to Player II is not fixed. As an application of timed games, and our main motivation to study them, we show that they can be used to solve the deterministic separability problem for nondeterministic timed automata with epsilon transitions. This is a novel decision problem about timed automata which has not been studied before.

Reachability for VASS is also inter-reducible with a plethora of problems from a number of areas of computer science. In spite of recent progress, the complexity of the reachability problem remains unsettled, and it is closely related to the lengths of shortest VASS runs that witness reachability. We consider VASS of fixed dimension, and obtain three main results. For the first two, we assume that the integers in the input are given in unary, and that the control graph of the given VASS is flat (i.e., without nested cycles). We obtain a family of VASS in dimension 3 whose shortest reachability witnessing runs are exponential, and we show that the reachability problem is NP-hard in dimension 7. These results resolve negatively questions that had been posed by the works of Blondin et al. in LICS 2015 and Englert et al. in LICS 2016, and contribute a first construction that distinguishes 3-dimensional flat VASS from 2-dimensional VASS.

It was postulated that microtubules play a central role in the polarization and directional migration of several types of cells. In this paper we investigated the role of microtubules in electrotaxis of rat Walker carcinosarcoma WC256 cells. We found that colchicine-stimulated disassembly of microtubules caused the formation of blebs instead of lamellipodia at the front of about 45% of cells. Most of the remaining cells contracted and became rounded or transformed into non-polar cells. Depolymerization of microtubules in both subpopulations of cells reduced the directionality of cell migration to about 50% of the control, but bleb-forming cells migrated much more efficiently than lamellipodia-forming cells. The analysis of microtubules architecture in the presence of an endogenous electric field showed that there is no relationship between the direction of migration and the polarization of microtubules.

With these two properties, the size of input can be incrementally reduced until the problem becomes trivial. We proceed in three steps: we first formulate the condition Theta for plain VASS, then adapt it to more general VASS with unconstrained coordinates, and finally to generalized VASS of Kosaraju.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1766"]}

{"title": "Tav4SB: grid environment for analysis of kinetic models of biological systems\u22c6\n", "abstract": " Taverna Workbench eases integration of software tools for life science research in experiments expressed as workflows. The Taverna services for Systems Biology (Tav4SB) project provides a set of new Web service operations which extend the functionality of Taverna Workbench in the systems biology domain. Tav4SB operations allow to perform numerical simulations or model checking of, respectively, deterministic or stochastic semantics of biological models. To visualize the results of model analysis a flexible plotting operation is provided as well. Tav4SB operations are executed in a grid environment, integrating heterogeneous software such as Mathematica, PRISM and SBML ODE Solver. User guide, contact information and full documentation of available Web service operations, exemplary workflows and other, additional resources can be found at the Tav4SB project\u2019s Web page: http://bioputer. mimuw. edu. pl/tav4sb/.Introduction. The Taverna Workbench [11] is a tool which facilitates the design and execution of the in silico experiments. Experiments are constructed as workflows which can be stored and executed when needed. The building blocks of a workflow are services, called processors. Technically, workflow is a set of processors, together with connections between their inputs and outputs. The remote processors are implemented as Web service (WS) operations. Scattered physically throughout computational resources of numerous scientific facilities, combined WSs allow to perform highly complex analyses, surpassing power of a standard workstation. Taverna services come from a diverse set of life sciences domains. In the field\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1766"]}
{"title": "Complexity of simulation preorder for a product of finite automata\n", "abstract": " We consider complexity of the question whether a finite-state system simulates a product of finite-state systems. As the main technical result we show EXPTIME-hardness of that problem. However, the value of our result appears more apparent when related to the complexity of language inclusion, known to be in PSPACE for the case we study. Our hardness result thus provides a counterexample to a widely accepted conjecture that branching-time preorders tend to be more computationally tractable than the linear-time ones. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such counterexample.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1766"]}
{"title": "Efficient seeding techniques for protein similarity search\n", "abstract": " We apply the concept of subset seeds proposed in ? to similarity search in protein sequences. The main question studied is the design of efficient seed alphabets to construct seeds with optimal sensitivity/selectivity trade-offs. We propose several different design methods and use them to construct several alphabets. We then perform an analysis of seeds built over those alphabet and compare them with the standard Blastp seeding method [2,3], as well as with the family of vector seeds proposed in [4]. While the formalism of subset seed is less expressive (but less costly to implement) than the accumulative principle used in Blastp and vector seeds, our seeds show a similar or even better performance than Blastp on Bernoulli models of proteins compatible with the common BLOSUM62 matrix.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1766"]}
{"title": "Causality versus true-concurrency\n", "abstract": " Category theory has been successfully employed to structure the confusing setup of models and equivalences for concurrency: Winskel and Nielsen have related the standard models via adjunctions and (co)reflections while Joyal et al. have defined an abstract notion of equivalence, known as open map bisimilarity. One model has not been integrated into this framework: the causal trees of Darondeau and Degano. Here we fill this gap. In particular, we show that there is an adjunction from causal trees to event structures, which we bring to light via a mediating model, that of event trees. Further, we achieve an open map characterization of history preserving bisimilarity: the latter is captured by the natural instantiation of the abstract bisimilarity for causal trees.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1766"]}

This is achieved by translating them into a natural extension of the Nested Relational Calculus NRC.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1766"]}
{"title": "Finitary observations in regular algebras\n", "abstract": " We investigate regular algebras, admitting infinitary regular terms interpreted as least upper bounds of suitable approximation chains. We prove that finitary observable contexts are suffcient for observational indistinguishability in a regular algebra. Moreover, assumed all observable sorts to be essentially flat, observational equivalence is also completely characterized by finitary contexts. As a corollary, methods of proving behavioural properties and observational equivalence of standard algebras can be reused in the setting of regular algebras.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1766"]}
{"title": "Reachability relations of timed pushdown automata\n", "abstract": " Timed pushdown automata (tpda) are an expressive formalism combining recursion with a rich logic of timing constraints. We prove that reachability relations of tpda are expressible in linear arithmetic, a rich logic generalising Presburger arithmetic and rational arithmetic. The main technical ingredients are a novel quantifier elimination result for clock constraints (used to simplify the syntax of tpda transitions), the use of clock difference relations to express reachability relations of the fractional clock values, and an application of Parikh's theorem to reconstruct the integral clock values.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1766"]}
{"title": "Improved Lower Bounds for Reachability in Vector Addition Systems\n", "abstract": " We investigate computational complexity of the reachability problem for vector addition systems (or, equivalently, Petri nets), the central algorithmic problem in verification of concurrent systems. Concerning its complexity, after 40 years of stagnation, a non-elementary lower bound has been shown recently: the problem needs a tower of exponentials of time or space, where the height of tower is linear in the input size. We improve on this lower bound, by increasing the height of tower from linear to exponential. As a side-effect, we obtain better lower bounds for vector addition systems of fixed dimension.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1766"]}
{"title": "WQO dichotomy for 3-graphs\n", "abstract": " We investigate data-enriched models, like Petri nets with data, where executability of a transition is conditioned by a relation between data values involved. Decidability status of various decision problems in such models may depend on the structure of data domain. According to the WQO Dichotomy Conjecture, if a data domain is homogeneous then it either exhibits a well quasi-order (in which case decidability follows by standard arguments), or essentially all the decision problems are undecidable for Petri nets over that data domain.We confirm the conjecture for data domains being 3-graphs (graphs with 2-colored edges). On the technical level, this result is a significant step towards classification of homogeneous 3-graphs, going beyond known classification results for homogeneous structures.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1766"]}
{"title": "Asthma-derived fibroblast to myofibroblast transition is enhanced in comparison to fibroblasts derived from non-asthmatic patients in 3D in vitro culture due to Smad2/3 signalling.\n", "abstract": " The basic hallmarks of bronchial asthma, one of the most common chronic diseases occurring in the world, are chronic inflammation, remodelling of the bronchial wall and its hyperresponsiveness to environmental stimuli. It was found out that the fibroblast to myofibroblast transition (FMT), a key phenomenon in subepithelial fibrosis of the bronchial wall, was crucial for the development of asthma. Our previous studies showed that HBFs derived from asthmatic patients cultured in vitro display some inherent features which facilitate their TGF-b-induced FMT. Although usefulness of standard'2D'cultures is invaluable, they have many limitations. As HBFs interact with extracellular matrix proteins in the connective tissue, which can affect the FMT potential, we have decided to expand our'2D'model to in vitro cell cultures in 3D using collagen gels. Our results showed that 1.5 mg/ml concentration of collagen is suitable for HBFs growth, motility, and phenotypic shifts. Moreover, we demonstrated that in the TGF-\u03b21-activated HBF populations derived from asthmatics, the expression of fibrosis-related genes (ACTA2, TAGLN, SERPINE1, COL1A1, FN1 and CCN2) was significantly increased in comparison to the non-asthmatic ones. We also confirmed that it is related to the TGF-\u03b2/Smad2/3 profibrotic pathway intensification. In summary, the results of our study undoubtedly demonstrate that HBFs from asthmatics have unique intrinsic features which predispose them, regardless the culture conditions, to the increased FMT under the influence of TGF-\u03b21.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1766"]}
{"title": "Binary Reachability of Timed-register Pushdown Automata and Branching Vector Addition Systems\n", "abstract": " Timed-register pushdown automata constitute a very expressive class of automata, whose transitions may involve state, input, and top-of-stack timed registers with unbounded differences. They strictly subsume pushdown timed automata of Bouajjani et al., dense-timed pushdown automata of Abdulla et al., and orbit-finite timed-register pushdown automata of Clemente and Lasota. We give an effective logical characterisation of the reachability relation of timed-register pushdown automata. As a corollary, we obtain a doubly exponential time procedure for the non-emptiness problem. We show that the complexity reduces to singly exponential under the assumption of monotonic time. The proofs involve a novel model of one-dimensional integer branching vector addition systems with states. As a result interesting on its own, we show that reachability sets of the latter model are semilinear and computable in exponential\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1766"]}
{"title": "Equivariant algorithms for constraint satisfaction problems over coset templates\n", "abstract": " We investigate the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) over templates with a group structure, and algorithms solving CSP that are equivariant, i.e. invariant under a natural group action induced by a template. Our main result is a method of proving the implication: if CSP over a coset template T is solvable by a local equivariant algorithm then T is 2-Helly (or equivalently, has a majority polymorphism). Therefore bounded width, and definability in fixed-point logics, coincide with 2-Helly. Even if these facts may be derived from already known results, our new proof method has two advantages. First, the proof is short, self-contained, and completely avoids referring to the omitting-types theorems. Second, it brings to light some new connections between CSP theory and descriptive complexity theory, via a construction generalizing CFI graphs.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1766"]}

Active movement of cells underlies many physiological processes such as: embryological development, immune response, wound healing; and pathophysiological as metastasis [1]. In 2-dimensional movement, a cell usually migrates by creating a lamellipodium\u2014a wide, flat projection made by F-actin filaments polymerization, which are continuously rearranged during cell movement process [2].

{"title": "Undecidability of performance equivalence of Petri nets\n", "abstract": " We investigate bisimulation equivalence on Petri nets under durational semantics. Our motivation was to verify the conjecture that in durational setting, the bisimulation equivalence checking problem becomes more tractable than in ordinary setting (which is the case, e.g., over communication-free nets). We disprove this conjecture in three of four proposed variants of durational semantics. The fourth variant remains an intriguing open problem.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1766"]}

{"title": "On completeness of logical relations for monadic types\n", "abstract": " Software security can be ensured by specifying and verifying security properties of software using formal methods with strong theoretical bases. In particular, programs can be modeled in the framework of lambda-calculi, and interesting properties can be expressed formally by contextual equivalence (a.k.a. observational equivalence). Furthermore, imperative features, which exist in most real-life software, can be nicely expressed in the so-called computational lambda-calculus. Contextual equivalence is difficult to prove directly, but we can often use logical relations as a tool to establish it in lambda-calculi. We have already defined logical relations for the computational lambda-calculus in previous work. We devote this paper to the study of their completeness w.r.t. contextual equivalence in the computational lambda-calculus.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1766"]}
