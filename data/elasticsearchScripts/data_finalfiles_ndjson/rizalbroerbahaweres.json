Salah satu kebutuhan utama yang tidak bisa dilepaskan dari pemakaian komputer adalah tempat penyimpanan baik berupa USB Flash Disk, HD Eksternal, HD Internal sampai HD untuk kebutuhan skala besar untuk komputer server yang berada di data center, laboratorium atau jaringan komputer. Ruang penyimpanan data atau data storage semakin berkembang dengan munculnya teknologi komputer jaringan yang memunculkan alternatif data storage berupa DAS, NAS, FC, FcoE dan iSCSI. iSCSI menggunakan standard TCP/IP protocol over Ethernet untuk menyediakan penyimpanan berbasis block. Saat ini ada 2 jenis multiprotocol SCSI Target utama di industri yaitu LIO dan COMSTAR yang menggantikan teknologi sebelumnya yaitu iET, SCST dan STGT. LIO (linux-iscsi. org) merupakan standard open source iSCSI Target untuk berbagi ruang penyimpanan di Linux. LIO mendukung storage fabrics, yaitu Fibre Channel (QLogic), FCoE, iEEE 1394, iSCSI, iSER (Mellanox InfiniBand), SRP (Mellanox InfiniBand), USB, vHost, dan lain-lain.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1979"]}

(Dibawah Bimbingan Rizal Bahawerez dan Nur Aeni Hidayah) Berdasarkan Keputusan Menteri Negara Pendayagunaan Aparatur Negara NomorKep/26/M.PAN/2/2009 mengenai peningkatan kualitas dan menjamin penyedia pelayanan publik dalam penyelenggaraan pelayanan. Universitas Terbuka (UT) merupakan satu-satunya perguruan tinggi negeri di Indonesia yang menerapkan sistem belajar jarak jauh dalam mengelola program pendidikannya. Dalam sistem belajar di Universitas Terbuka, belajar mandiri merupakan factor utama. Masalah ketersediaan bahan ajar merupakan faktor yang paling penting. Saat ini unit yang bertanggung jawab dalam melaksanakan manajemen SI/TI adalah Pusat Komputer (Puskom), Puskom inilah yang bertanggung jawab menyediakan layanan kepada seluruh unit / bagian dilingkungan UT. Dimana dalam pelayanan yang diberikan terdapat beberapa hal yang menjadi kendala sebelum upaya pencapaian penerapan standar service management diterapkan, yaitu diantaranya Tidak dapat menjalankan / mengelola TI dengan baik, kurangnya kepercayaan dari stakeholder, kurangnya control sehingga banyak resiko yang terjadi dan tidak adanya service level management yang jelas sehingga pelayanan yang diberikan oleh Puskom tidak ada indicator. Maka penulis mencoba untuk memberikan alternative pemecahan permasalahan dengan membuat penelitian terhadap layanan TI (IT Service Management). Oleh karena itu, pada penelitian terhadap\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1979"]}
