{"title": "Code smell detection using whale optimization algorithm\n", "abstract": " Software systems have been employed in many fields as a means to reduce human efforts; consequently, stakeholders are interested in more updates of their capabilities. Code smells arise as one of the obstacles in the software industry. They are characteristics of software source code that indicate a deeper problem in design. These smells appear not only in the design but also in software implementation. Code smells introduce bugs, affect software maintainability, and lead to higher maintenance costs. Uncovering code smells can be formulated as an optimization problem of finding the best detection rules. Although researchers have recommended different techniques to improve the accuracy of code smell detection, these methods are still unstable and need to be improved. Previous research has sought only to discover a few at a time (three or five types) and did not set rules for detecting their types. Our\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1014"]}
