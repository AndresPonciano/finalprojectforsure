{"title": "On cognitive biases in architecture decision making\n", "abstract": " The research carried out to date shows that architectural decision-making is far from being a rational process. Architects tend to adopt a satisfying approach, rather than looking for the optimal architecture, which is a result of many human and social factors. The results of a workshop, carried out with 14 software engineering practitioners show that cognitive biases are commonly present in architecture decision-making. A systematic approach to analysing the influence of biases on decision making has been introduced. Twelve cognitive biases identified during the workshop were analysed with regard to the elements of the decision-making context that affected the aspects of architectural decision making. Finally, we analyse the interactions between cognitive biases and the conditions of real-world software development.", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["1347"]}
{"title": "On cognitive biases in requirements elicitation\n", "abstract": " The purpose of this paper was to identify the cognitive biases most frequently affecting requirements elicitation, as well as to identify how these biases may influence the requirements elicitation and its outcomes. The research was based on an analysis of forty-one student reports prepared during software engineering classes. The analysis was performed using an adaptation of the Angoff Method, which is very popular in the area\u00a0of psychological research. It demonstrated that, out of the eight analyzed cognitive biases, representativeness, anchoring and confirmation bias most frequently influence\u00a0the requirements elicitation, while pro-innovation bias, the bandwagon effect and the IKEA effect are the least likely to occur. The research also revealed\u00a0that cognitive biases may distort the identified requirements in many ways.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1347"]}
{"title": "The Influence of Cognitive Biases on Architectural Technical Debt\n", "abstract": " Cognitive biases exert a significant influence on human thinking and decision-making. In order to identify how they influence the occurrence of architectural technical debt, a series of semi-structured interviews with software architects was performed. The results show which classes of architectural technical debt originate from cognitive biases, and reveal the antecedents of technical debt items (classes) through biases. This way, we analysed how and when cognitive biases lead to the creation of technical debt. We also identified a set of debiasing techniques that can be used in order to prevent the negative influence of cognitive biases. The observations of the role of organisational culture in the avoidance of inadvertent technical debt throw a new light on that issue.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1347"]}
