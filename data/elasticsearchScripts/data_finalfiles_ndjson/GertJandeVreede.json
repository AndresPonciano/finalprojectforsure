{"title": "Collaboration engineering with ThinkLets to pursue sustained success with group support systems\n", "abstract": " Field research and laboratory experiments suggest that, under certain circumstances, people using group support systems (GSS) can be significantly more productive than people who do not use them. Yet, despite their demonstrated potential, GSS have been slow to diffuse across organizations. Drawing on the Technology Transition Model, the paper argues that the high conceptual load of GSS (i.e., understanding of the intended effect of GSS functionality) encourages organizations to employ expert facilitators to wield the technology on behalf of others. Economic and political factors mitigate against facilitators remaining long term in GSS facilities that focus on supporting nonroutine, ad hoc projects. This especially hampers scaling GSS technology to support distributed collaboration. An alternative and sustainable way for organizations to derive value from GSS lies in an approach called \"collaboration\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "773\n", "authors": ["2090"]}

{"title": "Collaboration engineering: designing repeatable processes for high-value collaborative tasks\n", "abstract": " By collaborating people can accomplish more than they could as separate individuals. Yet, achieving effective team collaboration remains a challenge. Organizations struggle to make collaboration work. They often resort to implementing technologies, while experiences show that technology alone seldom is the answer. Collaboration processes need to be explicitly designed structured and managed to maximize the focus of purposeful effort. This is at the heart of a new area of research: Collaboration Engineering - designing recurring collaboration processes that can be transferred to groups that can be self-sustaining in these processes using collaboration techniques and technology. Through a number of action research studies with a host of organizations we developed a Collaboration Engineering design approach. This paper presents and illustrates this approach in terms of its way of thinking, working\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "339\n", "authors": ["2090"]}
{"title": "Causal relationships in creative problem solving: Comparing facilitation interventions for ideation\n", "abstract": " Organizations must be creative continuously to survive and thrive in today's highly competitive, rapidly changing environment. A century of creativity research has produced several descriptive models creativity, and hundreds of prescriptions for interventions that demonstrably improve creativity. This paper presents the cognitive network model (CNM) as a causal model of the cognitive mechanisms that give rise to creative solutions in the human mind. The model may explain why creativity prescriptions work as they do. The model may also provide a basis for deriving new techniques to further enhance creativity. The paper tests the model in an experiment where 61 four-person groups used either free-brainstorming or one of three variations on directed-brainstorming to generate solutions for one of two unstructured tasks. In both tasks, people using directed-brainstorming produced more solutions with high creativity\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "301\n", "authors": ["2090"]}

This trend has given rise to a new research field: Collaboration Engineering. The goal of Collaboration Engineering is to design and deploy processes for high-value recurring collaborative tasks, and to design these processes such that practitioners can execute them successfully without the intervention of professional facilitators. One of the key concepts in Collaboration Engineering is the thinkLet\u2014a codified facilitation technique that creates a predictable pattern of collaboration. Because thinkLets produce a predictable pattern of interactions among people working together toward a goal they can be used as snap-together building blocks for team process designs.

{"title": "ThinkLets: achieving predictable, repeatable patterns of group interaction with group support systems (GSS)\n", "abstract": " Over the past decade, Group Support Systems (GSS) has shown that, under certain circumstances, teams using GSS can be far more productive than teams who do not use GSS. However, research results are not unequivocal; they have been ambiguous, and sometimes conflicting which makes it difficult for GSS research to inform GSS practice. One cause of the conflict and ambiguity in GSS research results may be the result of focusing on a less-than-useful level of abstraction: GSS itself. This paper argues that in GSS research, the thinkLet may be a more useful unit of comparison than the GSS. A thinkLet encapsulates three components of a GSS stimulus: The tool, its configuration, and the script. Field experience shows that thinkLets may be used to create repeatable, predictable patterns of thinking among people making an effort toward a goal. To date we have documented about 60 thinkLets that map to seven\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "227\n", "authors": ["2090"]}

Although the state of knowledge and theory development in this area warrants a focus on descriptive field explorations, most cross-cultural GSS research has taken place in laboratory environments. The study reported here represents the first detailed descriptive field study ofGSS application in Africa. A grounded theory approach was used to collect and analyze data on eleven projects in which GSS meetings were organized in Malawi, Zimbabwe, and Tanzania. From the data emerged a model of GSS acceptance in the cultures investigated that extends the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) in terms of a specification of a number of relevant external factors. These factors include the endorsement of top management, computer literacy, oral communication preference, referent power, and satisfaction with use.

Collaboration is necessary yet many organizations struggle to make it work. The field of IS has devoted much effort to understanding how technologies can improve the productivity of collaborative work. Over the past decade, the field of Collaboration Engineering has emerged as a focal point for research on designing and deploying collaboration processes that are recurring in nature and that are executed by practitioners in organizations rather than collaboration professionals. In Collaboration Engineering, researchers do not study a collaboration technology in isolation. Rather, they study collaborative work practices that can be supported on different technological platforms. In this editorial, we discuss the field of Collaboration Engineering in terms of its foundations, its approach to designing and deploying collaboration processes, and its modeling techniques. We conclude with a Collaboration Engineering research agenda for the coming decade.", "num_citations": "154\n", "authors": ["2090"]}

For IS professionals and providers, satisfaction is critical throughout the life of a system because dissatisfied stakeholders can derail implementation, discontinue using an important system, erode IS/IT budgets, or even transfer their entire IT infrastructure to a different organization. The IS literature offers several perspectives on satisfaction, but none yet accounts fully for known satisfaction phenomena. We identify ten observed satisfaction effects, and summarize six existing models for satisfaction, identifying their merits, and the limits of their explanatory power. We then advance Yield Shift Theory (YST), a new causal theory for the satisfaction response that offers a more complete explanation of this phenomenon. YST derives two propositions from five assumptions to propose that variations in the satisfaction response\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "150\n", "authors": ["2090"]}

{"title": "Meeting satisfaction for technology-supported groups: An empirical validation of a goal-attainment model\n", "abstract": " Research shows that people who feel dissatisfied with a technology-supported meeting may discontinue use of such technology, even if it provides demonstrable benefits. It is therefore important to derive theoretical understandings of the satisfaction phenomenon. This article validates an instrument that measures the constructs of a goal-attainment model of meeting satisfaction. It then tests the model among 237 working professionals in 19 groups in the field. Results support the propositions that satisfaction with meeting process and satisfaction with meeting outcome are both a function of an individual's perceived net goal attainment with respect to the meeting. The results also support a proposed link between satisfaction with meeting outcome and satisfaction with meeting process. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for research and practice.", "num_citations": "138\n", "authors": ["2090"]}

A collaboration engineer designs collaboration processes and transfers them to practitioners in an organization. Through the recurring nature of the task, combined with lower investment in training, the approach is more likely to be successful in organizations because it is easier to adopt and sustain collaboration support in this way. In order to be successful, collaboration engineers need to develop collaboration process designs that have many more functions and requirements than traditional process agenda\u2019s of facilitators. This paper describes a step-by-step approach for the design of such collaboration processes. The approach was evaluated in a number of iterations.

Two key reasons for failure are distinguished from the literature: insufficient stakeholder involvement and poor analyses of the business processes. The purpose of this paper is to present a decade of field experiences with collaborative BPR. Nine BPR projects were executed and analyzed in detail, leading to the identification of 87 themes regarding the efficiency and effectiveness of the project. These themes were organized into 12 categories of lessons learned that provide insight into the \"best practices\" and together informed the evolution of the collaborative business engineering (CBE) approach to BPR. The CBE approach combines a BPR process with collaboration and simulation modeling support to address the above-mentioned reasons for failure in BPR.
