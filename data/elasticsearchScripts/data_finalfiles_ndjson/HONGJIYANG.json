Under various pathological conditions, abnormal expression of eNOS contributes to endothelial dysfunction and the development of cardiovascular diseases. A variety of pathological stimuli has been reported to decrease eNOS expression mainly through decreasing eNOS mRNA stability by regulating the binding of several cytosolic proteins to the cis-acting sequences within eNOS mRNA 3\u0393\u00c7\u2593 untranslated regions. However, the detailed mechanisms remain elusive. Because microRNAs inhibit gene expression through binding to the 3\u0393\u00c7\u2593 untranslated regions of their target mRNAs, microRNAs may be the important posttranscriptional modulators of eNOS expression.

Here we tested how alterations in AMF community induced by an invasive plant species generate feedback to the invasive plant itself and affect subsequent interactions between the invasive species and its native neighbors. We first examined the effects of the invasive forb Solidago canadensis L. on AMF communities comprising five different AMF species. We then examined the effects of the altered AMF community on mutualisms formed with the native legume forb species Kummerowia striata (Thunb.) Schindl. and on the interaction between the invasive and native plants. The host preferences of the five AMF were also assessed to test whether the AMF form preferred mutualistic relations with the invasive and/or the native species. We found that S. canadensis altered AMF spore composition by increasing one AMF species (Glomus geosporum) while reducing Glomus mosseae, which is the dominant species in the field. The host preference test showed that S. canadensis had promoted the abundance of AMF species (G. geosporum) that most promoted its own growth. As a consequence, the altered AMF community enhanced the competitiveness of invasive S. canadensis at the expense of K. striata. Our results demonstrate that the invasive S. canadensis alters soil AMF community composition because of fungal-host preference.

{"title": "Dynamic adaptive chemistry for turbulent flame simulations\n", "abstract": " The use of large chemical mechanisms in flame simulations is computationally expensive due to the large number of chemical species and the wide range of chemical time scales involved. This study investigates the use of dynamic adaptive chemistry (DAC) for efficient chemistry calculations in turbulent flame simulations. DAC is achieved through the directed relation graph (DRG) method, which is invoked for each computational fluid dynamics cell/particle to obtain a small skeletal mechanism that is valid for the local thermochemical condition. Consequently, during reaction fractional steps, one needs to solve a smaller set of ordinary differential equations governing chemical kinetics.

Therefore, targeting FEN1 could serve as a potent strategy for cancer therapy. In this study, we demonstrated that FEN1 is overexpressed in breast cancers and is essential for rapid proliferation of cancer cells. We showed that manipulating FEN1 levels in cells alters the response of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, we identified a small molecular compound, SC13 that specifically inhibits FEN1 activity, thereby interfering with DNA replication and repair in vitro and in cells.

The nylon fabric treated with HFPO/DMDHEU or HFPO/TMM retained significant amount of phosphorus after multiple launderings. The laundering durability of the HFPO applied to nylon was probably attributed to the formation of a crosslinked polymeric network on the nylon fiber. The nylon fabric treated with HFPO/DMDHEU showed higher percent phosphorus retention than that treated with HFPO/TMM. The percent phosphorus retention of the treated nylon increased as the DMDHEU or TMM concentration was increased, and the nylon fabric's stiffness follows the same trend.

The proposal density used is self-tuned and tailored to the specific target, but it is not adaptive.

{"title": "Optimal variable road-use pricing on a congested network of parallel routes with elastic demand\n", "abstract": " In this paper, a time-varying pricing model of a congested network of parallel bottleneck routes with elastic traffic demand is formulated using the time-delay optimal control theory. It is assumed that optimal use of the network is achieved when the net social benefit over the whole study horizon of time is maximized. The necessary conditions for optimal solution are derived and their corresponding economic interpretations are given. It is shown that at equilibrium, the generalized costs for all departure times and for all routes that are used are identical. A significant difference of the study from the previous analyses, is that queues are assumed not necessarily to be zero in determining the optimal time-varying tolls, and the exit capacity of each bottleneck is assumed either to be constant or to vary with queue length such as the case of traffic-response control. An approximate iterative algorithm is developed for solving the model in a discrete time version. Three numerical examples, each with a network of two parallel bottleneck routes, are presented. The first example examines the constant capacity case where the optimal solution can be obtained by solving a group of equations. The exact numerical solution is used to check the accuracy of results obtained by the iterative algorithm. The second and third examples demonstrate the applications of the proposed model and algorithm when the exit capacity is nonlinear and increasing or decreasing with queue length, respectively. It is found in the second example that the optimal time-varying toll allows queues during optimal use of the network.(A) For the covering abstract see IRRD 886400.", "num_citations": "43\n", "authors": ["42"]}

In this study, we found that MPP+ could increase the expression of \u256c\u2592-synuclein mRNA but could not elevate proteasome activity sufficiently, leading to \u256c\u2592-synuclein protein accumulation followed by aggregation. Both HSPs and HDJ-1, a homologue of human Hsp40, can inhibit MPP+-induced \u256c\u2592-synuclein mRNA expression, promote ubiquitination and elevate proteasome activity. These findings suggest that HSPs may inhibit the MPP+-induced \u256c\u2592-synuclein expression, accelerate \u256c\u2592-synuclein degradation, thereby reducing the amount of \u256c\u2592-synuclein protein and accordingly preventing its aggregation.", "num_citations": "42\n", "authors": ["42"]}

The three parts of reengineering could be integrated on the basis of a wide spectrum language. The key approach to comprehension and the production of formal specification is a notion of abstraction. Transformation can help to change the original source code into alternative forms, but with the same semantics. Abstraction is often interpreted as the act of hiding irrelevant details.  What constitute as relevant details is often left open to different interpretations. A unified approach for reverse engineering is described within which the notion of abstraction is classified and precisely defined. Abstraction rules are given and applied to various case studies.

In order to allow a rule based system to be immune from the above described structural errors, we have observed that for all columns in the matrix, all positive entries must be above all negative entries; and for all rows in the matrix, all positive entries must be to the right of all negative entries. If this is not the case, the rule based system may commit errors.

However, there is no appropriate method for measuring the internal velocity because of the destructive power of debris flow process.

Kinetic pressure is the difference of impact pressure and static pressure. The former is detected by force sensors installed in the flow direction at the sampling section. Observations show that static pressure can be computed using the formula for static water pressure by simply substituting water density for debris flow density.

Prior to this study, however, the function of the two subunits in oxidative deposition of iron in ferritin was unknown. The data show that, upon aerobic addition of 48\u0393\u00c7\u00f4200 Fe2+/shell to apoferritin, iron oxidation occurs only at the diiron ferroxidase center of recombinant H1 (rH-1). In addition to the diiron ferroxidase mechanism, such oxidation is catalyzed by the extension peptide (a specific domain found in phytoferritin) of rH-2, because the H-1 subunit is able to remove Fe3+ from the center to the inner cavity better than the H-2 subunit. These findings support the idea that the H-1 and H-2 subunits play different roles in iron mineralization in protein.

Here we performed a comparative analysis of cytokine abundance in PEs from TB patients and non-TB patients by protein array analysis and observed that MCP-2/CCL8 is highly expressed in the TB-PEs as compared to peripheral blood. Meanwhile, we observed that CCR5, the primary receptor used by MCP-2/CCL8, is mostly expressed on pleural CD4+ T lymphocytes.

In this study, a new class III chitinase from pomegranate seeds (pomegranate seed chitinase, PSC) was isolated and purified to homogeneity. The native state of PSC is a monomer with a molecular weight of approximately 30\u0393\u00c7\u00e2kDa. This chitinase naturally binds calcium ions with high capacity and low affinity, suggesting that PSC is a calcium storage protein. Consistent with this idea, its amino acid sequence (inferred from cDNA) is rich in acidic amino acid residues, especially Asp, similar to reported calcium storage proteins. The presence of calcium considerably improves the stability of the protein but has little effect on its enzymatic activity.

{"title": "Copper downregulates neprilysin activity through modulation of neprilysin degradation\n", "abstract": " Copper plays a central role in conserved processes such as respiration, and in highly specialized processes, such as protein modification. The metalloprotease neprilysin (NEP) degrades a variety of bioactive peptides and is involved in many physiological processes. However, very little is known about the regulation of NEP activity. In the current study, we focused on the effect of Cu 2+ on the enzymatic activity and protein stability of NEP. Using mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells, we found that the enzymatic activity of NEP was decreased by treatment with Cu 2+ in a dose-and time-dependent manner. In our investigation of the mechanism by which Cu 2+ downregulates NEP enzyme activity, we found that treatment with Cu 2+ caused a decrease in the level of NEP as determined by Western blot analysis.

{"title": "Allergies and risk of head and neck cancer: an original study plus meta-analysis\n", "abstract": " Background Although the relationship between allergy and cancer has been investigated extensively, the role of allergy in head and neck cancer (HNC) appears less consistent. It is not clear whether allergies can independently influence the risk of HNC in the presence of known strong environmental risk factors, including consumption of alcohol, betel quid, and cigarette.   Methods The current paper reports results from: 1) an original hospital-based case-control study, which included 252 incident cases of HNC and 236 controls frequency-matched to cases on sex and age; and 2) a meta-analysis combining the results of the current case-control study and 13 previously published studies (9 cohort studies with 727,569 subjects and 550 HNC outcomes and 5 case-control studies with 4,017 HNC cases and 10,928 controls).   Results In the original case-control study, we observed a strong inverse association between allergies and HNC [odds ratio = 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.27\u0393\u00c7\u00f40.62]. The meta-analysis also indicated a statistically significant inverse association between HNC and allergies [meta-relative risk (RR) = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.63\u0393\u00c7\u00f40.91], particularly strong for allergic rhinitis (meta-RR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.40\u0393\u00c7\u00f40.76). In addition, the inverse association between allergies and HNC was observed only among men (meta-RR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.54\u0393\u00c7\u00f40.84) but not among women (meta-RR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.81\u0393\u00c7\u00f41.18).

The kinetic energy release (KER) in a Coulomb explosion causes the atomic ions to exhibit a double-peak structure.

The distributions of atomic ions are highly anisotropic, having a maximum along the laser polarization axis and a minimum perpendicular to it. In contrast to the atomic ions, the parent ion CO+ exhibits a strong isotropic angular distribution.

{"title": "Pre-stack inversion for caved carbonate reservoir prediction: A case study from Tarim Basin, China\n", "abstract": " The major storage space types in the carbonate reservoir in the Ordovician in the TZ45 area are secondary dissolution caves. For the prediction of caved carbonate reservoir, post-stack methods are commonly used in the oilfield at present since pre-stack inversion is always limited by poor seismic data quality and insufficient logging data. In this paper, based on amplitude preserved seismic data processing and rock-physics analysis, pre-stack inversion is employed to predict the caved carbonate reservoir in TZ45 area by seriously controlling the quality of inversion procedures. These procedures mainly include angle-gather conversion, partial stack, wavelet estimation, low-frequency model building and inversion residual analysis. The amplitude-preserved data processing method can achieve high quality data based on the principle that they are very consistent with the synthetics.

The suppression of nucleation and growth of primary phases and eutectics might be mainly attributed to reduction of diffusion rates of atoms in a magnetic field on the condition of suppression of convections.

{"title": "Toll like receptor 2 mediates bleomycin-induced acute lung injury, inflammation and fibrosis in mice\n", "abstract": " Anti-cancer drug bleomycin (BLM) can cause acute lung injury (ALI) which often results in pulmonary fibrosis due to a failure of resolving acute inflammatory response. The aim of this study is to investigate whether toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 mediates BLM-induced ALI, inflammation and fibrosis. BLM-induced dendritic cells (DCs) maturation was analyzed by flow cytometry and cytokine secretion was detected by the ELISA method. The expression and activity of p38 and ERK MAPK were determined with Western blotting. The roles of TLR2 in ALI, inflammation and fibrosis were investigated in C57BL/6 mice administered intratracheally with BLM. The results demonstrated that BLM-administered mice had higher expression of TLR2 (P< 0.001) and its signaling molecules. Blocking TLR2 significantly inhibited the maturation of DCs and reversed BLM-stimulated secretion of cytokines in DCs, such as IL-6 (P< 0.001), IL-17 (P< 0.05) and IL-23 (P< 0.05). TLR2 inhibition attenuated BLM-induced increase of inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and reversed the immunosuppressive microenvironment by enhancing TH1 response (P< 0.05) and inhibiting TH2 (P< 0.001), Treg (P< 0.01) and TH17 (P< 0.01) responses. Importantly, blocking TLR2 in vivo significantly protected BLM-administered mice from pulmonary injury, inflammation and fibrosis and subsequently increased BLM-induced animal survival (from 50% to 92%). Therefore, TLR2 is a novel potential target for ALI and pulmonary fibrosis.", "num_citations": "27\n", "authors": ["42"]}

The comparison between the model analyses and the observations reveals that the simulation generally performed well in forecasting the precipitation, the pressure field, and the radar reflectivity. The simulation result shows that the variation of aerosol concentrations had significant effects on the cloud microphysical processes, as well as on hail precipitation at the surface.

These rocks have a wide range of K-Ar ages from~ 36 to< 0.2 Ma. The early volcanism was voluminous and dominated by flood-type fissure eruptions of tholeiites, whereas the later phase was represented by sparse eruptions of basanitic lavas. Thirty-six samples analyzed in this study show a wide range in SiO2 contents from 44%~ 54%. They all are sodium-rich and high-Ti basalts that, however, show marked isotopic variations between two end-members:(1) tholeiites that have higher 87Sr/86Sr of 0.7048~ 0.7052, and lower \u256c\u2561Nd of-0.8 to-2.4 and Pb isotope ratios (206Pb/204Pb of 16.9~ 17.2, 207Pb/204Pb of 15.3~ 15.4 and 208Pb/204Pb of 37.1~ 37.7); and (2) basanites that have lower 87Sr/86Sr of 0.7035~ 0.7044, and higher \u256c\u2561Nd of+ 1.3 to+ 4.9 and Pb isotope ratios (206Pb/204Pb of 17.7~ 18.0, 207Pb/204Pb of 15.4~ 15.5 and 208Pb/204Pb of 37.8~ 38.2). Alkali olivine basalt that occurs as a subordinate rock type is geochemically similar to the basanites, but isotopically similar to the tholeiites, characterized by the highest 87Sr/86Sr ratio among the three basaltic suites, coupled with a low Nb/U value (~ 33).

Increasing evidence demonstrates that the hippocampus is an important brain region associated with morphine dependence, but the molecular events occurring in the hippocampus following chronic exposure to morphine are poorly understood. Aldolase C is the brain-specific isoform of fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate aldolase which is a glycolytic enzyme catalyzing reactions in the glycolytic, gluconeogenic, and fructose metabolic pathways. Using Western blot and immunofluorescence assays, we found the expression of aldolase C was markedly increased in the mouse hippocampus following chronic morphine treatment.

In addition, the internal quantum efficiency has been extracted by temperature-dependent photoluminescence measurements, and there is no droop observed as the carrier density increases. The small droop in efficiency of-plane LEDs could be due to the lack of polarization effects that enhances the carrier confinement under high current density operation.

However, since phytate itself is acidic, the question remains as to whether the effect of phytate is due to pH alone or to additional effects. In the French fry model, the effects on acrylamide formation of pH, phytate, and/or Ca++ in various combinations were tested in either blanching or soaking (after blanching) steps.

Methods based on file extensions or magic numbers can be easily spoofed, while a more reliable way is based on analyzing the file's binary content. We propose an algorithm to generate models for each file type based on analyzing the binary contents of a set of known input files by using n-gram analysis and design a novel feature selection evaluation function for extracting signatures from the models, then using the signatures to recognize the true type of unknown files. Our aim is not to use the structure and key words of any specific file types as this allows the approach to be applied to general file types.

In this paper, a lossless model of speech is presented. It performs a pitch synchronous modulated lapped transform (MLT) on the linear prediction residual of speech. The residual signal can be reconstructed without distortion from its transform when the quantization error is neglected. The pitch synchronous process exploits the quasi-periodicity of the speech. The MLT converts the 'periodic' signal into the frequency domain. Efficient coding similar to that used in the waveform interpolation speech coder can be achieved on the transform result. The combination of pitch synchronization and MLT provides a promising basic model for speech coding and processing.", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["42"]}

{"title": "Preference vector ant colony system for minimising make-span and energy consumption in a hybrid flow shop\n", "abstract": " Traditionally, scheduling problems usually deal with the objectives related to production efficiency (e.g., the make-span, the total completion time, the maximum lateness and the number of tardy jobs). However, sustainable manufacturing should minimise the energy consumption during production process. Energy consumption not only constitutes a major portion of total production cost but also results in significant environmental effects. In this chapter, we discuss a multi-objective scheduling problem in a hybrid flow shop. Two objectives considered in the proposed model are to minimise make-span and energy consumption.

The subjective probabilities are introduced by using Girsanov's theorem. In this way, we provide risk managers or regulators with the flexibility of adjusting the risk measure according to their risk preferences and subjective beliefs. The advantages of the proposed measure are that it is easy to implement and that it satisfies the four desirable properties introduced in [3], which make it a coherent risk measure.

Although it is known that hypoxia underlies the major changes and that the physiological responses include hemodynamic changes and erythropoiesis, the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways mediating such changes are largely unknown. To obtain a more complete picture of the transcriptional regulatory landscape and networks involved in extreme altitude response, we followed four climbers on an expedition up Mount Xixiabangma (8,012 m), and collected blood samples at four stages during the climb for mRNA and miRNA expression assays. By analyzing dynamic changes of gene networks in response to extreme altitudes, we uncovered a highly modular network with 7 modules of various functions that changed in response to extreme altitudes. The erythrocyte differentiation module is the most prominently up-regulated, reflecting increased erythrocyte differentiation from hematopoietic stem cells, probably at the expense of differentiation into other cell lineages. These changes are accompanied by coordinated down-regulation of general translation. Network topology and flow analyses also uncovered regulators known to modulate hypoxia responses and erythrocyte development, as well as unknown regulators, such as the OCT4 gene, an important regulator in stem cells and assumed to only function in stem cells. We predicted computationally and validated experimentally that increased OCT4 expression at extreme altitude can directly elevate the expression of hemoglobin genes.

{"title": "Coarsening mechanisms, texture evolution and size distribution of Cu6Sn5 between Cu and Sn-based solders\n", "abstract": " During the reflowing procedure, the Cu concentration in the solder affects the coarsening mechanisms of intermetallic compound (IMC) grains. For the Sn3Cu solder, the mean radius of the IMC grains was proportional to the cube root of the reflowing time; while it follows the square root relation with the reflowing time for the SnAgCu and Sn solders. It is proposed that the flux from the substrate was only consumed to coarsen the IMC grains for Sn3Cu solder, while it was separated into two fluxes for the SnAgCu and Sn solders at the reflowing initial procedure. For the Sn3.8Ag0.7Cu/Cu and Sn/Cu couples, the size distribution of the IMC grains well agrees with the modified flux driven ripening (FDR) model when the value of r/<r> is above 1; while it would closely match with Marqusee and Ross analysis when the value of r/<r> is below 1. For Sn3Cu/Cu couple, the size distribution of IMC grains shows good agreement\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["42"]}

The results show that the features for K 2 O 2 gradually move to high binding energy, and the work function decreases with increasing temperature up to 460 K. As the species of K 2 O 2 decomposes at 540 K, there exist two kinds of oxygen bonding states. A thin KO layer is formed on the top surface, while oxygen bonded to silicon is located at subsurface, leading to an extremely low value (0.3 eV) of the work function. For further annealing, the oxygen bonded to potassium gradually transfers to Si due to the desorption of potassium, and Si-O bonds appear on the top layer, which is related to increases of the work function.", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["42"]}

But, can Web applications be engineered as well? Currently, J2EE, Apache/Perl/PDP/MySQL and .NET have been universally accepted as Web application development technology, but there is no universal accepted methodology for Web application development process. Web application needs to be engineered by moving focus from technology to process. In this paper, a novel lifecycle model for Web application development in SMEs has been proposed. It includes two iterative process phases with a pre-iterative sequential process phase. This model has been applied to a real-world project and the result has proved its potential to shape the way on how web applications can be engineered in SMEs.", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["42"]}

The objective of this study was to characterize the in situ rumen digestion and microbiome of four barley grain varieties. Three ruminally-cannulated heifers were fed a low (60% barley silage, 37 % barley grain and 3% supplement) or high grain (37% barley silage, 60% barley grain and 3% supplement) diets. Four different barley varieties (Fibar, Xena, McGwire and Hilose) and corn as a comparison were included in the experiment. One set of bags was used to estimate dry matter (DM), starch and crude protein (CP) disappearance. A second set was used to extract DNA from the adherent microbiome and a third set was used to visualize grain after incubation using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). DNA was subjected to amplicon 16S rRNA gene sequencing followed by analysis using QIIME. In the low grain diet, McGwire had the highest effective degradability (ED) of DM (P<0.01).

{"title": "Photoelectric characteristics of metal/InGaN/GaN heterojunction structure\n", "abstract": " A heterojunction structure photodetector was fabricated by evaporating a semitransparent Ni/Au metal film on the InGaN/GaN structure. The photocurrent (PC) spectra show that both the Schottky junction (NiAu/InGaN) and the InGaN/GaN isotype heterojunction contribute to the PC signal which suggests that two junctions are connected in series and result in a broader spectral response of the device. Secondary electron, cathodoluminescence and electron-beam-induced current images measured from the same area of the edge surface clearly reveal the profile of the layer structure and distribution of the built-in electric field around the two junctions. A band diagram of the device is drawn based on the consideration of the polarization effect at the InGaN/GaN interface. The analysis is consistent with the physical mechanism of a tandem structure of two junctions connected in series.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["42"]}

In the combined approach, the HAGA determines the optimal displacement ratio and number of fictitious charges used in CSM, and then obtains the optimal contour design to minimize and uniform the tangential electric field along the dielectric boundary based on the optimized CSM. The proposed HAGA method considerably improves the execution efficiency by accessing the fitness values of the searched solutions saved a priori in a hashing table during the optimization process. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, three cases of different contours of support insulators have been studied.

Furthermore, the noise spectrums of the ball valve in cavitation and non-cavitation cases were measured. The results show that the cavitation around the orifice occurs periodically with a very high frequency of 2500 Hz.

They are calculated from the horizontal to vertical magnetic component ratio in the frequency domain, and are very sensitive to deep and lateral geoelectric characteristics of the measurement site. Entropy analysis, carried out from the transfer functions with the so called transfer function entropy, points out clear temporal burst regimes of a few distinct harmonics preceding the main shock of the seismic sequence. A possible explanation is that they could be related to deep fluid migrations and/or to variations in the micro-/meso-fracturing that affected significantly the conductivity (ordered/disordered) distribution in a large lithospheric volume under the seismogenic layer below L'Aquila area.

Assessing quality of software at the design level will provide ease and higher accuracy for users.

This study aimed to develop a novel LSPR biosensor used for detecting p53 mutation. Nanosphere lithography was used to fabricate the silver nanoparticles. The DNA probe was designed to recognize the target sequence and immobilized on the chip surface by a covalent-coupling method using amine-group ligands. Synthetic oligonucleotides or PCR products were amplified from genomic DNA taken from blood samples and hybridized with the immobilized probe. Wild-type and mutant p53 was detected by measuring shifts in peak of LSPR extinction spectra. The low detection limit of the sensor for target sequence was 10 nM, and detection occurred over a wide dynamic range (10 nM-10 \u256c\u255dM). Importantly, the differences in measuring signal between wild-type and mismatched p53 DNA was significant, allowing for this sensor to effectively discriminate against single base mutations. In conclusion, we developed a biosensor with potential as a rapid, label-free, sensitive, and low-cost method for detecting p53 mutation. Our results suggest that such an LSPR-based biosensor provides an attractive alternative for clinical detection of genetic mutation.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["42"]}

TAA is a representative hepatic fibrosis inducer, repeated 7-weeks ip injection of it results in hepatic fibrosis. We compared the level of hepatic fibrosis in TAA-turnip group, TAA group, and vehicle control group. Nodules-formed by TAA were observed; they were rarely shown in vehicle control group, observed in most area in TAA group, but only shown in periportal regions in TAA-turnip group. These results were confirmed through Masson's trichrom stain; fibrous structures increased in TAA group (fibrosis score: 4) but significantly decreased in TAA-turnip group (fibrosis score: 2-3).

Validation of the method was acceptable, with 96.03\u0393\u00c7\u00f4102.82% accuracy in recovery test and inter and intra-day precisions were less than 2%. This developed method by having a combination of chromatographic fingerprint and quantitation analysis could be applied to the quality control of Curculiginis Rhizoma.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["42"]}

Retention indexes of different sulfur compounds under temperature programmed condition were calculated. The relative standard deviations of peak areas of main sulfur compounds in catalytic diesel oil were no more than 5.0%, detection limit for sulfur was 0.1 mg/L under chosen conditions. Because response factor was independent on the molecule structure of the sulfur-containing compound, the content of each sulfur compound was determined quantitatively using thiophene as sulfur standard sample. The linear range was 2 mg/L-1,000 mg/L sulfur, and the correlation coefficient was 0.997.

Such tools need to address specific areas of need in the implementation of concurrent engineering in construction. Collaborative decision-making is an important area in this regard. A review of existing works has shown that none of the existing approaches to collaborative decision-making adequately addresses the needs of distributed construction project teams. The review also reveals that fuzzy logic offers great potential for application to collaborative decision-making. This thesis describes a Web-based collaborative decision-making system for construction project teams using fuzzy logic. Fuzzy logic is applied to tackle uncertainties and imprecision during the decision-making process. The prototype system is designed as Web-based to cope with the difficulty in the case where project team members are geographically distributed and physical meetings are inconvenient/or expensive. The prototype was developed into a Web-based software using Java and allows a virtual meeting to be held within a construction project team via a client-server system. The prototype system also supports objectivity in group decision-making and the approach encapsulated in the prototype system can be used for generic decision-making scenarios. The system implementation revealed that collaborative decision-making within a virtual construction project team can be significantly enhanced by the use of a fuzzybased approach.

Axial profiles of {alpha} were measured at different boiler loads. Two kinds of methods were used for the measurements: the heat flux method (HFM) and the finite element method (FEM). For HFM, {alpha} was measured with a heat flux meter. For FEM, {alpha} was calculated by using finite element analysis based on the temperature measured on insulation-side surface of the membrane tubes. Axial pressure drop profiles were synchronically measured by using a multi-channel acquisition system. The peripheral distribution of {alpha} on the side wall and the front wall of the furnace were also measured. It was found that the pressure profiles along the furnace height fit well with a second order exponential decay, so that a direct derivative method was proposed instead of using the empirical differential method based on the discrete pressure drop values. Experimental results show that {alpha} decreases with the increasing furnace height and the decreasing boiler load. It was also found {alpha} in the corner was about 6-8% higher than that in the center on the same side of water wall. The data obtained by FEM is higher than those obtained by HFM and they vary remarkably more gradually with the suspension density.

The results are expressed as percentage change of lengths in axis and radius during drying. The relationships between volume and directional shrinkage were discussed. Directional shrinkage was correlated to volumetric shrinkage and moisture removal direction. It was observed that the shrinkage coefficient in the axis was significantly different from that in the radius during air-drying. On the other hand, data describing the mechanical characteristics of cylindrical potato samples were experimentally determined at the above drying conditions. The Young's modulus (E), yield stress (sigmac), fracture stress (sigmaf) were expressed as a function of bulk moisture content (M).

{"title": "Acquiring data designs from existing data-intensive programs\n", "abstract": " The problem area addressed in this thesis is extraction of a data design from existing data intensive program code. The purpose of this is to help a software maintainer to understand a software system more easily because a view of a software system at a high abstraction level can be obtained. Acquiring a data design from existing data intensive program code is an important part of reverse engineering in software maintenance. A large proportion of software systems currently needing maintenance is data intensive. The research results in this thesis can be directly used in a reverse engineering tool. A method has been developed for acquiring data designs from existing data intensive programs, COBOL programs in particular. Program transformation is used as the main tool. Abstraction techniques and the method of crossing levels of abstraction are also studied for acquiring data designs. A prototype system has been implemented based on the method developed. This involved implementing a number of program transformations for data abstraction, and thus contributing to the production of a tool. Several case studies, including one case study using a real program with 7000 Hues of source code, are presented. The experiment results show that the Entity-Relationship Attribute Diagrams derived from the prototype can represent the data designs of the original data intensive programs. The original contribution of the thesis is that the approach presented in this thesis can identify and extract data relationships from the existing code by combining analysis of data with analysis of code.

The magnetoresistance can reach 84% near the peak temperature, which suggesting a strong magnetic correlated electronic transportation process. Zero field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) are split below the paramagnetic\u0393\u00c7\u00f4ferromagnetic transition. The ZFC curves exhibit a typical blocking process. The observed spin glass and weak localization phenomena are due to the size effect, and it is found that the resistance dependent temperature curve above metal\u0393\u00c7\u00f4insulator transition temperature (Tp) is more suitable to small polaron hopping (SPH) model.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["42"]}
{"title": "Asphalt pavements rutting on upgrade section under high temperature, heavy load and slow speed\n", "abstract": " Based on investigation data about rutting on certain upgrade section of asphalt pavement with continuous slope in a freeway, viscoelastic theory and Burges model are introduced to calculate the residual shear strain of asphalt pavement after a vehicle passing. The influence on rut of upgrade section with continuous slope of horizontal force, vehicle speed, axle load and temperature is analyzed. The results indicate that the influence of horizontal force can be ignored, that of temperature is enormous, and that of vehicle speed and axle load are almost in same level but obviously less than that of temperature. The combination of high temperature, heavy loading and low speed is the crucial factor induced rutting developed in a short time on upgrade section with continuous or deep slope, and the combination of heave loading and low speed is the main cause induced rut that appears repeatedly on upgrade section. The results can give a reasonable explanation to the rut observed on field investigation.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["42"]}

Medication-related injuries were analyzed for intentionality, medications used, discharge status, and risk factors such as mental illness, eating disorders, and alcohol abuse or dependence.Results: There were nearly 3000 medication-related injury hospitalizations\u0393\u00c7\u00f61150 of them self-poisoning hospitalizations\u0393\u00c7\u00f6among Wisconsin 12-17 year olds during 2000-2002. Females 12-17 years had twice as many medication-related injuries as males. Sixty percent of medication-related injuries occurred in patients with a mental disorder diagnosis. Non-narcotic analgesics were most commonly used and had one of the highest rates of intentionality (65%). A large proportion of intentional/suicidal medication-related injuries were discharged to another facility (35%), compared to 14% among all medical injuries. Males with medication-related injuries were twice (95% CI: 1.60, 2.75) as likely and females 1.4 (95% CI: 1.2, 1.6) times as likely to have intentional/suicidal injuries if they also abused or depended on alcohol.Conclusions: Given that a nonfatal suicide attempt is the strongest predictor of eventual suicide, the hundreds of self-poisoning discharges per year in Wisconsin 12-17 year olds is a serious public health concern. Both the medical community and public health community should heed the warnings of these nonfatal suicide attempts and implement educational programs addressing this issue.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["42"]}

{"title": "Island perturbation to the sky radiance over the ocean: simulations\n", "abstract": " Sky-radiance measurements at the sea surface can be used to estimate radiative properties of aerosols over water. We demonstrate, through Monte Carlo simulations, that significant perturbations to sky radiance over the ocean can occur when measurements are carried out with radiometers located on islands. In particular, we present examples of the influence of the physical and optical thicknesses of an aerosol layer, the azimuth of observation relative to the Sun, the size of the island, the location of the radiometer on the island, and the albedo of the island on the magnitude of the perturbation for a circular island of uniform albedo. Relative errors in sky radiance of as high as 39% were found in the blue. Simulated (perturbed) sky radiances were combined with an algorithm for retrieving the aerosol phase function P(\u256c\u00ff), where \u256c\u00ff is the scattering angle, and with the single-scattering albedo \u2567\u00eb_0, to demonstrate how\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["42"]}

Infusion of serotonin induced the secretory response of corticosterone significantly at 10 nM and markedly at 100 nM and the response at 1000 or 10000 nM declined as compared with that at 100nM in normal mice. Total corticosterone secretion in response to 100 or 1000 nM serotonin in athymic mice was about one fourth that in normal mice, respectively. Corticosterone responses to ACTH at the range of 10 to 300 pg/ml in athymic mice were comparable to those in normal mice.

Papers published between 1990 and Aug. 2008 on the core journals included by Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and VIP Chinese Periodical Database were systematically searched. Studies providing data of BSI fatality during hospitalization with a non-comparative, observational design were included. Meta-analysis was done using the generic inverse variance model. Overall, 72 studies were included for this analysis. The weighted BSI fatality in-hospital based on them was 28.7%(95% CI: 27.2%-30.3%), with substantial differences between study and heterogeneity. For BSI cases from across all departments of hospitals, the weighed fatality was 20.7%(95% CI: 17.8%-24.0%). In the departments of burn, hematology and/or malignant tumors, and ICU, BSI fatalities were even higher, but were relatively low among BSI cases from neonatal wards, and patients with liver diseases, or diabetes mellitus. Fatality of hospital acquired BSI (HA-BSIs, 26.8%, 95% CI: 22.4%-32.0%) was significantly higher than that of community acquired BSI (CA-BSIs). For the past decades, BSI fatality has declined in various kinds of inpatients. BSI fatality during hospitalization was at a high level in China, but with a downward trend over the past decades.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["42"]}

The results showed that in the three investigated EPS samples five P forms were identified, including orthophosphate, orthophosphate monoesters, DNA, pyrophosphate and polyphosphate. And in the EPS extracted from A/A/O sludge and A/A/O-MBR sludge polyphosphate was the main phosphorus form. This indicated that P is contained in the EPS not only owing to the adsorption of orthophosphate, but also because EPS acting like the bacteria cells contributes to enhanced biological phosphorus removal. Furthermore the transformation of P forms in the EPS during the EPS extraction was found but limited within 1 h.

Degenerative osteoarthritis in the knee joint of left posterior limb was induced in 36 rabbits by full extension using plaster cast for 6 weeks. Then the rabbits were randomly divided into untreated group, hyaluronic acid group and sinomenine group. Another 4 normal rabbits were selected as normal control group. Rabbits in the sinomenine group and the hyaluronic acid group received intraarticular injections of sinomenine and hyaluronic acid once a week for 5 weeks, respectively. The content of IL-1beta in synovial fluid and serum were measured before and after treatment by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The pathological changes of cartilaginous tissue were analyzed by using Mankin's score. Compared with those in the untreated group, synovial fluid and serum IL-1beta contents in the sinomenine group and the hyaluronic acid group were significantly decreased (P< 0.01). And the synovial fluid and serum IL-1beta contents in the sinomenine group were lower than those in the hyaluronic acid group (P< 0.05). The mean Mankin's score of cartilage in the sinomenine group was significantly lower than that in hyaluronic acid group (P< 0.05).

{"title": "Rate-based active queue management for congestion control over wired and wireless links\n", "abstract": " Current active queue management (AQM) and TCP are designed and tuned to work well for wired networks where packet loss is mainly due to network congestion. In wireless networks, however, communication links suffer from transmission bit errors and handoff failures. As a result, the performance of TCP flows is significantly degraded. To mitigate this problem, we propose a rate-based exponential AQM (REAQM) scheme. REAQM tries to stabilize the system and achieve low delay, low packet loss, and high link utilization regardless the dynamic of network conditions. Simulation results indicate that REAQM is capable of performing well for TCP flows over both wired and wireless links.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["42"]}

EG1 has high thermal stability and optimal pH at neutral and shows great potential in textile and paper industry applications. To improve the expression level of EG1 in Pichia pastoris, the increasing copy number of clone, and its high cell density fermentation in 3.2 L fermenter for its high-level expression were investigated in this work. By electro-transformation of pPICZalphaB-egl into GS115EG11 integrated with single copy of eg1 gene, A resistant transformant with 3.8 times higher level expression than GS115EG11 was screened from YPDSZ plate containing 2000 microg/mL of Zeocin. The effect of initial cell density, pH and methanol on its expression and biomass accumulation was evaluated in shaking culture. Optimal EG1 production was observed when initial cell density OD600 was 5.0. EG1 production and biomass accumulation did not seem to vary when cells were induced at different pH values. Both of EG1 and cell density were found to increase with higher methanol concentrations, reaching 62.48 IU/mL and 31.7 (OD600) respectively after 120 h induction with 2.0%(V/V) methanol compared to 30.24 IU/mL and 17.79 (OD60) with 0.25% methanol induction. EG1 expression was further increased by 6.4 times higher than shaking culture after 95.5 hours induction with methanol in fed-batch fermentation, so totally 34 times higher than that for GS115EG11 was achieved by screening of high Zeocin resistant clone and high cell density fermentation.

However, the use of this scheme in an FDDI network may lead to an over-allocation of synchronous bandwidth to a network node, which may in turn cause the deadline of a synchronous message that can actually be guaranteed in practice to be misjudged otherwise by the existing theoretical method.

Protons of precise energies from a Van de Graaff accelerator impinged on a thin LiF target to produce neutrons in narrow energy bands. A coincidence was detected between the recoiling proton in the plastic scintillator and the elastically scattered neutron in a liquid scintillator. The energy of the recoil proton was determined by the elastic scattering kinematics, with the scattered neutron energy precisely determined by time of flight. The results are compared with previous measurements of the response of similar plastic scintillators in the energy region where they overlap.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["42"]}
{"title": "Improving short-term voltage stability problems by variable-speed air-conditioners\n", "abstract": " In recent years, air-conditioners have been increasing greatly and consuming larger portion of energy. At the same time, with the development of frequency converter technique, variable-speed air-conditioners have occupied more and more market share, not only because of the better energy efficiency, but also the improved comforts. Meanwhile, frequency converters can alleviate negative influences of induction motors on power system during voltage disturbance, which will do much help to the grid. Therefore, with logical control on frequency converters, performance will be better encountered in grid failure. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the above-mentioned effects of frequency converter by simulation, and to postpone the stalling of induction motor by resorting to logical control on converters.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["42"]}

How to establish train braking process model and determine the effective braking control strategy is the foundation of achieving the safe and reliable operation of the train. By taking the CRH2 -300 Electric Multiple Unit(EMU) as an example, based on the train braking process operation characteristics and brake deceleration mode curve, multiple models description method for its braking process have been developed with the data-driven modeling. And the efficiency of model is verified with China train control system level 3(CTCS-3). Simulation results show the established braking process model is suitable not only for the common brake but also has high tracking accuracy for the emergency brake. Furthermore, the model is satisfied with requirement of emergency braking distance that\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["42"]}
{"title": "Application of seismic facies and attributes analysis on the identification of Permian igneous rock\n", "abstract": " Seismic facies and attributes analysis techniques are introduced. The geological characteristics of some oil fields in western China are used in conjunction with drilling results and logging data to identify the lithology, intrusion periods, and distribution range of the Permian igneous rocks in this area. The lithologic classification, the vertical and horizontal distribution, and the intrusion periods of igneous rock were deduced through this study. Combining seismic facies and attributes analysis based on optimization can describe the igneous rock in detail. This is an efficient way to identify lithology and intrusion periods. Using geological data and GR\u0393\u00c7\u00f4DT logging cross-plots the Permian igneous rock from TP to TT was divided into three periods. The lithology of the first period is tuff and clasolite with a thickness ranging from 18 to 80\u252c\u00e1ms. The second is basalt with a thickness ranging from 0 to 20\u252c\u00e1ms.

{"title": "Obtaining farm animal embryos in vitro\n", "abstract": " This paper reviews the basic knowledge about obtaining farm animal embryos in vitro with special focus on differences among species and application of this procedure in the future. In vitro production of farm animal embryos consists of in vitro maturation (IVM) of oocytes, in vitro fertilization (IVF) of matured oocytes, and in vitro culture (IVC) of embryos. Oocytes can be collected from live animals (by laparotomy, laparoscopy, Ovum Pick Up) or from slaughtered ones (by puncture, sectioning). Usually immature oocytes are isolated, and during IVM they reach maturity. Matured oocytes are cultured with sperm (IVF), leading to the formation of zygotes. In the case of fertilization problems (horse, pig), intracytoplasmic sperm injection is used. The zygotes are usually cultured (IVC) to the morula and blastocyst stages. These embryos can be transferred to recipients or frozen/vitrified. Offspring have been obtained after\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["42"]}

Five diseases, including Rhizopus fruit rot and anthracnose fruit rot, have been recorded in Taiwan (2). In 2003, brown lesions were observed on mature or harvested fruits at the Chiayi Agricultural Experiment Branch. The disease caused fruits to collapse and was easily distinguished from anthracnose and Rhizopus fruit rot. In the field, Rhizopus fruit rot was characterized by black flocci sporangia and mycelia covering the flowers and young fruits. Lasiodiplodia fruit rot often occurred on mature or wounded fruit and diseased fruit were covered with gray or black flat mycelia under humid conditions. In the early stage of Lasiodiplodia fruit rot, tiny yellow-brown lesions appeared on the peel. The lesions could rapidly expand to 10 cm in diameter within 5 days and became dark brown with a light margin.

The angular distribution of the exploding fragments, therefore, reflects the degree of the alignment of molecules before ionization. Using the same femtosecond laser with intensity below the ionization threshold, the alignment of C2H4 molecules was also observed.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["42"]}

Firstly, legacy COBOL code is transferred into WSL, which is an intermediate language. Secondly, WSL representation is restructured to eliminate GOTO statements. Then an object concept model is created by operating WSL representation. Finally, the collaboration diagrams are constructed based on this object concept model.

Using drying potato sample formed cylindrically, the elasticity and viscosity coefficient were obtained with a stress-relaxation experiment by a generalized Maxwell's model. A model of simultaneous heat and moisture transfer in a cylindrical sample was coupled with the virtual work principle applicable to a body undergoing shrinkage deformation.

In particular, we match a software program with a pre-defined domain knowledge base in the representation of a simplified semantic network that we have proposed in order to link the source program with its domain-level interpretation.

Only 10.3% of the anemic patients were treated with chalybeate therapy before surgical procedures, and the proportion was 22.7% after the operation. More than 50% of anemic patient received blood transfusion. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer-related anemia is a common clinical manifestation in patients with gastrointestinal cancer, and anemia occurs more frequently in elder and patients with right colon\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["42"]}
{"title": "Estimation of reliability and cost relationship for architecture-based software\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we propose a new method to estimate the relationship between software reliability and software development cost taking into account the complexity for developing the software system and the size of software intended to develop during the implementation phase of the software development life cycle. On the basis of estimated relationship, a set of empirical data has been used to validate the correctness of the proposed model by comparing the result with the other existing models. The outcome of this work shows that the method proposed here is a relatively straightforward one in formulating the relationship between reliability and cost during implementation phase.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["42"]}
{"title": "Synthesis and insecticidal activities of new ether-derivatives of celangulin-V\n", "abstract": " In order to find new biorational pesticides, eight new 6-substituted ether derivatives of Celangulin-V were synthesized. The structures were confirmed by IR, 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopic and HRMS analyses. The insecticidal activities of these compounds were tested against third-instar larvae of Mythimna separata. Four derivatives (b, c, f, g) showed higher insecticidal activities than Celangulin-V, with KD50 values of 135.9, 101.33, 169.0 and 219.2 \u256c\u255dg.g-1, respectively. However, two compounds (a, d) showed lower insecticidal activities and two (e, h) no activity. The results suggest that C-6 substitutions in these compounds are very important for their insecticidal activities. The insecticidal activities of the derivatives with two or three carbon substitutions at C-6 are higher than that of Celangulin-V showing that this compound has the potential to be a lead structure for semi-synthetic, green insecticides.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["42"]}
{"title": "Influence of LT-GaN nucleation layer on the structural and optical properties of MOVPE-grown a-plane GaN\n", "abstract": " The influence of the LT-GaN nucleation layer on the quality of the GaN template was investigated by the study of the surface morphology of the nucleation layer, and of the crystalline and optical properties of the subsequently grown a-plane GaN template. Both X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence results reveal that better crystalline and optical quality could be obtained using thinner nucleation layer thickness and higher V/III ratio, leading to brighter near band edge luminescence as compared to films grown on lower V/III ratio nucleation layer. Our experiments indicate that reduction in the density of nucleation layer islands can effectively improve the crystalline quality of a-plane GaN template, and the V/III ratio of nucleation layer is a more dominant growth parameter to improve the crystalline and optical quality at the same time. The optimized growth parameters for the nucleation layer in our study are thickness\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["42"]}
{"title": "Optical probing of electric fields with an electro-acoustic effect toward integrated circuit diagnosis\n", "abstract": " Electro-optic probing of electric fields has been considered as a promising approach for integrated circuit diagnosis. However, the method is subject to relatively weak voltage sensitivity. In this Letter, we solve the problems with electro-acoustic effect. In contrast to the general electro-optic effect, the light phase modulation induced by the acoustic effect is 2 orders of magnitude stronger at its resonant frequency, as we observed in a GaAs thin film probe. Furthermore, this what we believe to be a novel method shows a highly reproducible linearity between the detected signals and the input voltages, which facilitates the voltage calibration.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["42"]}
{"title": "Collaborative virtual surgery: Techniques, applications and challenges\n", "abstract": " While considerable effort has been dedicated to improve medical education with virtual reality based surgical simulators, relatively little attention is given to the simulation of the collaborative procedures in distributed environments. In this paper, we first present a literature review of techniques involved in the development of collaborative simulators, including network architecture, transmission protocol, collaboration mechanism, schedule algorithm, collaborative user-interaction feature and haptic communication. We introduce the details of each technique and discuss the advantages and drawbacks. Then, we review some of the existing applications to illustrate how to apply these techniques to implement an efficient and robust collaborative simulator. Finally, we discuss the challenges that need to be addressed in the future.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["42"]}
{"title": "Modulation of typhoon genesis over the western North Pacific by intraseasonal oscillation\n", "abstract": " The intraseasonal oscillation (ISO) is studied for the years of less or more typhoon genesis from 1979 to 2006. It is indicated that the ISO strongly affects the typhoon genesis. In the years of more typhoon genesis, the ISO was weak in the area to the west of the Philippines; at the same time, the ISO was strong in the area to the east of it, with significant northwestward propagation. In this situation, the Walker cell seemed to shift gradually westward from the tropical western Pacific to the tropical eastern Indian Ocean, and then convergent winds appeared in the lower atmosphere while divergent winds in the upper atmosphere, suggesting the presence of enhanced ascending flow in favor of typhoon genesis. Moreover, in the years of less typhoon genesis, the ISO gradually became stronger with a significant eastward propagation from the eastern Indian Ocean to the area around 120 E. During these years, the Walker circulation gradually moved eastward, and then the divergent winds in the upper and lower atmosphere were not favorable for the typhoon genesis in the Western North Pacific.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["42"]}

{"title": "Synthesis of Li_3V_2 (PO_4) _3 by Calcination under the Carbon Protection [J]\n", "abstract": " Since the vanadium (V) with a valency of three is very unstable and is easy to be oxidized into V with valency of five, at present, most Li3V2 (PO4) 3 are prepared with its precursor calcination conducted under the protection of inert or reductive atmosphere. In order to avoid the high production cost caused by the formation of the inert or reductive atmosphere and the danger of happing explosion caused by using H2 as the reductive atmosphere, a new Li3V2 (PO4) 3 production route with its precursor calcination process protected by carbon was proposed. The precursor immersed in carbon powder before its calcination will be protected by the carbon and the reductive atmosphere of CO during calcination, since the carbon can be oxidized firstly and at the same time can produce the reductive gas CO. The experiments show that the proposed production route of carbon protection is effective. Using carbon protection, after calcination at 800\u0393\u00e4\u00e2 for 10 h, the pure phase Li3V2 (PO4) 3 can be obtained, and the Li3V2 (PO4) 3 with slight impurities will be obtain when the calcination was conducted at 700~ 750\u0393\u00e4\u00e2. It was found that the above mentioned impurities in Li3V2 (PO4) 3 can improve the electrochemical performance of the Li3V2 (PO4) 3 produced.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["42"]}

The removal performance of ammonium sulfate obtained was very satisfactory. The optimal cation and anion membranes were found. The removal efficiencies were influenced by voltage, initial concentration, flow rate and temperature. High voltage and high temperature are beneficial to this separation process, but high fluid flow rate and concentrated initial concentration prolong the operation time required to achieve the target value. It was found that the optimal outlet concentration is 1\u0393\u00c7\u00ebg/L, since the operation time is prolonged almost two\u0393\u00c7\u00c9fold if the outlet concentration is decreased from 1\u0393\u00c7\u00ebg/L to 0.5\u0393\u00c7\u00ebg/L.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["42"]}

METHODS: The fallopian tubes embolization was performed on 46 hydrosalpinx patients. First, the hysterosalpingography was performed to show the positions and shape of the hydrosalpinx. Then the hydrops was drawn into the celiac cavity in order to be absorbed after performing fallopian tube recanalization. Finally, transvaginal therapy was performed, putting the embolization microcoils into the fallopian tube through a micro-catheter One month after the fallopian tubes embolization, hysterosalpingography was conducted to check for the effectiveness of the embolization. After 3 months, all the 46 patients received the treatment of IVF-ET. RESULTS: The interventional treatment of 82 fallopian tubes obtained one time success among 46 cases of fallopian tubes embolization. Among them, obvious results were achieved in 72 fallopian tubes, taking up 88% of the total; effective results were seen in 10 fallopian tubes, accounting for 12% of the total. No one was invalid. In the same period, compared with the 91 cases of non-hydrosalpinx as the control group, the embolization group of patients achieved a higher fertilization rate (69%), and clinical pregnancy rate (41%), compared with the control group (63% and 39% respectively), but without a significant difference (P> 0.05). However, the ectopic pregnancy rate (0) and the abortion rate (8%) were significantly lower than the control group (8%, 16% respectively; P< 0.05).

{"title": "Influences of air/liquid mass flow rate on spray combustion produced by effervescent atomizer\n", "abstract": " Spray characteristics of an effervescent atomizer, including drop size distribution and droplets velocity profiles downstream were studied with Dual PDA. The velocity profiles of spray are similar at all experimental conditions, but the cone angle becomes slightly smaller under high liquid mass flow rate and low air/liquid mass flow rate (RAL). With the increase of RAL, Sauter mean drop sizes become smaller at the same liquid mass flow rate, but the average drop size is less than 15 \u256c\u255dm. Photographs of flame reveal that RAL influences the length of spray flame apparently. The lower the RAL, the bigger the droplets, and the longer the flame.

The pores were generated by introduction of a siliceous material into the precursor of the catalyst and then removal of the material by reaction with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. During the reaction, the formation and escape of a volatile gas (SiF4) from the precursor enlarged the surface area of the chromium fluoride. This process provided for the first time a porous chromium fluoride with a surface area of 187 m2/g and a pore volume of 0.58 cm3/g. Furthermore, the porous chromium fluoride exhibited excellent chemical stability in the presence of HCl, HF, and F2. It was catalytically active for halogen exchange in a fixed-bed fluorination reaction, and it exhibited excellent catalytic performance in mitigating the coke formation on the surface of the catalyst during vapor-phase catalytic fluorination.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["42"]}

So, this paper uses the definition and property of absolute correlation degree of the grey system theory and presents an improvable computation method of absolute correlation degree.

METHODS: Eight patients with major burn, complicated by invasive burn wound infection and sepsis, were consecutively admitted to our hospital from September 1997 to October 1998. Resting energy expenditures (REEs) were monitored by means of cardiorespiratory diagnostic system (Medical Graphics Corporation, USA) at patients' bedside. Plasma concentration of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha, and LPS were assayed before and after surgical intervention and at the time when the patients' vital signs became stable. Correlation analysis between REEs and IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha, and LPS were made, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 8 treated patients survived. Values of REE before surgical intervention were significantly higher than those after surgical intervention (P< 0.01), and when patients' vital signs became stable the values were significantly lower than those after surgical intervention (P< 0.01). The plasma concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha, and LPS after excision of invasive burn wound infection were significantly lower than those before surgical intervention (P< 0.05).

The inconsistency of the analysis/synthesis in the WI speech coder is removed by a new method, using the Gabor transform or the cosine modulated lapped transform. Perfect reconstruction of the speech is then guaranteed. Instead of using a time-varying transform, the speech signal is time-warped and pitch-synchronized operation is achieved by a time-invariant transform.

The solution of EYHBV-TF was then administered orally in normal mice, and the specific cellular immune activity induced was assayed with delayed type skin hypersensitivity test (DTH), with the non-specific immune activity assessed with immune organ index. The immune responses induced by oral EYHBV-STF solution were compared with those by EYHBV-STF injection and by different dosages (injection and oral) of porcine spleen HBV-specific transfer factor (PSHBV-STF), porcine spleen nonspecific transfer factor, and egg yolk extracts from non-immunized hens. RESULTS: The prepared EYHBV-STF oral solution, which met the standards for biological products, could inhibit leukocyte adhesion in vitro and significantly enhance mouse foot pad swelling, demonstrating its capability of transferring antigen-specific delayed type hypersensitivity reactions to naive recipient. EYHBV-STF oral solution also significantly improved the immune organ index in mice (P< 0 01) with similar effects to those caused by EYHBV-STF injections and by PSHBV-STF injection and oral solution. CONCLUSION: Orally administered EYHBV-STF and EYHBV-STF injection both possess\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["42"]}

The velocity of debris flows can be divided into surface velocity and internal velocity. The surface velocity of debris flows has been researched widely while the internal velocity is minimally researched because there is no available method for measuring internal velocity. In this paper, we developed two methods for measuring the internal velocity of debris flows in laboratory. One method is using impact pressure detecting, and the other is using shear forces detecting. In the former method, the internal velocity is calculated by the impact pressure detected by pressure sensors according to the relationship between velocity and kinetic pressure. In the later method, the internal velocity is calculated using the distance between two detecting sections and the time difference between the two waveforms of shear forces measured at both sections.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["42"]}

For 315 cases with CIN who had received either conization, hysterectomy or modified radical hysterectomy between April 2004 and Nov 2006, the recurrence after surgery was recorded. Results: 315 cases were diagnosed with CIN by biopsy. Of 232 cases who received conization, the surgical pathology was negative in 22 cases, had higher grade pathology than biopsy in 36 case and invasive cancer in 20 cases. In 83 cases that received hysterectomy or modified radical hysterectomy, the surgical pathology was negative in 4 cases and had invasive cancer in 4 cases. There were 5 recurrent cases in 214 cases with CIN who were treated by conization. Conclusions: The biopsy could not give an accurate diagnosis in cervical disease. For the patients with CIN, we should first treat it with conization.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["42"]}

The results indicate that the microstructure of low carbon bainitic steel consists of quasi-polygonal ferrite, granular bainite and lath bainite of different proportion and size for different cooling process. As air cooling after rolling, the microstructure of specimen consists of mainly quasi-polygonal ferrite and granular bainite with low strength and moderate ductility. As water-cooling after rolling, the microstructure of specimen is composed of mainly lath bainite with high strength and low elongation. As oil quenching after rolling, the microstructure of quasi-polygonal ferrite, granular bainite, lath bainite and acicular ferrite is observed in the specimen with higher strength and preferable ductility. As firstly water-cooling after rolling to 531\u0393\u00e4\u00e2 and then air cooling to room temperature, the microstructure of specimen consists of mainly granular bainite with high yield strength and high ratio of yield strength to tensile strength.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["42"]}

{"title": "An empirical study of a reverse engineering method for the aggregation relationship based on operation propagation\n", "abstract": " One of the major obstacles in reverse engineering legacy object-oriented systems is the identification of aggregation relationships. An aggregation relationship, also called whole\u0393\u00c7\u00f4part relationship, is a form of association relationship where an object is considered as a part of another object. This characteristic is mostly of semantic nature; therefore, it is difficult to distinguish aggregation from association relationships by implementation mechanism. Most reverse engineering methods for aggregation relationships are based on the lifetime dependence of an object on another object since many implementations of aggregation relationships result in such dependence. However, research literature shows that lifetime dependence is not really a primary property of the aggregation relationships. A reverse engineering approach is proposed on the basis of a primary characteristic for aggregation relationship\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["42"]}

Experiments showed that for the Si0.8Ge0.2 films grown in the micron size windows by molecular beam epitaxy, both the strain and the dislocation density would be less than that of the film grown at the large area of the same substrate, as the film thickness was over the critical thickness for pesudomorphic growth.

METHODS: TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling and immunohistochemistry were used to study cell apoptosis and expression of MCL-1 proteins and survivin proteins in 43 patients with B-NHL and 10 with reactive hyperplasia (RH) lymphoid tissue. RESULTS: The positive rate of MCL-1 proteins and survivin proteins was 58.1%(25/43) and 69.8%(30/43) respectively. The expression of MCL-1 proteins was not detected in RH lymphoid tissue, but that of survivin was detected in 10.0%(1/10). The expression of MCL-1 proteins in aggressive B-NHL was higher than that in indolent B-NHL (70.0% vs 30.8%, P< 0.05). The expression of survivin in aggressive B-NHL was also higher than that in indolent B-NHL (80.0% vs 46.2%, P< 0.05). Apoptotic index (AI) was not correlated positively with the expression of MCL-1, but correlated positively with the expression of survivin (r= 0.429, P< 0.01). MCL-1 and survivin were correlated positively in B-NHL (r= 0.598, P< 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: MCL-1 proteins as family member of BCL-2 have no influence on apoptosis but survivin may participate in the regulation mechanism of B-NHL apoptosis. It is indicated that the two proteins with a close relationship may take part in the development and progression of B-NHL.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["42"]}

As the other parameters of ions keep unchanged, the larger the ion radius, the more the molar delta((H2O)-O-17) of the ion is. With the same outer electron structure of ion, the more the ion charge, the more the molar delta((H2O)-O-17) of the ion is.

{"title": "\" Fly Dots\" Spreading Model of SARS along Transportation\n", "abstract": " In the beginning of this year, SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) broke out and spread in mainland of China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and other countries, regions successively. The world, especially China, pays high attentions on this public hygiene safety affair and takes various measures to prevent and control the further spreading of SARS. This work began in early April in this background. At this time, the SARS began to spread to Beijing and northern regions of China, but the situation in southern regions, such as Guangdong and Hong Kong is relative stable. The data about SARS spreading, special cases and sources in these regions are available. Through these information, we found the spreading characteristic of SARS has a distinct one besides other common ones, namely, jumped sperad between two points in long distance. This characteristic can not be singly described by the diffusion models for point sources. Pointed to this, a\" fly dots\" spreading model along transportation is put forward in this paper, which takes the vehicle as a scale and sets up SARS spreading model in the relative sealed vehicle. Based on this model, in a scale of the transportation, the spatial spreading of SARS due to flow of passengers is modeled. We simulatde the danger probability of SARS sperading, three cases reported in internet, and the affect of Beijing SARS epidemic situation to in Hebei province due to flow of passengers. The results show that this model meets the spacial spreading characteristic of SARS.

Such statements are dead statements and have no influence on the programs except making them more difficult to analyse and understand. Since the execution of concurrent programs is non-deterministic, it is hard to detect dead statements. In this paper, we develop a data flow approach to detect dead statements for concurrent Ada programs. In this method, concurrent Ada programs are represented by concurrent control flow graphs in a simple and precise way, and detecting rules are extracted by analysing program behaviours.

{"title": "Polarimetric SAR Surface Parameters Inversion Based on Neural Network\n", "abstract": " Surface parameters inversion by using Polarimetric SAR includes the inversion of the soil surface permeability, correlation length and RMS height. The retrieval of scattering parameters can be viewed as a mapping problem from the domain of measured signals to the range of surface/medium characteristics that quantify the observed medium. To date, parameter inversion has been based largely on empirical models. Empirical models have usually avoided the nonuniqueness problem by limiting the validity of the model to a single parameter and a narrow range. This limit on the range of validity requires that multiple empirical models be created-one model for each parameter. In this study, the Spaceborn Imaging Radar SIR-C data at L and C band was used to perform the inversion of bare surface parameters. A BP neural network based on IEM model was developed to carry out the inversion, and a test method was also developed.

The problem under consideration is encountered in the design of Direct Feed Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFC). The test section was a horizontally oriented rectangular transparent (Lucite material) channel with its lower wall consisting of a porous plate. Liquid was fed into the test section from its entrance, while gas was injected uniformly into the test section along the lower porous sidewall. The visual study shows the typical flow patterns found in the test section include bubbly flow, plug flow, slug flow, and annular flow. However, unlike the conventional co-current two-phase flow in a channel with gas and liquid uniformly entering from one of its ends, for the flow configuration considered in this work, it was found that two\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["42"]}

The X-ray {0 0 0 2} and {1 0 1 \u2560\u00e4 0} pole figures show that the orientation relationships between cubic GaN and hexagonal inclusions are (1 1 1)//(0 0 0 1),< 1 1 2>//1 0 1 \u2560\u00e4 0. The distribution of hexagonal inclusions mainly results from the interfacial bonding disorder in the grain boundaries parallel to hexagonal< 0 0 0 1> directions and the lattice mismatch in< 0 0 0 1> directions on {1 0 1 \u2560\u00e4 0} planes. In order to reduce the energy increase in cubic epilayers, hexagonal lamellas with smaller sizes in< 0 0 0 1> directions often nucleate inside the buffer layer or near the interface between the buffer layer and the epitaxial layer, and penetrate through the whole epitaxial layer with this orientation relationship.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["42"]}

Though several papers gave some literal description that the axes of fiber pair should be perpendicular to the reflector, few of them put forward a precise model and quantitative analysis. Just thinking about this, the mathematical model on this effect is established. The simulation curves with different obliquity of the reflector are computed and plotted.

Both the original code and obtained ER diagrams are used by semantic interface analysis. Reusable components are annotated with conditions which are needed for checking suitability and are saved in a reuse library for reuse and reengineering. Our method is demonstrated in detail through an example in this paper.

Interestingly, this new chitinase naturally binds calcium ions with high capacity and low affinity, suggesting that PSC is a Ca-storage protein. Analysis of the amino acid sequence showed that this enzyme is rich in acidic amino acid residues, especially Asp, which are responsible for calcium binding. Different from other known chitinases, PSC is located in the stroma of amyloplasts in pomegranate seeds. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis indicated that the embryonic cells of pomegranate seeds are rich in calcium ions, most of which are distributed in the stroma and the starch granule of the amyloplasts, consistent with the above idea that PSC is involved in calcium storage, a newly non-defensive function.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["42"]}

With a biotinylated extracellular fragment of human cancer stem cell surface marker CD133 as the target protein, the CD133 high-affinity peptides were screened from the phage peptide library by liquid phase panning. The clones with high-binding force with human CD133 were then identified by sandwich ELISA and their single-stranded DNA was extracted to test the specificity by competitive ELISA. The amino acid sequences of the selected peptides derived from the phage DNA sequences were synthesized after sequence alignment analysis, and their capacity of binding with colorectal carcinoma cells was assessed by immunofluorescence technique. After 4 rounds of liquid phase selection, the phages capable of specific binding with human CD133 were effectively enriched, with an enrichment ratio of 388 times compared to that at the fourth and first rounds. Thirteen out of the 20 clones from the fourth round of panning were identified as positive clones, among which 11 had identical amino acid sequence of TISWPPR, and 2 had the sequence of STTKLAL, and the former sequence showed a stronger binding specificity to CD133.

{"title": "Model selection with information complexity in multiple linear regression modeling\n", "abstract": " University of Kentucky University of Tennessee This paper aims to introduce to applied researchers a new family of information model selection criteria in multiple linear regression models. These criteria are known as information complexity (ICOMP) criteria. The paper provides supportive evidence under the R language to show the effectiveness of ICOMP and its tendency to outperform some other traditional criteria: AIC, SBC, etc. This paper also creates a framework on which to base future work in applying ICOMP to more general regression modeling problems in R. he selection of an appropriate model from a potentially large class of candidate models is an issue that is central to regression, time series modeling, and generalized linear models (McQuarrie & Tsai, 1998). In multiple linear regression, statistical model evaluation and selection involves evaluating a pool of subsets of predictors and selecting the best subset that predicts the response with sufficient accuracy from predictor variables that can be measured cheaply (Miller, 2002). Given a large number of predictor variables, the hope is to identify a small subset of them that gives adequate prediction accuracy for a reasonable cost of measurement. On the other hand, it is well known that, for multiple linear regression models fitted using least squares, the variance of the predicted response values increases monotonically with the number of predictor variables used in the prediction equation, and this increased prediction variability is traded off against reduced prediction bias. The question of how this trade-off should be handled is a critical problem in this field of subset selection in multiple\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["42"]}

{"title": "Analytical target cascading for optimal configuration of production service systems\n", "abstract": " Product Service System (PSS) advocates an innovative business mode where manufacturers provide products in the form of services instead of mere entity offerings. This mode not only enhances the utilization rate of products and resources, but also improves the service levels throughout the whole product lifecycle. PSS extension to manufacturing environment results in Production Service System (PnSS), which forms a hierarchically organized service-oriented manufacturing alliance composed of manufacturers/suppliers with various production service capabilities to collaborate a customer order. The process of selecting the optimal production service providers for a PnSS is called Production Service System Configuration (PnSSC). It is difficult to apply a centralized optimization method for a PnSSC problem because the members participating into the PnSS are uncertain while most of them are not willing\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["42"]}

A comprehensive literature review of human-computer interaction and gesture interface development is given. The study aims to reveal the effect of gesture interaction on human performance and to identify possible design failures. As a result, it reveals that a sensor system has a great impact on human performance in terms of longer cursor movement distances, longer movement time and greater arm and shoulder fatigue in comparison with a mouse. It will investigate whether the malfunctions of the hardware and software of gesture interfaces can produce discrete cursor movement. In such a situation, the actual working area and the joint ranges are lengthy and away from those that had been planned.

The results indicate that the whole PRD region can be divided into three homogeneous regions with different formation mechanisms. The optimal distribution functions for the three homogeneous regions and the non-homogenous regions are found to be not identical. The flood frequency of the whole PRD region gradually decreases from upstream (inland river regions) to downstream (coastal regions). This suggests that the coastal regions have a greater chance of flood disasters than the upper and middle reaches.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["42"]}

Laboratory experiments were performed to investigate the influence of temperature and pH on the distribution of aluminum species applying alum synthetic water. Aluminum species studied in the experiments included monomeric aluminum, soluble aluminum, suspended aluminum, and polymeric aluminum, which were determined by fluorescence spectrophotometry method. Results indicated that suspended aluminum was the major species at pH 6.5, occupied about 62.2% in the total aluminum mass concentration. While at pH above 7.0, monomeric aluminum was the major species; and varied little as reaction time increased. Polymeric aluminum mass concentration was low at studied water quality condition and also varied little as reaction time increased. The influence of temperature on aluminum species distribution was similar to solution pH; and both could be explained by pOH. Aluminum species in drinking water could be controlled by adjusting the pOH value, which provided theoretical guidance for the operation of the water distribution system and aluminum toxicity control.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["42"]}

DAMP molecules can be recognized by Toll like receptors, Nod1-like receptors, or Rig-I like receptors and induce autoimmunity or immune tolerance, which play critical roles in various chronic diseases such as arthritis, atherosclerosis, cancer and systemic lupus erythematosus. DAMP molecules include high-mobility group B protein 1, heat shock proteins and S100 proteins etc. The identification of DAMP molecules and clarification of mechanisms of their action will greatly contribute to reveal the pathological mechanisms of chronic diseases and provide a great opportunity to develop the new strategies for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment for these diseases.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["42"]}

This circuit is capable of converting a weak current into a frequency signal for amperometric measurements with high precision and further delivering a 10-bit digital output. A fast stabilization-enhanced potentiostat has been proposed in the design, which is used to maintain a constant bias potential for amperometric biochemical sensors. A technique based on source voltage shifting that reduces the leakage current of the MOS transistor to the reverse diode leakage level at room temperature was employed in the circuit. The chip was fabricated in the 0.35 \u256c\u255dm chartered CMOS process, with a single 3.3 V power supply. The interface circuit maintains a dynamic range of more than 100 dB. Currents from 1 pA to 300 nA can be detected with a maximum nonlinearity of 0.3% over the full scale.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["42"]}
{"title": "False Positive Item set Algorithm for Incremental Association Rule Discovery\n", "abstract": " In a dynamic database where the new transaction are inserted into the database, keeping patterns up-to-date and discovering new pattern are challenging problems of great practical importance. This may introduce new association rules and some existing association rules would become invalid. Thus, the maintenance of association rules for dynamic database is an important problem. In this paper, false positive itemset algorithm, which is an incremental algorithm, is proposed to deal with this problem. The proposed algorithm uses maximum support count of 1-itemsets obtained from previous mining to estimate infrequent itemsets, called false positive itemsets, of an original database. False positive itemsets will capable of being frequent itemsets when new transactions are inserted into an original database. This can reduce a number of times to scan an original database. This paper also proposes a new updating and pruning algorithm that guarantee to find all frequent itemsets of an updated database efficiently. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has a good performance.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["42"]}

However the efficiency of the grid system is still required improvement because exchanging certificates and verifying validity are compulsory in the authentication procedure. In this paper, we propose a novel authentication architecture for grid Security (AAGS), which adopts seeded secret key and combine key technique and employs the features of conic curves over the residue class ring Z n  into the authentication security, and we give precise definitions of the grid infrastructural protocols for AAGS. Compared with the SAP (SSL Authentication Protocol) in the GSI, AAGS is more efficient and convenient for its implementation, which contributes to the larger grid scalability and may be regarded as an optimized authentication approach of the grid security infrastructure.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["42"]}

{"title": "Recent studies on molecular mechanisms involved in mammalian sperm capacitation: A review\n", "abstract": " Sperm capacitation is a physiological event that allows sperm to bind and fuse with the oocyte. Changes associated with this process include removal of cholesterol from the plasma membrane, increases in pH and Ca+ 2, activation of first and second messenger cascades, an increase in respiration and subsequent changes in the sperm motility pattern. The most significant change in sperm after capacitation is its ability to undergo the acrosome reaction. The purpose of this review is to present some recent achievements towards understanding the molecular mechanisms of mammalian sperm capacitation. The review focuses on regulation of sperm function by seminal plasma derived first messengers, ie fertilizationpromoting peptide (FPP), adenosine, calcitonin and angiotensin II, acting to affect production of a second messenger, cAMP.

Although the RBAC model has been well accepted, it turns out to have some problems in applying RBAC to an existing system: an existing system is generally not organised in roles; it is very hard to add the access control functions to each module of an existing system.

Four Al-based coagulants and simulated raw water were used in the laboratory to investigate the aluminium transformation in coagulation, sedimentation and filtration processes. It is the use of Al-based coagulants that contributes more to the increase of the residual aluminium for the low-turbidity raw water, while the Al-based coagulants, especially the polymeric aluminium coagulants, work to remove the aluminium from the high-turbidity raw water. In the case of traditional coagulants, the increase of the turbidity or the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration in the raw water results in a high concentration of Al(C\u0393\u00c7\u00eb+\u0393\u00c7\u00ebS).

Thereby automatic information extraction and in put techniques are demanded (1)(2) and increasing em phasis is being placed on the realization of computer based systems, which are able to analysis printed doc uments automatically.

{"title": "A review of existing interfaces of automated examination and lecture scheduling systems\n", "abstract": " The development of automated examination and lecture scheduling systems currently available has tended to be concentrated upon the construction of a solution by automating the elimination of constraints by algorithmic means. The interface presented to the user often appears to be almost an afterthought. Little recognition is usually shown to the fact that significant work may still have to be done to ensure that the solution can be realized as a working timetable. This would usually involve a series of drop and drag operations. Often, for instance, certain constraints on particular events may have to be relaxed or hardened after the construction of a solution for sound institutional reasons [1, 2, 3]. Also, on the occasion when exams are unable to be scheduled by the automated process, little information is available on where they can be placed in the finished solution. As a substantial amount of time and effort within institutions are devoted to this manual intervention in the construction of a timetable [3, 4] it is quite surprising that software producers in this area have not provided more tools available for the manipulation of the final results.

Analysis of the Petri net can then reveal important information about the structure and dynamic behaviour of the modeled system, which can be used to evaluate the modeled system and suggest improvements or changes. This feature can be used in software maintenance. We propose a method for developing a Predicate/Transition net (PrT net) for software maintenance, whereby, software components are reverse engineered and annotated with formal predicates, transformed into a PrT net, and analysed on the PrT net.

{"title": "High Level Synthesis using Learning Automata Genetic Algorithm.\n", "abstract": " High-level synthesis consists of many interdependent tasks such as scheduling, allocation and binding. All tasks in high-level synthesis are NP-complete and the design objectives are in conflict for nature, most of the already proposed approaches are not efficient in the exploration of the design space and not effective in the identification of different trade-offs. For these reasons, genetic algorithms can be considered as good candidates to tackle such difficult explorations. A new algorithm that named Learning Automata Genetic Algorithm (LAGA) is used in this paper to perform scheduling and allocation concurrently. This algorithm is based on the Genetic Algorithm, the difference is that the Learning Process is added to the Genetic Algorithm. This strategy can complete the scheduling and the allocation effectively in the high-level synthesis under certain time and resource constraints. This algorithm is implemented in C language and is tested finally on a number of DSP benchmarks, and the test results then are compared with those obtained from four other different techniques which are commonly used in high-level synthesis. The experimental results show that the high-level synthesis using the LAGA algorithm is very effective, especially under the area constraint.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["42"]}

The research results showed that, with the addition of Fusarium sp., some looser and more porous manganese-electrolytic residues could be obtained. And after 47 hours, the leaching rate reached to 84% which was 2.30 times higher than that leached by individual organic acid even after 130 hours; the leaching rate of manganese and the concentrations of organic acids increased at the initial stage and then decreased, while pH was the reversed.

{"title": "The correlation between osteopontin and metastasis of hepatic Echinococcus multilocularis infection\n", "abstract": " OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression and distribution of osteopontin (OPN) in Echinococcus multilocularis cyst, and explore the role of OPN in the metastasis of hepatic E. multilocularis infection. METHODS: Forty gerbils were infected with 20% E. multilocularis suspension (0.1 ml per gerbil) through abdominal opening injection in liver. Gerbils were sacrificed at 100 days postinfection for observing the growth and metastasis of hepatic echinococcus cyst. The liver, hepatic echinococcus cyst and metastasis tissue were observed on HE stain; the expression of OPN were measured by immunohistochemistry staining (SP method). RESULTS: E. multilocularis were spread over the liver and abdominal cavity. Expression of OPN was found at different degree in echinococcus cysts. The positive expression rate of OPN in echinococcus cysts was 70%(28/40). OPN was mainly distributed in the germinal layer, inflammatory cells and some liver cells. 60%(24/40) occurred thoracic lymph node metastases. The OPN expression rate in hepatic echinococcus cysts with thoracic lymph node metastases (83%, 20/24) was significantly higher than that of hepatic echinococcus cysts without thoracic lymph node metastases (50%, 8/16)(P< 0.05). The positive expression of OPN in lymph node metastases (92%, 22/24) was higher than that of hepatic echinococcus cyst (70%, 28/40)(P< 0.05). CONCLUSION: Osteopontin mainly distributes in the germinal layer of hepatic echinococcus cyst and inflammatory cells, which might be involved in metastasis of hepatic E. multilocularis infection.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["42"]}

We tackle this problem by establishing a novel connection between the LT and the DFT based on matrix analysis. Specifically, for the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) with an arbitrary symmetric window, one of the most widely used LT, a sparse matrix representation for the conversion to and from the DFT is developed, leading to an efficient implementation in the form of low-order frequency domain FIR filtering. We give two example applications, MDCT domain group delay estimation and aliasing reduction for the temporal noise shaping (TNS).", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["42"]}

The experimental results showed that one typical periodic submicron ripple, whose periodicity changed with scanning velocity, was obtained when the irradiating energy was lower than the critical damage laser energy value. Another typical multiscale complex structure consisted of micron protrusions, submicron dimples and submicron short ripples, which were obtained when the irradiating energy was higher than the critical damage laser energy value. Wettability experiments revealed that the apparent contact angles on the surfaces of original stainless steel sample, the periodic submicron ripples and the multi-scale textures were 114, 148 and 162\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["42"]}

The structure of the complex was carefully characterized by FTIR, TG-DTG, 1 H NMR and 31 P NMR. FTIR results indicate that the synthesized complex is consisted of LiPF 6 and C 4 H 10 O 2. Chemical analysis shows that the content of LiPF 6 in the complex is about 45%, which could infer that the mole ratio of LiPF 6 and LiPF 6 (C 4 H 10 O 2) 2 in the complex is 1: 2. The results of 1 H NMR and 31 P NMR further confirm the composition of the complex and determine the structure. The molecular formula of the LiPF 6 complex is LiPF 6 (C 4 H 10 O 2) 2. Thermal analysis shows that the strong decomposition peaks of the complex appear at 75 C and 175 C.

{"title": "Transmission line inspires a new distributed algorithm to solve the nonlinear dynamical system of physical circuit\n", "abstract": " As known, physical circuits, e.g. integrated circuits or power system, work in a distributed manner, but these circuits could not be easily simulated in a distributed way. This is mainly because that, the dynamical system of physical circuits is nonlinear, and the linearized system of physical circuits is nonsymmetrical. This paper proposes a simple and natural strategy to mimic the distributed behavior of the physical circuit by mimicking the distributed behavior of the internal wires inside this circuit. Mimic Transmission Method (MTM) is a new distributed algorithm to solve the nonlinear ordinary differential equations extracted from physical circuits. It is a black-box algorithm. By mimicking the transmission lines, MTM seals the nonlinear dynamical system within the subcircuits and each subcircuit could be solved by SPICE on one processor.

METHODS: The gene fragments coding human and mouse sVEGFR2 were amplified with PCR and cloned into pVITRO2 to generate pVITRO2-hm-sVEGFR2 recombinant. The in vitro VEGF blocking effect of the pVITRO2-hm-sVEGFR2 expression products on HUVEC cells were evaluated. The anti-tumor effect of pVITRO2-hm-sVEGFR2 was studied in mouse B16 model. The microvessels were stained by using CD31 antibody. RESULTS: The co-expressing vector pVITRO2-hm-sVEGFR2 was constructed successfully, confirmed by the restriction endonuclease digestion and sequencing. The expressing products of pVITRO2-hm-sVEGFR2 could obviously block the function of VEGF on promoting the proliferation of HUVEC in vitro. The tumor growth in mice was also significantly inhibited by pVITRO2-hm-sVEGFR2 expression. CD31 staining demonstrated that the microvessel density obviously decreased in tumor tissues treated with pVITRO2-hm-sVEGFR2.

{"title": "Sea level change in coastal eastern Guangdong (Shanwei) in 1970\u0393\u00c7\u00f42009\n", "abstract": " The sea level change between 1970 and 2009 along the coast of Eastern Guangdong is investigated based on the tide data from the tidal gauges at Shanwei and Zhelang and sea level anomalies (SLA) data given by CNES. The data are compared with those of the South China Sea. It is shown that the trend of sea level change in the coastal Eastern Guangdong is relatively in accord with that of the South China Sea. They both present a seasonal change in the year, but have a time gap of 2-3 months. The sea level rise in the region has speeded up since 1970, and the rising trend has been more evident after 1987. The rising rate was 3.0 mm/a from 1987 to 2009. By using stochastic dynamic method, it is found that the SLA of Shanwei has cycles of annual, semi-annual, 4-month and 19a, with an annual swing of 10.6 cm. The sea level is significantly affected by the phenomenon of El Ni? o. There are more than 85% chances of low sea level phenomenon occurring in El Ni? o years, and vice versa in La Nina years. Furthermore, the seasonal variation is obvious, in which the lower sea level months are from March to August, and the higher from September to November. That is mainly caused by monsoon. By using curve fitting analysis, it is predicted that the SLA of eastern Guangdong in the years of 2030 and 2050 are 18\u252c\u25923cm, 31\u252c\u25923cm, respectively. The predicting values are in line with the maximum values of global predictions from IPCC (2007).", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["42"]}

{"title": "Analysis of topic evolution based on subtopic similarity\n", "abstract": " In the area of topic tracking, topic is developing with time. Actually speaking, traditional topic tracking approaches could track the relevant stories. However, the relation between events occurred during the topic development process could not be learned with traditional approaches. Furthermore, the whole history of the topic tracking could not be acquired either. Based on these disadvantages in traditional approaches, we propose anew method based on the calculation of the subtopic similarity.This method utilizes the idea of time partition so as to analyze the developing history of the topic. Our method concerned the time characteristic of a event as well as the location characteristic. Moreover, we use it to manipulate the information. In the experiment applying the practical data, it shows our method works more efficiently.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["42"]}
{"title": "Simultaneous detection of enterovirus 71 and coxsackievirus A16 by multiplex real-time PCR with an internal control\n", "abstract": " OBJECTIVE: To rapidly identify EV71 and CA16 simultaneously. METHODS: A multiplex real-time PCR with an internal control (IC) was developed. The specificity, sensitivity, reproducibility of the real time RT-PCR assay were estimated and more over 400 clinical samples were tested. RESULTS: The results showed 100% specificity for the selected panel. The assay met the sensitivity of 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) per milliliter samples for CA16 and 0.1 TCID50 for EV71. Analysis with 10 (4)-0.1 TCID50/mL EV71 or CA16 samples demonstrated high reproducibility with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 0.9%-2.0% for EV71 and 0.9%-2.3% for CA16. More than 400 clinical samples were detected by real-time PCR, The results showed that the average positive ratio for EV71 and CA16 were 46.1% and 14.2%, higher than common assay (34.5% and 12.8%). Moreover, the result statistics indicated that there were PCR inhibition in stools, rectal swabs and throat swabs specimens with inhibition ratio from 1.8% to 3.4%. The inhibition ratio of these samples showed the importance of IC when PCR was used to detect the RNA of EV71, CA16 or other enterovirus. CONCLUSION: As a result of its high specificity, sensitivity and avoiding false negative results by using an internal control, the assay is suitable for rapid clinical diagnosis of EV71 and CA16.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["42"]}

This contributed to decrease the beam\u0393\u00c7\u2593 s parameter products (BBPs) on the slow axis direction. Furthermore, a prism-array pair was used to shape the collimated beams to balance the BPPs of the high-power LD stacks on both the fast-axis and slow axis directions. The shaping could also make the comprehensive BPPs be less than that of the fiber, and the beam quality of highpower LD stacks was improved greatly to obtain the multi-mode fiber coupled stack with higher coupling efficiency. As an example, the beams of LD stacks consisting of 5 bars, with the output power of 200 W were collimated, shaped, focused and coupled into the multi-mode fiber with the core diameter of 0.8 mm and the numeric aperture of 0.22. Finally, The output power of 125.4 W was obtained.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["42"]}

With the enhancing of swirl intensity, the mixing process between air and droplets is speed up. Therefore, the spray cone angle increases remarkably, the mean axial velocity decreases gradually, the radial velocity and tangential velocity increase slightly and the fluctuation velocity increases evidently. As a result, the profiles of axial velocity become a twin-peak curve. Air swirl intensity has a marked effect on spray flame. As the swirl number increases, the turbulent spray flame become more wobbly. The length of flame shortens obviously, but the scales of crimples and eddies on the surface of flame reduce moderately. As the swirl number S= 1.2, all the fractions of CxHy, CO and NO remain at a lower level.

{"title": "RNA interference directed by small hairpin RNA expressed in COS-7 cells\n", "abstract": " RNA interference is a phenomenon of gene silencing directed by double-stranded RNA. It can specifically inhibit gene expression by degrading mRNA efficiently and has been widely used to knockdown gene expression in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, etc. For mammalian cells, dsRNA directed RNAi was detected only in murine undifferentiated ES or embryonic carcinoma (EC) cells. Our previous work proved the existence of RNAi effect for reporter gene GFP and endogenous gene Oct4 in undifferentiated murine ES cells. Yet in other kinds of mammalian cells, because of the existence of interferon pathway, long dsRNA will induce the cells to shutdown global protein translation and go to apoptosis. Therefore, dsRNA longer than 30 bp cannot be used to induce specific gene knockdown effect in these cells. Elbashir et al found that in vitro synthesized small interfering RNA (siRNA)(19-23 nt) could induce potent RNAi as effective as long dsRNA without showing unspecific effect, so that the interferon pathway could be bypassed. It was shown that during RNAi process, long dsRNA was first degraded into 19-23 nt siRNA and then recruited into RISC (RNA induced silencing complex) to degrade corresponding mRNA. However, the synthesis of siRNA is expensive and the effect is transient because the knockdown effect can only be maintained for about a week. Recently, it has been shown that U6 promoter directed small hairpin RNA (shRNA) can induce potent gene knockdown effect in murine P19 Embryonic Carcinoma cell.

Optimal uniform and time-varying tolls are sought to achieve optimal mode split and elimination of the queue behind a bottleneck. Road tolling schemes in either absence or presence of HOV lanes and\" equal toll\" constraint are derived for either first-best or second-best social optimum. The resultant changes in departure time, person-delay, total social cost and total benefit are compared by numerical examples. Findings are as follows: In the absence of HOV lanes, an anonymous toll for all vehicles should be charged for obtaining a first-best social optimum. In the presence of HOV lanes, the pricing for a first-best social optimum requires differentiating the toll across segregated lanes. If the\" equal toll\" constraint is imposed, a weighted average of the marginal external congestion costs of the carpooling and non-carpooling commuters should be set for a second-best social optimum. A time-varying tolling scheme is also determined to eliminate the queue behind a bottleneck, and the resulting equilibrium modal split is ascertained.

The object model is based on a practical OO development technique-HRT-HOOD. A real-time logic is specified by extending a sound formal method for real-time systems-TAM, to formalise the object model. With integration of HRT-HOOD and TAM, the advantages of object-oriented structured methods with the stepwise refinement techniques are combined. The result is illustrated on a case study.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["42"]}

{"title": "Effects of aluminum on neurobehavioral function and metabolism of monoamine neurotransmitter\n", "abstract": " OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of occupational exposure to aluminum on neurobahavioral function and metabolism of monoamine neurotransmitter. METHODS: Thirty-three workers exposed to aluminum and 40 controls were studied. Air aluminum concentrations in workplace environment were detected with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer, homovanillic acid (HVA) and vanilylmandellic acid (VMA) in urine and aluminum in serum and urine were detected with high perfolmance liquid chromatography. Neurobehavioral function was tested with Neurobehavioral Core Test Battery recommended by WHO. RESULTS: Geometric time-weighted average of aluminum in workplace environment was 0.95 mg/m3, ranging from 0.31 to 4.12 mg/m3, and urine aluminum levels in workers exposed to aluminum averaged 12.25 micrograms/L, significantly higher than that in controls (5.78 micrograms/L). There was no significant difference in serum aluminum between the exposed and controls. Both urine VMA and HVA levels were higher in the workers exposed to aluminum, and urine VMA level in the exposed was significantly higher than that in controls. There was significant difference in neurobehavioral test, including Santa Ana, digit symbol and Benton tests between the exposed and control workers. CONCLUSION: It suggests that occupational exposure to low level of aluminum can affect the neurobehavioral function and metabolism of monoamine neurotransmitter.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["42"]}

However, there exists no universal solution to realise data reuse across different types of applications or operating platforms. Data to be reused can be modelled by ontology by semantically unifying definition, category and descriptions of domain concepts contained in the data, in order to reduce complexities aroused by expressive power chaos from heterogeneous data sources. Simultaneously, data reuse interfaces could be upgraded to knowledge reuse services with the benefit of efficiency, availability and value enhancement.

According to one kind, each intuitionistic fuzzy rough set is constructed by a couple of intuitionistic fuzzy sets. According to the other, each intuitionistic fuzzy rough set is constructed by a couple of fuzzy rough sets. In this paper, another kind definition is proposed that each intuitionistic fuzzy rough set is constructed by a couple of rough fuzzy sets. Then, \"upper rough degree\" and \"lower rough degree\" are introduced to characterize the relation between components in each intuitionistic fuzzy rough value. And then their meanings in three kinds intuitionistic fuzzy rough sets are illustrated respectively. Besides, a strong similarity measure between intuitionistic fuzzy rough sets is proposed.

Using the parity space, the proposed subspace approach gives equivalent estimation of the MVC performance bounds in multivariable feedback control system. The basic procedure is to identify a parity space of the system residual, instead of the process model, directly based on closed-loop data. Therefore, the MVC performance indices are estimated to make control performance assessment. The equivalence of the proposed approach to the conventional interactor-matrix based approaches for the estimation of the MVC-benchmark is proved and illustrated through simulations.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["42"]}

{"title": "The flame retardant nomex/cotton and nylon/cotton blend fabrics for protective clothing\n", "abstract": " Due to its excellent fire-resistant property, Nomex has commonly been used to produce protective clothing [1, 2]. However, the high cost and low comfortability of Nomex have limited its wider uses. Blending Nomex with cotton not only reduces the cost but also improves comfortability of the fabrics. Because cotton is a highly flammable fiber, the Nomex/cotton blend fabric containing more than 20% cotton is not self-extinguishable [3-4]. Therefore, a durable flame-retardant finishing treatment becomes necessary to make the Nomex/cotton blend flame-resistant if it contains more than 20% cotton fiber. Previously we developed a flame retardant finishing system for cotton based on a hydroxyfunctional organophosphorus oligomer (HFPO) shown in Scheme 1. Because HFPO does not have a reactive functional group for cotton, it is necessary to use a bonding agent, such as dimethyloldihydroxyethyleneurea (DMDHEU), trimethylolmelamine (TMM), or 1, 2, 3, 4-butanetetracarboxylic acid (BTCA), to make the flame retardant resistant to hydrolysis [5-12].

METHODS: The shRNA expression vectors were constructed and subsequently transfected by direct injections into the tumors formed by CNE-2Z cells implanted in nude mice. The expressions of the targeted genes in tumor tissues and the apoptosis of tumor cells were evaluated. RESULTS: NPC CNE-2Z cells were successfully inoculated and subcutaneous tumor was formed in all nude mice. Under fluorescence microscope, tumor tissues showed the expression of each vector with green fluorescence. The expression of multiple shRNAs led to the decreases in the expressions of VEGF, c-myc, survivin, hTERT mRNA and proteins. Multi-gene silencing was better than single gene silencing in inducing the apoptosis of tumor cells. Tumor growth curves showed that the tumors treated with the shRNAs, including VEGF, c-myc, survivin, hTERT or the combination of 4 shRNAs, grower slowly obviously compared with control tumors. Inhibited rates of tumor growth by VEGF-, c-myc-, survivin-and hTERT-shRNA were 46.2%, 48.5%, 51.9% and 46.8% respectively. The combined application of 4 shRNA produced the more significant inhibitory rate (82.4%) than single shRNA application. CONCLUSIONS: The application of vector-based RNAi targeting multiple genes is a promising therapeutic modality in the gene therapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and multi-gene silencing is a new strategy for tumor therapy.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["42"]}

CY3-labeled siRNA was compounded into PEI and transfected into MS1 cells. Confocal microscopy was used to image the subcellular distribution of siRNA in MS1 cells. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting were used to evaluate VEGFR2 gene silencing induced by siVEGFR2/PEI complexes. A tumor-bearing nude mice model was established to compare the anti-tumor effect after delivered by local and systemic routes. siVEGFR2/PEI complex-transfected cells exhibited much fluorescence in cytoplasm with no evidence of nuclear accumulation. The expression levels of VEGFR2 mRNA and protein in PEI-transfected cells were significantly down-regulated compared with that in blank group, the silencing efficiency were 28.2% and 23.6% respectively. The tumor sizes in mice intratumorally injected with siVEGFR2/PEI complexes (189.429+/-17.562 mm3) were reduced definitely compared to that in mice injected with siVEGFR2/PEI complexes via vein route (315.507+/-20.491 mm3), or to saline groups (365.844+/-20.713 mm3). The study demonstrated that PEI could effectively transfect siRNA into cells and silence the VEGFR2 gene expression. Intratumoral delivery is more suitable for non-targeted modified PEI/siRNA complexes to inhibit the tumor growth in vivo.

{"title": "Research on Standardization and Formalization of Heterogeneous Geo-analysis Models in Web Space [J]\n", "abstract": " There are lots of geo-analysis model resources in the Web. However, the heterogeneity of these existing models has limited their sharing and reuse. Though the mature network technology can provide strong support to the sharing and reuse of the heterogeneous geo-analysis models, the study of geo-analysis models is relatively stagnant. On one hand, the standard of the metadata for models still hasn't formed. On the other hand, the semantic heterogeneity exists in spite of following an united standard. In order to meet the needs of the development of heterogeneous geo-analysis models, this paper proposes a method to standardize and formalize the existed heterogeneous geo-analysis models. Firstly, based on the status of the metadata for the geo-analysis models, this paper designs a standard framework of metadata for the geo-analysis models and makes use of XML Schema to describe this standard framework, which satisfies the standardization in the syntactic and structural level. The standard framework is comprised of section, compound element and data element. The data element is the basic unit to build the framework, and it can be described by several attributes. The compound element is made up of the data elements and the other compound elements. The section is the aggregation of related compound elements and data elements. Secondly, it presents a semantic mapping model on the basis of ontology because of the limitation of XML Schema in semantics. XML Schema is good at describing the structure of the XML document, while ontology places emphasis on the expression of semantic information.

Thus, this region is actually situated in a unique or \u0393\u00c7\u00a3transitional\u0393\u00c7\u00a5 position between contractional (Himalayan) and extensional (Andaman Sea) tectonic settings, which is furthermore characterized by the eruption of a series of volcanoes (Bender, 1983; Stephenson and Marshall, 1984; Maury et al., 2004) along the north-south-trending Sagaing Fault. In this paper, we report geochemical and Sr-Nd isotopic analyses of some of these volcanoes in the hope to better understanding their petrogenesis and tectonic significance. Although it has been proposed that the volcanism started since late Miocene time in localities (Bender, 1983), our samples consist only of Quaternary basalts and basaltic andesites recovered from Mt.

The mice were executed on the next day of drug withdrawal and the tumors were weighed and the tumor inhibition rate calculated. Immunohistochemistry was also performed on the tumor tissues to provide clue for the possible pathways of tumor inhibition. RESULTS: EGF-TCS markedly inhibited the tumor growth in nude mice, with a tumor inhibition rate of 71.3%, 60.87% and 45.22% corresponding to EGF-TCS dosage of 100, 50, and 25 microg/kg, respectively. Variance analysis suggested that EGF-Linker-TCS could significantly inhibit the tumor growth in the mice (F= 8.712, P= 0.006), and immunohistochemistry showed significantly inhibited angiogenesis in the tumors by EGF-TCS. No blood vessels were found in the tumor tissues in high dosage group, and there were also reduced blood vessels in the other two smaller dose groups in comparison with the untreated model group, indicating that EGF-TCS inhibited tumor growth and migration by inhibiting tumor angiogenesis.

To analyze relationship between the change of the signal intensity on superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) enhanced MR images and pathologic change. To discuss the value of SPIO enhanced detection in splenic metastasis in rat. Methods: Eight rodent model of VX2 tumor in spleen was established successfully. The images were obtained before and after administration of superparamagnetic iron oxide. T1-weighted spin-echo (SE) pulse sequence with a repetition time (TR) of 450ms, and echo time (TE) of 12ms (TR/TE= 450/12) were performed. The imaging parameters of T2-weighted SE pulse sequence as follows: TR/TE= 4000/128. Results: On SPIO enhancement T2WI sequence the SI of splenic parachyma decreased obviously with percentage of signal intensity loss (PSIL) was 55.04%, but the SI of tumor was not evidently change with PSIL was 0.87%. Nevertheless the SNR of normal splenic parenchyma around the lesions had obvious difference (P0. 001) comparatively. The contrast-to-noise (CNR) between VX2 tumor and splenic parenchyma had an evidently difference with before and after admininstration of SPIO (P0. 001). Conclusions: On SPIO enhanced T2WI the contrast degree of lesions increased obviously. Consequently, SPIO-enhanced T2WI MRI scanning can improve the rate of detection and characterization in lesions of spleen.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["42"]}

{"title": "Advance on the molecular mechanism of the interaction between wheat and Fusarium graminearum J\n", "abstract": " Wheat Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused by Fusarium graminearum Schwabe, is a widespread and destructive disease in wheat worldwide. In this paper, the molecular mechanisms for wheat and Fusarium graminearum interaction in recent years were reviewed as follows: inheritance, QTLs (quantitative trait loci), the responses at gene level of FHB resistance, in addition FHB resistance improvements in wheat by transgenic technique. The FHB resistance of wheat is quantitative trait controlled by two (or three) major loci and some minor. QTLs associated with FHB resistance have been mainly mapped on chromosome 3BS, 5A, 6BS, of which some markers could be utilized for marker assisted selection of the resistant lines directly. Some pathogenesis-related proteins (genes) such as \u256c\u2593-1, 3-glucanases, cytochrome P450, chitinases have been identified by using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and/or suppression subtractive hybridization. Some genes have been confirmed to delay or alleviate the FHB infection by the transformation wheat. However, the resistance acquired through transgene is minimal and not stable in fields test, and more works should be done untill the direct FHB resistant genes in wheat could be found and confirmed.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["42"]}
{"title": "An Efficient Queuing Scheme for Multicast Switches in Overlay Networks\n", "abstract": " The increasing multimedia applications such as teleconferencing and video-on-demand require the Internet to effectively provide high-performance multicast support, so overlay networks have been designed and employed to support the ever-growing multicast applications. In overlay networks, the process of packet replication is performed at a dedicated Multicast Service Node (MSN). Therefore, it is critical to design the architecture of MSN in general, and the queuing and scheduling on MSN in particular, to provide efficient multicast support. This paper proposes a high-performance queuing scheme for MSNs to support both unicast and multicast and to achieve high link utilization with a reasonable cost. The approach is to use per-vector queuing on-demand. Simulation study shows that by deploying this queuing scheme a switch can achieve a better throughput, higher link utilization, and a lower latency compared to other queuing schemes.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["42"]}

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis indicates that annealed alloys have single phase and the same hexagonal structure as that of LaN5 alloy (CaCu5 type, P6/mmm). The cell parameters of alloys fluctuate with the increasing annealing temperature. The equilibrium hydrogen pressure and plateau slope are a parabola function with annealing temperature for LaNi3.8Al0.75 Mn0.45 alloy. By this relationship, an appropriate heat treatment temperature for LaNi3.8Al0.75Mn0.45 alloy is determined to about 1220 \u0393\u00c7\u00f4 1230 K by mathematic simulation process.

A previous study (2) found that global gray matter volume decreased linearly with age, but there was no age-related decline for the white matter volume. Thus the global gray/white matter (G/W) ratio, a parameter indicating global development (3), while not affected by brain size, will also be influenced by age. Schizophrenia is a disease associated with epigenetic and abnormal neurodevelopment which may disrupt the balance of gray and white matter (3). Studies have shown morphological abnormalities of the cerebral gray and white matter in patients with schizophrenia (4, 5). However, to date no studies investigated the changes of G/W ratio and its association with age. We aimed to characterize the G/W ratio in addition to gray matter volume (GMV) as defined using the voxel based morphometry (VBM) in patients with first-episode, antipsychotic-naive schizophrenia.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["42"]}

However, many of the existing logging tools and associated interpretation procedures were originally designed for operation in vertical wells. Therefore, it becomes imperative that the response of conventional tools be properly understood when logging through highly deviated wells. In like manner, interpretation procedures need to be adapted for their accurate and reliable use in non-vertical wells. This paper undertakes the numerical simulation of dual-laterolog measurements acquired in 3D logging environments to appraise the reliability of measurement and interpretation procedures in non-conventional wells.

{"title": "Inducible expression of OsEBP-89 gene in rice\n", "abstract": " OsEBP-89 gene was an EREBP (ethylene responsive elements binding protein) transcription factor from rice (Oryza sativa). Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of OsEBP-89 gene can be induced by ACC, 2, 4-D, ABA, BR, JA, GA, 6-BA and salt. We found an ethylene responsive element-like ERE (ethylene responsive element), named IVC box, in the promoter region (-552 to-510) of OsEBP-89 gene. EMSA results showed the IVC box could specifically bind with nuclear proteins extracted from immature rice seeds. When the rice suspension cell harboring IVC/35S mini-promoter (-46)/GUS chimeric construct (pIVC/GUS) was treated by ACC, GUS activity could be induced. However, two plasmids with OsEBP-89 promoter/GUS (pPSG) and IVC box-deleted OsEBP-89 promoter/GUS (pSphSG) were transformed to rice, when both transgenic suspension cell treated with ACC the GUS expression was also inducible. This result indicated that there are more than one ethylene-responsive elements located in the promoter region of the OsEBP-89 gene.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["42"]}

METHODS: Two nucleic acid dyes, SYTO 13 and ethidium bromide (EB), are used to assess the viability of skin tissue. The viability of cells can be determined by different colors under fluorescence microscope. In this study, the recovery of skin restored at 4 degrees C for different periods is measured by SYTO/EB dyes and a type of indirect assessment, WST-1. Then both results are compared. RESULTS: The results measured by two methods showed that the viability of skin tissue was nearly 30% after two weeks storage. At any point of experiment, the data from two methods have not obvious variance. CONCLUSION: The assessment of skin viability by SYTO/EB is also quick, sensitive and convenient. At the same time the viability of any type of cells can be observed in situ.

{"title": "SAR interferogram MAP filtering based on stationary wavelet transform\n", "abstract": " Strong speckle noise of SAR interferogram is a great obstacle to phase unwrapping. In order to obtain a more accurate topographic model, a noise filtering step must be performed before the unwrapping of phase. In this article, we propose to filter this noise with a multi-resolution analysis of the interferogram, the real part and the imaginary part of the interferogram are processed seperatively. Several different probability density function are modeled with the Pearson system of distributions, then the wavelet coefficients of the noiseless data are estimated with a Bayesian model, maximizing the posteriori probability density function. The result is compared to that of three other methods and shows that the proposed method is powerful to interferogram speckle noise reduction, as well as it can preserve fine details in the interferogram that are directly related to the ground topography and maintain phase values distribution.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["42"]}

It was shown that using nano zeolites as the hosts of\" ship in bottle\" materials is an efficient way to increase the contents of the Fephen complex in the zeolite matrix. The different hosts make the location of the Fephen complex in zeolite Y and the interaction between the host and guest different. Under the mild conditions (60\u0393\u00e4\u00e2, atmospheric pressure), using aqueous H 2O 2 (30%) as the oxidant, with a similar Fe content, Fephen complexes in nano Y exhibit the catalytic activity 2.5 times higher than that in normal Y for the oxidation of cyclohexane.

We find that K-coverage and a proper substrate temperature (500\u252c\u00e1K) is favorable for the oxidation of the semiconductor, with temperature being even more effective than K-coverage. The efficiency of the promoted oxidation is discussed for different experimental conditions. We conclude that the oxidation ability of the oxygen species follows the order KO2, K2O2 and K2O, and that the fraction of the different species depends on the local atomic ratio of K/O and the substrate temperature.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["42"]}

{"title": "Heat transfer analysis of tofu coagulation process\n", "abstract": " Tofu is produced by heating soy milk containing a coagulating agent. In this heating process, soy milk gradually coagulates during heating, and loses the fluidity. In order to examine a relationship between this coagulation and heat transfer mechanism, following experiments were carried out. A tofu container was filled with soy milk and MgCl2, and then heated in a 90 deg C constant temperature bath. Using the thermocouples installed in the container, the temperature change during heating was measured. Perfectly solidified tofu was cooled, and the heating experiment was carried out again. The temperature change of solidified tofu was equal to that in the coagulation process. By cutting off the container under heating, the coagulation process of tofu was observed. The observation result showed that the solidification occurred in the initial stage. From the above results, it was deduced that conductive heat transfer was more dominant than the natural convection. A heat conduction equation was solved using the finite element method, and temperature distribution and temperature change of the container inside were estimated. It was proven that internal temperature change in the tofu coagulation process was predictable by solving the heat conduction equation, because numerically calculated temperature agreed with the measured value well. In addition, it was shown that the two-dimensional analytic solution agreed with the solution by the finite element method and", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["42"]}

However, it has not extensively practised on an industrial scale yet. The problem is that the study of complicated mechanism for both sides of reactions-bacterium and sulfide minerals has not obtained good progress. The gold-bearing sulfide minerals possess the different behavior during the bacterial oxidation. Obviously, it is not enough that only bacteriology, experimental conditions and technological parameters are studied. The main studing project of sulfide minerals in the process of bacterial oxidation must be determined. Therefore, it is suggested that the systematic study of sulfide mineralogy is operatively developed, Which will have not only the theoretical significance but also the practical significance to sped the industrialization.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["42"]}

The concentrating release of latent heat for the primary crystallization of Fe73.5Cu1Nb3Si13.5B9 ribbons can be reduced by fractional crystallization in the preannealing process. Quantitatively, a quarter of the latent heat can be released in advance at preannealing temperature 743\u252c\u00e1K for 30\u252c\u00e1min. The subsequent measurement of the soft magnetic properties indicates that the ribbons heat-treated first under the proper preannealing and then under the final annealing process (813\u252c\u00e1K for 60\u252c\u00e1min) still exhibit excellent soft magnetic properties.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["42"]}

{"title": "Building CORBA objects with DOS software applications\n", "abstract": " CORBA is becoming the most important middleware that supports the object-oriented and client/server paradigm in distributed computing systems. However, the application systems based on CORBA are still scarce. One main reason is that only a few CORBA object services have been developed. To develop a new CORBA application, a programmer should make an effort to design a program with a CORBA interface from scratch. In our previous work (Liang et al., 1997), a re-engineering approach was proposed to convert RPC-based programs to CORBA objects, which successfully speeds up the development of CORBA applications. However, the source code is required in this approach. In many cases, software designers may not get hold of the source code.

{"title": "Development and application of reverse engineering measures in a re-engineering tool\n", "abstract": " If software metrics are useful in a forward software engineering environment, they are vital in a reverse engineering one. We are endeavouring to develop suitable metrics for software engineers who urgently need them for reverse engineering legacy systems. We propose that the metrics for reverse engineering in our re-engineering tool, the Re-engineering Assistant (RA), are developed under five categories: complexity, abstractness, object orientation, economics and reusability. The main task of reverse engineering is to extract a representation of existing systems at a high level of abstraction. This main characteristic is reflected in our study. Complexity measures are used to indicate how complex it is to reverse engineer a piece of existing code. Abstractness measures indicate at what level of abstraction the existing code is and whether the code is abstract enough to understand. Object orientation measures indicate how object oriented the code is for those re-engineers who are hoping to transform myriad conventional procedural systems into object-oriented ones via reverse engineering. Economics (cost estimation) measures indicate the cost to reverse engineer the existing code. Reusability measures indicate to what extent the reverse engineered existing code can be reused.

This low density as sputtered TiN is shown to be superior to high density as sputtered TiN after both films have undergone an identical RTA treatment. The superior integrity of the low density TiN is attributed to enhanced oxygen gettering during RTA treatment at the Ti/TiN interface. This oxygen gettering has been shown to create a titanium oxynitride (TiON) layer between the Ti and TiN which accounts for the greatly enhanced barrier integrity.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["42"]}

We have previously reported that XG has neuroprotective effects, with the mechanism yet unknown. In this study, we investigated the possible mechanisms underlying neuroprotection of XG against Ab-induced toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells and primary neurons. Pretreatment with XG significantly attenuated the cell viability reduction induced by Ab exposure in a dose dependent manner which was testified by 3-[4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay. In addition, pretreatment with XG reversed the effect of Ab on Bax and Bcl-2 expression and repressed Abinduced caspase-3 activation, suggesting that the neuroprotective effect of XG is associated with apoptosis regulation. Neuroinflammation has been implicated in Abinduced neuronal death.

METHODS: Clinical data of 112 patients with types II and III AEG who underwent intraperiteanal operations from January 2008 to July 2010 were reviewed. Amongst the patients, 77 suffered from type II AEG and 35 suffered from type III AEG; 72 underwent proximal gastrectomy and 40 underwent total gastrectomy. RESULTS: The patients with type II and type III AEG shared some common characteristics, such as advanced tumor TNM stage and lymphatic metastasis. There was a significant difference in choice of surgical approaches between the two groups of patients (P< 0.05), with 57 type II AEG patients (74.0%) and 15 type III AEG patients (42.9%) undergoing proximal gastrectomy respectively. Operational time and incidence of postoperative complications differed between proximal gastrectomy and total gastrectomy (P< 0.05). Total gastrectomy lasted longer [(304.12+/-23.12) min] than proximal gastrectomy [(275.76+/-27.02) min]. Proximal gastrectomy provoked 20.8%(15 patients) heartburn and/or acid regurgitation and 12.5%(9 cases) reflux esophagitis. Fifteen patients (37.5%) with total gastrectomy had more than 5 meals a day. CONCLUSION: Intraperiteanal operations are recommended for patients with types IT and Ili AEG.

An adiabatic shear failure mode for ECVs was presented based on the fracture and the micro-optical observation of the destructed vessel. A damage evolution model for ECVs subjected to adiabatic shear was constructed, where the mechanical conditions including strain rate and strain were linked with the different evolution states of the adiabatic shear bands (ASBs). And these mechanical conditions were employed in the numerical code as the failure criteria to simulate the transient process of the ASB evolution. The simulated fracture profile shows a good agreement with the experimental result. The simulated result indicates that the rate-dependent critical strain, as well as explosive load, governs the adiabatic shear failure mode. Though the initial material imperfection ignites the ASBs, it has a minor influence on the final fracture profile. For the ECVs with the adiabatic shear failure mode, the crack (or ASB) expands faster than for those with the plastic instability failure mode.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["42"]}

The regulatory change of quality, breaking strength, pressive strength of defect-free and defect polyurea-coated concrete under sulfate corrosive environment has been studied; SEM was applied to study the change of the surface topography. The results showed that after accelerated corrosion by 80g/l sodium sulfate solution, the quality of the defect-free polyurea-coated concrete was basically invariant, while the defect polyurea-coated concrete has a largest increase (1.15%) after 30d, then remain stable; the early strength of defect polyurea-coated concrete would be higher than defect-free polyurea-coated concrete, as the pressive strength of defect polyurea-coated concrete was higher by 5.63 MPa at 12d, but the pressive strength of defect-free polyurea-coated concrete is higher by 5.45 MPa at 150d. Which indicated that in case of the reaction between incursive corrosion and hydration products, the quality and strength has a brief increase, and the strength would then decrease while the quality changed a little; SEM research depicted that corrosion just partly appeared on the interface and haven't cause apparent change of the tomography and structure of the coatings.

A high temperature pre-annealing to the Ge substrate results in a smooth surface of GaInP, while a surface degradation in the case of a low temperature annealing is obtained, which might come from an incomplete carbon and/or oxide desorption. An improved surface morphology of GaInP with silicon doping and with increasing Ge substrate misoriented angle was also observed, which indicates that the highly disordered GaInP film and the neat interface between Ge and GaInP were formed with the assistance of a high temperature pre-growth treatment.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["42"]}

It is very difficult to predict this type of reservoir using common seismic attribute analysis technology because of the uncertainty of analysis results. On the basis of investigating the application condition and effectiveness of various seismic attributes, focusing on the heterogeneity of carbonate reservoir and taking logging data as the known training samples, this paper realizes the 3D optimization processing for multi seismic attribute data volume by combing of multi statistic methods such as multivariate discriminant analysis, kernel principal component analysis etc. The established reservoir discriminant model in this paper has the total coincidence rate of 90.13% by retrospective test, proving the validity of the model.

Nowadays, there are many anticancer drugs, such as Bleomycin, Carboplatin, Carmustine, Cisplatin, Cyclophosphamide, Fluorouracil, Oxalip-latin, Paclitaxel, Vincristine and so on. But they have some drawbacks such as undesired side effects and multidrug resistance. Therefore it is urgent to look for the new anticancer drugs which have high activity and without or less with side effects. Thiochromanones are of considerable importance as pharmacophoric groups due to their known biological activities. Thiochromanones had been reported to possess important biological activities.[4] Thiochromanone derivatives, such as 3-bromo-4-thiochromanone derivatives,[5] 3-benzyli-enethiochromanone derivatives,[6, 7] the Mannich base of thiochromanone derivatives,[8, 9] 2, 3, 3a, 4-tetrahydrothiochromeno [4, 3-c] pyrazole derivatives [10] and 6H-thiochromeno [4, 3-b]-quinolines derivatives [11] et al had been synthesized and reported to have antifungal activities.

{"title": "A novel dual resonant tank for ZVT DC-DC converters with synchronous rectifier\n", "abstract": " DC-DC converters, widely used in industry, are much more needed to supply higher power with higher efficiency in various applications. However, the conventional DC-DC converters cannot achieve higher efficiency owing to the switching and conduction losses. Thus, this paper aims at reducing these losses of conventional DC-DC converters by using zero-voltage-switching (ZVS), zero-current-switching (ZCS), and Synchronous Rectification (SR) with reduced reverse recovery time of junction diodes. A novel dual resonant tank for DC-DC converters with SR is proposed on the basis of existing topologies. To verify the proposed circuit, a prototype converter is implemented in this paper. The simulated and experimental results obtained have demonstrated that the proposed dual resonant tank can be practically implemented in conventional DC-DC converters to provide better performance as compared with existing\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["42"]}

Our program includes not only the development of the detector itself, but also a set of auxiliary measurements which will help characterize its low-energy response. A novel scintillation counter has been developed to detect sub-MeV neutrons while rejecting gamma-ray backgrounds with good efficiency. The detector uses multiple layers of thin solid scintillator, with optical isolation between the adjacent layers. Incident low-energy neutrons produce ionizing recoil particles which remain within just one of the scintillator layers, while background gamma rays create electrons which most often cross the boundary between layers. By observing the trigger pattern within the layers, most gamma-ray backgrounds can be distinguished from the low-energy neutrons of interest.

METHOD: The expression levels of RSK-4 mRNA and protein were detected in 56 cases of breast cancer and the normal breast tissues, as well as in 20 cases of breast benign lesions, by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The expression rates of RSK-4 mRNA in breast cancer, the normal breast tissues and breast benign lesions were 48.2%, 76.8% and 75.0%, respectively. The expression level of RSK-4 mRNA in breast cancer was significantly lower than those in normal breast tissues and breast benign lesions tissues (P< 0.05). The expression level of RSK-4 significantly correlated with tumor size and clinical stage (P< 0.05). The expression rate of RSK-4 protein was 39.3% in breast cancer tissues, which was significantly lower than that of normal breast tissues (71.4%) and breast benign lesions (75.0%, P< 0.01). The expression level of RSK-4 protein was lower in breast cancer with large tumor, high clinical stage and lymph node metastasis. In 56 cases of breast cancer samples, the consistency rate of RSK-4 mRNA and protein was 73.2%. A significant correlation was found between RSK-4 mRNA and protein (\u2567\u00e7\u252c\u2593= 10.254, P< 0.05). CONCLUSION: The down-regulation of RSK-4 expression in breast caner suggests that it is a breast cancer suppressor gene, and the lack or down-regulation of RSK-4 expression is involved in the genesis and progression of breast cancer.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["42"]}

Matured fruits were harvested and percentage of downy blight fruit was recorded. Results of the 3-year field trials showed that lychee trees sprayed with NPA significantly (P< 0.01) reduced the incidence of fruit downy blight (0.5-11.8%), compared to untreated controls (26.1-46.6%). The treatment of NPA also was as effective as the treatment of mancozeb 80WP (dilution 500 times), a commercial synthetic chemical registered for the control of lychee fruit downy blight in Taiwan. Meanwhile, three applications of NPA in the fields not only significantly (P< 0.01) reduced the incidence of postharvest Peronophythora fruit rot of lychee (0-16%), compared to the untreated control (12.2-96.6%), but also delayed the development of postharvest fruit downy blight by 2-4 days. However, treatment of freshly harvested lychee fruits with NPA in the laboratory did not significantly (P> 0.05) reduce the incidence of Peronophythora downy blight of lychee fruits during postharvest stage. These results of field and laboratory experiments indicate that NPA must be applied to lychee plants at fruit development or maturing stage in the fields to induce resistance of lychee fruits against P. litchii and, thereby, reduce downy blight of lychee fruits in the field\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["42"]}

{"title": "Effect of radiofrequency of different temperatures and durations on motor conduction velocity of rat sciatic nerve\n", "abstract": " OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of radiofrequency of different temperatures and durations on sciatic nerve motor conduction velocity (MCV). METHODS: The bilateral sciatic nerve of 70 adult SD rats was dissected and exposed to radiofrequency ablation of different temperatures (30, 50, 55, 60, and 70 degrees C) and durations. The nerves were also exposed to increasing ablation temperatures from 30 degrees C to 50 degrees C with an increment of 5 degrees C (60 s at each temperature), and the changes in the MCV parameters were observed. RESULTS: The MCV parameters of rat sciatic nerve underwent significant changes following the radiofrequency exposures (P< 0.05) except for the exposure at 55 degrees celsius; for 10 s. Below the temperature of 55 degrees celsius;, the MCV showed no obvious correlation to the exposure time for the group. For the nerves exposed to radiofrequency of 55 degrees celsius;, the latency was not correlated to the exposure time within 30 s, and data could be obtained from 55 s group; with these exceptions, the latency was found to positively while the negative phase wave inversely correlated to the exposure time. With fixed exposure time of 60 s, the MCV parameters were positively correlated to the ablation temperature (below 50 degrees C). Failure of MCV measurement occurred following exposures to 55 degrees celsius; for 50 s (or longer) or to 60 degrees C (or higher) for 10 s. CONCLUSION: Low-temperature radiofrequency (below 50 degrees C) produces definite effects on the MCV of rat sciatic nerve, and the effects are not associated with the exposure time, the mechanism of which remains\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["42"]}

The physical and chemical properties, in especial the surface acidity of the catalysts were characterized by the techniques of BET, XRD, FT-IR, isopropanol probe reaction, microcalorimetry and FT-IR for NH3 adsorption. The catalytic activities of the catalysts were evaluated in the reaction of methanol dehydration to dimethyl ether. The results from BET, XRD and FT-IR verified that the specific surface areas of the supported catalysts decreased with the increase of Al2 (SO4) 3 loading. Above 20% Al2 (SO4) 3 loading, crystalline Al2 (SO4) 3 was detected for the supported samples. It could be concluded from the results of microcalorimetry and FT-IR for NH3 adsorption, that, upon the loading of Al2 (SO4) 3, the supported catalysts exhibited much higher surface acidity than the SiO2 support, on which the surface acidity was first enhanced and then weakened with the continuous increase of Al2 (SO4) 3 loading. In addition, both Br\u03b5\u00f2\u00c5 nsted (B) and Lewis (L) acid sites exist on the surface of the supported samples with B acid sites predominantly. The catalyst with 3% Al2 (SO4) 3 loading exhibited the strongest surface acidity and thus possessed the highest catalytic activity in methanol dehydration. At 533 K, 83.5% conversion of methanol with 100% selectivity to dimethyl ether was achieved on the 3Al2 (SO4) 3/SiO2 catalyst.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["42"]}

By accessing a look-up table, the algorithm reduces the number of cycles, simplifies the process computing the inverse value and enhances the speed. The table size is independent of the number of FFT points. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is significantly better than the others when the radix is 2 and the compution time is only 20% that of the conventional algorithm and at more 15% more than that of the existing algorithm based on look-up tables when the radix is greater than 2.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["42"]}

Methods Ninety patients with acute cerebral infarction were randomly divided into two groups: control group (n= 30) receiving routine drug treatment and treatment group (n= 60) treated with LMWH and routine drug treatment. The changes of the neurological dysfunction score, activity of daily life (ADL) and the level of cerebral blood flow before and after treatment were observed. Results There were significant differences in neurological dysfunction and ADL score before and after treatment in both control and treatment group (P0. 01). Compared with control group, the neurological dysfunction and ADL score in treatment group improved remarkably (P0. 01). The vascular pulsatility index (PI) and vascular resistance index (RI) had significant differences before and after treatment in both control and treatment group (P0. 01). Compared with control group, the PI and RI in treatment group improved more remarkably (P0. 01). There were no obvious side effects in both two groups. Conclusion It is suggested that LMWH could promote the recovery of neural function of patients with acute cerebral infarction, and the mechanism might be related with the improving of regional cerebral blood flow after cerebral infarction.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["42"]}

{"title": "Effect of drawdown pressure on heavy oil reservoir productivity [J]\n", "abstract": " In view of the two-phase flow of oil and water under the same pressure during the development of heavy oil reservoir, research is conducted on the mechanism of oil and water output under constant pressure in the laboratory. In order to probe into the fluid producing mechanism and law, constant-pressure valves are utilized to adjust the pressure of gas bottles, artificial cores of saturated water are simultaneously injected into the heavy oil and the formation water separately filled in two intermediate containers under constant pressure. The experiment shows that the production of fluid is controlled by the pressure difference. As the injection pressure gradient increases, water production increases, oil output changes little, and the ratio of water to oil increases. Results show that fluid production is raised by increasing the gradient of drawdown pressure in the two-phase flow of heavy oil and water. However, oil recovery can not be so enhanced.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["42"]}

{"title": "Insurance claims modulated by a hidden marked point process\n", "abstract": " Recently Markov-modulated compound Poisson models have gained its popularity in modelling insurance claims in the actuarial science literature. A Markov-modulated compound Poisson model can provide a realistic and flexibile way to model aggregate insurance claims by incorporating the impact of hidden states of an economy on claim frequencies and claim sizes. However, in practice, the Markov chain in the model is not observable. It is of practical interest to develop some methods to estimate the hidden state of the Markov chain and other unknown model parameters of the Markov- modulated compound Poisson model. This paper considers this important issue. We shall develop filters and smoothers for the hidden state of the economy underlying the Markov-modulated compound Poisson model.

{"title": "Eletromagnetic properties of NiZn ferrite/SrTiO3/HDPE composites for high-frequency applications\n", "abstract": " In recent years, with the rapid developments of electronics industry, electronic components have been required with smaller size and, higher performance. It is desired that the materials for these electronic components exhibit multifunctional properties, such as magnetic-electric [1, 2], magnetic-optical [3], flexibility [4] and other properties. Among them, dielectric-magnetic composites have recently received much attention. Much work has been carried out to synthesize dielectric-magnetic composite materials to meet the requirement for multifunctional components [5-9]. These composite materials can show both high inductive and capacitive properties, which has been identified to be an enabling solution to fabricate miniature filter and antenna, electro-magnetic interference (EMI) devices and so on. For the ceramic-based composites, however, the magnetic phase and the dielectric phase need to be cofired at high\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["42"]}
{"title": "A New Method of Reducing Shock between Press Head and Press Disk in High Speed Lapping\n", "abstract": " Considering the shock between the press head and press disk in high speed lapping is more serious, this paper proposes a new method to reduce this shock. By this method a hole is machined for air passing on the press head axis. The topper of the hole is connecting with a pressure air resource. Thus an air cushion between the press head bottom and press disk on the workpiece is produced. With the distance between them reducing gradually, the damping of air cushion on the press head increases gradually. This makes speed of the press head approaching the workpiece decrease gradually and until reach zero.

The predicted temperature distribution is in good agreement with the test results. Furthermore, comparisons are made between the temperature distribution of columns heated on three sides and four sides. Based on the FE model, a developed parametric analysis is undertaken, in which time, cross-sectional dimensions, steel ratio, type and thickness of fire-proof coating are taken into account. The analysis indicates that the influences of time, cross-sectional dimensions, type and thickness of fire-proof coating are main parameters.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["42"]}
{"title": "The Application of Bootstrap Method in Linear BRDF Models Inversion\n", "abstract": " It is usually assumed that the prior distributions of parameters and error are Gaussian distribution in remote sensing inversion. This assumption seems to be impractical in many cases. Prior distribution of parameters and error are very important in remote sensing inversion since many remote sensing inversion strategies take advantage of prior knowledge. We present a bootstrap method for estimating the prior distributions of parameters and error in this paper. This method relaxes the distribution assumption of parameters and error, and obtains those approximately exact distributions by means of prior data. Moreover, we classify prior data since they are collected from different classes, and implement statistical test for classified prior data. Results show that proper classification of prior data is reasonable. Finally, we take RossThick-LiTransit linear kernel-driven model as an example, and make a comparison of our method with usual Tikhonov regularizing inversion and Bayes inversion under normal hypothesis with NOAA-AVHRR observations. The result shows that classifying prior data and using the prior distribution obtained by bootstrap method can significantly decrease uncertainty of parameters.[Fund]: \u03c3\u00a2\u255c\u03c3\u00ab\u2562\u03a6\u00e7\u00ac\u03c4\u00e4\u2562\u03c4\u00ba\u00e6\u03c3\u00a1\u00aa\u03c3\u0192\u2551\u0398\u00e7\u00e6\u0398\u00ed\u2563\u03c4\u00a2\u00ab (\u03c4\u255d\u00fb\u03c3\u00c5\u2556: 40671129);; \u03c3\u00a2\u255c\u03c3\u00ab\u2562\u03a6\u00e7\u00ac\u03c4\u00e4\u2562\u03c4\u00ba\u00e6\u03c3\u00a1\u00aa\u03c3\u0192\u2551\u0398\u00e7\u00e6\u0398\u00e7\u00ec\u03c4\u00e9\u2563\u03c3\u0192\u2551\u0398\u00e7\u00e6\u0398\u00ed\u2563\u03c4\u00a2\u00ab (\u03c4\u255d\u00fb\u03c3\u00c5\u2556: 10231030);;\u0393\u00c7\u00a3\u0398\u00f2\u2510\u00b5\u2592\u0192\u03c3\u00a1\u00aa\u03a6\u00c7\u00e0\u03c3\u00c6\u00ee\u03c3\u00ea\u00a2\u00b5\u00fb\u2591\u03c3\u00c5\u00e6\u03c3\u2592\u00f2\u03a6\u00ab\u00ed\u03c3\u00ea\u00c6\u0393\u00c7\u00a5 \u0398\u00ed\u2563\u03c4\u00a2\u00ab", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["42"]}

The results show that nitrite nitrogen concentration influences the removal of TN greatly; the rate of TN removal and pH increase with the increase of nitrite nitrogen concentration. To raise nitrite nitrogen concentration furthermore, both the TN removal rate and pH level decrease. This suggests high concentration nitrite nitrogen will inhibit the ANAMMOX process. Moreover, the data indicate that for excellent TN removal effects, the proper nitrite nitrogen concentration shall be 84.4 mg/L.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["42"]}

METHOD: Twenty-one patients (21 ears) of localized attic cholesteatoma accepted atticotomy. Then different surgical managements were carried out according to the extent of cholesteatoma and whether the malleo-incudal joint was destroyed or not. If the cholesteatoma has only reached the surface of the malleo-incudal joint, it was regarded as type I (5 patients). To this type, the cholesteatoma was removed and the ossicular chain was preserved. If the cholesteatoma has entered the anterior attic space and destroyed the malleo-incudal joint, it was regarded as type II (16 patients). Besides the removing of cholesteatoma, the head of malleus and incus should be removed also in this condition. Then reconstruction of the ossicular chain was performed by putting PORP artificial auditory ossicles between the manubrium mallei and staple. In all these 21 patients, the lateral wall of attic was reconstructed with the cartilage of tragus. The perichondrium of the cartilage was used to repair the perforation in the non-vibrant membrane. Healing of the lateral wall of attic and the tympanic membrane and recovery of hearing level were investigated after the operation. RESULT: The follow-up period lasted 1 year to 5 years. Healing of the lateral wall of attic and the tympanic membrane were satisfying in all 21 patients. According to the pure tone audiometry after the operation, AB gap was less than 10 decibel in 10 patients, less than 20 decibel in 7 patients, less than 30 decibel in 3 patients, and over 30 decibel in only 1 patient\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["42"]}

Most reverse engineering (RE) methods for aggregation relationships are based on the lifetime dependence of an object on another object since many implementations of aggregation relationships result in such dependence. However, research literature shows that lifetime dependence is not really a primary property of the aggregation relationships. A reverse engineering approach is proposed on propagation of operations. To compare the propagation-based method with the lifetime-based method, we apply both methods to ten class libraries, collect their output, and perform statistical analysis to determine the effectiveness of the two methods.

Clustering techniques have been used to automatically discover typical user profiles from Web access logs. But it is a challenging problem that many clustering algorithms yield poor results because the session vectors are usually high dimensional and sparse. Although standard non-negative matrix factorization (SNMF) can be used in reducing the dimensionality of the session-URL matrix, the clustering results is not precise, because the basis vectors SNMF gets are not orthogonal and usually redundancy. In this paper, we apply local nonnegative matrix factorization (LNMF), which get basis vectors as orthogonal as possible, to reduce the dimensionality of the session-URL matrix.

{"title": "System optimum and pricing in multi-behaviors\n", "abstract": " The notions of user equilibrium (UE) and system optimum (SO) often allude to the literature together with the principle of marginal cost-pricing in the traffic network analyses. In reality, users do not always behave in a UE manner, typically when there exists oligopoly Cournot-Nash (CN) firms. In the presence of such UE-CN mixed equilibrium behaviors, we naturally ask whether a SO flow pattern remains attainable by meaningful link tolls. This paper provides a former answer to this question. We show that in a network with both UE and CN users, applying the traditional marginal-cost pricing for a system optimum requires that link tolls be differentiated across user classes. We then seek alternative meaningful tolls by establishing the existence of nonnegative uniform link tolls to support SO as a UE-CN mixed equilibrium with resort to a rigorous mathematical programming approach.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["42"]}

In the meantime, apoptosis was inducted by flow cytometer analysis (FCAS) after culture of Mn2+ or Mn3+(0.5-2 mmol/L) with SH-SY5Y cell for 24-72 h. The ultrastructural changes of apoptosis such as nuclear chromosome condensation, was seen by transmission electron microscope. In addition, DA content was decreased by measured with HPLC.

Before anthesis the calcium level was quite low. Calcium increased remarkably just after pollination and then decreased again gradually. Calcium precipitates were localized in the polar nuclei, including the nucleolus and nucleoplasm, and the cytoplasm surrounding polar nuclei. In the large central vacuole the calcium amount was negligible, though pollination-independent calcium elevation occurred in the chalazal region of the vacuole. During fertilization, abundant calcium was found in the fusing sperm and polar nuclei. Fertilization-induced calcium accumulation in the micropylar region of the central vacuole appeared after fertilization and during early mitosis of free endosperm nuclei. No obvious change of calcium level was observed in emasculated but unpollinated central cells, and in this case the level was much lower than in pollinated central cells. Calcium was also localized in the antipodal cells, embryo sac wall and nucellus, and no change was observed in these places before and after pollination.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["42"]}

{"title": "Improving Reliability of Knowledge Mining in Legacy Code by Utilising Cooperative Information\n", "abstract": " During the life cycle of a legacy software system, its documentation that records the links between domain knowledge and code often becomes deteriorated, which makes changes on software rather hard. Therefore there are considerable needs that the lost linkage between domain knowledge and code implementation be re-established prior to major software evolution activities. In the real world, the ambiguous appearance of domain knowledge embedded in source code constitutes the biggest barrier to recovering reliable domain knowledge. In this paper, we introduce an innovative approach to recovering domain knowledge with enhanced reliability from source code. The core of the approach is a social psychology-based model where recovered domain knowledge slices can exchange viewpoints with each other so that a better evaluation of the authenticity of the knowledge slices can be obtained.

{"title": "Investigation on the origin of wurtzite domains in thick cubic GaN using reactive ion etching\n", "abstract": " We measured the depth profiling of photoluminescence (PL) in cubic GaN films. The depth-resolved PL of normal grown GaN layers showed that the near-band-edge luminescence intensities of both cubic and wurtzite domains remained constant only until an etching depth of up to 2.7 \u256c\u255dm, but their ratio remained unchanged at all etching depths. Moreover, when a thin In0.1Ga0.9N layer was sandwiched between two GaN layers, the content of the wurtzite domains increased, and its distribution showed a dependence on thickness. As the reactive ion etching depth increased, the PL intensity ratio of cubic GaN to wurtzite domains increased. Based on the distribution, the strain relaxation, instead of the instability of cubic GaN at high temperature, was attributed to the origin of wurtzite domains.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["42"]}

DESIGN: Confluent primary cultures of VSMC derived from SHR and WKY aorta and mesenteric arteries and cerebral arteries were used. The effect of adenosine upon cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) formation and the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) was studied. METHODS: MLC phosphorylation was estimated by subjecting VSMC extracts incubated with 32P to gel electrophoresis, followed by autoradiography and laser densitometry. cAMP and cGMP levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: Baseline MLC phosphorylation levels were not significantly different in SHR and WKY VSMC. Adenosine caused dephosphorylation of MLC in a time-and dose-dependent manner. A maximal response of approximately 40% below control values was observed 5 min after addition of 10 (-5) mol/l adenosine in SHR and WKY VSMC with no significant difference between the two strains. The maximally effective concentration of 10 (-5) mol/l adenosine evoked increases in both cAMP and cGMP in VSMC from SHR and WKY rats to the same degree. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the overall ability of VSMC to relax, as evidenced by a marked decrease in MLC phosphorylation in response to adenosine, is unaltered in SHR.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["42"]}

The tensile bar stiffener, welded on inside tube surfaces, was introduced in this paper. Experimental study of 4 T-shaped columns subjected to eccentric compressive loads was carried out. Parametric impact analysis was emphasized on the constraint effect, the eccentricity and the specimen type. Failure modes and static mechanical properties were investigated. Experimental results showed that: the tensile bar stiffener effectively restrains the deformation at welds of steel plates and concave corners; the CFST specimens are provided with better comprehensive mechanical performance, especially for the stiffened CFST specimens.1 INTRODUCTION and L-shaped stubs, subjected to axial compressive load and biaxial eccentric compressive load, based on Columns in traditional frame structures, with corners extended into indoor space, normally have larger cross-sectional depths than those of adjacent infilled walls, leading to the reduction of usable utilization area and disturbance to indoor environment (Figure 1).

However, the scale and complexity of legacy systems are always so large that we cannot determine which functional parts are worthy of reuse intuitively and effectively.

Specifically, a CPN model for the legacy system is available as precondition, and we first mark the input/output places and transitions on this model. Then, a model reduction approach using trace-equivalent is applied to generate an external behavior equivalent model with smaller scale.

First, 20 male subjects are selected to operate a series of operation actions with their bare hands. Some typical operation actions, such as hold, screw and pinch, are requested to collect the force data of these subjects. Second, these subjects are asked to repeat these operation actions above again when they wear the EVA glove under the different pressure level. Finally, we use some correlation analysis techniques to mine the relationship among the collected data of different pressure levels and different wearing states. Experiment results show us: the force data of bare hand state have a correlation with the force data of wearing EVA glove state. So, this result can be use to analyze and estimate the force size of the wearing EVA glove state when the astronauts work in the space station.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["42"]}

Miller cycle is based on changing the intake valve closing time to achieve high expansion ratio than compression ratio, therefore it can improve the thermal efficiency to some extent. In this paper, the engine performance of applying the Miller cycle on a nature gas engine is studied using GT-Power, and optimized for different levels of compression ratio and for different engine spend. Simulation results indicated that, after applying the Miller cycle engine full load power and fuel combustion rate get worse at low engine speed but improved at high speeds.

{"title": "CORE-SHELL ELECTROSPUN CARBON NANOFIBER/SILICON NANOPARTICLE COMPOSITE FOR LITHIUM ION BATTERY APPLICATION\n", "abstract": " Rechargeable lithium ion batteries (LIB), known for its light weight, high energy density, and high voltage capacity per cell, possess a great potential in heavy duty hybrid electric vehicles, aerospace, and military applications [1]. Graphite is used in industry as a standard anode material due to its stable charge/discharge profile and a long plateau at 0.1 V vs. Li metal. However, its maximum theoretical capacity is limited to 372 mAh/g, corresponding to LiC6 structure upon Li intercalation [2-4].Much research has been devoted to increase the energy densities (both Wh/kg and Wh/L) of LIB. Hard carbons are used but the capacity has limited improvement [5]. Various alternative alloying metals have been investigated, among all, silicon is most promising due to its highest theoretical specific capacity of 4200 mAh/g by alloying with 4.4 Li atoms. It also possesses a low charge/discharge plateau at 0\u0393\u00c7\u00f40.4 V, which permits high energy output. However, the major challenge for Si-based anode is its 400% volume change during Li ion alloying/de-alloying. This often results in particle fusion, pulverization, and the loss of electrical contact of Si to the current collector [6-8]. Researchers are trying to reduce the amount of volume expansion and contraction by reducing the size of Si to nano-scale [9, 10]. Carbon has demonstrated to be a suitable coating material for Si to prevent nanoparticle agglomeration upon volume expansion and to generate a stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) for stable capacity [11].", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["42"]}

The surface morphology is studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM). It is found that the thickness of the boride layer reached maximum values when the borax content is 0.05 mol. The roughness decreases with raising borax content from 0.01 to 0.05 mol while the further increase of borax content from 0.05 to 0.1 mol results in increase of roughness.

In order to predict delamination, interface properties should be obtained. According to the research, temperature has large effects on the interface toughness. Therefore, interface toughness as function of temperature was studied by experiment and simulation in this paper.

Theoretical studies show that the standard variance is proportional to the bandwidth of the emitted signal, so we conclude that less time width or larger bandwidth of the transmitted signal produces less fluctuation.

It is indicated that tumor cells can recruit amounts of immune cells to tumor site and establish a suppressive immune microenvironment leading to tumor escape. The critical factor for tumor immunotolerance is the establishment of immunosuppressive microenvironment by interaction between pattern recognition receptors with pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns released from tumor tissue.

Under the conditions of a temperature of (28\u252c\u25921)\u0393\u00e4\u00e2 and a pH value of 8.0, the initial aeration rate and aeration time were controlled to be 80~ 90L/h and 330 min respectively, and the aeration rate was adjusted appropriately in the whole process of reactions. The start-up of our system can be achieved after 39 cycles, and the NO 2--N accumulation and the NH 4+-N removal efficiency reached 94.13% and 92.7% respectively. Thereafter, we discharged the sludge after 81 cycles and gradually increased the NH 4+-N concentration. After 131 cycles, the short-cut nitrification system became stable and exhibited a high capability of NO 2--N accumulation. The results indicate that the start-up can be achieved rapidly by only adjusting the aeration rate, but sacrificing the stability of system. A stable system can be obtained by controlling aeration time, discharging sludge, and increasing NH 4+-N concentration.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["42"]}

{"title": "Capacitance and Electrostatic Force Distribution Models of Micro Sensors Based on Comb Finger Gaps' MEMS Process Error\n", "abstract": " Because the capacitance and electrostatic force are vital to the performance of comb capacitive micro sensors and actuators, based on the comb finger gaps' error brought by the MEMS process, the models of capacitance and electrostatic force probability distribution were proposed after theoretical deduction and ANSYS simulation. It is indicated that, by the model, both the capacitance and electrostatic force distributions are quasi-Gaussian distribution type. Hence the probability for the capacitance and electrostatic force occurring in any interval can be estimated by means of quasi-mean and quasi-variance. The quasi-mean is a little bit different from the value of capacitance or electrostatic force without process error, less than 5%. The quasi-variance depends on the comb finger number and process error degree. When the comb finger number increases from 10 to 60, the quasi-variance of capacitance distribution increases 2 times while is about 1 time for electrostatic force distribution and, as process error degree is from 5% to 20%, the quasi-variance increases 1.5 times for capacitance distribution and is about 2.5 times for electrostatic force distribution. The model is helpful for the further performance exploration based on the process error of quite a large class of comb finger micro sensors and actuators.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["42"]}

METHODS: Primary cortical neurons were obtained from the brain of a SD rat and cultured and treated with Abeta25-35 and 17beta-estradiol. I order to investigate the possible mechanism of antagonism of estrogen against the neurotoxicity of Abeta25-35, Akt-I, a specific Akt inhibitor and ICI-182780, an inhibitor of estrogen receptor were added before the addition of estrogen. The Abeta32-35 induced cell viability and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release into the cell media was detected with spectrophotometer. Western blotting was used to detect the level of phosphorylated Akt, a cell-protecting factor, and level of nonphosphorylated Akt in different conditions. RESULTS: 20 micromol/L Abeta25-35 decreased the cell viability of the rat cortical neurons to 40.4%(P< 0.01) as compared with the control group and the cell viability of the group with the addition of 17beta-estradiol was 84.2%, significantly higher than that of the Abeta25-35 group (P< 0.01).

During the precision forging process of this blade, the friction between dies and workpiece has important effects on metal flow, deformation defects, load and energy etc. So researching the effects of friction conditions on the forging process of blade with a damper platform has been a crucial problem urgent to be resolved. In this paper, the precision forging process of titanium alloy blade with a damper platform under different friction conditions has been simulated and analyzed based on the DEFORM-3D software platform. The obtained results reveal the influence laws of friction on temperature field and load-stroke curves, and provide a significant basis for determining technological parameters of the blade forging process.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["42"]}

The composite polymer CTCO/PMMA films are prepared by spin-coating method and the propagation losses of the composite polymer CTCO/PMMA films are measured by photographic technique which is simple in construction. Such a configuration enables us to determine the propagation losses, which are independent of coupling efficiencies into and out of the guide and of the laser fluctuation and it is a real-time, non-contact, accurate method. The propagation losses of the composite polymer CTCO/PMMA films with five different concentrations are measured, and the results are consistent with our theoretical analysis. At last the method and results are discussed.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["42"]}

A semiconductor optical amplifier based Mach-Zehnder interferometer wavelength converter performs reshaping. A Fabry-Perot filter all-optically recovers the clock from the incoming packets in burst mode. The synchronous modulation through a Mach-Zehnder modulator using the recovered clock performs retiming. The 3R regeneration maintains a good signal quality through multiple hops, which is important for scalable optical networking.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["42"]}

Besides integrates the merits of JDL model, Omnibus model and hierarchy model, the FH model not only uses the logic partitions of JDL model, but also points out the flow of information in the system, making up the defect that the flow of information is difficult to be controlled exactly in information fusion system based on JDL model. At the same time, the FH model divides thefusion procedure of Omnibus model more particularly by using hierarchy model. Compared with other models, the FH model includes knowledge base and database management subsystems,thus the model is more practicable and researchers can pay more attention to the designsof information fusion methods and structure models.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["42"]}

Methods The expression of IL-6, STAT3 and VEGF was detected in 70 cases of gliomas, 10 cases of meningiomas and 5 cases of normal brain tissues by immunohistochemical method. Results The expression of IL-6, STAT3 and VEGF were significantly higher in high grade (III, IV) group than that in low grade (I, II) one (P0. 01). The level of STAT3 was positively correlated to that of IL-6 and VEGF (P0. 01). Conclusion There is a close relationship between the high level of IL-6, STAT3 and VEGF and progression of glioma, and they play an important role together in the cancinogenesis and progression of glioma. We identify that VEGF gene is regulated directly by STAT3 protein, while STAT3 is regulated by IL-6.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["42"]}

A better grinding result is achieved through a higher crushing pressure and a higher sorter frequency and the ultra-fine treated SiC powder possesses a smaller particle size, a narrower particle-size distribution, a higher specific surface area and reduced agglomeration. The effects of ultra-fine treatment on the compaction behaviors, sintering behaviors, properties and microstructure of SiC ceramics were investigated. The compact with ultra-fine treated powder has a higher density and a lower sintering temperature. The densification and mechanical properties of the ceramics can be ameliorated obviously and the microstructure defects of the ceramics decrease.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["42"]}

In view of analysis of C, H contents in Chinese continental crust, they are higher than Clarke value of global average content. This means the hydrocarbons composed of such C and H should be also higher than the average hydrocarbon content in global continental crust. Meanwhile, it is the active volcanic activity that becomes one of positive causes for Chinese continental crust should be in hydrocarbon enrichment, of which it contributes the kitchen model for hydrocarbon generation for organic source mechanism; its hydrothermal fluid contributes the catalytic model for hydrocarbon generation; its mantle-derived CO2 and H2 contribute compound mechanism for hydrocarbon generation; its hydrothermal water contributes the inorganic carbon compound model for hydrocarbon generation, and it also directly contributes mantle-derived hydrocarbons. Therefore, Chinese continental crust as a hydrocarbon-enriched one should be reasonable. In addition, higher C, H contents in Chinese sedimentary rocks than the average of global statistic values support the viewpoint that Chinese continental crust and upper continental crust should also be of hydrocarbon-enriched materials. In 2002, a new Yumen oil region was found in its basinal basement rock after 70-year development history, which indicates that the deep continental crust (s) of China still have a great deal of oil-gas resources to be explored and discovered.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["42"]}

Grinding of diaspore can increase the BrunauerEmmetTeller surface area of diaspore. As the grinding time is prolonged, the rate of size reduction decreases gradually. The size reduction of the original diaspore particle appears to reach a limit after 2 h grinding. Particle size data suggest that moderate aggregation occurs during grinding. The mechanochemical effect obviously promotes the decreases in reflection intensities of XRD with the increase the grinding time, but no new phase appears between 1 h to 2 h grinding, and the structure of \u256c\u2592AlOOH is still retained perfectly. N_2 adsorption study indicates that diaspore ground for 12 h shows a little smaller average pore diameter than the sample ground for 6 h and the original diaspore as well.

An effective purging method for eliminating leukemic cells without compromising normal reconstituting activity would make autotransplantation a more attractive strategy for selected CML patients.

But under this assumption, only if a few observed data have big error, the inversion result will become unstable.

Linear kernel-driven model with t-distribution error solved by EM algorithm is used to prove this new idea.

Islet cells from normal and DM2 rats were isolated and cultured over 24 h in a medium with or without gli and the static Ins secretion at various time intervals were measured by RIA. These islet cells either untreated or pre-treated for 24 h with various dosages of gli (500; 1000; 1500 ng/ml) were perifused by a column perifusion system.

METHODS: Cultured orbital fibroblasts from patients with GO and controls were challenged with IL-1 alpha or/and IL-1ra. Immunocytochemical staining was used to examine the changes of ICAM-1 in response to IL-1ra treatment; fluorescent photomicroscope was used to measure the adhesion between the labeled PBMC and orbital fibroblasts. Neutralizing antibody against ICAM-1 was used to demonstrate the role of ICAM-1 in the IL-1 alpha-induced adhesion. RESULTS: IL-1ra inhibits IL-1 alpha-induced ICAM-1 expression in cultured orbital fibroblasts both from GO patients and controls; IL-1ra inhibits IL-1 alpha-induced adhesion of PBMC to orbital fibroblasts in a concentration and time dependent manner. Moreover, a monoclonal anti-human ICAM-1 antibody produced a concentration dependent inhibition of the IL-1 alpha-induced adhesion of PBMC to the fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: IL-1ra inhibits IL-1 alpha-induced ICAM-1 expression in cultured orbital fibroblasts and the adhesion of PBMC to fibroblasts. IL-1 alpha-induced ICAM-1 expression may play an important role in the adhesion process. IL-1ra may be useful in the prevention or treatment of GO.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["42"]}

Information in the WWW cache shows users' recent interest. Users' interest can be widely used in customizing WWW pages, filtering information, pre-fetching information and so on. The key to using information in the WWW cache effectively is to build an adaptive user interest model and construct an adaptive algorithm for interest mining. Interest can be specialized by the tuple (term, weight) in the simple interest model. Association relations are not mined in this model, so the interest cannot be associated in expressing users' interest. Basing on analyzing the WWW cache model, we propose a two-dimension interest model. It is proved that mined users' interest can show users' current interest states.

This synthesis is characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA). Zeolite Y performances as host for metal complex in zeolites have also been studied. The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra, XRD patterns, and TG-DTA curves show that [Fe(phen)3] 2+ has been formed in the supercage of zeolite Y, and higher complex concentration can be obtained in the samples by using nano Y as host through the flexible-ligand method. [Fe (phen)3] 2+/nano Y exhibits higher activities for the liquid-phase oxidation of cyclohexane with aqueous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) than [Fe (phen)3]2+/ Y because of the higher surface area and shorter diffusion pathways.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["42"]}

The structure factors of cubic GaN(002) and (004) components are approximately identical. However, the integrated intensities of the rocking curve for cubic (002) components are over five times as those of (004) components. The discrepancy has been interpreted in detail considering other factors. In the conventional double crystal rocking curve, the peak broadening includes such information caused by the orientation distribution (mosaicity) and the distribution of lattice spacing. These two kinds of distributions can be distinguished by the triple-axis diffraction in which an analyser crystal is placed in front of the detector. Moreover, the peak broadening was analysed by reciprocal lattice construction and Eward sphere.

The ultrasonic velocities in H 2O 2 solution are measured at different concentrations and temperatures. The velocity-concentration coefficients and velocity-temperature coefficients of H 2O 2 solution are calculated. In the on-line ultrasonic H 2O 2 concentration meter, the ultrasonic transducer installed outside the H 2O 2 solution pipeline generates an ultrasonic wave pulse. The ultrasonic wave travels through the pipeline of H 2O 2 solution. The computer transfers the ultrasonic travel time into ultrasonic velocity. The platinum resister is installed inside the H 2O 2 solution pipeline. The resistor variation caused by temperature is sent to the computer through the interface. The computer calculates the ultrasonic velocity and H 2O 2 temperature by means of velocity-concentration coefficients and velocity-temperature coefficients. It displays and prints the value of the instant H 2O 2 solution concentration, and meantime displays the 8 hour curve for H 2O 2 solution concentration variation in the screen.

Such tools need to address specific areas of need in the implementation of concurrent engineering in construction. Collaborative decision making is an important area in this regard. As a fact, conventional decision support systems have shortcomings when dealing with complex uncertain or fuzzy events in the construction industry. In the conventional construction process, project team members often adopted an adversarial approach to decision making. In contrast, they are required within a concurrent engineering framework to be effective team players, working together for the good of the project. In some cases, these project team members are geographically distributed making regular physical meetings inconvenient, time-consuming and expensive. In making decisions, project team members bring their own disciplinary or individual views to the decision making process. This often means that conflict arises based on how important an issue is to different disciplines. Perhaps what one discipline considers very important is of low importance to another. The disparate priorities are usually expressed in linguistic fuzzy terms, eg, very important, important, low importance, and not important. There is often no formal or objective way of reconciling these in practice. Discussions are used to reconcile these but, the personalities of the individuals involved often have a great part to play and may result in sub-optimal solutions being adopted.

{"title": "Molecular biology of self and non-self pollen recognition in flowering plants\n", "abstract": " Fertilization in flowering plants is completed through several recognitionevents, and the first of which is the recognition of pollen by pistil of female reproductivetissue. Self-incompatibility (SI) is an intraspecific reproductive barrier to prevent selfferitilization and widely distributed in flowering plants. In many species, SI shows simplegenetics and is controlled by a single multi-allelic locus, called the S locus. In gametophyticSI (GSI) exemplified by the Solanaceae, Scrophulariaceae and Rosaceae, a class ofribonucleases, called S RNases, have been shown to mediate the stylar expression of SI butnot the pollen expression of SI. The latter appears to be determined by a gene differentfrom those encoding S RNases, often referred to as pollen S gene. The pollen S gene is thecrucial missing part in understanding the biochemical and molecular mechanisms of self andnon-self pollen recognition in flowering plants. Recent genetic analysis of mutationsaffecting the pollen expression of SI has suggested a possible model of how the pollen S geneinteracts with S RNases to achieve self and non-self pollen recognition.

{"title": "Gene controlled by promoter--PTH4 depending on whiG of Streptomyces coelicolor\n", "abstract": " The downstream gene controlled by promoter--PTH4 which is related to Streptomyces differentiation was cloned, and its sequence was determined by the dideoxy chain termination method. The results indicated that the 1597 bp of DNA fragment conferred a complete open reading frame (ORF). In searches of databases, the deduced product of the ORF was not homologous with any known proteins; it may be a new protein. The function of the gene was studied using the strategy of gene disruption; the actinorhodin could not be produced when this gene was disrupted. Therefore, this gene may be related to actinorhodin biosynthesis in Streptomyces coelicolor, and the result also shows that this gene may play a role in multiple level regulation of differentiation genes in Streptomyces.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["42"]}

{"title": "Analysis and Modelling of Spatial Objects to Implement OOP for Spatial Data Generalisation in GIS\n", "abstract": " This paper proposes a new approach to spatial data generalisation using object-oriented techniques. The Object Modelling Technique (OMT) (Rumbaugh 1991) is adopted in this approach. Detailed procedures for adopting the OMT methodology for modelling spatial data are given using diagrams, and implementation of the object-oriented (OO) modelling is demonstrably specified using the popular OO programming language C++. The advantages of using an OO approach over traditional relational models are discussed as is how its implementation presents a practical solution to the problem of spatial data generalisation in GIS. Moreover, by using the Object Model and Dynamic Model of OMT, the relationships between different feature classes can be examined and the generalisation processes analysed.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["42"]}

Modification of the undecagold clusters positive charges change or prevent the functional effects and the binding to the outside surface of the mitochondria. The mitochondrial functional alterations are dependent on the oxidative phosphorylation capacity of the isolated organelles. The results of these experiments indicate that artificial undecagold may be useful to explore the molecular mechanisms of biological energy transducers which require electric charges separation, ionic fluxes, and electric surface properties.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["42"]}
