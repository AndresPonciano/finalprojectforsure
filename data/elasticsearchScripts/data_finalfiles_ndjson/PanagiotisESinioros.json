{"title": "Determining the drivers for householder pro-environmental behaviour: waste minimisation compared to recycling\n", "abstract": " New mandatory household recycling targets present a serious challenge to UK Local Authorities. Public participation in Local Authority schemes is key to increasing household recycling levels, however, the most effective way to reduce waste is to deal with it at source, through waste minimisation. Understanding waste minimisation behaviour is key to achieving sustainable waste management and householder based projects which are theoretically underpinned by cognitive psychology and are promoted by carefully designed marketing/communications, over the long-term, should result in reductions in Municipal Solid Waste (MSW). Cognitive psychological modelling can provide the means to identify the driving forces behind recycling and waste minimisation behaviour, and in a given area determine the main likely success factors. Once these factors have been established, cost-effective campaigns can be\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "468\n", "authors": ["1227"]}

Metrics for collaborative processes, for working with large data sets and for minimization of the effects generated by vulnerabilities resulted from the use of distributed applications are proposed. Specific risk factors are identified for the interactions developed for collaborative processes. For each one of the identified risks, solutions are found for keeping an acceptable level of security. Architecture is proposed for optimization of collaborative processes security level. The behaviour of large data sets applications, in conjecture with the security framework, is analyzed for collaborative banking system flows.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1227"]}
{"title": "Small\u2010Capacity Gold Production Tests From Waste Desktop Computers\n", "abstract": " This article describes a procedure for the hydrometallurgical recovery of gold from waste computer printed circuit boards (PCBs) and central processing units (CPUs). The wastes processed within the recovery installation described in this article were derived from desktop computers, the parts of which were manually sorted to select those components found to be rich in gold content. X\u2010ray fluorescence measurements showed that considerable amounts of gold are contained in the \u201cfinger\u201d terminals of the PCBs as well as in the CPUs. This article describes the chemical processes for recovering gold from these parts. In addition, the article covers the emissions control apparatus that is capable of eliminating the nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions produced by the recovery process. The main costs arising from the overall procedure are for personnel utilization. Approximately 60 work hours from\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1227"]}

Correlation between heavy metal concentrations was calculated with Spearman's rho correlation coefficients. Ecological risk was assessed with ecological risk indexes (RIs) such as Hakanson's ecological RI, Geoaccumulation index, and enrichment factors. Heavy metals in water comply with drinking water criteria, except Pb in one water sample W2. Concentrations of Pb, Cr, Ni, Cu, Mn, and Zn were higher in the rainwater collection tank (43.50, 10.90, 18.87, 81.17, 177.99, and 330.17\u2009\u03bcg/L) than the surficial water inside (8.93, 1.27, 4.97, 17.0, 91.87, and 72.97\u2009\u03bcg/L) and outside the plant (4.18, 1.28, 1.60, 10.35, 26.21, and 12.10 \u03bcg/L).

{"title": "A preliminary study of the concentration of special purpose elements and precious metals in the enriched precipitates produced by a wet method of cathode-ray tube recycling\n", "abstract": " The purpose of the work is to investigate the existence and the possibility of recovering economically interesting elements, such as precious metals and rare earth elements, from phosphor layers of cathode ray tube wastes. Therefore, a series of analyses took place in the precipitation material that resulted from the disassembling and wet processing of the cathode-ray tube screens. An applied recycling method, that mechanically with water enriches precipitates of cathode ray tube glass (wet cathode ray tube recycling method), is hosted in a small-medium recycling company. Identification of the amorphous and crystalline phases in combination with the micro-structural characterization and the chemical, major, and trace-element analysis were performed in waste materials as well as in the precipitate that resulted from the wet cathode-ray tube recycling process.

This work is a characterization of aerosols and dust from dry and wet WEEE recycling processes in a small plant. A particle spectrometer measured size distributions of ultrafine particles whereas a deposition impactor collected aerosols for chemical analysis. Powders from milled printed circuit boards and from the cathode ray tube (CRT) processing line were additionally analyzed. Morphological characterization of the dusts by optical and electron microscopy also took place. All plant compartments are subject to aerosol concentrations during the work hours with highest concentration at 105 particles/cm3. The wet recycling technique was more efficient in retaining powders in the solid form than the dry technique.

{"title": "Energy theft problem in power systems: A-state-of-the-art\n", "abstract": " The existing power systems as well as the smart grids utilize a number of advanced computing, networking and measurement technologies that improve their planning and operation targeting to a full automated system in terms of monitoring and control. As power systems become more complicated, they face a combination of known and unknown vulnerabilities and threats that are more targeted and sophisticated. Among them, malicious activity, influencing the measuring devices, is of major importance since it can instantaneously result in the physical operation and reliability of the grid. Conventional and smart energy meters incorporated to power systems are of the most vulnerable, to actions trying to manipulate them, measuring devices. The problem of conventional or smart energy meters manipulation targeting to influence the power system operation and reliability is known as the energy theft (ENT) problem. This problem has become of major importance in many countries all over the world. The energy theft is happening mainly in transmission and distribution level. In order to reduce the impact of energy theft, there are many methods that have been proposed in the literature. This paper presents a state-ofthe-art survey for the energy theft problem solution.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1227"]}

{"title": "Intelligent Control of Artificial Social Systems\n", "abstract": " This paper proposes a new model for Artificial Social Systems (ASS) behaviors. ASS exists in practically every multi-agent system, and play a major role in the performance and effectiveness of the agents. This is the reason why we introduce a more suggestive model for ASS. To model these systems, a class of Petri nets is adopted and briefly introduced in the paper. This class allows representing the flow of physical resources and control information data of the ASS\u2019s components. The issue of the verification of the interconnections or interfaces among the Petri nets of primary components is realized with the help of the functional abstractions of the Petri net model of these components.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1227"]}
