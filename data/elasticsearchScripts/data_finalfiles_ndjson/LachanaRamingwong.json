Changes introduced to a software product often come with defects. Additional test cases are, this could reduce the main challenges of regression testing is test case prioritization. Time, effort and budget needed to retest the software. Former studies in test case prioritization confirm the benefits of prioritization techniques. Most prioritization techniques concern with choosing test cases based on their ability to cover more faults. Other techniques aim to maximize code coverage. Thus, the test cases selected should secure the total coverage to assure the adequacy of software testing. In this paper, we present an algorithm to prioritize test cases based on total coverage using a modified genetic algorithm. Its performance on the average percentage of condition covered and execution time are compared with five other approaches.", "num_citations": "32\n", "authors": ["398"]}

Although dozens of requirements engineering methods and techniques are available for practitioners, some techniques are proven successful to certain systems but not for others. In fact, selection appropriate of requirements engineering methods and techniques can be difficult and, in worse case scenarios, may ultimately lead to a failure. Recent changes in business environments and emerging technologies also affect requirements processes. This makes selection of an appropriate requirements engineering model even more sophisticate.

{"title": "Using artificial bee colony for code coverage based test suite prioritization\n", "abstract": " The goal of test suite prioritization is maximizing fault detection and code coverage rate. Several nature inspired optimization algorithms such as Swarm Intelligence (SI) have been studied for the optimization of such problems. The studies revealed the benefits of Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) over other algorithms. ABC and its variations were implemented in software testing areas, test suite prioritization in particular. However, most SI based approaches focus on fault detection ability which is difficult to predict. In this paper, the standard ABC algorithm is used to prioritize test suites based on code coverage. The results reveal that ABC shows promising results and, hence, is a great candidate for prioritizing test suites. It also suggests that a modification to the standard ABC algorithm or combination of ABC and another SI algorithm should yield an even better result.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["398"]}

Many government agencies developed m-government applications, mainly for information dissemination and electronic services delivery. Information has great effects to citizen's life in several ways. Warning messages are an obvious example. They are usually provided to people in affected or risk areas. Effective information dissemination of such information requires more than assembling them on the user interface. It requires a careful design. Designing how they are presented is not an easy task. Moreover, effective and efficient presentation can be difficult. Appropriate presentation aids in understanding of information and gives the correct clue on what to do next.

It is normal for software developers to find some problems with their software design, especially during their beginner days. This usually involves simple and repetitious defects which subtly hamper their overall productivity. Defect-driven development (DDD) is a concept proposed to tackle such problems. DDD utilizes the benefits of software defect knowledge base by collecting defects data from experienced programmers and teach beginners to avoid these problems. In this way, the beginners can proactively prevent the defects and subsequently produce more high-quality software. DDD concept can be efficiently adapted to either traditional software development such as the Waterfall and Spiral model, or the more modern concepts such as Scrum or Test-driven Development.
