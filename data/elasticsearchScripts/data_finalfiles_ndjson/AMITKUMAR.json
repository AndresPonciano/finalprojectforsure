It is often difficult to obtain data for failure probabilities under changing environmental conditions. Hence fuzzy sets are used to analyze the fuzzy system reliability, where a fuzzy number represents the reliability of each component. Chen [14] analyzed the fuzzy system reliability using vague set theory. The values of the membership and non-membership of an element, in a vague set, are represented by a real number in [0, 1]. A specialist is always uncertain about the values of the membership and non-membership of an element in a set. Hence, it is better to represent the values of the membership and non-membership of an element in a set by intervals of possible real numbers instead of real numbers. In this paper a new method has been developed for analyzing the fuzzy system reliability of a series and parallel system using interval valued trapezoidal vague sets, where the reliability of each component of each system is represented by an interval valued trapezoidal vague set defined in the universe of discourse [0, 1].The developed method has been used to analyze the fuzzy reliability of a marine power plant. The major advantage of the proposed approach (the concept of interval valued vague sets) over the existing approaches [7, 8, 14] is that the proposed approach separates the positive and negative evidence for the membership of an element in a set.

The authors continue the study of sorting and selection in the priced comparison model, i.e., when each comparison has an associated cost, and answer some of the open problems suggested by Charikar et al. If the comparison costs are allowed to be arbitrary, we show that one cannot get good approximation ratios. A different way to assign costs is based on the idea that one can distill out an intrinsic value for each item being compared, such that the cost of comparing two elements is some \"well-behaved\" or \"structured\" function of their values. We feel that most practical applications will have some structured cost property. The authors study the problems of sorting and selection (which includes finding the maximum and the median) in the structured cost model.

A genetic algorithm is used to decide upon global optimal set points for the slasher. A fuzzy expert system detects and identifies off-limits or failure conditions and generates command signals for low level control routines of such slasher components as the creel section, size box, the drying section and the beamer drive. The paper also addresses the issue of system integration between warping and weaving at a hierarchical level. Simple process models for each section of the slasher are used for computer simulation purposes.

To maximize the network survivability, the energy efficiency of paths must be taken into account for route selection. Simple heuristics such as choosing paths with minimal energy consumption are ineffective, because the energy of the nodes on such paths may deplete quickly. The issue is particularly serious for the networks with regular traffic pattern as in monitoring sensor applications. Existing solutions to this issue typically adopt the multi-path routing approach, in which multiple paths are set up between source and destination and one (or all) of the paths is (are) used at a certain moment. However, this approach involves high overhead for establishment and management of multiple paths.

The problem is APX-Hard and can be 2-approximated by, e.g., the elegant primal-dual algorithm of Agrawal, Klein, and Ravi from 1995. We give a local-search-based constant-factor approximation for the problem. Local search brings in new techniques to an area that has for long not seen any improvements and might be a step towards a combinatorial algorithm for the more general survivable network design problem. Moreover, local search was an essential tool to tackle the dynamic MST/Steiner Tree problem, whereas dynamic Steiner Forest is still wide open. It is easy to see that any constant factor local search algorithm requires steps that add/drop many edges together. We propose natural local moves which, at each step, either (a) add a shortest path in the current graph and then drop a bunch of inessential edges, or (b) add a set of edges to the current solution. This second type of moves is motivated by the potential function we use to measure progress, combining the cost of the solution with a penalty for each connected component.

In all the following problems the objective is to   provide resilience in networks while minimizing the cost incurred.    The main problem under consideration in this paper is that of backup   allocation: this problem takes as its input an already provisioned    primary network and a parameter k, and allocates backup capacity    on the edges of the underlying network so that all the demand can be    routed even in the presence of k edge failures.

{"title": "Optimal configuration of OSPF aggregates\n", "abstract": " Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a popular protocol for routing within an Autonomous System (AS) domain. In order to scale for large networks containing hundreds and thousands of subnets, OSPF supports a twolevel hierarchical routing scheme through the use of OSPF areas. Each area consists of a set of interconnected subnets and traffic across areas is handled by routers attached to two or more areas, known as Area Border Routers (ABRs). OSPF ABRs are typically configured to aggregate the subnet addresses in their areas and to advertise these aggregates in the remainder of the network instead of individual subnet addresses. Address aggregation within areas is a crucial requirement for scaling OSPF to large AS domains, as it results in significant reductions in routing table sizes, smaller link-state databases, and less network traffic to synchronize the router link-state databases. On the other hand, address aggregation also implies loss of information about the length of the shortest path from the ABR to each subnet; typically, an ABR associates each advertised aggregate with a single weight that is common for all subnets covered by the aggregate. This, in turn, can lead to the selection of significantly suboptimal OSPF routing paths between source-destination subnet pairs that span different areas. In this paper, we address the important practical problem of configuring OSPF aggregates to minimize the error in OSPF shortest path computations due to subnet aggregation. We first develop an optimal dynamic programming algorithm that, given an upper bound k on the number of aggregates to be advertised by the ABRs and a weight\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["188"]}

When the activity times in the project are deterministic and known, critical path method (CPM) has been demonstrated to be a useful tool in managing projects in an efficient manner to meet this challenge. However, in practical situations this requirement is usually hard to fulfill, since many of the activities will be executed for the first time. So when project activity times cannot be specified with certainty due to the lack of duration information or poor definitions of the activity, then to deal with such real life situations, Zadeh (1965) introduced the concept of fuzzy set. Since there is always uncertainty about the time duration of activities in the network planning, so fuzzy critical path method (FCPM) was proposed since the late 1970s. This thesis is devoted to critical path analysis under fuzzy environment. The chapter-wise summary of the thesis is as follows: Chapter 1 is introductory in nature. This chapter includes basic concepts used throughout the work. Chapter 2 presents brief review of the work done in the area of finding the critical path under fuzzy environment.

{"title": "Approximating Airports and Railways\n", "abstract": " In this paper we consider the airport and railway problem (AR), which combines capacitated facility location with network design, both in the general metric and the two-dimensional Euclidean space. An instance of the airport and railway problem consists of a set of points in the corresponding metric, together with a non-negative weight for each point, and a parameter k. The points represent cities, the weights denote costs of opening an airport in the corresponding city, and the parameter k is a maximum capacity of an airport. The goal is to construct a minimum cost network of airports and railways connecting all the cities, where railways correspond to edges connecting pairs of points, and the cost of a railway is equal to the distance between the corresponding points. The network is partitioned into components, where each component contains an open airport, and spans at most k cities. For the Euclidean case, any points in the plane can be used as Steiner vertices of the network. We obtain the first bicriteria approximation algorithm for AR for the general metric case, which yields a 4-approximate solution with a resource augmentation of the airport capacity k by a factor of 2. More generally, for any parameter 0< p<= 1 where pk is an integer we develop a (4/3)(2+ 1/p)-approximation algorithm for metric AR with a resource augmentation by a factor of 1+ p. Furthermore, we obtain the first constant factor approximation algorithm that does not resort to resource augmentation for AR in the Euclidean plane.

{"title": "Sampling in space restricted settings\n", "abstract": " Space efficient algorithms play a central role in dealing with large amount of data. In such settings, one would like to analyse the large data using small amount of \u201cworking space\u201d. One of the key steps in many algorithms for analysing large data is to maintain a (or a small number) random sample from the data points. In this paper, we consider two space restricted settings \u2013 (i) streaming model, where data arrives over time and one can use only a small amount of storage, and (ii) query model, where we can structure the data in low space and answer sampling queries. In this paper, we prove the following results in above two settings:                                            In the streaming setting, we would like to maintain a random sample from the elements seen so far. We prove that one can maintain a random sample using  random bits and  space, where n is the number of elements seen so far. We can extend this to the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["188"]}

{"title": "Enhanced Distributed Hash Tables for Complex Queries\n", "abstract": " Peer-to-peer file sharing systems have become a very popular way of sharing large number of files over a distributed environment. One of the principal ingredients of such systems is a lookup service which maps a key denoting a file to a location storing the file. Dynamic hash tables (DHT's) were recently proposed as a means of supporting such a lookup service in a completely distributed manner. They have many desirable properties, but suffer from one serious drawback-in order to locate a file, we must have a precise knowledge of the key representing it. In this paper, we propose a lookup service which supports complex queries and has all the advantages of DHT's. We also compare our proposed method with PIER , another recently proposed peer-to-peer system for answering complex queries. Our experiments show that our method results in better utilization of the network than PIER", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["188"]}
