{"title": "Configuration and usage pattern of a cloud environment based on iterative learning\n", "abstract": " An approach is provided in which a system receives a set of cloud requirements corresponding to a cloud environment and analyzes the set of cloud requirements using a set of machine logic based rules to generate a recommended cloud profile that is based, at least in part, on the set of cloud requirements and includes configuration setting values. In turn, the system configures configurable parameters of the cloud environment according to the configuration setting values of the recommended cloud profile.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["719"]}
{"title": "Performance Modeling & Analysis of Hyperledger Fabric (Permissioned Blockchain Network)\n", "abstract": " A blockchain is an immutable record of transactions (called ledger) between a distributed set of mutually untrusting peers. Although blockchain networks provide tremendous benefits, there are concerns about whether their performance would be a hindrance to its adoption. Our research is focused on Hyperledger Fabric (HLF), which is an open-source implementation of a distributed ledger platform for running smart contracts in a modular architecture. This thesis presents our research on performance modeling of Hyperledger Fabric using a Stochastic Petri Nets modeling formalism known as Stochastic Reward Nets (SRN). We capture the key system operations and complex interactions between them. We focus on two different releases of HLF, viz. v0. 6 and v1. 0+(V1). HLF v0. 6 follows a traditional state-machine replication architecture followed by many other blockchain platforms, whereas HLF V1 follows a novel\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["719"]}
{"title": "Debug session tree recorder with generic playback\n", "abstract": " Specific example debugging sessions are used to generate a generic decision tree (flow diagram) for use in future debugging sessions. Debug metadata is recorded for each debugging session. The debug metadata includes log file accesses and key traces. A generic decision tree is generated for use in future debugging sessions. Each file accessed by a developer during debug sessions creates a node in the generic decision tree. Branches of the decision tree are created between the nodes by aggregating the plurality of debug sessions together based on similarities and differences among the file accesses and results for the various debug sessions. The recorded metadata is genericized by identifying specific actions taken by developers and specific results thereof. The actions and results are abstracted to create more general types of actions and results such that the generic decision tree is applicable to a\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["719"]}
