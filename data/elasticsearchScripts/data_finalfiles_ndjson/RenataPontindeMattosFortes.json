However, this heavy use of texts creates an accessibility barrier to those who cannot read fluently in their mother tongue due to both text length and linguistic complexity. To offer an accessible alternative to these readers, shorter and simplified versions of text content should be provided. Taking that into consideration, this paper introduces Facilita, an assistive technology to help lower-literacy users to understand the text content of Web applications. Facilita generates an accessible content from Web pages automatically, using summarization and simplification techniques. It is also important to consider interface design requirements, since Facilita's target audience (the functionally illiterate) is often classified as computer illiterate as well.

The inclusion of disabled user interaction scenarios in the evaluation process is necessary to analyse ARIA requirements since dynamic changes are accommodated in the DOM structure. Two evaluation tool prototypes were developed and validated in separate case studies.

In addition, higher usability increases the satisfaction of customers. One of the most popular and economical accessible methods for usability evaluation is the Heuristic Evaluation (HE). However, a conduction of HE still depends on the participation of expert evaluator to produce the best results with quality; and expert evaluators are expensive and rare to find. Still, a little is know about adaptations of HE for novice evaluators. The development of adaptations to HE that can support the performance of novice evaluators, reducing the costs of applying it, remains as a challenge in the literature. In this context, organizations with a low monetary power rarely conduct usability evaluation in their process of software development. Researches that intend to investigate new approaches to enhance the performance of novice evaluators during HE are highly important to help these organizations to increase the quality of their products and satisfaction of their customers. The purpose of this study was to adapt the HE for novice evaluators, developing a set of tactics based on the knowledge of expert evaluators use during their performance of HE. We conducted a survey with four experts in usability related area in order to collect their main procedures used to perform a HE that were not described in the original method, since it is a lean method.

Our goal was to identify and describe benefits of this technique to the design of more usable privacy controls. For this reason, we conducted a case study with voluntarily participants. We chose a parental control model from the literature to be the subject of evaluation for the experiment. Therefore, we extracted 19 units of information from its interface, and put them into cards for the Card Sorting evaluation. After the experiment, we obtained 30 valid responses.

The results showed that, even though the ARIA specication achieved the status of W3C Candidate Recommendation in 2011 and W3C Recommen-dation in 2014, few websites implemented Tab and Menu Widgets according to ARIA in the Web.

Technological navigation aids for blind must provide accurate information about the environment and select the best path to reach a chosen destination. Urban barriers represent dangers for the blind users.

Previous work demonstrated that redundant solutions in smart environments complemented by human computation could provide a reliable and trustful data source for a new generation of blind navigation systems.

This paper come up with an approach for automatically classifying dropdown menu widgets and their subcomponents using a machine learning pipeline which analyses mutations that occur in RIAs' Document Object Model (DOM) structure, triggered by users interactions or visual effects.

The maintenance of such software is problematic, since its documentation rarely reflects the implemented code. In this context Reverse Engineering of Software can help by means of recovering the project information lost during the development phase and documenting the current software state. This article discusses the issues emerged during the application of the method of reverse engineering named Fusion-RE/I. The described experiment is part of the re-engineering of a prototype hypermedia system, which has, as main goal, to adapt it to a Software Engineering domain. Since the target is a hypermedia system, the results obtained during the use of Fusion-RE/I can be registered as a hyperdocument. By doing that, it is possible to observe and analyse some relevant issues concerning the method Fusion-RE/I.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["585"]}

Software tools to the authoring and presentation of those documents are also presented in order to manipulate and delivery them in the Web, showing an effective support for structured web teaching material.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["585"]}

In this context, we report a case study regarding to the process of analyzing and structuring documentation produced by 20 student groups who have developed different projects as a task for an HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) course. Consequently, a DTD could be defined. The result, as a structured set of documents, has being re-written according to XML-DTD specification to be available for improved searching and ex-changing tasks, commonly performed by software developers. Finally, the process of abstracting such structure based on existing documents was concluded to be an iteractive activity, corresponding to alternate between bottom-up and top-down approaches.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["585"]}
