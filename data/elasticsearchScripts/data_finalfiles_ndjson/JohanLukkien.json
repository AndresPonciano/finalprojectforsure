However, when shaping strategies are used to prevent starvation of lower priorities, it becomes difficult to achieve tightness results using this method. The reason for this is that a busy period is defined as the longest interval in which there exists pending load. It is exclusively based on execution time, and does not take the amount of provided bandwidth into account. As a consequence, it is less suitable for the study of idling systems. In particular, we do not yet have tightness results regarding the analysis of the Ethernet AVB standard, in which credit-based shaping is applied.

This can lead to increased end-to-end delays (MPL), or creation of sub-optimal routes (RPL). Furthermore, as highlighted in this work, there is no clear consensus within the research community about what the proper parameter settings of the suppression mechanism should be.

{"title": "An efficient hierarchical scheduling framework for the automotive domain\n", "abstract": " Modern real-time systems have become exceedingly complex. A typical car is controlled by over 100 million lines of code executing on close to 100 Electronic Control Units (ECU). With more and more functions being implemented in software, the traditional approach of implementing each function (such as engine control, ABS, windows control) on a dedicated ECU is no longer viable, due to increased manufacturing costs, weight, power consumption, and decreased reliability and serviceability (Nolte et al., 2009). With the ECUs having increasingly more processing power, it has become feasible to integrate several functions on a single ECU. However, this introduces the challenge of supporting independent and concurrent development and analysis of individual functions which are later to be integrated on a shared platform. A popular approach in the industry and literature is component based engineering, where the complete system is divided into smaller software components which can be developed independently. The Automotive Open System Architecture (AUTOSAR)(AUTOSAR, 2011) standard is an example of such an approach in the automotive domain. It relies on a formal specification of component interfaces to verify the functional properties of their composition. Many functions in automotive systems, however, also have real-time constraints, meaning that their correct behavior is not only dependent on their functional correctness but also their temporal correctness. AUTOSAR does not provide temporal isolation between components.

Achieving predictable QoS behaviour therefore requires a resource-aware component framework.

The goal of this paper is to explore some basic principles and architectural choices for building such a resource-aware component framework that allow predictable composition of a system from distributed components.

To predict a user\u2019s context in the daily-life situation a system needs to learn from multimodal data that are often imbalanced, and noisy with missing values. The model is likely to encounter missing sensors in real-life conditions as well (such as a user not wearing a smartwatch) and it fails to infer the context if any of the modalities used for training are missing. In this paper, we propose a method based on an adversarial autoencoder for handling missing sensory features and synthesizing realistic samples. We empirically demonstrate the capability of our method in comparison with classical approaches for filling in missing values on a large-scale activity recognition dataset collected in-the-wild. We develop a fully-connected classification network by extending an encoder and systematically evaluate its multi-label classification performance when several modalities are missing. Furthermore, we show class-conditional artificial data generation and its visual and quantitative analysis on context classification task; representing a strong generative power of adversarial autoencoders.

Detection of faults helps diagnosis of problems and maintenance can be done to restore performance, for example, by replacing or reconfiguring faulty parts. Fault detection methods in the literature are too complex for typical low-resource devices and they do not perform well in detecting intermittent faults. We propose a fully distributed fault detection method that relies on evaluating statements about trustworthiness of aggregated data from neighbors. Given one or more trust statements that describe a fault-free state, the trustor node determines for each observation coming from the trustee whether it is an outlier or not. Several fault types can be explored using different trust statements whose parameters are assessed differently.

To support a mixture of time-triggered and event-triggered tasks, some industrial systems deploy an RTOS with a table-driven dispatcher complemented with a preemptive scheduler to allocate the free time slots to event-driven tasks. Rather than allocating dedicated time-slots to time-triggered tasks, in this work we provide RTOS support to dynamically re-allocate time-slots of time-triggered tasks within pre-computed time ranges to maximize the availability of the processing capacity for event-triggered tasks.

{"title": "Opaque analysis for resource sharing in compositional real-time systems\n", "abstract": " In this paper we propose opaque analysis methods to integrate dependent real-time components into hierarchical fixed-priority scheduled systems. To arbitrate mutually exclusive resource access between components, we consider two existing protocols: HSRP-comprising overrun with and without payback-and SIRAP. An opaque analysis allows to postpone the choice of a synchronization protocol until component integration time. First, we identify the sources of pessimism in the existing analysis techniques and we conclude that both protocols assume different models in their local analysis. In particular, the compositional analysis for overrun with payback (OWP) is not opaque and is pessimistic. The latter makes OWP expensive compared to its counter part without a payback mechanism (ONP). This paper presents an opaque and less pessimistic OWP analysis. Secondly, SIRAP requires more timing information to perform a task-level schedulability analysis. In many practical situations, however, detailed timing characteristics of tasks are hard to obtain. We introduce an opaque analysis for SIRAP using the analysis of ONP to reduce the required timing information during the local analysis. We show that the analysis for ONP cannot deem systems schedulable which are infeasible with SIRAP. The SIRAP analysis may therefore reduce the required system resources of a component by sacrificing the choice for an arbitrary synchronization protocol at system integration time1.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["652"]}

The same problem also arises for fixedpriority non-pre-emptive scheduling (FPNS), being a special case of FPDS. This paper provides a revised analysis, resolving the problems with the existing approaches. The analysis is based on known concepts of critical instant and busy period for FPPS. To accommodate for our scheduling model for FPDS, we need to slightly modify existing definitions of these concepts. The analysis assumes a continuous scheduling model, which is based on a partitioning of the timeline in a set of non-empty, right semi-open intervals. It is shown that the critical instant, longest busy period, and worst-case response time for a task are suprema rather than maxima for all tasks, except for the lowest priority task, ie that instant, period, and response time cannot be assumed. Moreover, it is shown that the analysis is not uniform for all tasks, ie the analysis for the lowest priority task differs from the analysis of the other tasks. These anomalies for the lowest priority task are an immediate consequence of the fact that only the lowest priority task cannot be blocked. To build on earlier work, the worst-case response time analysis for FPDS is expressed in terms of known\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["652"]}

The aim is to find the overall behavior of a chain from which performance parameters (such as start time and response time of individual tasks, chain end-to-end response time, number of context switches and resource utilization) follow. This behavior is characterized in terms of the elementary actions of the tasks that make up the chain. From this we derive corollaries that give design guidelines, supporting the goal of improving chain end-to-end response time and the optimization of resources, which is achieved by minimizing context-switching overhead and buffer sizes", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["652"]}

It is possible to construct dedicated hardware for IIR filters with a linear speedup, but because of their recursive nature these filters are considered difficult to map efficiently on a vector DSP. The IIR programs for vector DSPs presented so far have their speedup bounded by the order of the filter. In this paper we present a program that has a linear speed up, in the sense that doubling the vector size doubles the throughput. The program is a vectorization of the incremental block-state architecture. The speedup of this program is not bounded by the order of the filter, and even works for low order filters.

This vision embodies the idea of one\u2019s home, where all kinds of devices are connected to each other via a heterogenous network to serve the purpose of watching and/or listening to digital content everywhere inside the home. As this heterogenous network may contain wireless links, problems may occur when transmitting high quality video using present wireless technologies since these suffer from both short-and long-term fluctuations in the effective bandwidth they provide. As a result, there exists a Quality of Service (QoS) trade-off between picture quality and required bandwidth.One solution to tackle the QoS problem is by adapting the video to the currently available bandwidth before it is transmitted over the network. To achieve this, the video is converted to a scalable video format consisting of a base layer and up to two enhancement layers, each layer providing a different quality level. The conversion is performed by a real-time transcoder and the video is sent over the network by a network sender. The network sender is able to measure the currently available bandwidth by analyzing network traffic. Depending on these measurements, it sends a layering configuration for the scalable video to the transcoder. This layering configuration consists of the number of enhancement layers and the bit rates of each individual layer. This implies that the transcoder is capable of adjusting the number of layers and their bit rates at run-time.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["652"]}

The automatic and unobtrusive sensing of behavioral context can help develop solutions for assisted living, fitness tracking, sleep monitoring, and several other fields. Towards addressing this issue, we raise the question: can a machine learn to recognize a diverse set of contexts and activities in a real-life through joint learning from raw multi-modal signals (e.g. accelerometer, gyroscope and audio etc.)? In this paper, we propose a multi-stream temporal convolutional network to address the problem of multi-label behavioral context recognition. A four-stream network architecture handles learning from each modality with a contextualization module which incorporates extracted representations to infer a user's context. Our empirical evaluation suggests that a deep convolutional network trained end-to-end achieves an optimal recognition rate.

To illustrate the model, we apply it to a family of reservation prediction strategies and validate the outcome by means of a series of experiments in which we measure the resource utilization of two video components.

Each HSF comes with its own set of composition rules which take into account a specific synchronization protocol for arbitrating access to resources. However, the inventors of these synchronization protocols have also chosen to describe these composition rules with the help of protocol-specific component interfaces. This creates unnecessary framework dependencies on components.In this chapter, we review existing interfaces and propose uniform interfaces to integrate resource-sharingcomponentsinto HSFs. Forthepurposeofcomputinguniforminterfaces, we introduce a local (component-level) timing analysis for components which is independent (oragnostic) of theglobalsynchronization protocolbeingused forarbitrating access to shared resources. An individual component can therefore be analyzed as if all resources are entirely dedicated to it. Given its interface, the component can then be used with an arbitrary global synchronization protocol.

{"title": "Scavenging the channel share: performance on sensing and allocation\n", "abstract": " Perceptually appealing high graded streaming services maintain a persistent quality, even though the entropy levels of encoded information vary temporally/spatially. Transporting the streams over the network, imposes fluctuating QoS requirements on the underlying network, to cope up with these variations. Generally these requirements are mapped statically onto scarce wireless channel bandwidth using the IEEE 802.11 e standard, which supports prioritized arbitration through a set of medium access control (MAC) mechanisms. In an absolute QoS protection policy, the static mapping considers the maximum share requirements of streams, though the reservation is not always utilized over time, and therefore wasted. This offers a challenge to dynamically tune the MAC mechanisms objectively to minimize the channel bandwidth wastage. Hence this paper present a dynamic channel reservation model, which can intercept the signals of potential adaptation of MAC mechanisms distributively, and react accordingly. The model is verified by simulations. The results demonstrate the gain in channel utilization due to the dynamic approach, and compare the performance of model for different MAC mechanisms. Such a study highlights unnoticed and unintended wastage of channel, which can be avoided.

{"title": "Evaluation of Appearance Based Methods for Facial Expression Recognition\n", "abstract": " Analyzing the valence of emotion in human face images although is a trivial task for humans, the same process involves a lot of constraints for computer programs. Some of these constraints are due to the noise introduced by digital capturing devices such as cameras, while others include illumination variations and pose variations in the captured images. A number of approaches have been suggested [1],[2],[3] for detecting the presence of human faces in images which is also the first step in the process of analyzing the valence of emotions in the detected face images. The most important problem here is one that involves a way to represent most important characteristics that go into defining the face image. These important characteristics are defined as the feature vectors of the image. Most of these approaches present a good representation of face images and few have adopted a learning procedure to classify these features into face and non face classifications [1],[4]. Most of these approaches classify a single image and use the information extracted from single image (feature extraction) for classification purposes. Similar kind of work has been done in the area of speech recognition. A major difference in the approaches in two areas is that speech recognition includes temporal changes in the classification of feature vectors. One such significant approach is the one involving Hidden Markov Models.In the current work we investigate the couple of appearance based approaches namely the Local Binary patterns [2], and the optical flow motion estimation [5] as a part of obtaining the feature vectors. This process is followed by process of clustering\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["652"]}
{"title": "Real-time resource availability signalling in IMS-based networks\n", "abstract": " The emerging converged IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) allows the use of unlicensed, nondedicated and nondeterministic computer access networks for delivering IP multimedia services. To provide end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) over such networks combined with the IMS core network, for resource demanding real-time services, such as live multimedia services, is a serious challenge. The main problem is the variation of resource availability, both in the network and end devices, during a single multimedia session. One solution to this problem is adaptation of content and quality of the media according to availability of resources in both the end devices and network. However, this solution requires accurate and timely signalling of resource availability between communicating parties during a multimedia session. In this paper, we suggest how signalling can be done using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["652"]}
{"title": "Virtual community based secure service discovery and access for 3D video steaming applications\n", "abstract": " The Freeband I-Share project aims to define the mechanisms for trust, willingness, resource discovery and sharing mechanisms in virtual communities. To improve the secure and performance of a 3D video streaming application, which is a research vehicle of the I-Share project, we propose a virtual community based access control approach for secure service discovery and access (VICSDA) which groups services in virtual communities and only grants authenticated community members to discover and access these community services. There are two main contributions associated with this approach. First, different from most of the other access control approaches it adopts a dual access control mechanism which allows community services to define their local access control policy besides following the community membership policy. Second, behavior of these community services is monitored in order to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["652"]}
{"title": "Runtime failure detection and adaptive repair for fault-tolerant component-based applications\n", "abstract": " In software engineering appropriately developed reusable components may significantly reduce the design cost, shorten the time to the market and reduce the maintenance effort. For those reasons more and more attention has been paid to the component-based framework recently. In this chapter, to improve availability of each individual service instance in a component-based system, we propose a runtime configurable fault management mechanism (FMM) which utilizes model-based failure detection and rule-based repair. When more than one repair action is possible, FMM picks one that incurs the best tradeoff between the success rate, the cost of repair and the post-repair reliability measure. Furthermore, in order to gradually improve the quality of fault tolerance, FMM is designed to be able to accumulate knowledge and adapts its capability accordingly.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["652"]}
{"title": "Analysis of a chain starting with a time-driven component\n", "abstract": " In this article we provide a model for the dynamic behavior of media processing chains of software components communicating via bounded buffers. Components can have variable computation times and the first component in the chain has a periodic behavior. The aim is to find the overall behavior of a chain from which performance parameters (such as start time and response time of individual tasks, chain end-to-end response time, number of context switches and resource utilization) follow. This behavior is characterized in terms of the elementary actions of the tasks that make up the chain, and the associated schedule function. Knowing the behaviour of the chain at design time allows the optimization of resources, which is achieved by minimizing context switching overhead and buffer sizes. Additionally we show what are the conditions to be imposed at design time such that the chain satisfies its real-time constraints that influence directly the quality of service provided.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["652"]}
{"title": "A framework for video streaming to resource-constrained terminals\n", "abstract": " A large range of devices (from PDA to high-end TV) can receive and decode digital video. However, the capacity of one device is very different from the capacity of another device. This paper discusses how the same video but differently encoded can be efficiently distributed to a set of receiving devices. The key technology is scalable video coding. The paper shows how a framework assists in adapting the digital code to the changing transmission conditions to optimize the quality rendered at the different devices. The paper concludes with a validation based on a real-time streaming application.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["652"]}

The system consists of a compiler and a network loader. Readers are expected to be familiar with the language Pascal. We do not deal with Pascal in general but only with the implementation at hand. We assume also that readers are familiar with the Occam view on concurrency, in which a program consists of a collection of processes that communicate solely using point-to-point, one-directional channels (7]).The manual is organized as follows. In chapter 2 the language is described. In order to support parallelism, some modications of the standard denition of Pascal have been made and some extensions have been added. In chapter 3 we deal with standard libraries of procedures and functions that can be included in user programs.
