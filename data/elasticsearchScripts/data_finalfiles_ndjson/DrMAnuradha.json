{"title": "Detection of Burr Type XII Reliable Software Using Sequential Process Ratio Test: an Order Statistics Approach\n", "abstract": " As the volumes of data increases day by day, assessing software reliability takes more time using classical hypothesis. There is exigency for the people to have the tools/mechanisms to find out whether the software is reliable or not. Several methods came into existence to assess the software reliability. It captivate more period to come to a decision in Classical Hypothesis testing because the conclusions can be drawn only after infer the mass amounts of data. But by adopting Sequential Analysis of Statistical literature it can be decided very quickly whether the software which is developed is reliable or unreliable. This paper presents a modern technique of statistical science procedure called Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) using order statistic approach is applied to analyse the results for Burr Type XII model.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["442"]}
{"title": "SPC and Order Statistics: Burr Type XII Model\n", "abstract": " This paper presents a simple SRGM, the Burr Type XII Non Homogeneous Poisson Process (NHPP) model is used as a control mechanism based on order statistics of the cumulative quantity between observations of time domain failure data. This model has the ability of modeling both reliability improving and deteriorating systems and has gained wide acceptance. The Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method is used to derive the point estimators. We have applied the model to sets of existing software failure datasets to assess the failure process using SPC.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["442"]}
