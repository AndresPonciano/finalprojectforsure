{"title": "Network effects, software provision, and standardization\n", "abstract": " In this paper we examine the software provision decision of software firms. The provision decision by software firms determines the value and hence the market share of competing hardware technologies. We show how the provision decision by software firms determines whether multiple hardware technologies are supported in equilibrium or whether there is de facto standardization, with only one hardware technology supplied with software in equilibrium. We show that when consumers place a high value on software variety, there is a suboptimal amount of standardization by the market.", "num_citations": "640\n", "authors": ["838"]}

The study shows that consumers are willing to pay a significant premium for spreadsheets that are compatible with the Lotus platform and for spreadsheets that offer links to external databases, and a smaller premium for spreadsheets that offer local area network compatibility. These results support the hypothesis that the computer spreadsheet market exhibits network externalities. Finally, the quality-adjusted (real) price of computer spreadsheets declined by approximately 15% per year from 1986 to 1991.", "num_citations": "597\n", "authors": ["838"]}
{"title": "Price manipulation in the Bitcoin ecosystem\n", "abstract": " To its proponents, the cryptocurrency Bitcoin offers the potential to disrupt payment systems and traditional currencies. It has also been subject to security breaches and wild price fluctuations. This paper identifies and analyzes the impact of suspicious trading activity on the Mt.\u00a0Gox Bitcoin currency exchange, in which approximately 600,000 bitcoins (BTC) valued at $188 million were fraudulently acquired. During both periods, the USD-BTC exchange rate rose by an average of four percent on days when suspicious trades took place, compared to a slight decline on days without suspicious activity. Based on rigorous analysis with extensive robustness checks, the paper demonstrates that the suspicious trading activity likely caused the unprecedented spike in the USD-BTC exchange rate in late 2013, when the rate jumped from around $150 to more than $1,000 in two months.", "num_citations": "479\n", "authors": ["838"]}

For such systems there is interdependence between the hardware-adoption decisions of consumers and the supply decisions of software manufacturers.

We do so by examining early dynamics of exchange rates among different cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin essentially dominates this market, our data suggest no evidence of a winner-take-all effect early in the market. Indeed, for a relatively long period, a few other cryptocurrencies competing with Bitcoin (the early industry leader) appreciated much more quickly than Bitcoin. The data in this period are consistent with the use of cryptocurrencies as financial assets (popularized by Bitcoin), and not consistent with winner-take-all dynamics. Toward the end of our sample, however, things change dramatically. Bitcoin appreciates against the USD, while other currencies depreciate against the USD. The data in this period are consistent with strong network effects and winner-take-all dynamics. This trend continues at the time of writing.

In addition, it is shown that regulating the number of nodes (as in a permissioned network) does not lead to additional cost savings that cannot otherwise be achieved via a setting of block rewards in a permissionless (ie, free entry) network. This suggests that permissioned networks will not be able to economize on costs relative to permissionless networks.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["838"]}

{"title": "The development of cable television in Israel\n", "abstract": " The Israeli telecommunications industry has recently undergone significant changes. One of the most important changes was the decision to establish a cable television (CATV) industry in the country. The decision of the government not to play an active role in the development and provision of CATV represented a significant departure from past practice. This paper describes the development of the CATV industry in Israel and evaluates how well the evolution of the industry has served the public interest.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["838"]}
{"title": "Long-Term Care Facilities as a Risk Factor for Death Due to COVID-19: Evidence from European Countries and US States\n", "abstract": " A large percentage of the deaths from COVID-19 occur among residents of long-term care facilities. There are two possible reasons for this phenomenon. First, the structural features of such settings may lead to death. Alternatively, it is possible that individuals in these facilities are in poorer health than those living elsewhere, and that these individuals would have died even if they had not been in these facilities. Our findings show that, controlling for the population density and the percentage of older adults in the population, there is a significant positive association between the number of long-term care beds per capita and COVID-19 mortality rates. This finding provides support for the claim that long-term care living arrangements (of older people) are a significant risk factor for dying from COVID-19.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["838"]}
{"title": "Online exploration, content choice & echo chambers: An experiment\n", "abstract": " In this experiment, we create an online search environment where users explore the TED Talks collection, and choose a talk to watch. As users search in this environment, they can separately control two search dimensions-topic and popularity. Furthermore, in topic-based searches, we randomly block/show popularity information. We ask: what types of users are most likely to get caught in a content echo chamber and what is the role of popularity information provision in facilitating echo chambers? Susceptibility to echo chambers is proxied by:(I) conducting little to no exploration in the search process, and (II) relying on popularity in content choice. We find that high levels of sociability and previous experience with similar content are associated with susceptibility to echo chambers. Opinion leadership, on the other hand, is associated with more exploration and lower reliance on popularity. Interestingly, popularity information provision increases opinion leaders' popularity sorting, and thus raises the potential for content echo chambers.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["838"]}

{"title": "An Introduction to Key Themes in the Economics of Cyber Security\n", "abstract": " Software security is an important concern for vendors, consumers, and regulators since attackers who exploit vulnerabilities can cause significant damage. In this brief paper, I discuss key themes in the budding literature on the economics of cyber-security. My primary focus is on how economics incentives affect the major issues and themes in information security. Two important themes relevant for the economics of cyber security issues are (i) a security externality and (ii) a network effect that arises in the case of computer software. A nascent economics literature has begun to examine the interaction between vulnerability disclosure, patching, product prices and profits.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["838"]}
{"title": "Out of sight: patents that have never been cited\n", "abstract": " Patent citations have become an acceptable proxy for inventions\u2019 quality. Our study offers the first systematic exploration of uncited patents. Analyzing data on all US patents issued between 1976 and 2008, we examine the ratio of uncited patents out of all patents granted each year. We find a robust pattern, consistent across technological fields, whereby the percentage of uncited patents declined between 1976 and the mid-1990s, but has been significantly increasing since then. We discuss policy implications of these findings and suggest that the ratio of uncited patents can serve as a complementary measure for evaluating the patent system.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["838"]}
{"title": "Networks and spillovers in software in Israeli Hi-Tech\n", "abstract": " A large literature has used patent data to measure knowledge spillovers across inventions but has not explicitly considered the collaboration networks formed by inventors as a mechanism for shaping these knowledge flows. Using a recently developed methodology, we examine the incidence and nature of knowledge flows mediated by the collaboration networks of inventors. We apply this methodology to three sectors in which programming skills are vital:(i) Information and Communication Technology/Information Security (ICT/IS)(ii) Financial Technology (Fin-Tech,) and (iii) Medical Technology (Med-Tech.) These are all areas of innovation in which Israel should have a comparative advantage. We find the following:(I) the quality of the Israeli ICT/information security inventions is systematically linked to the structure of the collaborative network. In particular, we find positive and significant direct and indirect knowledge spillovers.(II) We find no evidence of such spillovers in either Fin-Tech or Med-Tech.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["838"]}
{"title": "DP11851 Following the Code: Spillovers and Knowledge Transfer\n", "abstract": " It is believed that there are significant knowledge spillovers in Open Source Software (OSS). If such spillovers exist, it is likely they occur via two channels: In the first channel, programmers take knowledge, expertise, and experience gained from one OSS project they work on and employ it in another OSS project they work on. In the second, programmers reuse software code by taking code from one OSS project and employing it in another OSS project. In previous work, we found knowledge spillovers via the first channel. In this paper we develop a methodology to measure software reuse at the micro-micro level in a large OSS network. We find that projects that reuse code from other projects have higher success. Controlling for code reuse, we also find knowledge spillovers from projects connected via common programmers. Thus, our empirical work suggests that knowledge spillovers occur via both channels.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["838"]}

{"title": "Sorting out the search engine market\n", "abstract": " Many observers believe that the emergence of the Internet has profoundly changed society. Perhaps the most important feature of the Internet is the tremendous amount of publicly accessible information. According to estimates by Lawrence and Giles (1998, 1999), the number of publicly indexable pages on the World Wide Web grew from 320 million in December 1997 to 800 million in February 1999. Search engines hold the key to helping consumers access and sort the wealth of information on the web. Many search engines are consistently among the top 25 most visited Web sites. This suggests that Internet users spend a significant amount of time using search engines to find relevant information. Indeed, a recent study by Statistical Research Inc.(2000) estimates that 57 percent of Internet users search the Web every day, making searches the second most popular activity on the Web, after e-mail. Approximately 81 percent of users check e-mail each day. 2 Despite the sophistication of the search engines, they are far from comprehensive. For example, search engines are more likely to index\" popular\" sites (ie, those sites that have more links to them) and sites that are in the United States. 3 Lawrence and Giles remark that\" search engines can be compared to a phone book which is updated irregularly, is biased toward listing more popular information, and has most of the pages ripped out\" 4 (http://wwwmetrics. com/). In this chapter I examine the evolution of and competition in the Internet search engine market. The goal of my analysis is to examine whether early entrants benefit in the long run from their first-mover position in Internet markets\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["838"]}
