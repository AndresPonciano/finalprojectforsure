{"title": "Proposal of Enhanced Extreme Programming Model\n", "abstract": " Extreme programming is one of the commonly used agile methodologies in software development. It is very responsive to changing requirements even in the late phases of the project. However, quality activities in extreme programming phases are implemented sequentially along with the activities that work on the functional requirements. This reduces the agility to deliver increments continuously and makes an inverse relationship between quality and agility. Due to this relationship, extreme programming does not consume enough time on making extensive documentation and robust design. To overcome these issues, an enhanced extreme programming model is proposed. Enhanced extreme programming introduces parallelism in the activities' execution through putting quality activities into a separate execution line. In this way, the focus on delivering increments quickly is achieved without affecting the quality of the final output. In enhanced extreme programming, the quality concept is extended to include refinement of all phases of classical extreme programming and creating architectural design based on the refined design documents.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["1370"]}

{"title": "Proposed Framework to Manage Software Requirements and Reuse\n", "abstract": " Requirement elicitation and analysis form the focal point in the initial stages of the software development process. Unfortunately, in many software development projects, developers and end-users speak different languages. On one hand, end-users prefer to use natural languages while software developers who are technically perceptive, tend to use conceptual models. This difference in technical knowledge creates a communication gap, a potential cause of poor quality software products or project conflicts. The aim of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of a novel technique that seeks to foster effective elicitation of software requirements and support the implementation of structures that match particular requirements. By combining requirement elicitation and re-usable parts, the proposed solution envisages improvements in the overall software design process leading to enhanced requirement specifications. The novel idea is to incorporate an intermediate step for mapping Unified Modeling Language (UML) to Web Ontology Language (OWL) to enable the addition of ontology languages. The proposed model is validated through a survey. The validation results show that the proposed solution allows software developers to elicit software requirements and implement structures that match certain requirements.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1370"]}

The Main drawbacks of new software development are more costly, and need maintenance. Reuse is solution of these problems that caused the widespread usage of object oriented (OO) development. Object oriented development is the backbone of component-based development (CBD). CBD facilitates reuse of the existing components (by customizing) with the new ones. Main advantages of reusable components are more reliable, saved time and reduced cost. CBD approach is different from traditional/new software development. Several models have been proposed for traditional software development such as Waterfall, Rapid Application Development (RAD), Evolutionary, Rational Unified Process (RUP) and agile. Whereas the popular CBD models, for customized development, are V, Y, Umbrella and W. Almost all software development companies, both the new software and customized software have to be developed.

{"title": "Induction of Interactive Methods to Teach Software Engineering Course\n", "abstract": " Software engineering (SE) field is considered as a backbone of software industry. Students suffer many problems and difficulties when they approach to industry due to the old contents of SE course, lack of practice and inability in the subject area. The main reason of the SE course problems is the lack of coordination or gap between software industry and academia. This paper proposed a novel solution to enhance SE curriculum to bridge the gap between industry and academia. The proposed solution will assist students at optimal level in their professional careers to achieve goals of SE course. Survey research methodology is used to evaluate the proposed solution and the results of data analysis are highly encouraging. It is anticipated that the universities will find this research helpful to improve the quality of SE course.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1370"]}
{"title": "The proposal of a novel software testing framework\n", "abstract": " Software testing is normally used to check the validity of a program. Test oracle performs an important role in software testing. The focus in this research is to perform class level test by introducing a testing framework. A technique is developed to generate test oracle for specification-based software testing using Vienna Development Method (VDM++) formal language. A three stage translation process, of VDM++ specifications of container classes to C++ test oracle classes, is described in this paper. It is also presented that how derived test oracle is integrated into a proposed functional testing framework. This technique caters object oriented features such as inheritance and aggregation, but concurrency is not considered in this work. Translation issues, limitations and evaluation of the technique are also discussed. The proposed approach is illustrated with the help of popular triangle problem case study.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1370"]}

Knowledge management system (KMS) is a process of knowledge extraction, storage, transformation, analysis, distribution and deployment. Strategic alliance plays an increasing role to a global scale in technology business competition. Organizations are able to use alliances to respond to new technology and deliver new products more efficiently. The relationship between knowledge management and strategic alliance is identified. Knowledge transfer and selecting suitable partner are critical factors in the success of strategic alliance of an organization. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed for KMS strategic alliance. By applying this framework, strategic alliance will be highly achievable in corporate companies.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1370"]}
{"title": "Kinect Based Electronic Assisting System to Facilitate People with Disabilities Using KXPRUM Agile Model\n", "abstract": " There is a need of electronic assisting system to facilitate people with disabilities to perform their daily life tasks. Microsoft Kinect technology was introduced with Xbox to allow the children to play games using motions instead of using joysticks. The success of Kinect technology came up heuristically to scientists to use this technology in other disciplines like medical field. This research is conducted to develop an electronic assisting system to facilitate patients to make them free of attendants to perform routine tasks like on coffee maker, on/off air conditioner/light and control wheelchair. A customized KXPRUM model is proposed to develop the electronic system. The results are reported on the first four releases of electronic assisting system. Five patients act as customer to conduct case study to validate the proposed KXPRUM model. 80% customer satisfaction is achieved to show the effectiveness of the proposed model.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1370"]}
