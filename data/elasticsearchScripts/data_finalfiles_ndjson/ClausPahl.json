{"title": "A lightweight container middleware for edge cloud architectures\n", "abstract": " In typical cloud applications, most of the data processing is done on the back end and the clients are relatively thin. Integrating Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and sensors into such an environment in a straightforward manner causes several problems. If billions of new devices start shipping data into the cloud, this will have a major impact on the flow of network traffic. Also, certain applications require real-time behavior (eg self-driving cars) and cannot afford to wait for data, which may arrive late due to network delays. Finally, users may also not want to send sensitive or private data into the cloud, losing control over it (this is especially important for healthcare applications). Consequently, cloud computing is moving away from large, centralized structures toward multicloud environments. The integration of cloud and sensor-based IoT environments results in edge cloud or fog computing [1, 2], in which a substantial part of the data processing takes place on the IoT devices themselves. Rather than moving data from the IoT to the cloud, the computation moves to the edge of the cloud [3]. However, when running these kinds of workloads on such an infrastructure, we are confronted with different issues: the deployed devices are constrained in terms of computational power, storage capability, reliable connectivity, power supply, and other resources. For a start, we need solutions that are lightweight enough to be run on resource-constrained devices.

This work focuses on an alternative approach, based on the edge cloud computing model, ie, processing and filtering data before transferring it to a backing cloud infrastructure. We describe the implementation of a low-power and low-cost cluster of single board computers (SBC) for this context, applying models and technologies from the Big Data domain with the aim of reducing the amount of data which has to be transferred elsewhere. To implement the system, a cluster of Raspberry Pis was built, relying on Docker to containerize and deploy an Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark cluster, on which a test application is then executed. A monitoring stack based on Prometheus, a popular monitoring and alerting tool in the cloud-native industry, is used to gather system metrics and analyze the performance of the setup. We evaluate the complexity of the system, showing that by means of containerization increased fault tolerance and ease of maintenance can be achieved, which makes the proposed solution suitable for an industrial environment. Furthermore, an analysis of the overall performance, which takes into account the resource usage of the proposed solution with regards to the constraints imposed by the devices, is presented in order to discuss the capabilities and limitations of proposed architecture.", "num_citations": "31\n", "authors": ["636"]}

The trustmarks would be informed by live performance data from the cloud service provider, or ideally an independent third-party accountability and assurance service that would communicate up-to-date information relating to service performance and dependability. By combining assurance measures with a remediation scheme, cloud service providers could both signal dependability to customers and the wider marketplace and provide customers, auditors and regulators with a mechanism for determining accountability in the event of failure or non-compliance. As a result, the trustmarks would convey to consumers of cloud services and other stakeholders that strong assurance and accountability measures are in place for the service in question and thereby address trust and confidence issues in cloud computing.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["636"]}

{"title": "An approach to unified cloud service access, manipulation and dynamic orchestration via semantic cloud service operation specification framework\n", "abstract": " Cloud computing offers various computational resources via convenient on-demand service provision. Currently, heterogeneous services and cloud resources are usually utilized and managed through diverse service portals. This significantly limits the effectiveness and efficiency for tasks implementation. Fundamentally, it is due to the lack of adequate specifications for service concepts, operations and interfaces from diverse cloud service models and types. This paper proposes a service management operation semantic description framework for comprehensive cloud service operation specification. Relying on ontological modelling techniques, cloud service operations are specified via entity classification, attribute assertion, relationship assertion and annotation assertion. Further, the proposed framework benefits from operation reasoning application. It enables intelligent assistance for multiple operation preparation and remote execution tasks. Based on the approach, a cloud service operation ontology and a unified service access and manipulation system prototype are implemented. Extensive experiments are conducted over different cloud service providers and for distinct service models. Obtained results demonstrate that the approach outperforms existing practices by facilitating reliable and effective service access, manipulation and interaction tasks.", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["636"]}

Often, data that is accumulated on the devices has to be sent to remote cloud data centers for processing. However, with hardware capabilities of controllers continuously increasing and the need for better performance and security through local processing, directly processing data on a remote cluster, known as Edge Computing, is a favourable solution. Recent trends such as microservices, containerization and serverless technology provide solutions for interconnecting the nodes and deploying software across the created cluster. This paper aims at proposing a serverless architecture for clustered container applications. The architecture relies on the MQTT protocol for communication, Prometheus for monitoring and Docker swarm in conjunction with openFaas for deploying services across a cluster. Using the proposed architecture as a foundation, a concrete traffic management application is implemented as a proof-of-concept.

The contract concept supports the re-use of components by providing means to establish and modify component interconnections. A flexible contract concept shall be based on a refinement relation for operations and classes, derived from operation abstractions.

Process-centric systems, ranging from enterprise workflow systems to open distributed service compositions, have significantly increased in number and complexity. Objective: Designers of process-centric systems can benefit from process abstractions (including patterns) capturing and allowing the reuse of designs for frequent operational problems. Existing process patterns detection techniques have efficiency problems and difficulties to identify partial and inexact pattern instances. Method: We propose a process pattern detection technique based on a family of subgraph matching algorithms. The algorithms implement surjective graph morphism detection and a mechanism to incorporate semantic similarity computation for types and attributes of process graph elements.

Process variability models, known from product line modelling and manufacturing, can control this customisation by taking into account the domain models. While activities and objects have already been studied, we investigate here the constraints that govern a process execution. In order to integrate these constraints into a process model, we use a rule-based constraints language for a workflow and process model.

{"title": "Change impact analysis for evolving ontology-based content management\n", "abstract": " Ontologies have become ubiquitous tools to embed semantics into content and applications on the semantic web. They are used to define concepts in a domain and allow us to reach at a common understanding on subjects of interest. Ontologies cover wide range of topics enabling both humans and machines to understand meanings and to reason in different contexts. They cover topics such as semantic web, artificial intelligence, information retrieval, machine translation, software development, content management, etc. We use ontologies for semantic annotation of content to facilitate understandability of the content by humans and machines. However, building ontology and annotations is often a manual process which is error prone and time consuming. Ontologies and ontology-driven content management systems (OCMS) evolve due to a change in conceptualization, the representation or the specification of the domain knowledge. These changes are often immense and frequent. Implementing the changes and adapting the OCMS accordingly require a huge effort. This is due to complex impacts of the changes on the ontologies, the content and dependent applications. Thus, evolving the OCMS with minimum and predictable impacts is among the top priorities of evolution in OCMS. We approach the problem of evolution by proposing a framework which clearly represents the interactions of the components of an OCMS. We proposed a layered OCMS framework which contains an ontology layer, content layer and annotation layer. Further, we propose a novel approach for analysing impacts of change operations.

SOA has the potential to bridge the gap between business and technology and to improve the reuse of existing applications and the interoperability with new ones.

Knowledge gained from integration projects can be captured to build a repository of semantically enriched, experience-based solutions. Business patterns identify the interaction and structure between users, business processes, and data.

We use Hidden Hierarchical Markov Models to map observed performance anomalies to hidden resources, and to identify the root causes of the observed anomalies in order to improve reliability.

We propose a four phase process that covers the operationalization, representation and detection of higher-level changes in ontology evolution life cycle.

The layered change log model has been used to achieve two purposes, i.e. recording of ontology changes and mining of implicit knowledge such as intent of change, change patterns etc. We formalize the change log using a graph-based approach. We introduce a technique to identify composite changes that not only assist in formulating ontology change log data in a more concise manner, but also help in realizing the semantics and intent behind any applied change.

The dynamic business environment and the problems with the long time implementation, high cost, etc. of process development and maintenance, are pushing organisations as process consumers to look for ready to use and shared business processes from IT providers for on demand requirements. This is manifest in the rising of Cloud Computing and Business Process Outsourcing with the development of the new concept of (business) Process as a Service. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an architectural style commonly adopted for enterprise IT infrastructures and the implementation of service based business processes. However, the SOA style and current specifications do not intend for the case of business processes sharing with cross organisational consumers, since various requirements or the business policies of different organisations, are unmanageable to meet on a business process at the same time.  In this thesis, we present an architectural solution to address the above issues for the Process as a Service. It consists of a Service Process Architecture (SPA) architectural style designed to extend the SOA style, and a supported architecture framework designed for the specific style. The proposed SPA style has a defined principle for the goal of process customizability and adaptability on process design and development with providers.

The cloud with its infinite resources can accommodate many of the existing scenarios, however, as new scenarios emerge in the IoT area, the cloud falls short. In this context, the Edge Computing model emerged as an extension to the cloud in support of low latency and high-performance applications, by placing part of cloud resources at the edge of the network, in close proximity to the data sources and applications. The goal of Edge Computing is to provide the same level of abstraction at the cloud but in a local context. However, since Edge Computing inherits many of the benefits provided by the cloud, it also inherits some of its drawbacks. One such limitation is the management overhead needed to set-up and continuously configure the Edge Computing applications. In the cloud space, this problem has been addressed using a new paradigm called serverless technology. Similarly, in the Edge Computing, few attempts are being developed to bring the concept of Serverless Computing at the edge.

{"title": "Using a cloud broker API to evaluate cloud service provider performance\n", "abstract": " Cloud service brokerage enables the cloud service ecossytem to become more interoperable and allows users to migrate between offerings easily. To this end, we developed a multi-cloud storage broker in the format of an API to allow objects to be stored and retrieved uniformly across a range of storage providers, allowing for portability and easy migration. This multi-cloud storage abstraction is implemented as a Java-based multi-cloud storage API and supports GoogleDrive, Drop-Box, Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services. The library offers three services, namely a file service, blob service and table service. A test application was used to compare storage operations across different providers. The abstraction is based on a layered ontological framework. While many multi-cloud applications exist, we will focus on mapping the layered ontology onto a design pattern-based organisation of the architecture to demonstrate how this meets the required maintainability and extensibility properties.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["636"]}

{"title": "Exploiting patterns and tool support for reusable and automated change support for software architectures\n", "abstract": " Lehman\u2019s law of continuing change implies that software must continually evolve to accommodate frequently changing requirements in existing systems. Also, maintainability as an attribute of system quality requires that changes are to be systematically implemented in existing software throughout its lifecycle. To support a continuous software evolution, the primary challenges include (i) enhancing reuse of recurring changes; and (ii) decreasing the efforts for change implementation. We propose change patterns and demonstrate their applicability as reusable solutions to recurring problems of architectural change implementation. Tool support can empower the role of a designer/architect by facilitating them to avoid labourious tasks and executing complex and large number of changes in an automated way. Recently, change patterns as well as tool support have been exploited for architecture evolution, however; there is no research to unify pattern-driven (reusable) and toolsupported (automated) evolution that is the contribution of this paper. By exploiting patterns with tool support we demonstrate the evolution of a peerto-peer system towards client-server architecture. Evaluation results suggest that:(i) patterns promote reuse but lack fine-granular change implementation, and (ii) tool supports automation but user intervention is required to customise architecture change management.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["636"]}

The convergence speed of the genetic algorithm is quite low in solving many of the large hybrid optimization problems. In other similar studies, heuristic algorithms were used to solve the interval scheduling problem. Such algorithms are not able to find nearly optimal solutions to hard problems. Since the optimization of scheduling is part of the hard problems, it is wise to use meta-heuristic algorithms to find nearly optimal solutions. Accordingly, an energy-aware meta-heuristic scheduling algorithm is presented in this paper for realtime virtual machines. The main goal of this algorithm is to minimize the total busy time of the physical machines in an interval without violating the deadline for virtual machines.

{"title": "The Role of Experimental Exploration in Cloud Migration for SMEs.\n", "abstract": " The migration of IT systems to the cloud is still a problem, in particular for smaller companies without much cloud expertise. Generally, some expected benefits are defined and an awareness of potential problems does exist to some extent in the organisations. However, this is often not sufficient to confidently embark on a full migration project in the cloud. While discussions and conceptual analyses can help to some extent, we explore here the suitability of feasibility studies with experimental explorations at the core. These studies would typically cost 5% of the overall migration cost based on our use cases, but can help with a reliable risk assessment. It can clarify how much of the expectations and intentions can materialise in the cloud. The cost of the migration, but, more importantly, the cost of operating an IT system in the cloud can be estimated. Using a feasibility study with an experimental core based on a partial prototype delivers much more reliable figures regarding configurations, quality-of-service and costing than a theoretical analysis could deliver.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["636"]}
{"title": "A Framework for Generating Domain-specific Rule for Process Model Customisation.\n", "abstract": " The domain-specific model-driven development requires effective and flexible techniques for implementing domain-specific rule generators. In this paper, we present a framework for rule generation through model translation with feature model, a high-level of the domain model to translate into low-level of rule language based on the paradigm of software reuse in terms of customisation and configuration with domain-specific rule strategies benefit mode-to-text translations. This framework is domain-specific where non-technical domain user can customise and configure the business process models. These compositions support two dimensional of translation modularity by using software product line engineering. The domain engineering is achieved by designing the domain and process model as a requirement space, it is also called template model, connecting with feature model through weaving model. The feature model is a high-level input model to customise the template model to an implementation. The application engineering is achieved by supporting the rule definition and configuring the generated rules. We discuss the development approach of the framework in a domain-specific environment; we present a case study in a Digital Content Technology (DCT) domain.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["636"]}
{"title": "Change Support to Maintain Quality in Learning Technology Systems\n", "abstract": " The quality of learning technology systems can degrade over time due to changes in learners, content and the software environment. This might occur as long-term evolution of the system to adjust the system to environmental changes or as part of short-term adaptation in order to adapt to the learner behaviour and knowledge. We present a quality management framework for changing environments that integrates evolution and adaptation. The framework sees evolution and adaption as two incarnation of change. A key concept is the notion of feedback that causes quality goals such as learning achievement or learner experience to be changed or the need to adjust the system to maintain existing goals. The aim is to support instructors, course designer and platform support in understanding the interaction of evolution and adaptation and to help them in designing, modelling, running and maintaining\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["636"]}

The virtually unlimited availability of cloud resources enables service owners to consume resources without quantitative restrictions, paying only for what they use. To avoid cost overruns, resource consumption must be controlled and capped when necessary. We present a distributed tree-based protocol for managing quotas in clouds that minimizes communication overheads and reduces the time required to determine whether a quota has been exhausted. Experimental evaluation shows that our protocol reduces communication costs by 42% relative to a distributed baseline solution and is up to 15 times faster.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["636"]}

Architecture-centric software evolution (ACSE) enables change in system structure and behavior while maintaining a global view of software to address evolution-centric tradeoffs. Lehman\u2019s law of continuing change demands for long-living and continuously evolving architectures to prolong the productive life and economic value of software systems. To support a continuous change, the existing solutions fall short of exploiting generic and reusable solutions to address frequent ACSE problems. We argue that architectural evolution process requires an explicit evolution-centric knowledge for pro-active and anticipative change management. We propose a pattern language (PatEvol) as a collection of 7 change patterns that enable reuse-driven and consistent architecture evolution. We integrate architecture change mining (PatEvol development) as a complementary and integrated phase to facilitate reuse-driven architecture change execution (PatEvol application). In the proposed pattern language, reuse-knowledge is expressed as a network-of-patterns that build on each other to facilitate a generic, first-class abstraction to operationalise recurring evolution tasks. We exploit language based formalism to promote patterns and prevent potential anti-patterns during ACSE. The pattern language itself continuously evolves with an incremental acquisition of new patterns from architecture change logs over-time.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["636"]}

As identified by F. Brooks (F. Brooks, The Mythical Man-Month, Addison Wesley, 1995), complexity of software system consists of the essential complexity, the complexity of problems that are part of requirements placed upon software systems, and accidental complexity caused by the use of current software engineering methods and technologies. Current trends in the use and development of information technology raise the both dimensions of complexity.

In an earlier paper, we introduced a facetted dimension model to capture the various factors of change and suggested a change-aware design of LTS. The purpose of the paper here is to add empirical results to the facets in order to show the relevance of the dimension model by specifically looking at an LTS that has been developed, maintained and extended over a period of more than 20 years.

{"title": "Graph-based pattern matching and discovery for process-centric service architecture design and integration\n", "abstract": " Process automation and applications integration initiatives are often complex and involve significant resources in large organisations. The increasing adoption of service-based architectures to solve integration problems and the widely accepted practice of utilising patterns as a medium to reuse design knowledge motivated the definition of this work. In this work a pattern-based framework and techniques providing automation and structure to address the process and application integration problem are proposed. The framework is a layered architecture providing modelling and traceability support to different abstraction layers of the integration problem. To define new services - building blocks of the integration solution - the framework includes techniques to identify process patterns in concrete process models. Graphs and graph morphisms provide a formal basis to represent patterns and their relation to models. A family of graph-based algorithms support automation during matching and discovery of patterns in layered process service models. The framework and techniques are demonstrated in a case study. The algorithms implementing the pattern matching and discovery techniques are investigated through a set of experiments from an empirical evaluation. Observations from conducted interviews to practitioners provide suggestions to enhance the proposed techniques and direct future work regarding analysis tasks in process integration initiatives.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["636"]}

During the execution of service compositions, architectural constraint violations relating to functional and non-fucntional system properties need to be handled intelligently and autonomously, possibly requiring architectural reconfigurations. We propose integrated architectural constraint violation handling to deal with architectural quality problems through dynamic reconfiguration.

{"title": "Constraint-based validation of e-learning courseware\n", "abstract": " Courseware defines a course in terms of its learning content, by defining what learning content to deliver to a learner, when it should be delivered and how. Courseware is generally delivered and managed using some type of Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) or Learning Management System (LMS). Courseware authoring, also known as courseware construction, is a rapidly evolving research area that is concerned with the tools and methodologies, a course creator uses, to define and create courseware. Understanding how people learn and using that knowledge to create better courses has always been a challenge for course creators. The literature provides the course creator with general course construction methodologies, embedded in pedagogical principles [Gagn\u00e9 et al., 2005, Reigeluth, 1999a, Reigeluth, 1983a, Briggs et al., 1991]. Course creators may also apply their own pedagogy in courseware construction. For example sequencing courseware topics in a particular way or ensuring that learning resources do not take an unreasonable amount of time to complete. Although course creators aim to apply pedagogical principles to the courseware they construct, when developing large courseware this can be difficult, especially when there are seemingly more pressing issues, such as standards compliance and delivery deadlines. When pedagogical principles are not adequately applied in courseware it can can lead learner confusion, motivational prob-", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["636"]}

{"title": "Bringing Activity into E-Learning\u2013the Development of Online Active Learning and Training Environments\n", "abstract": " Interaction is central in learning processes (Moore, 1992; Ohl, 2001). E-learning systems can act as mediators in the interaction between the learner and her or his environment, ie content, peers, and instructors. Engaging the learner in a learning process through interaction is a central element of successful learning design (Sims, 1997). The current predominant focus on knowledge transfer in e-learning is partly a result of a lack of interactive multimedia technologies. With the recognition of skills training as being equally important to knowledge acquisition, more work has been done on activity-based learning and training supported by interactive multimedia technology (Trikic, 2001). With advances in multimedia and Web technologies, a shift from purely knowledge-based learning towards activity-based learning and training can be observed (Okamoto et al., 2001).Interactive Web and multimedia technologies support skills-oriented training in learning technology systems in addition to knowledge-based learning. In particular, in e-learning environments, the learner-content interaction is often more central than the learner\u2019s interaction with instructors and peers (Ohl, 2001). The focus here is on the development of active learning objects based on interactive educational multimedia. Advanced uses of multimedia, in particular interactive educational multimedia, is a technical solution that can support activity-based e-learning and e-training (Elsom-Cook, 2001). Active learning is characterized by knowledge-or skills-level interaction of the learner with e-learning system and content, ie goes beyond the typical navigation and delivery", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["636"]}

It is proposed that these ontologies can readily be converted into standardised courseware learning objects, which can either be used directly by students and teachers or can be of assistance to authors in designing and building complex courseware material.
