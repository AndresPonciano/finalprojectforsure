This study aims to aggregate and identify useful object-oriented measures, specifically those obtainable from the source code of object-oriented systems that have gone through such empirical evaluation. By conducting a systematic literature review, 99 primary studies were identified and traced to four external quality attributes: reliability, maintainability, effectiveness and functionality. A vote-counting approach was used to investigate the link between object-oriented measures and the attributes, and to also assess the consistency of the relation reported across empirical studies. Most of the studies investigate links between object-oriented measures and proxies for reliability attributes, followed by proxies for maintainability.

Despite claims that offshoring is motivated for less offensive reasons than simply reducing costs, the main driving force has always been related to costs [2]. The realization of economic benefits, however, seems to be mystified, resulting in a lack of clarity. On one hand, industrial experiences demonstrate that the assumed benefits are not always achieved and thus shall not be taken for granted [5]. On the other hand, senior executives are easily driven away by promised salary differences. An industry report about a successful offshore outsourcing project with timely delivered good quality software mentions attractive hourly rates in India versus Germany and consequent \u201csignificant cost saving\u201d expressed as \u201cseveral million\u20ac/year\u201d[1]. But how trustworthy is such claims? Is there any actual evidence and transparency in the way costs have been calculated? Other industrial studies indicate that cost-savings are not as drastic as pure salary comparisons suggest, due to additional managerial overhead [5],[6]. In fact, the benefit of low-cost labor must be weighed against the risk of missed deadlines, dissatisfied users, and failure to reduce development costs. So what shall we trust? To shed some light on this matter, we trace the claims of cost-savings and offer our judgment of the evidence.Evidence is the basis for decision-making.

In this paper we explore an implementation of an offshore strategy in a Swedish software company that opened its offshore branch in Russia. Based on extensive documentation analysis we create an overview of the initially expected benefits and obstacles that prevailed among onshore product and development unit managers. Years after implementation of the offshore insourcing strategy we asked these managers about the achievement of their expectations. We observed that the company documented various expected benefits when implementing an offshoring strategy and also concerns that some of these benefits might not be achieved. Seven years after its implementation, the offshoring strategy was overall considered working, however the expected benefits were not fully achieved.

In large-scale corporations with many geographically distributed sites and high divisional detachment, such strategies are yet doomed to result in implementing irrelevant work methods and procedures that conflict with the local interests. As Tayloristic habits are disappearing, organizations willingly or unwillingly change their decision-making approaches to enable more participation and influence from the performers. These trends are associated with the rise of participation-based parallel structures, such as quality circles, task forces or communities of practice. In this paper, we present our findings from studying corporate-level communities by the means of a multicase study at Ericsson. We found that the main hindrances are related to the limited decision-making authority of parallel structure, member selection and achieving representation across the organizational units. Our results suggest that parallel structures highly depend on the authority of the members within their local communities, and their ability to not only channel the dialog between the units they represent and the community, but also enable the active engagement of the unit in the community studies. As such, we believe that special attention shall be put on the ambassador role of the community members.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1549"]}
{"title": "Learning and Performance Evolution of Immature Remote Teams in Large-ScaleSoftware Projects: An Industrial Case Study\n", "abstract": " Background: Recruitment and onboarding of software developers are essential steps in software development undertakings. The need for adding new people is often associated with large-scale long-living projects and globally distributed projects. The formers are challenging because they may contain large amounts of legacy (and often complex) code (legacy projects). The latters are challenging, because the inability to find sufficient resources in-house may lead to onboarding people at a distance, and often in many distinct sites. While onboarding is of great importance for companies, there is little research about the challenges and implications associated with onboarding software developers and teams in large-scale globally distributed projects with large amounts of legacy code. Furthermore, no study has proposed any systematic approaches to support the design of onboarding strategies and evaluation of onboarding results in the aforementioned context.Objective: The aim of this thesis is two-fold: i) identify the challenges and implications associated with onboarding software developers and teams in large-scale globally distributed legacy projects; and ii) propose solutions to support the design of onboarding strategies and evaluation of onboarding results in large-scale globally distributed legacy projects.Method: In this thesis, we employed literature review, case study, and business process modeling. The main case investigated in this thesis is the development of a legacy telecommunication software product in Ericsson.Results: The results show that the performance (productivity, autonomy, and lead time) of new developers/teams\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1549"]}
{"title": "Low degree of separation does not guarantee easy coordination\n", "abstract": " In the times of increased global competition, software companies are forced to search for more effective development practices and often team up with onshore and offshore partners to develop faster and better products. In this paper we empirically explore a highly distributed onshore development project with a complex coordination structure. Our findings demonstrate that onshore development projects are not protected from coordination and communication challenges and task allocation complexities. Previously reported qualitative findings regarding organizational problems in this paper are supplemented with quantitative measurements of the true coordination delays and additional analysis of coordination patterns and their evolution.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1549"]}

{"title": "Ethics and law on the electronic frontier\n", "abstract": " The new electronic relations have brought as much benefits as duties. The society uses more often computers in every day life than ever. Unfortunately, cyberspace bounds are huge and its regulation is very complicated. In many cases the users are responsible for his security. That is why Electronic Law knowledge is useful and important for the new society. The most powerful computer and net users are those who are educated in Computer Science. Various authorities in the field of Computer Science education are urging the necessity of topics on legal regulation of the electronic society. Several universities in Latvia starting from the 2002/2003 study year have implemented a new course on``IT Industry Standards, Legislation, Labour Protection and Ergonomics''. The topic is extended considering the students being programmers, computer users and hired workers.

{"title": "Fair comparison of developing software in different locations: dynamic decision model\n", "abstract": " While offshore software development is frequently looked at in simple economic terms, assumed benefits are not always achieved. This can be attributed to unexpectedly high transition costs and a number of extra costs for maintaining a sourcing strategy. When offshoring fails, companies need to revisit their decision. In this paper, an analytical model is proposed to support evaluation of offshoring strategies and decision options. The model focuses on value comparison, and treats outcomes of offshoring relationships more fairly and realistically than a na\u00efve salary comparison. The model is a development of models with extensions motivated by lessons learned from two empirical cases. The model is designed to consider more decision outcomes than previously suggested. In contrast to current practice focusing on economic profits from the salary differences between onshore and offshore, we focus on the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1549"]}

Agile methods are widely spread and often adapted to the context-specific needs. The adaptations constitute reductions and/or extensions of agile practices.

To systemize the knowledge of the impact of agile practices, we launch this workshop and invite researchers and practitioners to work on a documenting and accumulating their experiences in a knowledge base.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1549"]}

In this paper, we describe efforts that have been made in upgrading and enriching the relevant study programmes and services at the University of Latvia so as to respond to the needs of the IT industry.

{"title": "Towards an understanding of sourcing decisions\n", "abstract": " A variety of new forms of business are enabled through globalization and practiced by software organizations today. While companies go global to reduce their development costs, access a larger pool of resources and explore new markets, it is often assumed that the level of services shall remain the same after implementing the sourcing decisions. In contrast, critical studies identified that global software development is associated with unique challenges, and a lot of global projects fail to mitigate the implications of a particular environment. In this paper we explore offshore insourcing decisions in an empirical field study conducted at Ericsson. A set of questions for consideration emerged from empirical observations of a software transfer project and was used as a basis for building an insourcing decision model. We discuss the ingredients of insourcing decision process and emphasize that due to a wide variability in the choices, the steps towards a global initiative are not, and should not be the same for every company and project. Finally, the companies should carefully select their what, where, when, how and why strategies paying attention to alignment of each selected decision and their contribution to the achievement of the expected benefits.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1549"]}
