Performance differences for a large random sample of English-and French-speaking examinees were compared on a grade 6 mathematics and social studies provincial achievement test. Items displaying differential item functioning (DIF) were flagged using three popular statistical methods\u2014ManteTHaenszel, Simultaneous Item Bias Test, and logistic regression\u2014and the substantive meaning of these items was studied by comparing the back-translated form with the original English version. The items flagged by the three statistical procedures were relatively consistent, but not identical across the two tests. The correlation between the DIF effect size measures were also strong, but far from perfect, suggesting that two procedures should be used to screen items for translation DIF. To identify the DIF items with translation differences, the French items were back-translated into English and compared with the original English items by three reviewers. Two of seven and six of 26 DIF items in mathematics and social studies respectively were judged to be nonequivalent across language forms due to differences introduced in the translation process. There were no apparent translation differences for the remaining items, revealing the necessity for further research on the sources of translation differential item functioning.

It is divided into 3 sections: Part 1 introduces the topic of immigrant student achievement and the performance disadvantage that is consistently reported across a range of international jurisdictions. Part 2 then presents national profiles from scholars in ten countries (England, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Finland, Netherlands, Republic of Ireland, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand). These educational jurisdictions were selected because they represent a range of Western nations engaged in large-scale reform efforts geared towards enhancing their immigrant students\u2019 achievement. Each of the national profiles provides a brief overview of the evolution of the cultural composition of their respective school-aged student population; explains the trajectory of achievement results in non-immigrant and immigrant student groups in relation to both national and international large-scale assessment measures; and discusses the effectiveness of policy responses that have been adopted to close the achievement gap between non-immigrant and immigrant student populations. It also examines the relationships between education policies and immigrant student achievement and discusses how education policies have evolved across various cultural contexts. In conclusion, Part 3 analyzes cross-cultural approaches designed to address the performance disadvantage of immigrant students and proposes future areas of inquiry stemming from the national profiles.

{"title": "The health of Canada\u2019s young people\u2013A mental health focus: School\n", "abstract": " Youth spend a lot of their time at school. Thus it is not surprising that their school-related experiences have a significant influence on their cognitive development, and their physical and mental health. Schools provide a\" critical context for shaping children's self-esteem, self-efficacy and sense of control over their lives\"(Stewart, Sun, Patterson, Lemerle, & Hardie, 2004). As children move forward into their early and later teen years, schools become more important, and the support of teachers and peer connections within schools may have an even greater influence than their home context (Stewart, 2008; Stewart et al., 2004).Young people who feel connected with their school and have positive experiences with teachers and peers are more likely to develop strong emotional bonds and self-confidence. They are much less likely to engage in health-compromising activities or struggle with their mental health and emotional well\u2011being (eg, Wold, Samdal, Nutbeam, & Kannas, 1998). Young people need to make strong connections with their peers and these peers also influence each other's school experiences and subsequent behaviours. Young people who feel less connected to school are more likely to search and connect with like-minded peers, and these peer groups tend to engage in high-risk activities (Bond et al., 2007). Similarly, young people who do not feel accepted by their peers or connected with school are the most likely to have lower levels of confidence and sense of self (King, Vidourek, Davis, & McLellan, 2002).", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1056"]}

{"title": "The impact of positive school climate on student well-being and achievement\n", "abstract": " Student achievement is the top priority in education. While teaching, attendance, assessment, and evaluation are important aspects influencing students\u2019 academic achievement, these factors are all governed by the way students feel in their school environment. School cultures that are not hospitable to learning are detrimental to student achievement (Watson, 2001). School safety is necessary if learning and healthy development are to flourish (Devine & Cohen, 2007). Therefore, a closer look at the relationship of specific aspects of a school\u2019s culture, like climate, safety, and well-being, to student learning is needed (MacNeil, Prater, & Busch, 2009). The feelings and attitudes that are elicited by a school\u2019s environment are often referred to as school climate (Loukas, 2007). Closely related to school climate (and often, used interchangeably) is the notion of safety or safe learning environment. A safe and supportive school environment in which students flourish emotionally, socially, and academically is largely based on the quality of relationships between many individuals, including students, parents, school personnel, and the community (Demaray, Malecki, & Jenkins, 2012; Loukas, 2007). In addition to individual characteristics, personality, and biological predispositions, all children and adolescents\u2019 behaviors are crucially influenced by factors related to family relationships, school environment, people in the neighborhood, and the broader cultural context (Rigby, 2012). These factors both affect and help to explain the broad concept of school climate.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1056"]}

To emphasize health as a determinant of educational achievement, this article establishes a gradient in education by health among Canadian students. Using data from the 2006 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study, the relationship between self-rated health and achievement is examined for 8,626 students from 131 schools. The variation of the gradient in education by health within and between schools suggests that increases in self-rated health are associated with increased achievement for students. Moreover, the within-school regression accounted for 2.7% of the variation in achievement due to health, whereas the between-school regression slope accounted for 19.8% of the variation in achievement due to health. Inequalities in achievement associated with health were more pronounced between schools than within schools.

{"title": "The Enactment of Applied English: Does Caring Lead to Teaching to the Test?\n", "abstract": " Many school systems require students to pass one or more standardized examinations to graduate. This case study of three lower academic stream English classes in a single Ontario secondary school explored how the presence of a high-stakes standardized examination affected the enactment of the curriculum. Qualitative data were collected through a combination of teacher interviews, classroom observations, and teaching/learning artifacts. The findings of the inductive analysis suggest that the four teachers in the study cared deeply about the emotional well-being and scholastic success of their students; however, this caring sometimes manifested itself in less than ideal teaching practices, such as the use of external rewards, removal of student responsibility for learning, and teaching to the test. Seven strands are identified, each describing how caring is manifested within this teaching/learning context. Three vignettes describe actual classroom events which epitomise how caring was demonstrated by these teachers towards their students. While positioning teaching to the test as an act of caring is unusual, the evidence from this study suggests teachers do it because they believe it will benefit students\u2019 well-being and future outcomes. These findings suggest that for any high-stakes test, caring teachers may teach to the test and narrow the curriculum.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1056"]}

The use of the alternative procedures also provided an opportunity to examine if hypotheskd interactions and ciifferences occurred between procedures.Conelations, root mean square error analyses, and decision consistencies were examined based on the Biology, Chemistry, Geography, Geology, Math, and Physics examinations wntten in January or June of 1994195 and 1995/96. These examinations contained both dichotomously-scored multiple-choice items and polytomously-scored extended-response items. Along with the cumnt procedure, 17 alternative procedures were exarnined that incorporated the generalized partial credit mode1 (GPCM), differentiai weighting of the multiple-choice and the extended-response sections, andior arWliary information.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1056"]}
