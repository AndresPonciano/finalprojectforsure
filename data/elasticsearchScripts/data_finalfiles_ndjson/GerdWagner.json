{"title": "Design Rationale for RuleML: A Markup Language for Semantic Web Rules.\n", "abstract": " This paper lays out the design rationale of RuleML, a rule markup language for the Semantic Web. We give an overview of the RuleML Initiative as a Web ontology effort. Subsequently, the modular syntax and semantics of RuleML and the current RuleML 0.8 DTDs are presented (focusing on the Datalog and URI sublanguages). Then we discuss negation handling, priorities/evidences, as well as agents and RuleML. We next proceed to RuleML implementations via XSLT and rule engines. In our conclusions, we continue to explore the bigger picture of ontologies and discuss some requirements for a future RuleML. An appendix shows our Semantic Web scenario in the insurance industry.", "num_citations": "492\n", "authors": ["577"]}
{"title": "The Agent-Object-Relationship metamodel: towards a unified view of state and behavior\n", "abstract": " We present an agent-oriented approach to the conceptual modeling of organizations and organizational information systems, called Agent\u2013Object-Relationship (AOR) modeling, where an entity is either an agent, an event, an action, a claim, a commitment, or an ordinary object, and where special relationships between agents and events, actions, claims and commitments supplement the fundamental association, aggregation/composition and generalization relationship types of Entity-Relationship (ER) and Unified Modeling Language (UML) class modeling. Business processes are viewed as social interaction processes emerging from the behavior of the participating agents. In the proposed approach, behavior is primarily modeled by means of interaction patterns expressed in the form of reaction rules that are visualized in interaction pattern diagrams. It is an option, though, to use UML activity and statemachine\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "337\n", "authors": ["577"]}
{"title": "Ontologies, meta-models, and the model-driven paradigm\n", "abstract": " 9.6 Conclusions           Ontologies are no silver bullet. They can be employed in the software process as descriptive standardized domain models, domain-specific languages, and modelling (description) languages. However, they should not be mingled with specifications of software systems. In MDE, both forms of models are needed and complement each other. It is time to develop appropriate mega-models that clarify the role of ontologies in MDE. This chapter has presented one approach; however, this can be only an intermediate step, because we restricted ourselves to the standard IRDS metapyramid. Other, more sophisticated meta-pyramids exist and must be extended to be ontology-aware.", "num_citations": "208\n", "authors": ["577"]}
{"title": "Towards ontological foundations for conceptual modeling: The unified foundational ontology (UFO) story\n", "abstract": " This paper describes a long-term research program on developing ontological foundations for conceptual modeling. This program, organized around the theoretical background of the foundational ontology UFO (Unified Foundational Ontology), aims at developing theories, methodologies and engineering tools with the goal of advancing conceptual modeling as a theoretically sound discipline but also one that has concrete and measurable practical implications. The paper describes the historical context in which UFO was conceived, briefly discusses its stratified organization, and reports on a number of applications of this foundational ontology over more than a decade. In particular, it discusses the most successful application of UFO, namely, the development of the conceptual modeling language OntoUML. The paper also discusses a number of methodological and computational tools, which have been\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "181\n", "authors": ["577"]}
{"title": "Towards ontological foundations for the conceptual modeling of events\n", "abstract": " In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the application of foundational ontologies, i.e., formal ontological theories in the philosophical sense, to provide a theoretically sound foundation for improving the theory and practice of conceptual modeling. In this paper, we present advances on our research on the ontological foundations of conceptual modeling by addressing the concept of events. We present a foundational ontology of events (termed UFO-B) together with its axiomatization in first-order logic. Moreover, we report on an implementation of UFO-B using the computational logic language Alloy, and discuss its consistency, validation and possible uses.", "num_citations": "165\n", "authors": ["577"]}
{"title": "An ontologically well-founded profile for UML conceptual models\n", "abstract": " UML class diagrams can be used as a language for expressing a conceptual model of a domain. In a series of papers [1,2,3] we have been using the General Ontological Language (GOL) and its underlying upper level ontology, proposed in [4,5], to evaluate the ontological correctness of a conceptual UML class model and to develop guidelines for how the constructs of the UML should be used in conceptual modeling. In this paper, we focus on the UML metaconcepts of classes and objects from an ontological point of view. We use a philosophically and psychologically well-founded theory of classifiers to propose a UML profile for Ontology Representation and Conceptual Modeling. Moreover, we propose a design pattern based on this profile to target a recurrent problem in role modeling discussed in the literature. Finally, we demonstrate the relevance of the tools proposed by applying them to solve\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "163\n", "authors": ["577"]}
{"title": "Ontologies and the Semantic Web for E-learning (Guest editorial)\n", "abstract": " The Semantic Web is the emerging landscape of new web technologies aiming at web-based information and services that would be understandable and reusable by both humans and machines. Ontologies, generally defined as a representation of a shared conceptualization of a particular domain, is a major component of the Semantic Web. It is anticipated that Ontologies and Semantic Web technologies will influence the next generation of elearning systems and applications.To this end, key developments such as\u27a2 formal taxonomies expressed, eg, with the help of the web ontology languages RDFS and OWL, and\u27a2 rules expressed, eg, with the help of the web rule language RuleML, are expected to play a key role in enabling the representation and the dynamic construction of shared and reusable learning content.", "num_citations": "160\n", "authors": ["577"]}
{"title": "On the general ontological foundations of conceptual modeling\n", "abstract": " As pointed out in the pioneering work of [WSW99,EW01], an upper level ontology allows to evaluate the ontological correctness of a conceptual model and to develop guidelines how the constructs of a conceptual modeling language should be used. In this paper we adopt the General Ontological Language (GOL), proposed in [DHHS01], for this purpose. We discuss a number of issues that arise when applying the concepts of GOL to UML class diagrams as a conceptual modeling language. We also compare our ontological analysis of some parts of the UML with the one proposed in [EW01].", "num_citations": "159\n", "authors": ["577"]}
{"title": "A Unified Foundational Ontology and some Applications of it in Business Modeling.\n", "abstract": " Foundational ontologies provide the basic concepts upon which any domain-specific ontology is built. This paper presents a new foundational ontology, UFO, and shows how it can be used as a guideline in business modeling and for evaluating business modeling methods. UFO is derived from a synthesis of two other foundational ontologies, GFO/GOL and OntoClean/DOLCE. While their main areas of application are natural sciences and linguistics/cognitive engineering, respectively, the main purpose of UFO is to provide a foundation for conceptual modeling, including business modeling.", "num_citations": "140\n", "authors": ["577"]}
{"title": "Using the unified foundational ontology (UFO) as a foundation for general conceptual modeling languages\n", "abstract": " In recent years, there has been a growing interest in approaches that employ ontological models as theoretical tools for analyzing and improving conceptual modeling languages. In this paper we present a philosophically and cognitively well-founded formal ontology which has been developed with the special purpose of serving as a foundation for general conceptual modeling languages. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this foundational ontology named the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) has been used to evaluate and redesign the metamodel of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) for the purpose of conceptual modeling.", "num_citations": "139\n", "authors": ["577"]}
{"title": "A database needs two kinds of negation\n", "abstract": " Databases do not usually allow for the representation of explicit negative information. We show that the concept of strong negation, already known from partial logic and constructive logic, provides a computationally feasible means to represent and process explicit negative information. On the other hand it seems desirable to retain the usual form of negation in databases, viz negation-as-failure which we also call weak negation. We show how the interaction between strong and weak negation can be modelled within the framework of partial logic.", "num_citations": "115\n", "authors": ["577"]}
{"title": "Web rules need two kinds of negation\n", "abstract": " In natural language, and in some knowledge representation systems, such as extended logic programs, there are two kinds of negation: a weak negation expressing non-truth, and a strong negation expressing explicit falsity. In this paper I argue that, like in several basic computational languages, such as OCL and SQL, two kinds of negation are also needed for a Web rule language.", "num_citations": "107\n", "authors": ["577"]}
{"title": "Agent-oriented enterprise modeling based on business rules\n", "abstract": " Business rules are statements that express (certain parts of) a business policy, defining business terms and defining or constraining the operations of an enterprise, in a declarative manner. Since these rules define and constrain the interaction among business agents in the course of business processes, they have to refer to the components of their mental state, such as the knowledge/information and the commitments of an organization. We propose an agent-oriented approach to business rules and show how to represent and visualize business rules and business processes in Agent-Object-Relationship modeling.", "num_citations": "105\n", "authors": ["577"]}

{"title": "How to design a general rule markup language\n", "abstract": " A General Rule Markup Language has several purposes. It may serve as a lingua franca for different rule systems and rule components in application software to exchange rules between each other. It may be used to express derivation rules for enriching XML-based taxonomies (also called \"web ontologies\") by adding definitions of derived concepts. It may be used to publish the reactive behavior of a system in the form of reaction rules. And it may be used to provide a complete XML-based specification of a software agent. Further uses may arise in novel web applications. In this paper, I consider the problem of how to design a General Rule Markup Language that can be used for these, and for future emerging purposes.", "num_citations": "101\n", "authors": ["577"]}
{"title": "Conceptual modeling: definition, purpose and benefits\n", "abstract": " Over the last decade there has been a growing interest in `conceptual modeling' for simulation. This is signified by a greater intensity of research and volume of papers on the topic. What is becoming apparent, however, is that when it comes to conceptual modeling there are quite different views and opinions. These differences may be beneficial for creating a debate that takes the field forward, but they can also lead to confusion. The purpose of this panel is for leading researchers to identify and discuss their views on conceptual modeling. In particular we will debate the definition, purpose and benefits of conceptual modeling for the field of simulation. Through the discussion we hope to highlight common ground and key areas of difference.", "num_citations": "92\n", "authors": ["577"]}
{"title": "Logic programming with strong negation and inexact predicates\n", "abstract": " We show how a negation operation which allows for the possibility to represent explicit negative information can be added to Prolog without essentially altering its computational structure. This negation is called strong since it expresses a notion of directly established falsity as opposed to the rather weak notion of indirectly established falsity expressed by negation-as-failure. By means of strong negation the useful distinction between exact and inexact predicates can be expressed in logic programs providing for the capability of reasoning with empirical domains.", "num_citations": "91\n", "authors": ["577"]}
