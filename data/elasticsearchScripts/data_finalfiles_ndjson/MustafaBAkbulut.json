The thin-film measurements yield 1.26 \u00b10.15 m\u03a9\u00b7cm (thicknesses: 50, 100, and 200 nm); however, there is significant uncertainty regarding the integrity of the film in liquid state. The device-level measurements utilize the melting of the encapsulated structures by a single voltage pulse while monitoring the current through the wire. The melting is verified by the stabilization of the current during the pulse. The resistivity of liquid GST is extracted as 0.31 \u00b1 0.04 and 0.21 \u00b10.03 m\u03a9\u00b7cm from 20- and 50-nm-thick wire arrays.", "num_citations": "38\n", "authors": ["1541"]}

Extremely high current densities (>20 MA/cm2) and consequent high temperatures (1700 K) and temperature gradients (1 K/nm) along the microwires give rise to strong thermoelectric effects. The thermoelectric effects are characterized through capture and analysis of light emission from the self-heated wires biased with lower magnitude direct current/alternating current voltages. The hottest spot on the wires consistently appears closer to the lower potential end for n-type microwires and to the higher potential end for p-type microwires. The experimental light emission profiles are used to verify the mathematical models and material parameters used for the simulations.

The large temperature levels involved and small dimensions of PCM devices give rise to very large temperature gradients (\u0303 10 K/nm and higher) which result in strong thermoelectric effects. High-temperature characterization of the temperature-dependent thermoelectric properties of these materials is therefore critical to understand for the operation of these devices but to date there is only limited experimental data available.

{"title": "Analysis of self-heating of thermally assisted spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memory\n", "abstract": " Thermal assistance has been shown to significantly reduce the required operation power for spin torque transfer magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM). Proposed heating methods include modified material stack compositions that result in increased self-heating or external heat sources. In this work we analyze the self-heating process of a standard perpendicular magnetic anisotropy STT-MRAM device through numerical simulations in order to understand the relative contributions of Joule, thermoelectric Peltier and Thomson, and tunneling junction heating. A 2D rotationally symmetric numerical model is used to solve the coupled electro-thermal equations including thermoelectric effects and heat absorbed or released at the tunneling junction. We compare self-heating for different common passivation materials, positive and negative electrical current polarity, and different device thermal anchoring and boundaries resistance configurations. The variations considered are found to result in significant differences in maximum temperatures reached. Average increases of 3 K, 10 K, and 100 K for different passivation materials, positive and negative polarity, and different thermal anchoring configurations, respectively, are observed. The highest temperatures, up to 424 K, are obtained for silicon dioxide as the passivation material, positive polarity, and low thermal anchoring with thermal boundary resistance configurations. Interestingly it is also found that due to the tunneling heat, Peltier effect, device geometry, and numerous interfacial layers around the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), most of the heat is dissipated on the lower potential side of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1541"]}

The threshold voltage (V T ) of the narrow channel devices can be dynamically controlled by the side-gate (Fig 2) voltage (V side ) in a wide range [2, 3], mainly due to the increase in the channel energy barrier (Fig. 3) [4].

{"title": "Electrical Resistivity of Liquid Ge2Sb2Te5 in Patterned Nanostructures\n", "abstract": " Phase change memory devices are based on the electrical resistivity contrast between the amorphous and the crystalline phases of chalcogenide materials [1]. Since melting is required to amorphize the material, knowledge of the liquid state properties is critical for device design. Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) is the most studied phase change material. However, the two experimental values reported to date for electrical resistivity of liquid GST (one on a thin film [2], the other in bulk [3]) differ by an order of magnitude. We have extracted the electrical resistivity of liquid GST from single pulse measurements on a large number of encapsulated GST line structures with varying lengths, widths and thicknesses.

{"title": "Numerical modeling of electrothermal effects in silicon nanowires\n", "abstract": " Asymmetric melting was observed in electrically pulsed n-type (phosphorus) nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si) wires fabricated lithographically. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images taken from the pulsed wires showed that melting initiates from the ground terminal end of the wires instead of the center as initially expected. Asymmetry in the temperature profile is caused by heat exchanged between charge carriers and phonons when an electrical current is passed along a temperature gradient. This effect is known as Thomson effect, a thermoelectric heat transfer mechanism. One dimensional (1D) time dependent heat diffusion equation including Thomson heat term was solved to model the temperature profile on our structures. The modeling results show that Thomson effect introduces significant shifts in the temperature distribution.
