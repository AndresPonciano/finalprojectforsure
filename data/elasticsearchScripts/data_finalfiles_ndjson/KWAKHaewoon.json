Our key tenet is that data-driven personas are located between aggregated and individual customer statistics. At their best, digital data-driven personas capture the coverage of the customer base attributed to aggregated data representations while retaining the interpretability of individual-level analytics; they benefit from powerful computational techniques and novel data sources. We discuss how digital data-driven personas can draw from technological advancements to remedy the notable concerns voiced by scholars and practitioners, including persona validation, inconsistency problem, and long development times.

Here, we propose FrameAxis, a method for characterizing documents by identifying the most relevant semantic axes (\u201cmicroframes\u201d) that are overrepresented in the text using word embedding. Our unsupervised approach can be readily applied to large datasets because it does not require manual annotations. It can also provide nuanced insights by considering a rich set of semantic axes. FrameAxis is designed to quantitatively tease out two important dimensions of how microframes are used in the text. Microframe bias captures how biased the text is on a certain microframe, and microframe intensity shows how prominently a certain microframe is used. Together, they offer a detailed characterization of the text. We demonstrate that microframes with the highest bias and intensity align well with sentiment, topic, and partisan spectrum by applying FrameAxis to multiple datasets from restaurant reviews to political news. The existing domain knowledge can be incorporated into FrameAxis by using custom microframes and by using FrameAxis as an iterative exploratory analysis instrument. Additionally, we propose methods for explaining the results of FrameAxis at the level of individual words and documents.

The present level of proliferation of fake, biased, and propagandistic content online, has made it impossible to fact-check every single suspicious claim, either manually or automatically. Alternatively, we can profile entire news outlets and look for those that are likely to publish fake or biased content. This approach makes it possible to detect likely \"fake news\" the moment they are published, by simply checking the reliability of their source. From a practical perspective, political bias and factuality of reporting have a linguistic aspect but also a social context. Here, we study the impact of both, namely (i) what was written (i.e., what was published by the target medium, and how it describes itself on Twitter) vs. (ii) who read it (i.e., analyzing the readers of the target medium on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube).

{"title": "\" Trust me, I have a Ph. D.\": A Propensity Score Analysis on the Halo Effect of Disclosing One's Offline Social Status in Online Communities\n", "abstract": " Online communities adopt various reputation schemes to measure content quality. This study analyzes the effect of a new reputation scheme that exposes one's offline social status, such as an education degree, within an online community. We study two Reddit communities that adopted this scheme, whereby posts include tags identifying education status referred to as flairs, and we examine how the \u201ctransferred\u201d social status affects the interactions among the users. We computed propensity scores to test whether flairs give ad-hoc authority to the adopters while minimizing the effects of confounding variables such as topics of content. The results show that exposing academic degrees is likely to lead to higher audience votes as well as larger discussion size, compared to the users without the disclosed identities, in a community that covers peer-reviewed scientific articles. In another community with a focus on casual science topics, exposing mere academic degrees did not obtain such benefits. Still, the users with the highest degree (eg, Ph. D. or MD) were likely to receive more feedback from the audience. These findings suggest that reputation schemes that link the offline and online worlds could induce halo effects on feedback behaviors differently depending upon the community culture. We discuss the implications of this research for the design of future reputation mechanisms.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1188"]}

{"title": "Convergence of media attention across 129 countries\n", "abstract": " The objective of this study is to assess the longitudinal trends of media similarity and dissimilarity on the international scale. As news value has well-established political, cultural, and economic consequences, the degree to which media coverage and content is converging across countries has implications for international relations. To study this convergence, we use the daily data of the 100 topics that were over-reported in each country, compared to other countries, from March 7 to October 9, 2016. The results of this analysis indicate that two complementary patterns\u2013globalization and domestication\u2013explain the media attention across the countries. We conclude that this attention can be driven not only by geographical closeness but also by more complex dimensions, such as historical relationships. Also, although a group of countries often have common media attention, their similarity level depends on\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1188"]}
{"title": "Efforts towards automatically generating personas in real-time using actual user data\n", "abstract": " The use of personas is an interactive design technique with considerable potential for product and content development. A persona is a representation of a group or segment of users, sharing common behavioral characteristics. Although representing a segment of users, a persona is generally developed in the form of a detailed narrative about an explicit but fictitious individual that represents the collection of users possessing similar behaviors or characteristics. In order to make the fictitious individual appear as real person to the product developers, the persona narrative usually contains a variety of both demographic and behavioral details about socio economic status, gender, hobbies, family members, friends, possessions, among many other data. Also, the narrative of a persona normally also addresses the goals, needs, wants, frustrations and other emotional aspects of the fictitious individual that are pertinent to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1188"]}

Our social contexts consist of three dimensions: community membership, key persons, and interestingtweets within a personal timeline. A person is oftena member of several communities, such as a family, a class, or a team, simultaneously. We identify all communitiesthat a user participates in. Labeling a tweetwith a visual representation to indicate what communityit belongs to can help readers to understand why thetweet is written, since different communities are likelyto carry tweets in different contexts. We then discoverkey persons and interesting tweets within a personaltimeline.

Online games have attracted attention from researchers, because i) the purpose of actions is relatively clear, and ii) actions are quantifiable. A wide range of predefined actions for supporting social interaction (eg, friendship, communication, trade, enmity, aggression, and punishment) reflects either positive or negative connotations among game players, and is unobtrusively recorded by the game servers.

{"title": "How-to Present News on Social Media: A Causal Analysis of Editing News Headlines for Boosting User Engagement\n", "abstract": " To reach a broader audience and optimize traffic toward news articles, media outlets commonly run social media accounts and share their content with a short text summary. Despite its importance of writing a compelling message in sharing articles, the research community does not own a sufficient understanding of what kinds of editing strategies effectively promote audience engagement. In this study, we aim to fill the gap by analyzing media outlets\u2019 current practices using a data-driven approach. We first build a parallel corpus of original news articles and their corresponding tweets that eight media outlets shared. Then, we explore how those media edited tweets against original headlines and the effects of such changes. To estimate the effects of editing news headlines for social media sharing in audience engagement, we present a systematic analysis that incorporates a causal inference technique with deep learning; using propensity score matching, it allows for estimating potential (dis-) advantages of an editing style compared to counterfactual cases where a similar news article is shared with a different style. According to the analyses of various editing styles, we report common and differing effects of the styles across the outlets. To understand the effects of various editing styles, media outlets could apply our easy-to-use tool by themselves.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1188"]}
{"title": "Statistical Modeling of Harassment against Reddit Moderators\n", "abstract": " Despite the dedication that some volunteer moderators of online communities display when performing their moderation duties, they become targets of hate and harassment by other users. To understand what causes the change in moderator role from heroes to victims, we analyze the responses of 1,818 moderators on Reddit to an online survey about moderation practices and harassment. We built a statistical model and found 6 significant independent variables that affect harassment on moderators, such as the knowledge of community norms, which increases harassment on moderators the most. Our findings imply that vulnerable moderators in toxic communities need countermeasures against harassment.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1188"]}

We measured such differences in four different levels: (1) by actual news items, (2) by section, (3) by topic, and (4) by subtopic. We characterized the news items at the four levels by using the computational techniques, which are topic modeling and the vector representation of words and news items. We found that differences in news reading behavior across different demographic groups are the most noticeable in subtopic level but neither section nor topic levels.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1188"]}

{"title": "Predicting Anti-Asian Hateful Users on Twitter during COVID-19\n", "abstract": " We investigate predictors of anti-Asian hate among Twitter users throughout COVID-19. With the rise of xenophobia and polarization that has accompanied widespread social media usage in many nations, online hate has become a major social issue, attracting many researchers. Here, we apply natural language processing techniques to characterize social media users who began to post anti-Asian hate messages during COVID-19. We compare two user groups -- those who posted anti-Asian slurs and those who did not -- with respect to a rich set of features measured with data prior to COVID-19 and show that it is possible to predict who later publicly posted anti-Asian slurs. Our analysis of predictive features underlines the potential impact of news media and information sources that report on online hate and calls for further investigation into the role of polarized communication networks and news media.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1188"]}
{"title": "A Survey on Predicting the Factuality and the Bias of News Media\n", "abstract": " The present level of proliferation of fake, biased, and propagandistic content online has made it impossible to fact-check every single suspicious claim or article, either manually or automatically. Thus, many researchers are shifting their attention to higher granularity, aiming to profile entire news outlets, which makes it possible to detect likely \"fake news\" the moment it is published, by simply checking the reliability of its source. Source factuality is also an important element of systems for automatic fact-checking and \"fake news\" detection, as they need to assess the reliability of the evidence they retrieve online. Political bias detection, which in the Western political landscape is about predicting left-center-right bias, is an equally important topic, which has experienced a similar shift towards profiling entire news outlets. Moreover, there is a clear connection between the two, as highly biased media are less likely to be factual; yet, the two problems have been addressed separately. In this survey, we review the state of the art on media profiling for factuality and bias, arguing for the need to model them jointly. We further discuss interesting recent advances in using different information sources and modalities, which go beyond the text of the articles the target news outlet has published. Finally, we discuss current challenges and outline future research directions.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1188"]}

We analyzed 270 million records of player behavior in the 4th closed beta test of ArcheAge. Our findings show that there are no apparent pandemic behavior changes, but some outliers were more likely to exhibit anti-social behavior (eg, player killing).

{"title": "Exploring the Solution Space of Community Detection Methods\n", "abstract": " Discrete categorization of entities has been a fundamental means to understanding complex data. In network science, such endeavor has been largely realized by community detection method which extracts topologically cohesive subsets of a network by looking at its patterns of clustering. However existing community detection methods produce highly heterogeneous and inconsistent partitions for a single network [1, 2]. Although this problem has been repeatedly addressed in many studies and a huge number of studies in various disciplines have used different types of community detection methods, no study has yet provided systemic investigation of relationships between the solutions and their properties. Here, we provide meta-analysis of a solution space constructed using community partition vectors obtained from various community detection methods. Investigated methods include both modularity-based methods and modularity-free methods, and both deterministic and stochastic methods. Exhaustive computation with social, natural and artificial networks demonstrates that although solutions obtained from several finest community detection methods produce very similar modularity values, the resulting solutions are highly heterogeneous for most of the networks analyzed. The patterns of clustering in the solution space indicate fundamental bifurcation of the analyzed detection methods into different meta-classes depending on their optimization schemes.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1188"]}
