{"title": "An evidential model of distributed reputation management\n", "abstract": " For agents to function effectively in large and open networks, they must ensure that their correspondents, ie, the agents they interact with, are trustworthy. Since no central authorities may exist, the only way agents can find trustworthy correspondents is by collaborating with others to identify those whose past behavior has been untrustworthy. In other words, finding trustworthy correspondents reduces to the problem of distributed reputation management. Our approach adapts the mathematical theory of evidence to represent and propagate the ratings that agents give to their correspondents. When evaluating the trustworthiness of a correspondent, an agent combines its local evidence (based on direct prior interactions with the correspondent) with the testimonies of other agents regarding the same correspondent. We experimentally studied this approach to establish that some important properties of trust are captured\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "944\n", "authors": ["36"]}

Agents are desirable for the very reason that they provide higherlevel abstractions for complex systems.

The agents need to ensure that the service providers they select are trustworthy. Because the agents are autonomous and there is no central trusted authority, the agents help each other determine the trustworthiness of the service providers they are interested in. This help is rendered via a series of referrals to other agents, culminating in zero or more trustworthy service providers being identified. A trust network is a multiagent system where each agent potentially rates the trustworthiness of another agent. This paper develops a formal treatment of trust networks. At the base is a recently proposed representation of trust via a probability certainty distribution. The main contribution of this paper is the definition of two operators, concatenation and aggregation, using which trust ratings can be combined in a trust network. This paper motivates and establishes some important properties regarding these operators, thereby ensuring that trust can be combined correctly.

{"title": "Agent-based trust model involving multiple qualities\n", "abstract": " A key limitation of current Web services standards is the inability to differentiate service instances at runtime using (nonfunctional) qualities of services (QoS). Such differentiation is necessary to allow for runtime selection and binding to service instances in a manner that continually adapts selected services to the service consumer's preferences and needs. Quality values are volatile, depend on the trust associated with instances and service providers, and also depend on the needs of service consumers. We propose a multiagent framework where agents consider the consumers' QoS preferences, determine trust levels to associate to service instances and providers, and automatically select service instances on a consumer's behalf. The service agents use a trust model that is centered on a shared conceptualization for QoS (ontology) and a QoS preference model that considers consumer's tradeoffs among qualities\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "118\n", "authors": ["36"]}

Although commitments have been used in many works, an adequate formal semantics and axiomatization for them does not yet exist. This paper presents a logic of commitments that illustrates the commonalities and differences of the two kinds of commitments.

When agents interact in such settings, each relies upon being able to model the trustworthiness of the agents with whom it interacts. Fundamentally, such models must consider the past behavior of the other parties in order to predict their future behavior. Further, it is sensible for the agents to share information via referrals to trustworthy agents. Much progress has recently been made on probabilistic trust models including those that support the aggregation of information from multiple sources. However, current models do not support trust updates, leaving updates to be handled in an ad hoc manner.This paper proposes a trust representation that combines probabilities and certainty (defined as a function of a probability-certainty density function). Further, it offers a trust update mechanism to estimate the trustworthiness of referrers. This paper describes a testbed that goes beyond existing testbeds to enable the evaluation of a composite probability-certainty model. It then evaluates the proposed trust model showing that the trust model can (a) estimate trustworthiness of damping and capricious agents correctly,(b) update trust values of referrers accurately, and (c) resolve the conflicts in referral networks by certainty discounting.", "num_citations": "95\n", "authors": ["36"]}

This is the kind of commitment that Bratman 1, ch. 2] and Harman 7, p. 94] invoke when they say that an agent is\\committed\" to his intentions.

Although these devices carry a lot of compute power and enable several interesting applications, they lack conventional interfaces such as keyboards, mice, and touchscreens. As a result, such devices can't authenticate and authorize users in familiar ways. Furthermore, unlike for conventional settings, a one-time authentication at the start of a session usually isn't appropriate for the IoT, because the application scenarios are dynamic and a user might not retain physical control or even awareness of IoT devices quite as readily as with traditional computers. Thus, users need to be continuously authenticated and authorized. Fortunately, the IoT offers interesting potential solutions for meeting these requirements.

Trust applies to a variety of attributes of the relationship between truster and trustee. For example, an agent may trust someone to possess an important capability, exercise good judgment, or to intend to help it. Although such varieties of trust are hugely different, they respect common logical patterns. We present a logic of trust that expresses such patterns as reasoning postulates concerning the static representation of trust, its dynamics, and its relationships with teamwork and other agent interactions. In this manner, the proposed logic illustrates the general properties of trust that reflect natural intuitions, and can facilitate the engineering of multiagent systems.", "num_citations": "55\n", "authors": ["36"]}

The deep Web, by contrast, is information that is reachable over the Web, but that resides in databases; it is dynamically available in response to queries, not placed on static pages ahead of time. Recent estimates indicate that the deep Web has hundreds of times more data than the surface Web. The deep Web gives us reason to rethink much of the current doctrine of broad-based link analysis. Instead of looking up pages and finding links on them, Web crawlers would have to produce queries to generate relevant pages.

In this chapter, we present and discuss two declarative, social semantic approaches for modelling interaction.

Engineering a multiagent system means rigorously specifying the communications among the agents by way of interaction protocols.

These properties of agents have profound implications on the nature of protocol specifications. As we shall see, protocols for multiagent systems turn out to be fundamentally different from those for other kinds of distributed systems such as computer networks and distributed databases. We conceptualize all distributed systems in architectural terms-as consisting of components and connectors between the components. The components of the Internet are all nodes with IP addresses. The main connector is the Internet protocol, which routes packets between the nodes. The components of the web are the clients (such as browsers) and servers and the connector is the HTTP protocol. The components in a distributed database are the client databases and the coordinator and a connector is the two-phase commit protocol. We can discern a pattern here: the connectors are nothing but the interaction protocols among the components. Further, we can associate protocols with the application it facilitates.

The services could involve serving static pages, processing queries, or carrying out transactions. We model service providers and consumers as autonomous agents.

An agent may provide a service to another agent or give a referral that leads it in the right direction. Importantly, the agents can judge the quality of a service obtained and adaptively select their neighbors in order to improve their local performance. Our approach enables us to address two important challenges. One, in contrast with traditional systems, finding trustworthy parties is nontrivial in open systems.

Although C&S\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s approach demonstrates the key strengths of relying on commitment semantics, it suffers from key shortcomings, which limit its applicability in practice. One, C&S do not model commitments properly, causing unacceptable interference between commitments in different transactions. Two, they require that the communication infrastructure guarantee first-in first-out (FIFO) delivery of messages for every agent-agent channel.

Custard addresses this challenge by providing a relational syntax for schemas of important norm types along with their canonical lifecycles and providing a mapping from each schema to queries that compute instances of the schema in different lifecycle stages. In essence, Custard supports a norm-based abstraction layer over underlying information stores such as databases and event logs. Specifically, it supports deadlines; complex events, including those based on aggregation; and norms that reference other norms. We prove important correctness properties for Custard, including stability (once an event has occurred, it has occurred forever) and safety (a query returns a finite set of tuples).

The informal person-to-person social networks are used as\\referral chain\" requests for expertise, and software agents help automate the search of information and expertise. However, current systems rely exclusively on collections of email messages or newsgroup postings. As a result, previous approaches yield poor referrals for requests outside of the domain of the given collection. By contrast, we develop an approach that (1) combines techniques from information retrieval, multiagent learning and adaptive user modeling to re ne the social network according to the user's needs, and (2) allows agents to unintrusively exchange explicit pro le information to add coverage regarding a user's expertise.

Classical AI notions such as knowledge and intentions can serve as natural primitives for the specification of agents. However, in order for them to live up to their promise, these notions must be given rigorous definitions. We propose formal definitions for intentions, knowledge, and know-how in a general model of actions and time. Our definitions are conceptually simple and are designed to be modular, in the sense of being orthogonal to one another. Using these definitions, we are able to prove a success result for agents that is akin to the notion of liveness in traditional computing.

Trust is thus crucial in any decentralised system. This paper builds on recent efforts to use argumentation to reason about trust. Specifically, a set of schemes is provided, and abstract patterns of reasoning that apply in multiple situations geared towards trust. Schemes are described in which one agent, A, can establish arguments for trusting another agent, B, directly, as well as schemes that A can use to construct arguments for trusting C, where C is trusted by B. For both sets of schemes, a set of critical questions is offered that identify the situations in which these schemes can fail.", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["36"]}

This paper studies the problem of agents enacting commitment protocols, which inherently requires that their policies cohere with the given protocols.

This paper adopts the well-known idea of monotonic concession, but specializes and enhances it with the particular features of commitments. Specifically, this paper formulates inference rules for commitment concession that respect the nature of commitments. Next, it shows how commitments can be systematically revised as the agents incrementally engage each other in enacting their protocol.

{"title": "Incorporating commitment protocols into Tropos\n", "abstract": " This paper synthesizes two trends in the engineering of agent-based systems. One, modern agent-oriented methodologies deal with the key aspects of software development including requirements acquisition, architecture, and design, but can benefit from a stronger treatment of flexible interactions. Two, commitment protocols declaratively capture interactions among business partners, thus facilitating flexible behavior and a sophisticated notion of compliance. However, they lack support for engineering concerns such as inducing the desired roles and selecting the right protocols. This paper combines these two directions. For concreteness, we choose the Tropos methodology, which is strong in its requirements analysis, but our results can be ported to other agent-oriented methodologies.

Interestingly, precision and inertia turn out to control the coordination process.

Protocols expose two important challenges:(1) how to compose them in a way that respects commitments and (2) how to verify the compliance of the parties with the social states. Individually, these challenges are inadequately studied and together not at all. We motivate the notion of a social context to capture how a protocol may be enacted. A protocol can be verifiably enacted when its participants can determine each other's compliance. We first show the negative result that even when protocols can be verifiably enacted in respective social contexts, their composition cannot be verifiably enacted in the composition of those social contexts. We next show how to expand such a protocol so that it can be verifiably enacted. Our approach involves design rules to specify composite protocols so they would be verifiably enactable.

We propose Silk, a mechanism wherein a generator monitors interactions among member agents and recommends norms to help resolve conflicts. Each member decides on whether to accept or reject a recommended norm. Upon exiting the system, a member passes its experience along to incoming members of the same type. Thus, members develop norms in a hybrid manner to resolve conflicts. We evaluate Silk via simulation in the traffic domain.

{"title": "Mining Contracts for Business Events and Temporal Constraints in Service Engagements\n", "abstract": " Contracts are legally binding descriptions of business service engagements. In particular, we consider business events as elements of a service engagement. Business events such as purchase, delivery, bill payment, and bank interest accrual not only correspond to essential processes but are also inherently temporally constrained. Identifying and understanding the events and their temporal relationships can help a business partner determine what to deliver and what to expect from others as it participates in the service engagement specified by a contract. However, contracts are expressed in unstructured text and their insights are buried therein. Our contributions are threefold. We develop a novel approach employing a hybrid of surface patterns, parsing, and classification to extract 1) business events and 2) their temporal constraints from contract text.

Several approaches have been proposed over the years. However, most approaches concentrate on the causes and effects of actions, but do not give general characterizations of actions themselves. A useful formalization of actions would be based on a general, possibly nondiscrete, model of time that allows branching (to capture agents\u0393\u00c7\u00d6 choices). A desirable formalization would also allow actions to be of arbitrary duration and would permit multiple agents to act concurrently. We develop a branching\u0393\u00c7\u00c9time framework that allows great flexibility in how time and action are modeled. We motivate and formalize several coherence constraints on our models, which capture some nice intuitions and validate some useful inferences relating actions with time.", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["36"]}

A persuasive view of intelligent agents uses cognitive primitives such as intentions and beliefs to describe, explain, and specify their behavior. These primitives are often associated with a notion of commitment that is internal to the given agent. However, at first sight, there is a tension between commitments and rationality. We show how the two concepts can be reconciled for the important and interesting case of limited, intelligent agents. We show how our approach extends to handle more subtle issues such as precommitments, which have previously been assumed to be conceptually too complex.

Current approaches couple agent and protocol designs, requiring coordinated changes. In contrast, we propose an approach that decouples agent and protocol designs, while maintaining interoperability. We build on the well-known architectural construct of an interceptor. We introduce interaction refactorings to transform interactions in response to evolving requirements, with each refactoring incrementally changing agents, interceptors, and the protocol.

Current approaches tend to use linear TL, and can handle sets of sequences of states. However, they assume deterministic actions with all changes effected solely by one agent. By contrast, we use a branching model of time that can express concurrent actions by multiple agents and the environment, leading to nondeterministic effects of an agent's actions.

The societal framework is largely omitted. To develop new foundations for ethics in AI, we adopt a sociotechnical stance in which agents (as technical entities) help autonomous social entities or principals (people and organizations). This multiagent conception of a sociotechnical system (STS) captures how ethical concerns arise in the mutual interactions of multiple stakeholders. These foundations would enable us to realize ethical STSs that incorporate social and technical controls to respect stated ethical postures of the agents in the STSs.

In P2P systems, a very large number of autonomous computing nodes, the peers, rely on each other for services. P2P networks are emerging as a new distributed computing paradigm because of their potential to harness the computing power and the storage capacity of the hosts composing the network, and because they realize a completely open decentralized environment where everybody can join in autonomously. Although researchers working on distributed computing, multiagent systems, databases, and networks have been using similar concepts for a long time, it is only recently that papers motivated by the current P2P paradigm have started appearing in high quality conferences and workshops. In particular, research on agent systems appears to be most relevant because multiagent systems have always been thought of as networks of autonomous peers since their inception. Agents, which can be superimposed on the P2P architecture, embody the description of task environments, decision-support capabilities, social behaviors, trust and reputation, and interaction protocols among peers.

However, despite the intuitive naturalness of the above connections, they have not been adequately studied in a formal framework. This article provides a combined operational semantics for goals and commitments by relating their respective life cycles as a basis for how these concepts (1) cohere for an individual agent and (2) engender cooperation among agents.

These communities are personalized, in that their formation depends on choices made by each member to serve the personalized needs of its user.This paper compares communities of the above kind (personalized, topic-sensitive) with communities as studied in traditional link analysis. We study the correlation between the two kinds of communities as they emerge in referral networks.

I motivate and present a formal theory of the intentions of a multiagent system that analyzes them in terms of its internal organization, and the intentions of its member agents. This theory treats social structure directly in terms of the interactions among agents and does not attempt to reduce it to psychological concepts. It makes few assumptions about the architecture of agents and about the manner in which they interact. Thus it is intuitively plausible, can be described in a simple formal model, and is applicable to a large variety of multiagent systems. This theory is applied to an extended example, and some interesting variations are outlined.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["36"]}

{"title": "Information sharing among autonomous agents in referral networks\n", "abstract": " Referral networks are a kind of P2P system consisting of autonomous agents who seek and provide services, or refer other service providers. Key applications include service discovery and selection, and knowledge sharing. An agent seeking a service contacts other agents to discover suitable service providers. An agent who is contacted may autonomously ignore the request or respond by providing the desired service or giving a referral. This use of referrals is inspired by human interactions, where referrals are a key basis for judging the trustworthiness of a given service. The use of referrals differentiates such networks from traditional P2P information sharing systems, which are based on request flooding. Not only does the use of referrals enable an agent to control how its request is processed, it also provides an architectural basis for four kinds of interaction policies.

However, business service settings require richer policies and call for proactive behaviors. A business not only must respond to explicit requests, but also monitor its environment, collate events, and potentially act in anticipation of events in order to ensure that its policies are satisfied.

When artificial systems are considered to be intelligent or autonomous, it is almost obligatory to attribute intentions and beliefs to them. The currently dominant view of intentions sees them as involving commitments on the part of the agents who have them. But the notion of commitment seems to clash with the notion of rationality. It is argued that this need not be so. Commitments are only appropriate for agents with a limited capacity to reason. A treatment of commitment has been previously proposed that reconciles them with rationality. Here further motivations for the commitments of limited agents are discussed.

In Splee, a role binding is information that is dynamically generated during protocol enactment, potentially as the content (payload) of communication between two agents. Multicast communication is the idea that a message is sent to a set of agents. The two categories of extensions are interconnected via novel features such as set roles (the idea that a role binding can be a set of agents) and subroles (the idea that agents playing a role must be a subset of agents playing another role). We give the formal semantics of Splee and give small model characterizations of the safety and liveness of Splee protocols. We also introduce the pragmatic idea of query attachments for messages.

In existing selection approaches, a service requester focuses on finding providers based on their QoS and thereby ignores their service prices that could change with their QoS. High QoS may provide more benefits, but may require a high service price. As a result, the highest QoS may not produce the maximum utility. A service requester and candidate service providers have a conflicting interest over service prices. Since a provider would not reveal its minimum acceptabl price, it is important for a requester to predict the minimum price for a service that meets its QoS requirements.

A consequent weakness of such protocols is that commitment protocols thus fail to distinguish between possible executions that are normal and those that may be allowed but are not ideal. This paper develops an approach for specifying preferences among executions that are allowed by a protocol. It captures sets of executions via a simple language and gives them a denotational characterization based on branching-time models. It shows how to incorporate the specifications into rulesets, thereby giving the specifications a natural operational characterization.

Commitments and their causal relationships can be inferred from Dooley graphs to flexibly model business processes.We present a theoretical foundation for Dooley graphs, commitments, and causality in terms of the \u2567\u00c7-calculus, a process algebra for specifying concurrent systems, which has found application in business process modeling. This paper expresses the key elements of Dooley graphs (roles, characters, conversations) and of our approach (commitments and causal diagrams) using the \u2567\u00c7-calculus. Further, we accommodate a new variety of primitives for exception handling termed reentrant connectors. The \u2567\u00c7-calculus enables us to derive useful properties from a given model and to validate its correctness. We show how these properties assist in building an entire business process model in which agents interact flexibly.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["36"]}

Interorganizational Business Interactions: Contracts, Processes, Evolution.(Under the direction of Professor Munindar P.

In open environments, autonomous organizations having heterogeneous information systems interact in an ever-evolving manner. The nature of the contractual relationships among such organizations has a significant bearing on the modeling of the business processes in which they participate. Conventional approaches are not suitable for open environments because (1) they lack support for modeling and management of contracts among organizations,(2) the modeling abstractions they offer do not afford crucial software engineering desiderata such as reuse, refinement, aggregation, and verification, and (3) they fail to provide the designers with guidelines on adapting the models should the underlying requirements change. We propose a novel approach for engineering interorganizational business interactions. Contractual relationships are modeled via commitments and the interactions for enacting the contracts are captured via the modular abstraction of protocols. Relative to how organizations value the various terms of the contracts and how the contracts are played out via protocols, safety and benefit of the contracts are reasoned about. A protocol specifies rules that govern the interactions among the organizations. Protocols can be published to a repository, shared, reused, refined, and aggregated.

Semantic exceptions are especially prominent in the large, ie, when we construct and execute a workflow. A workflow is a composite computation with several interoperating components and interacting processes. Detecting and resolving semantic exceptions is critical to the functioning of a workflow, especially when its member activities are autonomous, heterogeneous, long-lived, and interact in subtle ways. Unfortunately, present workflow techniques offer little support for exceptions. For modeling, they provide few abstractions beyond activity charts. For enactment, they are not flexible enough to allow a component to detect and resolve semantic exceptions properly. We describe a multiagent approach for handling semantic exceptions. Our approach is based on high-level abstractions such as commitments, a process metamodel that accommodates commitments and allied concepts, a behavior model to specify agents, and an execution architecture that handles persistent and dynamic (re) execution. We can handle a variety of semantic exceptions by formulating a number of commitment patterns that cover the important situations. The behavior model and the commitment patterns are expressed as statecharts and executed in a rule-based system.

These approaches result in rigid models that over-constrain business execution.

The high-level model captures the business relationships in terms of commitments between the participants. Telang and Singh [5] develop a method for verifying if a low-level interaction model satisfies a high-level business model. They propose a top-down methodology in which a Business analyst first develops a high-level business model. An IT analyst then develops UML 2.0 sequence diagrams, and verifies if they satisfy the high-level model.

{"title": "Community standards for agent communication\n", "abstract": " It is obvious that communication is inherently a matter of convention. Each application scenario or domain identifies a community of practice of interacting parties who must define the structure and meaning of their mutual communications so as to interoperate successfully. Specifying the structure formally is conceptually trivial. But a consequence of the autonomy and heterogeneity of the communicating parties is that, to support interoperation, we must precisely specify the meanings of communications as a basis for judging their compliance. There are three main families of approaches for addressing meaning. An informal approach supports flexibility through ad hoc meanings but offers no support for compliance. Further, it risks proliferating dialects thereby exacerbating the problems of developing and maintaining interoperating systems. A mentalist approach presupposes a specific cognitive implementation architecture to specify meanings in terms of cognitive concepts. In effect, it supports each party interpreting communications idiosyncratically according to its mental state, thus precluding judging compliance based solely on observed interactions. A social approach specifies meanings in terms of social state (formalized via commitments or conventions), which yield criteria for judging compliance despite being abstract. Successful interoperation in an open system presupposes not only that we be able to judge compliance, but also that the communications among its members be standardized. Importantly, not only is the essence of communication social, the essence of a standard is social as well.

Previous computational approaches have treated the outcomes in a domain-specific way. Specifically, these approaches focus on the mathematical aspect and assume that a positive or negative experience can be identified without showing how to ground the experiences in real-world interactions, such as emails and chats. We propose G\u251c\u255dven, an approach that relates trust to the domain-independent notion of commitments. We consider commitments since commitment outcomes can be associated with experiences and a large body of works exist on commitments that include commitment representation and semantics. Also, recent research shows that commitments can be extracted from interactions, such as emails and chats. Thus, we posit G\u251c\u255dven can provide an useful basis to infer trust between agents from their interactions.

Norms provide the standard of correctness of the interactions between agents and provide a basis for accountability for their actions. We focus on commitments to capture relationships between agents. Based on commitments, we provide a framework using which we can calculate trust probabilistically between agents. We evaluate our approach in two parts.

To this end, we adopted a qualitative research methodology based on semi-structured interviews. This is an established social science methodology that helps understand the core concerns of stakeholders in depth by avoiding the biases of superficial methods such as surveys. We find that whereas drivers agree with the experts that AVs will significantly impact transportation systems, they are apprehensive about the prospects for their livelihoods and dismiss the suggestions that driving jobs are unsatisfying and their profession does not merit protection. By showing how drivers differ from the experts, our study has ramifications beyond AVs to AI and other advanced technologies.

However, most game-theoretic defensive deception approaches have assumed that players maintain consistent views under uncertainty. They do not consider players' possible, subjective beliefs formed due to asymmetric information given to them. In this work, we formulate a hypergame between an attacker and a defender where they can interpret the same game differently and accordingly choose their best strategy based on their respective beliefs. This gives a chance for defensive deception strategies to manipulate an attacker's belief, which is the key to the attacker's decision making. We consider advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks, which perform multiple attacks in the stages of the cyber kill chain where both the attacker and the defender aim to select optimal strategies based on their beliefs. Through extensive simulation experiments, we demonstrated how effectively the defender can leverage defensive deception techniques while dealing with multi-staged APT attacks in a hypergame in which the imperfect information is reflected based on perceived uncertainty, cost, and expected utilities of both attacker and defender, the system lifetime (i.e., mean time to security failure), and improved false positive rates in detecting attackers.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["36"]}

In this paper, we propose Snaz, a technique that uses deceptively crafted honey traffic to confound the knowledge gained through passive network reconnaissance. We present a two-player non-zero-sum Stackelberg game model that characterizes how a defender should deploy honey traffic in the presence of an adversary who is aware of Snaz. In doing so, we demonstrate the existence of optimal defender strategies that will either dissuade an adversary from acting on the existence of real vulnerabilities observed within network traffic, or reveal the adversary's presence when it attempts to unknowingly attack an intrusion detection node.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["36"]}

We consider trust as it arises in and influences people-driven service engagements. Existing approaches for estimating trust between people suffer from two important limitations. One, they consider only commitment as the primary means of estimating trust and omit additional significant factors, especially risk and emotions. Two, they typically estimate trust based either on fixed parameter models that require manual setting of parameters or based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM), which assume conditional independence and are thus ill-suited to capturing complex relationships between trust, risk, commitments, and emotions. We propose TRACE, a model based on Conditional Random Fields (CRF) that predicts trust from risk, commitments, and emotions. TRACE does not require manual parameter tuning and relaxes conditional independence assumptions among input variables.

{"title": "Social Contexts and Social Pragmatics\n", "abstract": " We consider the social relationships between autonomous principals, assuming that each principal is represented in a computational multiagent system via a unique agent. Work on commitment protocols [1, 7] has shown that the meaning of interactions may be expressed in terms of (social) commitments [3]: Cp (x, y, p, q) represents an expectation of y (creditor) that x (the debtor) will bring about q (consequent) if p (the antecedent) holds. Further, we consider a decentralized setting where only the local states of the participating principals are available. Each local state reflects what the corresponding principal has observed, and carries the intuition of being a local projection of a notional global state. This raises the question of alignment: given that each agent is confined to its local view, but the commitments are interagent artifacts, how can we ensure that the agents remain in a coherent social state? For instance, when delivery relies on a courier, it will not be directly observable by the shopkeeper. The commitment to the delivery of the goods to the client, taken by the shopkeeper, is satisfied when the courier completes delivery. The client will see such a commitment as satisfied.

In this technical report we propose a theoretical framework that unifies these constructs with regard to maintenance and facilitates effective cooperation between agents. Our contribution is threefold.(1) We formulate maintenance commitments as a construct in their own right, distinct from achievement commitments to complex temporal formulas.(2) We show how achievement and maintenance commitments and goals can be composed, and give pragmatic patterns of reasoning.(3) We develop an operational semantics that describes the interplay between maintenance commitments and goals.

Agents can be thought of as the elementary units of open computational environments or multiagent systems. In particular, agents can adapt their behavior and interactions, thus potentially realizing rich emergent social phenomena.Increasingly, researchers recognize trustworthiness as a relation between a trusted party and a trusting party that arises in a context of interaction. Trustworthiness thus inherently reflects the purpose for which one party may trust another. This contrasts not only with security, which deals with encryption and digital signatures, but also with the more common notion of trust in distributed computing, which emphasizes authentication. Ultimately, no matter what security techniques are used or authentications obtained, one party must decide whether to place its\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["36"]}

Leading applications of interest include pedagogical tools [1], military training simulations [2], and educational games [3].Our work, like the research of the previously mentioned applications, is based on the concepts of appraisal theory. A fundamental concept of appraisal theory is that the environment of the agent is essential to determining the agent\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s affective state. As such, appraisal theory yields models of affect that are tied to a particular domain with a defined context. Therefore, each new problem domain requires a new instance of the model. A current and common practice has been to copy and edit a previous application (and, occasionally, to build from scratch) to meet the specifications of a new domain. This approach may be reasonable for research proofs-ofconcept, but is not suitable for developing production applications. Additionally, many affective applications use physical sensors that provide additional information about the user and the user\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s environment. The number and variety of sensors continues to increase and they are now available via a variety of public services (eg, a weather service) and personal commercial devices (eg, GPS in mobile phones).

This is not only tedious, but also nontrivial as the application must be adjusted whenever the set of sensors changes. It is for these purposes that we introduce Koko.

{"title": "Methodology for fire hazard indexing and ranking of materials with particular reference to needs of architects and construction engineers\n", "abstract": " Fire safety considerations for a building dictate use of those materials/products that have low fire hazard. In addition to functional suitability, fire hazard potential of a material/product too needs to be considered by architects and construction engineers. In this context, assessment of fire behaviour of building material/products is becoming increasingly important. To assess fire behaviour (or fire hazard potential), various fire tests are conducted. On the basis of fire test results/data, materials/products of lower fire hazard are identified. However, test results of different fire tests are expressed differently. This implies that there is \u0393\u00c7\u00fflack of uniformity\u0393\u00c7\u00d6 in expression of test results/data.

A young (0-12h old) female mated with 0-12h old male, Binodoxys indicus produces 131.6\u252c\u25928.08 progeny within 4 days of life. However, older female mated with older male (both 96-108 h old) yields only 89.0\u252c\u259212.54 progeny. The progeny sex ratio (proportion of males) is female-biased (0.36\u252c\u2592. 03) when the parents were younger (0-12h old) but is male\u252c\u2556 biased (0.59\u252c\u25920.06) when the parents were older (96-108h old). Therefore, it implies that most of the daughters are produced during earlier phase of reproduction. The analysis of the data shows that only maternal age at copulation influences the total births significantly while both maternal as well as paternal age during copulation influence the progeny sex ratio. The implication of these results is discussed with reference to the maximisation of yield of total births as well as the female births for mass propagation and field release of the parasitoids in biocontrol programmes.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["36"]}

But when I telnet to my workstation, I can view all lab files and read my e-mail, effectively acquiring the authorizations of my office space. Tunneling helps us hack around the limitations of how the authorizations and capabilities are set up. Tunneling is a cheap way to achieve application integration. But it is not always desirable. For example, in the near future, I might leave my e-wallet on a server, change its settings from my desktop (wider authorizations), and use it for only small purchases from my phone (limited authorizations). Of course, tunneling from the phone to the server via the desktop would be a security risk, not to mention confusing to the user. Thus, tunneling may sometimes be essential, but would often not be desirable.

Material and Methods: The present study included 107 pathological specimens of histologically proven cases of OSCC (n= 19), leukoplakia (n= 77) and benign lesions (n= 10). All the cases were subjected to immunohistochemistry to check the expression of CK8 antibodies. Correlation was evaluated statistically by Chi-square test. Result: Increased expression of CK8 was seen in OSCC and leukoplakia with dysplasia. No immunoreactivity was seen in benign oral mucosa. Expression of CK8 was significantly correlated with dysplasia and cancer. Conclusion: CK8 can be used as marker of sequential premalignant changes in oral cancers.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["36"]}
