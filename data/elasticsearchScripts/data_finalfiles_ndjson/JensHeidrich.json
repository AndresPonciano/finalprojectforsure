{"title": "Software project control centers: concepts and approaches\n", "abstract": " On-line interpretation and visualization of project data are gaining increasing importance on the long road towards predictable and controllable software project execution. In the context of software development, only few techniques exist for supporting these tasks. This is caused particularly by the often insufficient use of engineering principles in the software development domain. Beyond that, interpretation and visualization techniques from other domains (such as business or production processes) are not directly applicable to software processes because of the specific characteristics of software development. A software project control center (SPCC) is a means for collecting, interpreting, and visualizing measurement data in order to provide purpose- and role-oriented information to all involved parties (e.g., project manager, quality assurer) during the execution of a project.

The acceptance of an estimation technique is highly dependent on estimation accuracy. Often, this accuracy is only determined after an initial application. Possible further steps for improving the underlying estimation model typically do not influence the decision on whether to discard the technique or deploy it. In addition, most estimation techniques do not explicitly support the evolution of the underlying estimation model in an iterative manner.

This paper sketches the Sprint I controlling approach for software development projects and gives first evaluation results. The approach is grounded on the usage of context-oriented cluster curves and integrated in the framework of software project control centers.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1996"]}
{"title": "Context-driven Software Project Estimation\n", "abstract": " Using quantitative data from past projects for software project estimation requires context knowledge that characterizes its origin and indicates its applicability for future use. This article sketches the SPRINT I technique for project planning and controlling. The underlying prediction mechanism is based on the identification of similar past projects and the building of so-called clusters with typical data curves. The article focuses on how to characterize these clusters with context knowledge and how to use context information from actual projects for prediction. The SPRINT approach is tool-supported and first evaluations have been conducted.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1996"]}
{"title": "Continuous Process Improvement\n", "abstract": " Nowadays, a variety of different processes for the development and maintenance of software-intensive systems exists, ranging from agile development processes to classical plan-based approaches. There is no ultimate process that can be applied in each and every situation. It depends on the project goals and environment as well as on the required characteristics of the system under development. Development processes support organizations in developing software-intensive systems with certain quality characteristics, within a certain time span, and requiring a certain amount of effort. Continuous process improvement deals with the establishment and maintenance of high-quality processes, with analyzing their performance and effectiveness, and with initiating corresponding improvement actions if needed. In this chapter, we will take a closer look at how to systematically define and continuously improve\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1996"]}
{"title": "Tutorial: business IT alignment using the GQM+ Strategies\u00ae approach\n", "abstract": " Most of today\u2019s products and services are software-based. Organizations that develop software want to maintain and improve their competitiveness by controlling software-related risks. To do this, they need to align their business goals with software development strategies and translate them into quantitative project management. There is also an increasing need to justify cost and resources for software and system development and other IT services by demonstrating their impact on an organization\u2019s higher-level goals. For both, linking business goals and software-related efforts in an organization is necessary. However, this is a challenging task, and there is a lack of methods addressing this gap.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1996"]}
{"title": "GQM+Strategies\u00ae: Experiences from Industrial Case Studies and Visualization Needs\n", "abstract": " Explicitly linking software-related activities to an organization\u2019s higher-level goals has been shown to be critical for several purposes such as aligning activities to strategies or linking budgets to strategic objectives. GQM+Strategies\u00ae provides mechanisms for explicitly linking goals and strategies in an organization based on goal-oriented measurement. Developing strategic measurement systems with GQM+ Strategies\u00ae requires that higher-level decision makers are involved and that, as a consequence, their information needs are addressed. Experience has shown that it is important to use adequate representations for decision makers when involving them in the definition of strategic measurement systems. This article sketches practical experience from three industrial pilot studies that applied the method, derives requirements for representing strategic measurement systems to decision makers in an adequate format, and proposes visualization mechanisms that can contribute to the fulfillment of the stated requirements. In the conclusion, next steps and future research questions are sketched.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1996"]}
