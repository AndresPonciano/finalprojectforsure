{"title": "Visual comparison for information visualization\n", "abstract": " Data analysis often involves the comparison of complex objects. With the ever increasing amounts and complexity of data, the demand for systems to help with these comparisons is also growing. Increasingly, information visualization tools support such comparisons explicitly, beyond simply allowing a viewer to examine each object individually. In this paper, we argue that the design of information visualizations of complex objects can, and should, be studied in general, that is independently of what those objects are. As a first step in developing this general understanding of comparison, we propose a general taxonomy of visual designs for comparison that groups designs into three basic categories, which can be combined. To clarify the taxonomy and validate its completeness, we provide a survey of work in information visualization related to comparison.

{"title": "Combing the communication hairball: Visualizing parallel execution traces using logical time\n", "abstract": " With the continuous rise in complexity of modern supercomputers, optimizing the performance of large-scale parallel programs is becoming increasingly challenging. Simultaneously, the growth in scale magnifies the impact of even minor inefficiencies - potentially millions of compute hours and megawatts in power consumption can be wasted on avoidable mistakes or sub-optimal algorithms. This makes performance analysis and optimization critical elements in the software development process. One of the most common forms of performance analysis is to study execution traces, which record a history of per-process events and interprocess messages in a parallel application. Trace visualizations allow users to browse this event history and search for insights into the observed performance behavior. However, current visualizations are difficult to understand even for small process counts and do not scale gracefully\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "60\n", "authors": ["932"]}

CPU manufacturers have developed sampling-based performance measurement units (PMUs) that report precise costs of memory accesses at specific addresses.

We have developed a method to gather fine-grained memory access performance data for specific data objects and regions of code with low overhead and attribute semantic information to the sampled memory accesses. This information provides the context necessary to more effectively interpret the data. We have developed a tool that performs this sampling and attribution and used the tool to discover and diagnose performance problems in real-world applications.

Moreover, real-life network data sets usually represent objects with a large number of additional attributes that need to be visualized, such as in software engineering, social network analysis, or biochemistry. In this paper, we present a novel approach, called Network Lens, to visualize such attributes in context of the underlying network.

The interface is designed to visualize symptom and medication information, collected by an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system, which will consist of a smartphone, electronic dosing device, wrist sensor and a bed sensor. In our work, the focus is on measuring data related to some of the main health-related quality of life aspects such as motor function, sleep, medication compliance, meal intake timing in relation to medication intake, and physical exercise. A mock-up demonstrator for the interface was developed using UCD methodology in collaboration with PD patients. The research work was performed as an iterative design and evaluation process based on interviews and observations with 11 PD patients. Additional usability evaluations were conducted with three information visualization experts. Contributions include a list of requirements for the interface, results evaluating the performance of the patients when using the demonstrator during task-based evaluation sessions as well as opinions of the experts. The list of requirements included ability of the patients to track an ideal day, so they could repeat certain activities in the future as well as determine how the scores are related to each other. The patients found the visualizations as clear and easy to understand and could successfully perform the tasks.

Much of this data is of relational nature, such as social networks, metabolic pathways, or links between software components. Traditionally, those networks are represented as node-link diagrams or matrix representations. They help us to understand the structure (topology) of the relational data. However in many real world data sets, additional (often multidimensional) attributes are attached to the network elements. One challenge is to show these attributes in context of the underlying network topology in order to support the user in further analyses.

Biochemical networks as representations of processes are very important for a comprehensive understanding of living beings. Drawings of these networks are often visually overloaded and do not scale.

If those pathways are visualized, this strategy generates additional navigation and exploration problems as the user loses the context within the complete network.In this article, we present a general solution to this problem of visualizing interconnected pathways and discuss it in context of biochemical networks.

{"title": "Multivariate networks: visualization and interaction techniques\n", "abstract": " As more and more data is created each day, researchers from different science domains are trying to make sense of it. A lot of this data, for example our connections to friends on different social networking websites, can be modeled as graphs, where the nodes are actors and the edges are relationships between them. Researchers analyze this data to find new forms of communication, to explore different social groups or subgroups, to detect illegal activities or to seek for different communication patterns that could help companies in their marketing campaigns. Another example are huge networks in system biology. Their visualization is crucial for the understanding of living beings. The topological structure of a network on its own could give insight into the existence or distribution of interesting actors in the network. However, this is often not enough to understand complex network systems in real-world applications. The reason for this is that all the network elements (nodes or edges) are not simple one-dimensional data. For instance in biology, experiments can be performed on biological networks. These experiments and network analysis approaches produce additional data that are often important to be analyzed with respect to the underlying network structure. Therefore, it is crucial to visualize the additional attributes of the network while preserving the network structure as much as possible. The problem is not trivial as these so-called multivariate networks could have a high number of attributes that are related to their nodes, edges, different groups, or clusters of nodes and/or edges.

Software metrics are quantitative measurements of a piece of software, e.g., a class, a package, or a component. A good understanding of software metrics supports the identification of possible problems in the development process and helps to improve the software quality. In this paper, we present two possibilities how novel visual representations can support the user to discover interesting properties within the metric data set. The first one uses a new interactive 3D metaphor to overcome known problems in the visualization of the evolution of software metrics. Then, we focus on the usage of 2D animation to represent metric values.

{"title": "Towards the Visualization of Multivariate Biochemical Networks\n", "abstract": " Many open challenges exist when dealing with different biological networks. They are crucial for the understanding of living beings. Complete drawings of these typically large networks usually suffer from clutter and visual overload. In order to overcome this issue, the networks are divided into single, hierarchically structured pathways. However, this subdivision makes it harder to navigate and understand the connections between pathways. Another challenge is to visualize ontologies and hierarchical clusterings, which are important tools to study high-throughput data that are automatically generated nowadays. Both of these methods produce different types of large graphs. Although these methods are used to explore the same data set, they are usually considered independently. Therefore, a combined view showing the results of both methods is desired. Additionally, real life data sets, including biological networks, usually have additional attributes related to the considered network. Investigating means to visualize such multivariate data together with the network drawing is also one of the ongoing challenges in biology, but also in other fields.The aim of this thesis is to lay out the foundations towards defining techniques for the visualization of multivariate biochemical networks. An overall understanding of the problems related to biochemical networks should be acquired to achieve this aim. More importantly, a contribution to the aforementioned challenges is necessary.
