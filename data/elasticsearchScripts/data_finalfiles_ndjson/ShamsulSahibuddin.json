WLAN-based indoor positioning system is considered as one of the best choices for indoor positioning due to its low cost, simple configuration and high accuracy. Although the WLAN Received Signal Strength fingerprinting method is the most accurate positioning method, the offline phase of this method known as radio map creation is a time consuming process. On the other hand, in dynamically changing environments, this radio map will be outdated and this will reduce the positioning accuracy. In this paper the Multi-Wall signal path loss model will be used to automatically generate the radio map based on the knowledge of the environment layout. The results of the experiment show that the indoor positioning by using the generated radio map can achieve high accuracy with average distance error reaching up to 1.2 m.

{"title": "Accurate Indoor-Positioning Model Based on People Effect and Ray-Tracing Propagation\n", "abstract": " Wireless local area networks (WLAN)-fingerprinting has been highlighted as the preferred technology for indoor positioning due to its accurate positioning and minimal infrastructure cost. However, its accuracy is highly influenced by obstacles that cause fluctuation in the signal strength. Many researchers have modeled static obstacles such as walls and ceilings, but few studies have modeled the people\u2019s presence effect (PPE), although the human body has a great impact on signal strength. Therefore, PPE must be addressed to obtain accurate positioning results. Previous research has proposed a model to address this issue, but these studies only considered the direct path signal between the transmitter and the receiver whereas multipath effects such as reflection also have a significant influence on indoor signal propagation. This research proposes an accurate indoor-positioning model by considering people\u2019s presence and multipath using ray-tracing, we call it (AIRY). This study proposed two solutions to construct AIRY: an automatic radio map using ray tracing and a constant of people\u2019s effect for the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) adaptation. The proposed model was simulated using MATLAB software and tested at Level 3, Menara Razak, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. A K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) algorithm was used to define a position.

{"title": "nhancing Cognitive Aspects of Software Visualization Using DocLike Modularized Graph.\n", "abstract": " Understanding an existing software system to trace possible changes involved in a maintenance task can be time consuming especially if its design document is absence or out-dated. In this case, visualizing the software artefacts graphically may improve the cognition of the subject system by software maintainers. A number of tools have emerged and they generally consist of a reverse engineering environment and a viewer to visualize software artefacts such as in the form of graphs. The tools also grant structural re-documentation of existing software systems but they do not explicitly employ document-like software visualization in their methods. This paper proposes DocLike Modularized Graph method that represents the software artefacts of a reverse engineered subject system graphically, module-by-module in a document-like re-documentation environment. The method is utilized in a prototype tool named DocLike viewer that generates graphical views of a C language software system parsed by a selected C language parser. Two experiments were conducted to validate how much the proposed method could improve cognition of a subject system by software maintainers without documentation, in terms of productivity and quality. Both results deduce that the method has the potential to improve cognitive aspects of software visualization to support software maintainers in finding solutions of assigned maintenance tasks.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1150"]}
{"title": "Physical image quality evaluation of medical radiographs\n", "abstract": " The noise equivalent quanta (NEQ) has been recommended as a measure of physical quality of medical images. Digitised data of medical radiographs in a previous work have been analysed in terms of resolution via the modulation transfer function (MTF) and noise via the noise power spectrum (NPS), but not in terms of NEQ. As the NEQ is currently regarded as a basic device performance measure of the imaging system, it is very useful to be able to determine it. The average gamma of the radiograph was computed, both the MTF and the NPS data were interpolated and these values were used to compute the NEQ. The computation shows that for spatial frequency range 0\u20130.7 cycles/mm the NEQ of Lanex Regular/T Mat G screen-film combination is slightly lower than that of Lanex Regular/T Mat L, for 0.7\u20131.5 cycles/mm the NEQ of both are almost the same, and for frequencies greater than 1.5 cycles/mm the NEQ of the former is greater than that of the latter.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1150"]}

The seaweeds, Turbinaria ornata (T. ornata), Sargassum species (Sargassum sp.) and Padina tetrastromatica (P. tetrastromatica), were extracted in cold water and freeze-dried. Anaesthetised rats were prepared for direct blood pressure measurements with the changes in HR also being monitored. Rats were administered intravenously with the aqueous extract of the seaweeds at doses of 2.5 to 20.0 mg/kg. Concentrations of Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ found in the dose of 20.0 mg/kg of the marine plant extracts were determined. Subsequently, salt solutions containing the equivalent cationic concentration found in each of the seaweed extracts were tested on Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. All seaweeds investigated produced significant (P< 0.05) reductions in the blood pressure of both SHR and the control WKY rats. In T. ornata, significant (P< 0.05) HR reducing effect was produced. In contrast, this effect was not seen in other brown seaweeds tested. Analysis of the ionic composition present in all the extracts revealed that the salt solution with equivalent ionic content of each seaweed extract did not produce any significant decrease in blood pressure of the SD rats. In conclusion, the data obtained from the present study suggest that the aqueous extracts of T. ornata, Sargassum sp. and P. tetrastromatica may contain blood pressure lowering agents.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1150"]}

{"title": "Development of Social Presence Requirements Artefacts for E-Learning Using Multiphase Approach\n", "abstract": " E-learning is an application which facilitates learners\u2019 activities throughout the learning process. An E-learning plays a role in attracting learners to sustain learners\u2019 connectedness while they are sharing knowledge. To address the issue of lack of connectedness in E-learning, the authors have introduced multiphase approach whereby it is able to assist in providing a set of social presence requirements for E-learning development. This paper reveals four social presence elements for developing connectedness in E-learning. In requirements elicitation, the authors prioritize social presence elements via MoSCoW prioritization method. Delphi method is carried out to obtain experts\u2019 consensus as the evaluation for all the artefacts related to social presence requirements development. The evaluation discusses results on Delphi round one and Delphi round two regarding social presence requirements. Three\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1150"]}
{"title": "Energy performance evaluation for dynamic frequency scaling on rate monotonic and earliest deadline first scheduling algorithm\n", "abstract": " Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) algorithm is widely used to reduce processor\u2019s energy consumption in mixed-criticality systems. Existing works show that there are more DVFS algorithms were developed based on Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling scheme compared to Rate Monotonic (RM) scheduling scheme. To understand the reason why EDF is prevalent for DVFS algorithms, simulation can be done to get the power consumption of both scheduling schemes. However, there is no simulation tools available dedicated for this purpose. This research aims to investigate power consumption of both scheduling schemes under different processor speed levels using SimSo simulator. The processor\u2019s utilization and schedulability are determined using a set of task in SimSo. Power consumption for Least Common Multiple of tasks period is then calculated based on the proposed power model. The result shows that EDF performs better than RM and able to reduce 30% of energy at processor speed of 0.7. In addition, the capability of SimSo to be used in DVFS algorithm creation also had been observed. It is found that SimSo can be used for further research with additional codes.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1150"]}
{"title": "Indoor positioning system based Wi-Fi fingerprinting for dynamic environment: Experimental preliminary result\n", "abstract": " Location Based Services (LBS) are an important permissive technology and it have wide range of application. The main component of LBS is location detection. It can be divided into proximity, triangulation and fingerprint. Fingerprint Wi-Fi has been preferred technology due to its accurate positioning results and minimal infrastructure cost. It is conducted in offline and online phase. In the first phase, a site survey is conducted to collect the vectors of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) at many reference points of known locations. Then users measures RSSI vector at their position in the online phase. System compares the received target vector with the stored fingerprints. People Presence Effect (PPE) has a dominant influence to RSSI in a dynamic environment. It is necessary to further research related to PPE so that it can be generated a more accurate indoor positioning system in dynamic environments such as airports, hospital and shopping area.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1150"]}
{"title": "Tracking control of an unmanned aerial vehicle using cascade configuration of fuzzy logic controllers in presence of windflaw\n", "abstract": " In this study, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), quadrotor particularly, with six degree of freedom (6-DOF) is modeled and a novel arrangement of fuzzy logic controller (FLC) are designed to control quadrotor\u2019s attitude and altitude. The UAVs are high nonlinear in terms of dynamic equations and are in class of under-actuated systems with six degree of freedom and four propeller\u2019s speed as inputs. So, designing an appropriate controller is the main challenge in UAV\u2019s applications. The controller architectures is composed of three FLCs. A MIMO FLC is implemented to control angles and altitude which is fed by two first output controllers, namely desired roll and pitch angles. Then, an octagonal helix path is constructed in such a way that an octagonal schema is generated in XY plane and is developed in vertical direction. By applying the windflaw to the system as a disturbance, which is blew in three directions, namely x, y, and z, the performance of designed controller is investigated. Finally, results are presented to show the controller performance for tracking purpose in presence of a wind as disturbance.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1150"]}
{"title": "MAPPING OF A PLATFORM SPECIFIC MODEL TO A PARTICULAR PLATFORM USING AN EAV DESIGNED PLATFORM MODEL\n", "abstract": " The Model Driven Architecture (MDA) aimed to produce applications that support multiple platforms using models instead of the conventional coding with less cost and time. The MDA development process separated to Platform Independent Model (PIM) and Platform Specific Model (PSM). Both, PIM and PSM are standing in different level of abstraction. The PIM focused on the business rules definition with no concern about the platform environment. It is the PSM role to emphasis on the implementation environment of the targeted platform. Although, the PSM models holding some technical implementation details about the targeted platform, but it\u2019s still considered too abstract to be executed in a run-time platform environment. The degree of abstraction can be controlled by the model mapping, given the MDA standard Platform Model (PM). The PM can be described as a platform\u2019s system manual that provides model mapping with a specific technical details required by the targeted run-time environment. In this work we explicitly employed a Platform Model (PM) designed by the Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) concept to support the model mapping from PSM to Java platform. A case study provided as proof of concept to generate executable Java code that supports desktop and mobile platform.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1150"]}
{"title": "Managing software projects with team software process (TSP)\n", "abstract": " Despite the widespread use of sound project management practices and process improvement models over the last several years, the failure of software projects remains a challenge to organisations. As part of the attempt to address software industry challenges, several models, frameworks, and methods have been developed that are intended to improve software processes to produce quality software on time, under budget, and in accordance with previously stipulated functionalities. One of the most widely practised methods is the Team Software Process (TSP). The TSP was designed to provide an operational framework for establishing an effective team environment and guiding engineering teams in their work. This chapter provides an overview of the TSP and its associated structures and processes. It also highlights how the TSP operational framework can assist project manager and software development\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1150"]}
{"title": "COMMON SUB-EXPRESSION IDENTIFICATION STRATEGY FOR MQO\n", "abstract": " In query optimization, a query can be executed with different strategies, known as execution plan. The query optimizer will determine the best execution plan for a single query. However, when there are more than one query to be executed together, the locally optimal strategies for single queries may not be the best choice for obtaining a globally optimal execution cost. This will require for a multiple query optimizer that is able to select an alternative plan for each query in order to obtain an optimal global execution plan for the multiple queries. An optimal global plan can be obtained in two ways, by using an admissible heuristic with the search algorithms or by decreasing the number of search space through reducing the number of alternative plans generated. In generating alternative plans, the number and quality of the alternative plans produced are the major factors that will determine the performance of multiple-query optimization. In this paper, we propose the sharing opportunities for identifying the common sub-expressions.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1150"]}
