{"title": "Patterns leveraging analysis reuse of business processes\n", "abstract": " This paper proposes the use of patterns to help the software designer to model business processes. It focuses on the initial phases of the software development life cycle and has the objective of promoting reuse of the components of these phases. Business processes are considered to have a critical analysis phase, which demands a significant portion of the development efforts. Due to the emphasis on these phases, the proposed solution is to use patterns with two objectives: to model the business processes and to provide reuse of analysis elements. For that, the \u2018Strategies and Patterns\u2019 methodology is complemented with new patterns, diagrams and stages in its process. Complementary, the pattern documentation structure is improved. This work intends to contribute presenting new directions to use and to obtain patterns. To assess the propositions, one case study is presented and analyzed, trying to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1437"]}
{"title": "Applying pattern techniques to leverage component-based development.\n", "abstract": " This paper proposes the use of patterns to be used along with the Component-Based Development (CBD) approach. Patterns aim documenting, recovering and, mainly, capturing composition and functionalities of the components in order to obtain software reuse. Definitions of patterns and examples of applications are presented, as well as the references made to components within some expressive methods concerning patterns. The tailoring and integration of patterns with components is used to conclude that the concepts and structures widely used by patterns are feasible to be applied to model not just objects and classes, but also components as addressed by CBD approaches. As a result, it is proposed that CBD should make use of some pattern methods and techniques to leverage reuse in all stages of the lifecycle, independently from the paradigm being used and component development process and notation adopted.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1437"]}
