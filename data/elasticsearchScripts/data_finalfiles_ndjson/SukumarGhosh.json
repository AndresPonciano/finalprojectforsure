{"title": "Fault-containing self-stabilizing algorithms\n", "abstract": " Self-stabilization provides a non-masking approach to fault tolerance. Given this fact, one would hope that in a self-stabilizing system, the amount of disruption caused by a fault is proportional to the severity of the fault. However, this is not true for many self-stabilizing systems. Our paper addresses this weakness of distributed self-stabilizing systems by introducing the notion of fault containment. Informally, a fault-containing self-stabilizing algorithm is one that contains the effects of limited transient faults while retaining the property of self-st abilization. The paper begins with a formal framework for specifying and evaluating fault-containing self-stabilizing protocols. Then, it is shown that self-stabilization and fault containment are goals that can conflict. For example, it is shown that imposing a O (1) bound on the worst caserecovery time from a l-faulty state necessitates added overhead for stabilization: for some tasks\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "191\n", "authors": ["524"]}

{"title": "Dissecting self-* properties\n", "abstract": " The scale and complexity of distributed systems have steadily grown in the recent years. Management of this complexity has drawn attention towards systems that can automatically maintain themselves throughout different scenarios. These systems have been described with many terms, such as self-healing, self-stabilizing, self-organizing, self-adaptive, self-optimizing, self-protecting, and self-managing. These attributes are collectively referred to as self-* properties. Even with the increased focus on self-* research, there exists much ambiguity in the perceptions of the different self-* properties. In this paper, we propose to resolve the ambiguity by introducing a template for defining self-* properties, and use it to offer formal definitions of existing self-* terms. We then present some observations about the relationships among the different self-* properties.

{"title": "An exercise in fault-containment: self-stabilizing leader election\n", "abstract": " Self-stabilizing algorithms are designed to guarantee convergence to some desired stable state from arbitrary initial states arising out of an arbitrarily large number of faults. However, in a well-designed system, the simultaneous occurrence of a large number of faults is rare. It is therefore desirable to design algorithms that are not only self-stabilizing, but also have the ability to recover very fast from a bounded number of faults. As an illustration, we present a simple self-stabilizing leader election protocol that recovers in O(1) time from a state with a single transient fault on oriented rings. Only the faulty node and its two neighbors change their state during convergence to a stable state. Thus, the effect of a single fault is tightly contained around the fault. The technique for transforming a self-stabilizing algorithm into its fault-contained version is simple and general, and can be applied to other problems as well that satisfy\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "93\n", "authors": ["524"]}

This paper presents a probabilistic algorithm for fault-containment, that confines the effect of any single fault to the immediate neighborhood of the faulty process, with an expected recovery time of O(\u0394               3). The most significant aspect of the algorithm is that the fault-gap, defined as the smallest interval after which the system is ready to handle the next single fault with the same efficiency, depends only on \u0394, and is independent of the network size.

{"title": "Locally self-adjusting skip graphs\n", "abstract": " We present a distributed self-adjusting algorithm for skip graphs that minimizes the average routing costs between arbitrary communication pairs by performing topological adaptation to the communication pattern. Our algorithm is fully decentralized, conforms to the CONGEST model (i.e. uses O(logn) bit messages), and requires O(logn) bits of memory for each node, where n is the total number of nodes. Upon each communication request, our algorithm first establishes communication by using the standard skip graph routing, and then locally and partially reconstructs the skip graph topology to perform topological adaptation. We propose a computational model for such algorithms, as well as a yardstick (working set property) to evaluate them. Our working set property can also be used to evaluate self-adjusting algorithms for other graph classes where multiple tree-like subgraphs overlap (e.g. hypercube networks\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["524"]}

The laser beam induces a homogeneously nucleated micro-bubble at the water\u2013glass (SOM-coated) interface due to high absorptivity of the SOMs at the laser wavelength, and the very high light intensity at the laser spot (\u223c10s' of MW cm\u22122).

{"title": "Self-optimizing DHTs using request profiling\n", "abstract": " Various studies on request patterns in P2P networks have confirmed the existence of the interest-based clusters [11] and [12]. Some P2P networks that exhibit the small-world phenomenon contain clusters of peers that frequently communicate with one another [17]. The existence of interest-based clusters opens up the possibility of more efficient routing. In this paper we consider the problem of designing a self-optimizing overlay network and routing mechanisms to permit efficient location of resources by the periodic profiling of request patterns. Our self-optimization protocol uses selective replication of resources for restricting the sizes of the clusters, and proposes the deployment of inactive nodes for further reduction of the routing latency. The self-optimization protocol is demonstrated on the Chord network [22]. It leads to a routing latency that scales with the size of the clusters.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["524"]}
{"title": "Fault-containing self-stabilizing distributed protocols\n", "abstract": " Self-stabilization is an elegant approach for designing a class of fault-tolerant distributed protocols. A self-stabilizing protocol is guaranteed to eventually converge to a legitimate state after a transient fault. However, even a minor transient fault can cause vast disruption in the system before legitimacy is reached. This paper introduces the notion of fault-containment to address this particular weakness of self-stabilizing systems. Informally, a fault-containing self-stabilizing protocol, in addition to providing self-stabilization, contains the e ects of faults. This ensures that disruption during recovery from faults, is proportional to the extent of the faults. The paper begins with a formal framework for specifying and evaluating fault-containing self-stabilizing protocols. The main result of the paper is a transformer that converts any non-reactive self-stabilizing protocol into an equivalent fault-containing self-stabilizing protocol that can repair any single fault in the system in O (1) time. For a large class of input protocols, the corresponding output protocols produced by the transformer have O (1) space overhead. The small time and space overhead make the fault-containing self-stabilizing protocol a practical alternative to the original self-stabilizing protocol. The transformer is based on a novel stabilizing timer paradigm that signi cantly simpli es the task of fault-containment.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["524"]}

The diurnal analysis shows an enhancement of O++ around midnight. On the nightside the O++ densities are highly variable but show a positive correlation with variations in the O+ densities. Model calculations of O++ concentrations in the nightside are made assuming that impact ionization by precipitating electrons and transport of ions from the dayside were the sources for O++ ions. We find that in situ ionization by precipitating electrons contributes very little, whereas a downward O++ flux in the range of 105 to 106 cm\u22122 s\u22121 can account for the measured values of O++ densities near midnight.

Literature review suggested that though there is a case for linking these two variables there are hardly any study which has empirically tried to explore this relationship particularly in Indian context. For addressing this gap in the literature, a survey was conducted using established scales. In all 325 usable survey responses from executives working in various sectors in India were analyzed using regression analysis. The results show that organizational identification and job embeddedness are strongly related. However, hypotheses stating that the perceived organizational support and job satisfaction will accentuate this relationship were not supported. These findings along with the finding that organizational identification and job embeddedness are strongly related, throws up a few implications for the practicing managers. Overall this study attempts to contribute to the literature by empirically examining the relationship between organizational identification and job embeddedness as the existing literature on this relationship is scant.

Although this is an efficacious treatment policy, it has high acute systemic and mucosal toxicities, which lead to frequent treatment breaks and increased overall treatment time. Hence, the current study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of concurrent chemoradiation using 40 mg/m2 weekly cisplatin. Materials and Methods: This is a single institutional retrospective study including the data of 266 locally advanced head and neck cancer patients who were treated with concurrent chemoradiation using 40 mg/m2 weekly cisplatin from January 2012 to January 2014.

{"title": "Optimisation of IDA-based fragility curves\n", "abstract": " The seismic fragility of a structure is the conditional probability of failure for a given seismic hazard level. It is measured as the probability of exceedance of a particular limit state of the selected damage measure (DM) for a given intensity measure (IM). Over the last decade, the incremental dynamic analysis or \u2018IDA\u2019has become the preferred choice of obtaining the seismic fragility of a structure. An IDA consists of a series of nonlinear response-history analyses (NLRHA) of the mathematical model of a structure subjected to incremented intensity measures of a ground acceleration data. A multi-IDA, where a multitude of ground acceleration records are used to obtain multiple IM vs. DM \u2018IDA curves\u2019, are typically used in a seismic fragility analysis. For a selected IM, the variation in DM are treated as random samples in calculating fragility. Typically, lognormal distributions are used to model the distribution of DM at each hazard level. The parameters of these lognormal distributions vary over hazard levels. Previous researchers used trendlines to express these parameters as functions of the intensity measure/hazard level. These trendlines were obtained by minimising the error in estimating the sample mean and the sample standard deviation values at each hazard level. In current study, a simple 2D stick model idealisation of a nuclear (primary) containment structure is selected. The multi-IDA is performed using a set of 25 ground acceleration records of similar seismo/geological origins.

Because of the rich diversity of medicinal plants and for their large scale use for medicinal purpose, attention of Govt. of India has been focussed to promote the culture of many of those medicinal plants and extract the useful and beneficial alcaloids from those plants for human welfare.Like many other plants, the medicinal plants are also proned to a large number of pests including mite pests which cause retardation of growth of the plants and that ultimately affect the yield. So far as mites occurring on medicinal plants are concerned, practically nothing has been done from West Bengal and barring Lal & Mukherji (1977) no efforts were made to explore the mite fauna on medicinal plants from India. Since many of the mites on medicinal plants have importance either as pests or as predators, it was thought desirable to explore the mite fauna on medicinal plants and find out their importance, if any, either as pests or as predators. The present paper is the first attempt in that direction and reports 54 species belonging to 27 genera under 14 families and 3 orders from West Bengal, of those, 23 species are phytophagous. 2 are fungivorous and the remaining 29 species are predatory in habit.

{"title": "The effect of glutathione upon chaperone activity of alpha-crystallin is probably mediated through target modulation\n", "abstract": " We studied the effect of the presence of glutathione, both reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG), on the chaperone activity of \u03b1-crystallin towards thermal aggregation of \u03b32-crystallin. Results showed that while GSH enhanced the chaperone activity of \u03b1-crystallin, GSSG appeared to diminish it to some extent. When, however, the effect of the presence of glutathione was studied in the absence of \u03b1-crystallin, the nature of their action was found to be almost similar to that observed in its presence. These results suggest that glutathiones probably modulate the target protein which ultimately influences the chaperone activity of \u03b1-crystallin.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["524"]}

The decrease was more pronounced in N-treated limed soil than the corresponding unlimed soil. In both unlimed and limed situations total hydrolysable organic N was found to decrease more in the N-treated than the corresponding untreated system not receiving N. The largest decrease in total N due to cropping in the N-treated limed soil corresponded with the largest increase in N-uptake by the crop. Results from a soil N balance showed that a greater amount of N was unaccounted for in N-saturated limed soil. Fixed NH+-N declined with cropping, particularly from N-saturated soils. It is suggested that the role of fixed NH4+-N must be taken into consideration in any N-transformation study.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["524"]}

Attempts have been made to collection of rainfall data and analyzing this for Daspalla region in Odisha, eastern India for prediction of monsoon and post-monsoon rainfall by using six different probability distribution functions, forecasting the probable date of onset and withdrawal of monsoon, occurrence of dry spells by using Markov chain model and finally crop planning for the region. Soil parameters viz. particle size distribution, soil pH, bulk density (BD), soil moisture content at field capacity and permanent wilting point, available water capacity (AWC), soil organic carbon storage were assessed; and pedotransfer functions (PTFs) were developed for saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), water retention at field capacity (FC, -33 kPa) and permanent wilting point (PWP, -1500 kPa) for different sites under major cropping system in the Kuanria canal command. It is revealed from this analysis that, for prediction of monsoon and post-monsoon rainfall, Log Pearson Type-III and Gumbel distribution, respectively have been found as the best fit probability distribution function.

Knowledge of variations in the superficial veins of head and neck is essential to carry out successful surgical procedures. During routine dissection of head and neck of two middle aged male cadavers, in the Department of Anatomy, Calcutta National Medical College, Kolkata, India, we came out with some interesting venous architecture. The retromandibular vein on the left side of both the cadavers was found to be undivided and joined with the facial vein in the neck at an acute angle to form a common venous trunk at variable distances from the angle of the mandible. That trunk ultimately drained into the left subclavian vein. This might be the result of disappearance of the cephalic part of the external jugular vein and formation of an additional communication between common facial vein and the external jugular vein in foetal life. In one case, we also came across an extra transverse communication between that common trunk and the internal jugular vein.

This paper illustrates how processes in an overlay network can use the information about traffic flow pattern and spontaneously adjust the topology to minimize their communication costs. Four different self-optimization protocols are presented. The selfish protocols allow peers to modify their routing tables to suit their individual needs, and are easy to implement, but the improvements are limited. Compared to this, the altruistic protocols that allow peers to adjust the routing tables based on the needs of other processes, promise a better performance.

However, planning of military operations is a complex process and is guided by the experience and capability of the commander and his staff who provide the necessary inputs to him. This decision making process can be made intelligent by developing Knowledge Based (KB) expert systems. In this paper, a knowledge-based approach has been used to produce a number of thematic maps useful for various military operations. The approach developed is capable of taking inputs in the form of data layers that may be generated from satellite images, aerial photographs, topographical maps or other ancillary data. Some common military operations such as selection of sites for bridges, ferries and helipads, identification of tactically important roads and vehicle mobility movement are considered.

Although pure TiO2 nanocrystals are terminated with thermodynamically stable {101} facets but Nb5+ doped TiO2 was found to be terminated with high energy {103} facet by lowering the surface energy. Successful doping in anatase TiO2 has been characterized by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) analysis.

As functions of the inner and outer radii, we find in the case of armchair edges that the size of the band gap follows distinct branches, while in the case of zigzag edges it changes monotonically.

Predatory potentiality of the fish was studied in a three prey system under different habitat conditions alone or along with two and four conspecifics. The number of Aedes larvae consumed in comparison to other prey types (tubificid worms and vegetables) was noted and an index of prey selectivity was used to evaluate the preference for Aedes larvae. Foraging experiments were attempted in the laboratory. The study revealed a strong and consistent preference to tubificid worms (selectivity coefficients> 0.33, t (5)= 8.08; p< 0.001) in a simple habitat three-prey system. However, mosquito larvae (selectivity coefficients> 0.33, t (5)= 6.74; p< 0.01) were consumed readily when habitat complexity increased. Presence of conspecifics affected male foraging behaviour similarly with Aedes larvae as preferred prey in complex habitat and tubificid larvae in simple habitat. Significant difference of niche breadth (t (17)= 5.92; p< 0.001) between simple and complex habitat reflecting shift of prey selection pattern by fish. Consumption rate of different prey types varied with the predator densities in both habitats.

Each year more and more computers are procured and put to use. But it\u2019s not just the number of computers that is driving energy consumption upward. The way that we use computers also adds to the increasing energy burden. Research reveals that most personal desktop computers are not being used the majority of the time they are running and many personal computers worldwide are needlessly left on continuously. Increasing awareness of climate change and concern for the environment, has forced a variety of industries including the educational institutes to review their environmental credentials. Colleges and universities throughout the world are now paying more attention to Green Computing as an initiative towards a greener environment and cost savings. Institutions of higher education (IHEs) can decrease their carbon footprints and save costs when they embed energy-saving programs in their IT policy. Many institutions have chosen to include information on their websites about green computing efforts and how to reduce carbon footprints. In addition use of thin-client and virtualization is also being adapted as efforts towards sustainable computing.

{"title": "Performance Evaluation through Cash Management\n", "abstract": " Cash being a medium of exchange is one of the important components of working capital. The present research paper is an attempt to evaluate the cash management performance of two leading companies in the Indian steel industry, namely SAIL and TSL during the period 2003-04 to 2009-10. Secondary data collected from the published annual reports of the sample companies are used in the study. Cash flow based measures are employed to evaluate the cash management performance as well as liquidity performance of the selected companies. Linear regression equation is applied to examine the impact of cash balances on profitability performance. The empirical findings of the study reveal that TSL on the average has utilized its cash more efficiently in comparison to SAIL. Moreover, TSL has better capacity to convert its sales into cash than that of SAIL.Cash is the medium of exchange and therefore it is the most important component of working capital. Generally speaking, cash balances denote cash on hand and bank deposits. Maintaining cash balance at a high level is necessary but at the same time it is not desirable since cash in its present form is a non-earning asset.

The results are explained under the basic assumptions of the molecular recombination model. The ERDA hydrogen concentration profiles are composed of two distinct hydrogen desorption processes, limited by rapid molecular diffusion in the initial stages of irradiation, and as the fluence progresses a slow process limited by diffusion of atomic hydrogen takes over. Which of the aforesaid processes dominates, is determined by the continuously evolving Hydrogen concentration within the films. The first process dominates when the H content is high, and as the H concentration falls below a certain threshold (Hcritical) the irradiation generated H radicals have to diffuse through larger distances before recombining to form H2, thereby significantly bringing down the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["524"]}

Two combination of Sentinel-2 dataset have been considered, first combination is 4-band dataset at 10m resolution which consists of NIR, R, G and B bands, while second combination is generated by stacking 4 bands having 10m resolution along with other six sharpened bands using Gram-Schmidt algorithm. For Landsat-8 OLI dataset, six multispectral bands have been pan-sharpened to have a spatial resolution of 15m using Gram-Schmidt algorithm. Random Forest (RF) and Maximum Likelihood classifier (MLC) have been selected for classification of images. It is found that, overall accuracy achieved by RF for 4-band, 10-band dataset of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 OLI are 88.38%, 90.05% and 86.68% respectively. While, MLC give an overall accuracy of 85.12%, 87.14% and 83.56% for 4-band, 10-band Sentinel and Landsat-8 OLI respectively. Results shown that 10-band Sentinel-2 dataset gives highest accuracy and shows a rise of 3.37% for RF and 3.58% for MLC compared to Landsat-8 OLI. However, all the classes show significant improvement in accuracy but a major rise in accuracy is observed for Sugarcane, Wheat and Fodder for Sentinel 10-band imagery. This study substantiates the fact that Sentinel-2 data can be utilized for mapping of vegetation with a good degree of accuracy when compared to Landsat-8 OLI specifically when objective is to map a sub class of vegetation.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["524"]}

Fibers with large diameters have bigger effective mode areas (Aeff) and can be useful for high power lasers and amplifiers. However, a large mode area (LMA) results in an increased number of modes that can be more susceptible to mode coupling. The modal effective index difference (\u0394neff) strongly correlates with mode stability and this increases as the modal order (m) increases. We report here that the mode spacing between the higher order modes can be further enhanced by introducing doped concentric rings in the core.

A significant increase in refractive index of films due to Si rich phase stabilization upon irradiation is observed, which is supported by UV\u2013Vis spectroscopy. Further, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) shows the improved Si rich SiNx phase at surface of films. Fourier transform Infrared spectroscopy suggests increased bond density of Si\u2013N in thin films. This is due to out-diffusion of hydrogen upon ion irradiation as bond density for Si\u2013H decreases upon irradiation.

Load imbalance among cache servers can substantially degrade content delivery performance. Due to the skewed and dynamic nature of real-world workloads, cache servers that serve viral content experience higher load as compared to other cache servers. We propose a novel distributed load balancing protocol called Meezan to address the load imbalance among cache servers. Meezan replicates popular objects to mitigate skewness and adjusts hash space boundaries in response to load dynamics in a novel way. Our theoretical analysis shows that Meezan achieves near perfect load balancing for a wide range of operating parameters.

{"title": "Photosynthetic performance and yield of watermelon grown under biodrainage (Casuarina equisetifolia) vegetation\n", "abstract": " The rise of water table situation, which causes waterlogging in agricultural field, can be controlled with biological drainage in addition to usual engineering drainage measures. The process uses the transpiration properties of trees. The biodrainage species, also known as \u201cphreatophytes\u201d, is able to draw water directly from the groundwater table or from the capillary fringe above it and eventually transpiring it to atmosphere. This causes decline in water table beneath the vegetation bringing waterlogged field to cultivable condition. Under such scenario in post monsoon season watermelon was cultivated as intercrop in a biodrained field under Casuarina equisetifolia plantation. Comparative photosynthesis performance of watermelon in field with and without Casuarina plantation was evaluated. The objective was to physiologically evaluate productivity of intercrops like watermelon under biodrainage vegetation and understanding the tree-intercrop interaction in reclaimed field. The Casuarina plantation on an average caused 21-34% reduction in incident of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) over watermelon crop in comparison to control. In spite of reduced PAR, photosynthesis rate in two cultivars \u2018Mokasa\u2019, Arka Manik and local \u2018Sugar baby\u2019 was higher (24.63, 20.36 and 19.43 m mol m-2 s-1) than control (21.80, 19.60 and 18.93 m mol m-2 s-1, respectively). The excess soil water in root zone in control field caused reduction in photosynthesis, stomatal conductance as well as yield, in all the three cultivars. Inside biodrainage vegetation the photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and yield of all the cultivars were better than control. However\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["524"]}

Hardness and the fracture toughness of the composite, were found to increase moderately with respect to the base glass.

The enhanced hardness of the composite was discussed by correlating the cushioning as well as toughening behavior of the agglomerated SWCNT bundles. On the other hand enhanced plastic flow was proposed to be the prime reason for the accumulation of SWCNT bundles around the crack, which increases the toughness of the composite by reducing the crack length.

Water, the dominant component in articular cartilage, is present in both free (70%) and bound form. Bound water is present in collagen fibrils comprising 10-20% of the cartilage. Studies indicate that T2\u2013the proton spin-spin relaxation time parameter-correlates with histologically observed variation arising from structural anisotropy of the collagen fibrillar network (1). Normally, the fibrils are oriented in response to mechanical loading forces of the knee joint, but with progression of osteoarthritis (OA), structural disruption occurs. This breakdown results in fluctuations in the ratio of free to bound water in the cartilage and is manifested in T2 variation. There are few cross-sectional studies of T2 changes with OA (2-3), especially in humans. This study evaluates T2 differences and their potential relationship with cartilage morphometry in healthy volunteers and in patients in varying stages of OA, as ascertained by the radiography based Kellgren Lawrence (KL) scale.

The opportunistic network is a demanding network with no set route to travel a message from the source to be able to the destination. During these networks, nodes use possibilities gained based on store-carry-forward patterns to forward communications. Every node that obtains a message when it activities another node makes selection concerning the forwarding or not necessarily delivering the node came across. Most of these message forwarding protocols use the benefit of social properties information like contact information and social relationship enclosed by the nodes in the social opportunistic network. In this paper, a Bonding based forwarding technique is proposed which is finding direct and indirect bonding among nodes by exploiting contact information and social pattern. In the proposed protocol, we also focus on indirect bonding by finding weakest direct bonded nodes and then replace it with strong indirect bonded nodes of the network. In this work, the balance between transmission delay and network traffic is considered by using shortest path map based mobility model. ONE simulator is used for simulation and performance of the proposed protocol is compared contrary popular approaches for instance Epidemic, PRoPHET, and BubbleRap, and Interaction based when using the shortest path map based mobility model.

Unlike single mode fibers (SMFs), a FMF guides more than one mode with a larger effective mode area. Mode division multiplexing in FMFs has gained significant importance for potentially high data rate transmission. However, with the increase in the number of modes, a FMF encounters possible coupling between the modes. We proposed two designs of a FMF that supports LP_01, LP_11, LP_21 and LP_02 modes, which propagate with larger mode spacing, offering reduced mode coupling and thus enhancing mode stability. The modal stability or effective index difference between the modes is enhanced by more than 26% by introducing a ring of air-holes in the first fiber design.

{"title": "Rule based end-to-end learning framework for urban growth prediction\n", "abstract": " Due to the rapid growth of urban areas in the past decades, it has become increasingly important to model and monitor urban growth in mega cities. Although several researchers have proposed models for simulating urban growth, they have been primarily dependent on various manually selected spatial and nonspatial explanatory features for building models. A practical difficulty with this approach is manual selection procedure, which tends to make model design process laborious and non-generic. Despite the fact that explanatory features provide us with the understanding of a complex process, there has been no standard set of features in urban growth prediction over which scholars have consensus. Hence, design and deploying of systems for urban growth prediction have remained challenging tasks. In order to reduce the dependency on human devised features, we have proposed a novel End-to-End prediction framework to represent remotely sensed satellite data in terms of rules of a cellular automata model in order to improve the performance of urban growth prediction. Using our End-to-End framework, we have achieved superior performance in Figure of Merit, Producer's accuracy, User's accuracy, and Overall accuracy metrics respectively over existing learning based methods.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["524"]}
{"title": "3'End Sequencing Library Preparation with A-seq2\n", "abstract": " Studies in the last decade have revealed a complex and dynamic variety of pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation reactions. mRNAs with long 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) are generated in differentiated cells whereas proliferating cells preferentially express transcripts with short 3'UTRs. We describe the A-seq protocol, now at its second version, which was developed to map polyadenylation sites genome-wide and study the regulation of pre-mRNA 3' end processing. Also this current protocol takes advantage of the polyadenylate (poly(A)) tails that are added during the biogenesis of most mammalian mRNAs to enrich for fully processed mRNAs. A DNA adaptor with deoxyuracil at its fourth position allows the precise processing of mRNA 3' end fragments for sequencing. Not including the cell culture and the overnight ligations, the protocol requires about 8 h hands-on time. Along with it, an easy-to-use software package for the analysis of the derived sequencing data is provided. A-seq2 and the associated analysis software provide an efficient and reliable solution to the mapping of pre-mRNA 3' ends in a wide range of conditions, from 106 or fewer cells.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["524"]}

SARAL/AltiKa promises reliable results on retrieving water level of inland water and coastal bodies, though recognition pattern as well as interpreting and modeling of AltiKa waveforms at land water boundary is still a challenge. Different Retracking methods are widely used for determining the water level more correctly. An altimetry waveform also gives vital information about the reflecting surface. So, waveform classification is many times needed for retrieving surface information or before applying retracking method. In this paper, SARAL/AltiKa 40 Hz waveform dataset (Pass #152) over the Maithon Reservoir, Jharkhand, India were classified\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["524"]}

However there is large scope for modifications of its physical properties. In the present study multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) are dispersed in a high tilted antiferroelectric liquid crystal composed of rod like molecules. The effects of nano-dispersion on electro-optical and dielectric properties of the host are studied in details. The time for switching between dark and bright states and the rotational viscosity are reduced and spontaneous polarization is enhanced considerably by minute addition of MWCNTs. The high tilt angle of the molecules necessary for obtaining good dark state in displays has not changed after dispersion of nanotubes. The strong interaction of the aromatic cores of the rod like liquid crystal molecules with the honey-comb pattern of the CNT walls is considered responsible behind such improvements of physical properties of the host.

Though several therapeutic managements are available for arthritis, their side effects not only limit their use, but also advocate the quest for natural therapies. In this study, we explored the antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory and antiarthritic activities of Bungarus fasciatus venom (BFV) in experimental animal models. Rheumatoid arthritis was induced by Freund\u2019s complete adjuvant (FCA) in male Wistar albino rats. Lyophilized BFV was diluted in 0.9% NaCl. Antiarthritic activity showed that BFV significantly reduced the paw and ankle diameters; urinary hydroxyproline, glucosamine levels and serum ACP/ALP/TNF-\u03b1/IL-1\u03b2/IL-17/Cathepsin-K/MMP-1 levels. These parameters were significantly increased in FCA induced arthritic animals. Joint histopathology study indicated the partial restoration of joint structure. Treatment with BFV significantly reduced the mean latency time of tail flick response, acetic acid induced writhing response and formalin induced licking response in male albino mice. BFV treatment also significantly reduced carrageenan induced paw edema and xylene induced ear edema in male albino mice. The results indicated that BFV possess antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory and antiarthritic properties and further studies are warranted to find the active constituents present in BFV.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["524"]}

The carrier heating by the intense pump modifies the electron collision frequency and hence the nonlinearity of the medium which in turn reduces the steady state and transient gain of the scattered Brillouin mode. The presence of a strong magnetic field in the transverse direction not only considerably reduces the effects of carrier heating but also lowers the Brillouin threshold and enhances the gain parameters. The results of the present investigation strongly suggest that the incorporation of carrier heating by the pump in the analysis leads to a better understanding of stimulated processes in solid and gaseous plasmas. It also helps considerably in filling the existing gap between theory\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["524"]}

Apparent molecular length in nematics, layer line spacings in smectics, tilt angle in SC, inter molecular distances and orientational order parameters were determined from X-ray diffraction patterns of aligned samples at different temperatures. Temperature variation of the orientational order parameters agree fairly well with Maier-Saupe theory in the nematic phase and with McMillan's theory in the smectic phase with tilt angle correction in SC. Discontinuities of <P2>and <P4>- at SAN in PPOB and at SC -N transitions indicate that the transitions are of the first order.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["524"]}

{"title": "Studies on the storage stability and feasibility of radurization of Indian mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta)\n", "abstract": " Mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta) is one of the commercially important varieties of fish in India, preferred by the consumer in a fresh condition. Due to its short storage life, large portions of the catch are either sun-dried or cured with salt, yielding products that fetch a very low price. The conservation of fresh fish would facilitate better distribution in the interior of the country. Radurization of mackerel offers a potential for extending the shelf-life in ice by a factor of three. A dose of 150 krad was observed to be optimal to enhance the storage life to 25-28 days from 10 -12 days without inducing undesirable changes in the organoleptic attributes. Time-temperature-tolerance (TTT) between 0-20 Degree-Sign C of the radurized and unirradiated mackerel was ascertained with reference to physico-chemical, microbiological and organoleptic parameters. The rate of spoilage of unirradiated mackerel was 3-fold higher than that of radurized samples when the storage temperature did not exceed 5 Degree-Sign C. It was observed that alterations in shear force, water-holding capacity and plasticity index were less in radurized samples, pointing to the retention of textural attributes during the extended storage. The microflora of mackerel during storage revealed that the terminal flora of the unirradiated mackerel were predominantly gram-negative including Pseudomonas and Enterobacteria spp. while that of radurized fish comprised mainly Bacillus and Micrococcus spp. The spores of Bacillus sp. 128 isolated from radurized mackerel were observed to exhibit exceptionally high resistance to both u.v. and gamma radiation.

The SBS gain or SBS threshold in a fiber is highly related to the overlap between the optical and acoustic modes.

By introducing the electric field via the ITO electrodes, the GST layer can be changed between the amorphous and crystalline states. As the modal loss in the crystalline state is much higher than the amorphous state, through a rigorous modal analysis of the coupled silicon nanowire and GST waveguide by using the finite element method, the optimal ITO spacing is obtained at 75nm which is less sensitive to device parameter variations and thus offering better tolerances.

{"title": "Microbe-based strategy for plant nutrient management\n", "abstract": " The rapid industrialization and urbanization of developing countries such as India have encroached on cultivable lands to meet the demands of an ever-increasing population. The altered land use patterns with increased fertilizer use has increased crop yields with leaching of major portion of the applied nutrients from the soil. Nitrates and phosphates are the agricultural pollutants that are discharged into aquifers due to anthropogenic reasons causing severe environmental and health problems. Production of these nutrients requires energy and finite resources (rock phosphate, which has gradually depleting reserves). An alternative management strategy would be to sequester excess nutrients within a biomass that is reused for agriculture. Two discrete enriched microbial consortia with the potential of simultaneous nitrate and phosphate sequestration upon application as biofertilizer restricted them within the plant root zone, ensuring prevention of eutrophication through leaching while making it available for uptake by plants. The nutrient accumulated biomass enhanced the crop yield by 21.88% during mung bean cultivation with maintained elemental content and other nutritional qualities. The major drawback of conventional biofertilizer application (slow release and action) could be overcome using this formulation leading to environmental protection, crop yield enhancement and soil fertility maintenance post-cultivation.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["524"]}

Estimation of the seismic vulnerability of these bridges is a necessary step to identify the associated risk and ensure the safety of lifeline systems. Reinforced concrete (RC) dominates bridge construction around the world (along with prestressed concrete). Corrosion has been identified as a major degrading factor in concrete bridges, which makes these structures more vulnerable to extreme event loads, such as earthquake or wind forces, over their design life. Seismic vulnerability assessment of bridge structures is typically performed through a seismic fragility analysis in the probabilistic domain. For about two decades, researchers have been using this tool to effectively estimate the seismic failure probabilities of bridge structures. More recently, researchers have focused on the seismic fragility estimation for concrete bridges deteriorating primarily due to corrosion. However, most of these studies have not properly dealt with (i) the significant uncertainties in the corrosion process and (ii) the effects of pitting corrosion. The current paper presents a unique framework of seismic fragility estimation of corroded concrete bridges, incorporating a probabilistic treatment of the non-uniform corrosion process and integrating it with the Bayesian updating of the corrosion model based on monitored data (measurements through non-destructive testing). The time-varying seismic fragility of a RC bridge pier is estimated in an illustrative numerical example.

{"title": "Agroforestry for improving soil biological health\n", "abstract": " A single teaspoon of soil has more organisms than the total number of people in this planet. Therefore measuring microbial population and their activity in soil is essential in order to measure the potential of a soil to mineralize nutrients. The rhizosphere is the biologically active zone of soil, where plant roots and microorganisms interact, and is of significant importance for plant performance as well as for nutrient cycling and ecosystem functioning (Singh et al. 2004; Marschner et al. 2004., Bhaduri et al. 2015). The structure of rhizosphere microbial communities is the result of complex interactions between plant genotype and fertilization (Aira et al. 2010).Sometimes it is difficult to quantify their population and analyse the activity as soil organisms are strongly affected by management practices such as cultivation, mulching, irrigation, aeration and ground cover management.

However, this method, like other Monte Carlo methods, incurs a significant computational cost as it requires explicit numerical integration of differential equations to carry out inference. In this paper we propose a novel method for circumventing the requirement of explicit integration by using derivatives of Gaussian processes to smooth the observations from which parameters are estimated. We evaluate our methods using synthetic data generated from model biological systems described by ordinary and delay differential equations. Upon comparing the performance of our method to existing ABC techniques, we demonstrate that it produces comparably reliable parameter estimates at a significantly\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["524"]}

The quest for optimum dose and fractionation schedule in high dose rate (HDR) intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT) is still ongoing. While the American Brachytherapy Society recommends four to eight fractions of each less than 7.5 Gy, there are some studies demonstrating similar efficacy and comparable toxicity with higher doses per fraction. Objective: To assess the treatment efficacy and late complications of HDR ICBT with 9 Gy per fraction in two fractions. Materials and Methods: This is a prospective institutional study in Southern India carried on from  June 2012 to  July 2014. In this period, 76 patients of cervical cancer satisfying our inclusion criteria were treated with concurrent chemo-radiation following ICBT with 9 Gy per fraction in two fractions, five to seven days apart. Results: The median follow-up period in the study was 24 months (range 10.6-31.2 months).

If quantum entanglement can plausibly provide explanation for these, it is then imperative to obtain entanglement entropy in these topologies. In this work, using two different methods, we explicitly show that the entanglement entropy scales as area of the Genus-1 geometry.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["524"]}

{"title": "Radius of electron, magnetic moment and helical motion of the charge of electron\n", "abstract": " Electron was discovered in 1897 by JJ Thomson. After the discovery of electron several models of the electron have been proposed [1],[2]. The proposals are based on the properties of the electron, which are indeed enigmatic. They are roughly divided into three classes, in which the electron is regarded as: a) A strictly point-like particle; b) An actual extended particle; c) An extended-like particle in which the position of the point-like charge is distinct from the particle center-of-mass [2]. As electron is a charged lepton, its properties involve electromagnetic phenomena. Different electromagnetic phenomena revealed eight different radii of electron [3],[4]. The models of electron are also related to the size of the particle or the radii and hence with electromagnetic phenomenon as those different electromagnetic phenomena are the origin of the radii. Relativistic spinning sphere model of electron introduces the spectroscopic way to treat electron model in a semi-classical manner which involves a spherical structure of the particle with tiny charge and mass without violating QED theory [3]. It is noteworthy that the strictly point-like models face the problem with classical formalism and the velocity goes beyond c. Again the extended model in which the charge is glued over the entire body violates QED. Hence the extended body with a point like charge is more approachable. Relativistic spiining sphere model [3] is of that type. Here we are introducing the way to corelate relativistic spinning sphere model with the semi-classical helical motion of charge, which in other words can be said as type of zitterbewegung motion.

Efforts are directed towards optimizing the doping level and magnetic field to achieve maximum Brillouin gain at pump intensities much below the optical damage threshold level.

Changes in the self-diffusion coefficient were reported to be mainly due to alterations of water concentration. MRI diffusion imaging studies were usually performed in vitro on high field systems (1, 2, 3). The main problems in diffusion weighted imaging of articular cartilage, in vivo, are short T2 value of cartilage, necessity of sufficient spatial resolution and undesired motion artifacts induced during diffusion encoding gradient pulses. One shot diffusion imaging sequences successfully solved the problem of motion artifacts but fail to provide sufficient spatial resolution with reasonably short TE for cartilage imaging (4). Objectives of the present study were to develop a diffusion imaging protocol based on pulsed gradient spin echo sequence with a navigator based motion correction and show utility of this protocol for in vivo measurement of articular cartilage on 1.5 T.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["524"]}

{"title": "Quality assessment of radurized Indian mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta)\n", "abstract": " Indian mackerel (Rastreitiger kanaqurta) is one of our commercially important fish varieties, the annual landings being in the order of 100,000 tons. A survey of consumer-acceptance standards has indicated a preference for wet fish in fresh condition. However, owing to an inadequate supply of ice for chilling the fish and extremely poor facilities for transportation and distribution, aggravated by a tropical environment with inherently high microbial contamination risks, a large percentage of mackerel reaches the consumer in a state of putrescence. Prime fish normally does not reach the hinterland and fresh fish is restricted to people in coastal areas. Table 1 indicates that one-half of the mackerel catch is disposed of without icing, and as much as 25% of the catch has to be cured and sun-dried; emphasizing the need for conservation of fresh mackerel for distribution to interior places in the country. Studies during the past few years have revealed that exposure to radurization doses enhances about three-fold the shelf-life in ice of mackerel. The-technological feasibility of this process as well as the stability of radurized mackerel at various storage temperatures has been discussed at the previous two research coordination meetings held at Jakarta and Bombay. The present report pertains to factors influencing the quality-assessment of radurized mackerel stored at 0 and 5 C.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["524"]}

Rapid population growth has further negatively impacted natural resource management and upsetting the socio-ecological balance. Sundarbans, world\u2019s largest contiguous tract of mangroves, is not an exception. It is shared between Bangladesh (60%) and India (40%) but the later is much more populated. Indian Sundarbans (IS) is not only the home of 4.5 million people but also of 85% total Indian mangrove habitat and 1434 faunal species. Agriculture, fishery and Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) from mangroves are their major sources of income. Inhabitants of this climatically vulnerable region are facing the risks of becoming environmental refugees due to land loss by shore line changes. Moreover, storm surges because of cyclones like Aila are becoming more frequent causing sudden heavy intrusion of saline water in the freshwater stock. Further, salt accumulation in soil and water often affect agricultural and aquaculture productions. Climate risks have thus severely affected the livelihoods along with this unique ecosystem. Man-Mangrove Interactions (MMI) in IS is also obstructed by unsustainable exploitation of NTFPs, embankments in mud-flats causing failure of propagules to survive, etc. However, the risks and impacts are not in the same degree in the entire region.

{"title": "30-day mortality following initiation of immunotherapy for advanced stage lung cancer\n", "abstract": " Methods: A retrospective analysis from six UK oncology centres. Inclusion criteria: lung cancer and mesothelioma patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors between January 2014 and September 2017. Data included patient demographics, tumour characteristics, tumour programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression, treatment duration, outcome and mortality. Results: 252 patients were included, mean age 66.5 years, of which 53% were male. 61.1% had adenocarcinomas and 28.2% squamous cell carcinomas. Performance status (PS) was 0\u20131 in 79.4%. 21.8% received Nivolumab, and 77.7% Pembrolizumab. At time of analysis, 41.3% of patients were deceased. 37 patients (14.7%) died within 30 days of starting immunotherapy. Median treatment duration 83 days, and median time from starting immunotherapy to death was 97 days (range 5\u2013756). Death within 30 days of starting immunotherapy did not correlate with age (Mann-Whitney p= 0.9), gender (p= 0.9), line of therapy (p= 0.1), choice immunotherapy agent (p= 0.6), stage of lung cancer (p= 0.9), histology (p= 0.8), level of expression of PD-L1 (p= 0.8) or PS at start of immunotherapy (p= 0.1). Conclusion: Death within 30 days is a significant feature of patients starting immunotherapy, and needs to be taken into consideration when deciding treatment. It is not possible to predict, on the basis of patient demographics, tumour characteristics, or treatment which patient are most at risk of early death.

Considering single trace scalar operators in the boundary theory and using the saddle point analysis of the worldsheet OPE [1], we derive an explicit relation between OPE coefficients in the boundary and worldsheet theories for the contribution of single trace spin  operators to the OPE. We also consider external vector operators and obtain the relation between OPE coefficients for the exchange of single trace scalar operators in the OPE. We revisit the relationship between the bulk cubic couplings in the Supergravity approximation and the OPE coefficients in the dual boundary theory. Our results match with the known examples from the case of AdS/CFT. For the operators whose two and three point correlators enjoy a non renormalization theorem, this gives a set of three way relations between the bulk cubic couplings in supergravity and the OPE coefficients in the boundary and worldsheet theories.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["524"]}

The incidence is on a rise due to advanced imaging techniques. Aims: The objective of the study was to analyse the clinical and demographic profile of patients with brain metastases from primary solid tumors. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective single institutional study covering 130 consecutive patients with brain metastases from January 2007 to August 2014. Results: Some 64.6% of the patients were females. The majority were in the sixth decade of life. The site of the primary tumor was the lungs in 50.8% of the cases. The overall median time from the diagnosis of the primary malignancy to detection of brain metastases was 21.4 months. Survival was found to be significantly improved in patients with solitary brain lesions when compared to patients with multiple brain metastases, and in patients undergoing surgical excision with or without cranial irradiation when compared to whole brain irradiation alone. The majority of the cases belonged to the recursive partitioning analysis class II group. Whole brain radiation therapy was delivered to 79% of the patients. Conclusions: Most of the patients with brain metastases in the study belonged to recursive partitioning analysis classes II or III, and hence had poor prognosis. Most of the patients in the Indian context either do not satisfy the indications for surgical excision or are incapable of bearing the high cost associated with stereotactic radiosurgery. Treatment should be tailored on an individual basis to all these patients.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["524"]}

Recently a free electron laser based on current modulation [1] and a germanium based negative index heterostructure for high speed modulation [2] and modulational instability in optically strained magnetoactive semiconductors [3] have been reported. Modulational instability problems have been deeply studied in the cases of continuous nonlinear models, such as the sine-Gorden and nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation [4, 5], and discrete models [6\u20139]. One of the main effects of modulational instability is the creation of a localized pulse [10], so that the modulational instability may be considered as a leading mechanism for energy localization in a homogeneous nonlinear systems [8, 11, 12]. It is responsible for many physically interesting effects, such as the filamentation of a laser beam, the formation of envelop solitons in nonlinear optical fibers and cavitons in plasmas, as well as the breakup of monochromatic ocean waves. Substantial progress has been made in the description of the elementary excitation of atoms, molecules, and solids and their interactions.

{"title": "The influence of friction force on modified gear teeth and its effect on bearing force\n", "abstract": " Theoretical analysis of vibration of a geared system becomes quite complicated because of the presence of several factors contributing to generation of the excited motions. Some examples are static transmission error (STE), gear tooth flexibility, backlash, friction forces present at the contact surfaces, torsional and flexural rigidity of the shafts on which gears are mounted etc. Considerations of all these factors make a model too complicated to be treated analytically. STE is believed to be chiefly responsible for gear vibration and noise. Consequently, tooth profile modification is employed to minimize dynamic transmission error (DTE) variation and dynamic load. However, high performance gears are still noisy in many applications. One possible explanation is the presence of friction as a noise source. A six degree-of-freedom torsional-translational model is considered to study the effect of friction in the line-of-action (LOA) and off-line-of-action (OLOA) direction under gear tooth modification. An attempt is made to find optimum profile modification for minimum bearing force along LOA and OLOA direction.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["524"]}

Likewise, we aim to study the relationship between Power/Energy, and some attributes obtained from hardware counters and current program (execution time, operations/second, etc). In a previous study, we had used linear regression modeling to estimate power/energy, and found good prediction accuracy, but further diagonistics were required to refine the model [5]. We have taken the non-linear regression approach, because a rigid form of dependence between the dependent and independent variables might result in incorrect estimations for a varied dataset as ours. We perform a 10-fold cross-validation on our dataset to determine the veracity of the models. Average error between measured and predicted values of power and energy were found to be approximately 5% for power and energy, respectively, using just 3 variables as predictors. We have also developed a library (UHPwrLib) to capture the power consumption of our multi-GPU test node, to evaluate statistical predictions with actual empirical results.

{"title": "Improvements of algebraic attacks based on structured gaussian elimination\n", "abstract": " Algebraic attacks are studied as a potential cryptanalytic procedure for various types of ciphers. The XL SGE algorithm has been recently proposed to improve the complexity of the XL attack. XL SGE uses structured Gaussian elimination (SGE) during the expansion phase of XL. In this paper, we establish that XL SGE suffers from some serious drawbacks that impair the effectiveness of SGE-based reduction at all multiplication stages except the first. In order to avoid this problem, we propose several improvements of XL SGE. Our modifications are based upon partial monomial multiplication and handling of columns of weight two. Our modified algorithms have been experimentally verified to be substantially superior to XL SGE.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["524"]}

{"title": "Conservative mandibular resections for oral cavity malignancies: A review\n", "abstract": " The mandible plays an important role in mastication, speech and facial cosmesis. Apart from direct involvement by oral malignancies, the mandible used to be excised in oral cancers due to its proximity to the tumour, for adequate resection margins and for fear of recurrence as cancer was thought to spread via the periosteal lymphatics. However, with better understanding of spread of oral cancers and also the various routes of mandibular involvement, more and more oral cancers are being resected with only a portion of the mandible that is juxtaposed to the tumour. This allows preservation of bony continuity of at least one cortex, which improves cosmetic outcome and provides better function.

The confinement in the y-direction is kept harmonic which ensures that tunneling is allowed only along the x-direction. The harmonic confinement potential is kept fixed and a constant external magnetic field is applied along the z-direction. The growth of probability density in the classically forbidden zones and tunneling current are monitored critically which reveals how tunneling significantly depends on the barrier parameters. The efficacy of the switching function in enforcing adiabaticity of the evolution is demonstrated.

The phenomenon of parametric interaction is treated as a three-wave interaction process, involving second-order nonlinearity of the medium. It is found that the second-order optical susceptibility in ion-implanted semiconductor plasma is modified due to the presence of non-drifting charged colloidal particles. It is interesting to note that the charged colloids modify the dispersion profile, whereas the gain profile is found to be independent of it. The present study also suggests that a proper selection of colloid density will lead to anomalous dispersion, which in turns becomes helpful in the generation of squeezed states.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["524"]}

The addition resulted in higher compressive strength at room temperature (CCS), lower water absorption and saturation coefficient value in the temperature range of 1000-1050 \u00b0C, which may be taken as predictors of durability. Significant improvement in the extent of efflorescence was observed with sodium silicate addition at 1000 \u00b0C and above. The reduction in efflorescence may be attributed to the reduction in overall pore volume as well as to the possible formation of complex salts which are less apt to migrate to the surface. This also had the effect of minimizing the differential structure between surface and interior of the brick.

It is observed that as the number of ply increases, the tenacity, breaking elongation, work of rupture, packing factor and flexural rigidity of untextured yarns improve. Chemical texturization of ply yarn brings about moderate increase in tenacity along with considerable improvement in bulk. However, after texturization, the tenacity, breaking elongation, work of rupture and packing improve while the initial modulus and flexural rigidity are adversely affected with the increase in number of ply. As revealed by the stress relaxation and cyclic loading of ply yarns, the stress decay and permanent set increase with the increase in number of ply at low deformation level, while at high extension level, the stress decay  decreases. In the textured yarn, the stress decay and permanent set are always higher as compared to that of their untextured counterparts.

To combat such rapid urban expansion, the present study attempts a spatio-temporal pattern analysis of urbanization and sprawl in Faridabad, a major industrial, highly urbanized, populated and critically polluted area in Haryana and National Capital Region (NCR) of India which helps the urban planners and decision makers to make development plans with a sustainable approach in that region. Multi-temporal satellite images of Landsat TM/OLI have been used to prepare the land use-land cover map which indicates a significant increase in built-up area and thereby decrease in vegetation cover and open space in Faridabad during the study period of nineteen years. Shannon\u2019s entropy method indicated the dispersion of built-up area resulting urban growth and occurrence of urban sprawl.

However, in most cases it is not possible to maintain the same degree of resilience since the shared memory model is more powerful than the message passing model in this respect.

Pneumonia is mainly caused by bacteria like Klebsiella pneumoniae. Moreover, many of these pathogenic strains are showing acute resistance for many commercially available antibiotics due to its biofilm formation ability. The present study evaluates the antimicrobial activity of Adhatoda vasica Nees. extracts against the biofilms of Klebsiella pneumoniae and their free-living forms. After extraction and phytochemical screening of Adhatoda vasica Nees, the presence of vasicine in extracts was ascertained by thin layer chromatography. The antimicrobial activity for all the extracts and commercially available vasicine against planktonic forms of bacteria were determined using the agar well diffusion method with tetracycline as control. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values were evaluated by a macrobroth dilution technique. The anti-biofilm effects were assessed by microtitre plate method. The cell viability assay was assessed by EtBr/AO staining. Results shows that the A. vasica Nees. leaf extract have remarkable zone of inhibition for Klebsiella pneumoniae as compared to standard vasicine and tetracycline.

In our work, we use Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) as the link-quality metric in a modified version of the of DSR protocol coined as MDSR which takes into consideration the SNR value of a wireless link in addition to the hop count metric to discover new routes. We have extensively used the QUALNET Simulator to evaluate our modified DSR protocol and the results indicate that the MDSR provides high throughput, high packet delivery ratio, reduced end-to-end delay and jitter in comparison to the original DSR protocol. We have compared the performance of DSR and MDSR in two different network topologies with 52 and 92 mobile nodes respectively. In each topology we have considered two cases one using DSR without considering the link SNR values and the other using MDSR on the same topology considering the link SNR values.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["524"]}

Among the liquid organic fuels, methanol or ethanol has shown promising characteristics regarding reactivity at low temperature [4]. In DAFC, the anode side is provided with alcohol, for example methanol (CH3OH) and the cathode side is fed with oxygen or air. In the presence of catalysts, methanol is split into protons and electrons through an oxidation reaction at the anode. Then protons travel across the membrane, and the electrons transfer in an external circuit to the cathode. On the other hand, oxygen combines with protons and electrons to form water through a reduction reaction at the cathode (Figure 1).", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["524"]}

It is confirmed that the valence states of Eu and Fe ions are formally trivalent while that of Ti ions are tetravalent (3d0). The analysis yielded that the tetravalent Ti ions occupy octahedral sites with distorted Oh symmetry which is triggered by the presence of vacant 8a anionic site adjacent to TiO6 octahedra. Further study with Fe doping revealed that it essentially reduces the octahedral distortion by introducing anionic disorder (migration of 48f oxygen ions to 8a site).

We demonstrate application of the theory to three different biomolecular systems, namely, deca-alanine, TBA (thrombin binding aptamer), and a RNA hairpin.

Using guided photons as the probe for detection and measurement, and finally converting the signal magnitude from any domain to an electronic signal is one of the most effective approaches of sensing. Novel and efficient designs of hybrid and composite plasmonic horizontal slot waveguides and dielectric straight slot resonators are proposed and optimised to detect a small refractive index change. Practically, the concentrations of chemical liquid and gas or vapour are often expressed in terms of \u2018grams per litre (g/l)\u2019 and \u2018parts per million (ppm)\u2019, respectively. Thus, device sensitivities related to the detection of those substances may be expressed in amplitude or wavelength shift of the output optical signal per unit g/l or ppm. However, changes in the concentration and the chemical property of any liquid, gas, and chemical vapour result in refractive index variation of those substances. Therefore, we emphasised the detection of the refractive index change which, on the other hand, represents the concentration and/or chemical property change in the testing sample. Design, optimisations, and performance analyses of those waveguides are carried out by a direct divergence modified full-vectorial two-dimensional (2D) finite element method (FV-FEM).

When a document (or another piece of content, eg video) is semantically annotated it becomes a source of information that is easy to interpret for finding important information from it. Here the important thing is to find out female images close to Golden Ratio. Methodology. The primary objective of the proposed methodology is to annotate a set of images from group based photo on semantic analysis of the individual image or images. The annotated or tagged words are confined in respective images. The keywords are encapsulated based on the Euclidian distance between the visually identified feature positions of each individual image. The hidden key (s) are extracted from the input image and the image with the analogous result is displayed to the end user. The annotated tag contains information about the nature of the image. The final step is to find out whether the image or images are close to Golden Ratio for identification of beautifulness of the female images. Results. This is the most important stage of semantic annotation.

During manufacturing process there may have some faulty TSVs. Recovery of these faulty TSVs is necessary for a reliable TSV based system. Use of redundant TSVs to recover faulty TSVs is an attractive solution for repairing faulty TSV. Proper grouping of functional and redundant TSVs and efficient techniques of signal shifting through redundant TSVs can improve the recovery rate of faulty TSVs. In this paper, we propose a methodology to make connection between functional TSVs and redundant TSVs for re-route the signal using multiplexers (MUXs) in such a way that required number of MUXs will be minimum and dependency will be maximum.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["524"]}

We develop a tight-binding model of the heterostructure adopting a minimal interfacial hybridization scheme that promotes induced magnetic exchange on the topological surface states, as well as induced Rashba-like spin-orbit coupling in the ferromagnet. Therefore, our model accounts for spin Hall effect from bulk states together with inverse spin galvanic and magnetoelectric effects at the interface on equal footing. By varying the transport energy across the band structure, we uncover a crossover from surface-dominated to bulk-dominated transport regimes. We show that the spin density profile and the nature of the spin-orbit torques differ substantially in both regimes. Our results, which compare favorably with experimental observations, demonstrate that the large damping torque reported recently is more likely attributed to interfacial magnetoelectric effect, while spin Hall torque remains small even in the bulk-dominated regime.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["524"]}
{"title": "News Analytics for Global Infectious Disease Surveillance\n", "abstract": " Traditional disease surveillance can be augmented with a wide variety of open sources, such as online news media, twitter, blogs, and web search records. Rapidly increasing volumes of these open sources are proving to be extremely valuable resources in helping analyze, detect, and forecast outbreaks of infectious diseases, especially new diseases or diseases spreading to new regions. However, these sources are in general unstructured (noisy) and construction of surveillance tools ranging from real-time disease outbreak monitoring to construction of epidemiological line lists involves considerable human supervision. Intelligent modeling of such sources using text mining methods such as, topic models, deep learning and dependency parsing can lead to automated generation of the mentioned surveillance tools. Moreover, realtime global availability of these open sources from web-based bio-surveillance systems, such as HealthMap and WHO Disease Outbreak News (DONs) can aid in development of generic tools which will be applicable to a wide range of diseases (rare, endemic and emerging) across different regions of the world.  In this dissertation, we explore various methods of using internet news reports to develop generic surveillance tools which can supplement traditional surveillance systems and aid in early detection of outbreaks. We primarily investigate three major problems related to infectious disease surveillance as follows.

This study recognizes (1) the role of grain self\u2010-sufficiency to reduce dependency on international market volatility,(2) the need to ensure that food and agricultural sectors arefree from free\u2010trade negotiations and (3) the urgency for a comprehensive adoption of sustainable intensification methods to ensure long\u2010term food and nutrition security. A conceptual framework has also been developed showing how the core outcomes of self\u2010sufficiency can create the basic preconditions for sustainability in agriculture. Despite rigorous academic debates of the tension between food self\u2010sufficiency and food trade to mitigate global hunger, the question \u2018To be or not to be self\u2010sufficient?\u2019remains far from answered.

The levels of serum trace minerals (Cu, Zn, Fe and Mn) were estimated by atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Data on hormonal and serum mineral profiles of sheep and goat were partitioned and subjected to statistical test of significance by Student\u2019s t-test (Snedecor and Cocharan 1994) at 5% and 1% levels by using STATISTICA software package. Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient was calculated for determination of the relationship between hormone and serum trace mineral values before and after trace mineral supplementation to animals.Averages of serum trace minerals before and after mineral supplementation are given in Tables 1, 2 for Black Bengal goat and Garole sheep. Serum trace mineral concentration was significantly (P< 0.01) increased after supplementary feeding of trace mineral mixture for 15 days in goat breed, except Mn. Similarly in sheep breed, trace mineral concentration of serum after supplementary feeding differs significantly (P< 0.01) than that of without supplementary feeding regime except Fe. This clearly showed that supplementary trace mineral feeding for short duration on goat and sheep has positive influence on serum trace mineral concentration. Similar results were also reported by various authors across different regions of the globe (Smith and Akinbamijo 2000, Erdogan et al. 2002). Serum concentrations of most micronutrients increased significantly in both goat and sheep, significant (P< 0.01)", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["524"]}

The scope of the present research project is to investigate the instabilities in porous channel flow by means of local linear stability analysis in order to elucidate their physical origin and underlying mechanisms. The numerical approach for the problem consists of framing an eigenvalue problem using primitive variable approach to model the porous channel flows. The Volume Averaged Navier-Stokes (VANS) equations are used for modeling the flow through a porous channel with a porosity distribution function varying along the wall-normal direction separating the homogeneous fluid region and the homogeneous porous region by an interface region with smooth transition of porosity. The linearized VANS equations are discretized using 4th order dispersion-relation preserving finite-differences schemes, in order to reduce the computational resources in terms of memory and time. The modal stability analysis is performed to identify the linearly unstable region based on the critical flow parameters (critical Reynolds number and critical wavenumber). Reynold-Orr analysis is carried out to identify the contribution of different terms of the perturbation kinetic energy in the flow. A scaling approach is done to identify and distinguish between the different physical mechanisms governing the instabilities in the flow at different ranges of porosity.

This activation leads to release of a large pool of cytokines from the activated lymphocytes and macrophages.

Five out of the above eight features are required for the diagnosis. There are 2 variants of HLH, primary HLH; where the defect in the immune system is hereditary and secondary HLH; where it is caused by other secondary diseases such as infections, hematological malignancies, autoimmune and auto-inflammatory diseases. In this article, we have reported a case of HLH, which was secondary to disseminated tuberculosis. There are only few case reports of HLH secondary to disseminated tuberculosis. Mortality may be as high as 50%. Although tuberculosis has various manifestations, our patient presented with fever, skin rash, cytopenias, splenomegaly, and very high ferritin.

The first known case of human arthritis date back as far as 4500 BC in the fossils of Native Americans, found in Tennessee, USA. The ancient classic Ayurvedic text has described painful deforming polyarthritis called \u201camavata\u201d and \u201csandhighatvata\u201d that bears resemblance to rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory arthritis [1]. Arthritis has been mentioned in the ancient Hindu and Greek mythology [2]. The first written reference on arthritis was found in the Indian holistic book Charaka Samhita where it has been described as swollen painful joints, initially occurring in hands, feet, causing loss of appetite and occasionally related with fever [3]. The history of arthritis has been marked with a continuous search for better therapy, less toxicity and a reasonable cost. To understand the magnitude of the problem of rheumatic disorders, several strategies have been launched by American College of Rheumatology [4]. It has been found that soft tissue rheumatism and osteoarthritic disorders were the commonest community ailments. Inflammatory arthritic disorders including rheumatoid arthritis are less than 10% in the community, whereas osteoarthritis is the most predominant one. Although there are hundred types of arthritic conditions which could be classified under three major categories: rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and gouty arthritis.

In this paper, we consider boundary solutions under nonignorable nonresponse models in two-way incomplete tables with data on both variables missing. We establish a result similar to Park {\\it et al.} (2014) on sufficient conditions for the occurrence of boundary solutions. We also provide a new result, which connects the forms of boundary solutions under various parameterizations of the missing data models. This result helps us to obtain the exact form of boundary solutions in the above tables, which improves a claim made in Baker {\\it et al.} (1992) and avoids computational burden. A counterexample is provided to show that the sufficient conditions for the occurrence of boundary solutions are not necessary, thereby disproving a conjecture of Kim and Park (2014). Finally, we establish new necessary conditions for the occurrence of boundary solutions under nonignorable nonresponse models in square two-way incomplete tables, and show that they are not sufficient.

Several renewable energy technologies have found wide acceptance and deployment in the developed as well as the developing nations. Apart from solar PV, biomass based energy systems have gained much popularity, particularly in the developing economies, where unavailability of grid electricity in remote and rural areas paved the way for wide deployment of biomass based energy systems. This paper focuses on two novel and high-efficiency biomass gasification based conceptualized combined cycle plants that offer promising performance. Biomass gasification, when integrated to combined cycles, offers high efficiency compared to the conventional biomass based gas engines. An indirectly heated GT cycle has been considered in the topping cycle, while in the bottoming cycle both Steam Rankine cycle (SRC) has been considered in one configuration and Organic Rankine cycle (ORC) has been considered for the other. The study reveals that high overall efficiency is achievable in such combined cycle systems.

In past the city have unnaturally shaken several times due to far and near source earthquakes and raised a serious question against safety of the city. Tollygunge is the heart of South Kolkata City. In the present study seismic hazard analysis at bedrock level of Tollygunge area has been carried out considering all seven seismogenic sources around Kolkata and Maximum Considerable Earthquake (MCE) has been determined using stochastic simulation software SMSIM. The MCE can occur due to Eocene Hinge Zone (EHZ), situated beneath this area and capable to cause 6.2 magnitude of earthquake. IS 1893 (Part-1): 2002 for hard soil response spectrum compatible time histories has been generated at bedrock level by the software WAVEGEN. In order to find out site soil amplification of Tollygunge, 1 D seismic wave propagation software SHAKE 2000 has been used and ground motion at bedrock has been transformed to surface level. The present study indicates that the amplitude ground motion will amplify due to presence of soft thick river channel deposit of the area. Finally a comparison has been made with the generated site specific response spectra of this area and IS 1893 (Part-1): 2002 zone III response spectra. Present study clearly reveals that if the buildings in that region are designed according to Indian codal response spectra, it may undergo damage during MCE.Kolkata has grown in north-south direction along the River Hooghly towards the eastern bank.

An empirical formula based on phenomenological model is used to determine the maximum possible plasma density in terms of density of state mass in the medium which is used in deriving third order susceptibility using coupled mode scheme and hydrodynamical model. Extensive numerical estimates have been performed to appreciate the DOS dependency of OPC process in InSb, CdS and GaAs crystals shined by119 m \u03bc pulsed OH2 laser at 300K. Threshold value of pump electric field, the possibility of optical phase conjugation and the corresponding interaction length is to be premeditated. The maximum possible plasma density is found to be highest in CdS and lowest in InSb crystals. Hence the analysis reveals that higher the density of state mass lower is the interaction length. CdS is found to be most appropriate host for the (OPC-SBS) process with highest gain coefficient and with lower interaction length. On the other hand if the crystal is used as an optical waveguide with relatively large interaction length then InSb proves its potential in practical applications such as fabrication of phase conjugate mirrors.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["524"]}

We agree with his view on noradrenaline and terlipressin therapy in hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). It would have been ideal to compare the two vasopressors if given as infusion and dose monitored by mean arterial pressure. However, terlipressin has been used as bolus therapy in most of the studies [1]. Gerbes et al.[2] treated 32 consecutive patients with HRS with continuous terlipressin infusion and reported reversal of HRS in 42% of patients in a retrospective study. They concluded that continuous terlipressin infusion may achieve response rates comparable with those of bolus administration, but possibly at a lower daily dose (3 mg) and with less severe complications (9%). In our study also, dose, adverse effects, and response rates with bolus administration were comparable. However, more studies focusing specifically on this aspect are needed to answer this\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["524"]}

Previous results used a 3D MHD spectral code to show that, individually, neither two-dimensional (2D) nor slab-wave components will turn their wave vectors in a turning Parker-like field, and that nonlinear interactions between the components are required to reproduce observations. In these new simulations we consider a variety of initial MHD states and examine the direction of minimum variance with respect to the mean magnetic field and the ratio of maximum-to-minimum variance of the fluctuating magnetic field as the large-scale magnetic field slowly changes from a field-aligned flow\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["524"]}

{"title": "A General Purpose Simulator For Network-on-chips\n", "abstract": " As a New paradigm for implementing communication among the system components embedded in a single chip, Network-on-Chip (NoC) has gained considerable attention over the last few years. Increasing integration produces a situation where bus structure, which is commonly used in System-on-chips (SoC), becomes blocked and increased capacitance poses physical problems. As such, there has been an increased need for defining and developing simulation software for carrying out simulation of NoC architectures. In this paper, we present a NoC simulator, a systemC based general-purpose network simulator for NoC, which is built upon the object-oriented modular design of the NoC architecture components. Here we demonstrate the use of our proposed simulator by simulating several existing well-known architectures.

{"title": "Frequency modulation in Direct Band gap Semiconductors: Band structure and Density of state mass effects\n", "abstract": " The frequency modulation has been investigated analytically in direct gap semiconductors including band structure (BS) and carrier heating (CH) effects. In order to include BS effects, an approach has been deviced in which firstly an expression for carrier temperature using energy balance equation is derived. Then this carrier temperature is used in an empirical formula based on phenomenological model to determine the maximum possible plasma density in the medium. Extensive numerical estimates have been performed to appreciate the BS effects on modulation process in InSb, CdS and GaAs crystals using2 CO laser of frequency THz 6.1 at 300K. Efforts are made to find out conditions for achieving lower absorption coefficient with lower power input and also to find out most suitable material among the three semiconductors. Suffice it to say that due to the effect of density of state mass (DOS) the plasma frequency increases due to which absorption coefficient can get strongly modulated, leading to the frequency modulation in the direct gap semiconductors. Above fact can be successfully used in the fabrication of optical fibers and can have a profound effect on long distance communications. Above results based on DOS effects are also applicable in band structure engeenering for tunable devices.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["524"]}

For an efficient solution, the algorithm imposes a hard constraint that each segment is modelled by a single latent component. The hard constraint facilitates the solution of ML boundary estimation using dynamic programming. The PLCS framework does not impose a parametric assumption unlike earlier ML segmentation techniques.

For encrypting secret message the authors have used new algorithm called MSA proposed by Nath et al (1). For hiding secret message the method used was proposed by Nath et al (2). In MSA (1) method the authors have introduced a new randomization method for generating the randomized key matrix which contains all 256 characters in 16 X 16 matrix to encrypt plain text file and to decrypt cipher text file. To make the encryption and the decryption process totally secured the authors have introduced multiple encryption and multiple decryption methods. MSA method is totally dependent on the random text_key which is to be supplied by the user. The maximum length of the text_key can be of 16 characters long and it may contain any character (ASCII code 0 to 255). From the given text-key one can calculate the randomization number and the encryption number using an algorithm proposed by Nath et. al (1). The different key matrices can be formed is 256! and which is quite large and hence if someone applies the brute force method then he/she has to give trail for 256! times which is quite absurd. Moreover the multiple encryption method makes the system further secured. To hide encrypted secret message in the cover file the suthors have inserted in the 4-th bit of each character of encrypted message file in 8 consecutive bytes of the cover file.

This year\u2019s Nobel Prize in Chemistry (2009) was shared by three scientists Venkataraman Ramakrishnan, Thomas A. Steitz and Ada E. Yonath. They have shown what the ribosome looks like and how it functions at the atomic level. The Swedish Academy of Sciences agreed to bestow this honour of their research work on understanding the central dogma of protein synthesis. Using X-ray crystallography they established the 3D structure of protein synthesis machinery ie Ribosome. The ribosome reads the information from the mRNA and translates it into long chains of amino acids (polypeptide) and these molecules form proteins of various complex functions depending on its post-translational modifications. The trilogy of Nobel prizes regarding the central dogma, started with James Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins elucidating, the atomic model of the double stranded DNA molecules in 1962. DNA is present in every cell of all organisms except for retro-viruses, even it is considered as the blueprint of life. As the activity of any process in cellular functions finally depends on proteins, in recent science, transcription and translation processes are considered more important than replication. Thus the work of Roger D. Kornberg on RNA synthesis in 2006 is also an important milestone.

This research note purposes to provide a critical understanding of the various policy issues and implementation methods that have arisen from and out of the disinvestment/privatization process in India since the economic reforms began in 1991. In doing so, it also aims to bridge a critical gap in the reforms policy literature in this area. The key issues that are raised in this paper are as follows: (a) the policy basis for the disinvestment/privatization of state-owned enterprises in the reforms period in India; (b) the methods chosen for such; and (c) the limitations and constraints of the implementation of such policy.

The consequent steady-state amplification characteristics of the modulated waves are also reported. Using coupled mode theory, the effect of excess carriers diffusion on the threshold field and gain profile of the modulated wave is extensively studied. The origin of this interaction is assumed to lie in the induced non-linear diffusion current density of the medium. By considering the modulation process as a four-wave parametric interaction, an expression for effective cubic susceptibility describing the phenomenon is deduced. The modulation is greatly modified by propagation characteristics such as dispersion and diffraction due to dielectric relaxation of acoustic mode\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["524"]}

{"title": "Traffic-Aware Design Methodology for High-speed Backbone Networks using WDM Technology\n", "abstract": " Abstract\u2212 High-speed backbone networks play a significant role in interconnecting the lower level access networks employing wired as well as wireless technologies. Such backbone networks, with ever-increasing demand for bandwidth need to apply high speed transmission (Terabits/sec) mostly using optical fibres along with wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology. The problem of logical topology design and traffic routing for wavelength-routed optical networks has been investigated extensively in the past using different heuristic approaches. However, these methodologies are in general carried out for a given traffic matrix and their performance depends on the nature of traffic distribution amongst various node pairs. Thus, these methodologies may not perform equally well for networks with different traffic distributions. In the present work, we present some novel design methodologies that compute the lightpath demand between each node pair based on the traffic distribution along with the nodal transceiver demand in proportion with the nodal traffic intensity. These approaches lead to traffic-aware lightpath topology designs which offer better performance (reduced congestion) as compared to the existing techniques for different traffic distributions.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["524"]}

{"title": "Mars water abundance: An estimate from D/H ratio in SNC meteorites\n", "abstract": " Recent measurements of water composition in SNC meteorites have shown a high and variable deuterium to hydrogen (D/H) ratio. The highest D/H value is nearly equal to the present\u2010day value in the Mars atmosphere. This indicates that between 1.3 billion years (Gyr) ago and 180 million years (Myr) ago the Martian atmosphere may have attained the same D/H ratio as it has now. This also provides evidence for an interaction process involving water operating between atmosphere, regolith, and rocks in SNC meteorites. In this paper we have calculated the amount of water at present and at 4.5 Ga via the D/H fractionation process, assuming that water is lost to space as well as to the surface. A surface flux smaller than \u223c 108 cm\u22122 s\u22121 operating over the life history of the planet will not have any influence on the size of the fractionated water reservoir.

Autonomy implies some degree of independence, and when a system's ability to achieve its mission is independent of how it is initialized, the system is self-stabilizing. Application of self-stabilization to system and network components is motivated by core concerns of fault-tolerance in distributed systems. Self-stabilization is a solution to problems of transient memory faults and systems with dynamic reconfigurations. Research in self-stabilization explores many of the classic themes of distributed computing (distributed graph algorithms, mutual exclusion, distributed agreement). Recent papers combine self-stabilization with traditional forms of fault-tolerance, consider methodological issues for the design of self-stabilizing systems, investigate randomized techniques, and apply stabilization to new networking models. The workshop brings together concerns from theory and practice of self-stabilization.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["524"]}

Thick ionopauses are formed in the region between 200 and 400 km and here the electron density decreases with a scale height of about 20 km. Further, these regions get permeated by strong horizontal magnetic fields. However, during conditions of low Psw, the \u201ctop\u201d of the ionosphere moves to higher altitudes and the region between 200 and 400 km is nearly free of magnetic fields. This region then forms a part of the \u201cmain\u201d ionosphere, where electron density decreases with a scale height of about 200 km.

A dc electric bias is applied to assist pump wave in transferring electrons from the lower conduction valley to upper satellite valleys in n-GaAs, ie in increasing the effective mass of electrons. The nonlinearity arises through the energy dependence of the effective mass and the piezoelectric nature of the sample. It is found that the energy dependence of the mass in the negative differential resistivity region is responsible for induction of fourth-order nonlinearity in the sample. It is also found that the negative differential resistivity region in n-GaAs has a great influence on the nonlinear optical parameters of the sample.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["524"]}

When particle losses from the drifting flux tube into the ionosphere are neglected, this behaviour is adiabatic in a thermodynamic sense. For a population of particles with an isotropic pitch-angle distribution, the generalization of that system of equations is obtained by adding radial and azimuthal spatial diffusion terms. The magnetic field is taken to be dipolar in the inner magnetosphere. The potential electric field is assumed to consist of magnetospheric convection and corotation components. Experimental data are used to estimate the radial equatorial profiles of the plasma sheet pressure.

We consider here the full advection-diffusion problem, though attention is restricted to the case of small scalar diffusion, or large Peclet number. In this regime, a certain one-dimensional unstable manifold is shown to be the dominant organizing structure in the distribution of the passive scalar. In general, it is found that the chaotic structures in the flow strongly influence the scalar distribution while, in contrast, the flux of passive scalar from the localized active no-slip surface is, to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["524"]}

Partitioning of 203Hg occurs in a species specific manner with higher levels recorded in the brain and gonad of white rat.

The enzyme characteristics such as substrate and temperature optima were more or less similar while pH requirement for optimum AChE activity varied from 7.0 to 7.6 In vitro inhibition of head and body AChE was studied using pure and commercial anticholinesterase compounds. Interestingly, the commercial formulations like Metacid-50 and Carbaryl are potent enough at 1 x 10 (-8) M to produce 50% in vitro inhibition of AChE of head and body regions within 15 min of preincubation. A 20 min of preincubation (t0. 5) was necessary to record 50% in vitro inhibition of AChE with known and pure anticholinesterase compounds such as DFP (3.5 x 10 (-10) M) and physostigmine (3.6 x 10 (-10) M). It is surmised that (a) the response of the head and body AChE to the commercial formulations of the insecticides may be used as a reliable and sensitive bioindicator of pesticidal contamination of the terrestrial environment and (b) termite control may be successfully done with the application of organophosphate or carbamate compounds.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["524"]}

{"title": "Effect of Magnetostatic Field on the Stimulated Raman Scattering of Transversely Polarized Electromagnetic Waves and Raman Instability in Semiconductor Plasmas\n", "abstract": " The stimulated Raman scattering of a large amplitude transversely polarized electromagnetic pump wave from both, the electron plasma wave and the molecular vibrations produced at a frequency equal to that of transverse optical phonon, is investigated in an n\u2010type semiconductor plasma. The general dispersion relation is obtained considering only the Stokes' component of the scattered electromagnetic wave in the presence of a large magnetostatic field applied at an arbitrary angle to the direction of propagation of the pump wave. The analysis is applied to both the cases of isotropic (B0 = 0) and magnetoactive (B0 \u00b1 0) plasmas. The threshold electric field necessary for the onset of Raman instability and the growth rate of the unstable mode well above the threshold is studied. It is concluded that the threshold pump amplitude as well as the growth rate have strong dependence on the orientation of the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["524"]}
{"title": "Gas production by accelerated in situ bioleaching of landfills\n", "abstract": " A process for improved gas production and accelerated stabilization of landfills by accelerated in situ bioleaching of organic wastes by acid forming bacteria in substantially sealed landfills, passing the leachate of hydrolysis and liquefaction products of microbial action of the microorganisms with the organic material to an acid phase digester to regenerate the activated culture of acid forming microorganisms for recirculation to the landfill, passing the supernatant from the acid phase digester to a methane phase digester operated under conditions to produce methane rich gas. The supernatant from the methane phase digester containing nutrients for the acid forming microorganisms and added sewage sludge or other desired nutrient materials are circulated through the landfill. Low Btu gas is withdrawn from the acid phase digester while high Btu gas is withdrawn from the methane phase digester and may be upgraded for use as SNG. The process of this invention is applicable to small as well as large organic waste landfills, provides simultaneous disposal of municipal solid waste and sewage sludge or other aqueous organic waste in a landfill which may be stabilized much more quickly than an uncontrolled landfill as presently utilized.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["524"]}
{"title": "Extended Deformable Shell Model Calculation of the Lattice Statics and Dynamics of LiH and LiD Crystals\n", "abstract": " An attempt is made for a unified study of the lattice statics and dynamics of the LiH\u2013LiD crystals. So far it has not been possible to obtain a unified description of the different properties of this crystal on the basis of a single model and with a single set of model parameters. All the previous calculations suffer from this inadequacy and their results show that there are certain problems regarding the stability of the static lattice structure, the cohesive energy, and a consistent description of the dielectric properties and the dispersion of phonons for this crystal. The present calculation based on the extended deformable shell model removes the earlier difficulties and provides a good overall description of the lattice mechanical properties of this crystal with a single set of parameters. Another salient feature of the present investigation is to indicate the effect of the quadrupolar distortion of the charge cloud, in particular, of the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["524"]}

But if gradients are present in the medium, it will become necessary to consider the spatial dependence of z because of its explicit dependence on temperature. Recently, Chandra and Verma/4/have analysed the effect of the spatial dependence of z on the propagation of the longitudinal mode. The object of this note, therefore, is the analytical study of the effect of the spatial dependence of z on the hybrid mode propagation. We consider a solid-state plasma which is subjected to the density gradient an/ax, temperature gradient aTo,/a x, magnetic field 6 (along the z-axis), and an electromagnetic wave (along the y-axis).", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["524"]}

{"title": "Some Characteristics of Submerged Horizontal Diffused Jet Over an Erodible Bed\n", "abstract": " Many local erosion problems are the result of fluid jets diffusing into a larger body of slower moving fluids. Particularly interesting is the case of erosion due to a submerged horizontal jet issuing out of a sluice gate and then flowing over a partly solid apron to a mobile bed. The rate at which erosion occurs in such situations is needed to formulate suitable scale model laws. This paper was concerned with the findings of an experimental investigation carried out to evaluate hydraulic parameters for such a computation. Equations governing the diffusion process, the velocity distribution law within the boundary layer, and the expression for the growth of the boundary layer thickness with distance for the rigid bed apron as well as for the mobile sand bed were derived based on experimental findings. It was observed that there exists a transition region of the boundary layer growth as it crosses from rigid bed apron to mobile\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["524"]}

{"title": "The 3\u2032 UTR Landscape in Cancer\n", "abstract": " Oncogenesis is tightly connected with dysregulated gene expression. Alterations occur at many levels, including in posttranscriptional regulatory elements that control the stability, cellular localisation or translation efficiency of messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs). These elements are located primarily in the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs. Multiple examples are known of oncogenes whose activity and function become altered owing to changes in their 3\u2032 UTRs. Strikingly, recent studies have uncovered global changes of 3\u2032 UTRs in cancers, going beyond individual genes. Cancer cells express transcripts with systematically shorter 3\u2032 UTRs compared to normal cells. The implications of these changes for cellular biology are poorly understood, but high-throughput approaches are being developed to uncover the regulators, targets and impact of 3\u2032 UTR-based regulation.

{"title": "A Real-Time Face Motion Based Approach towards Modeling Socially Assistive Wireless Robot Control with Voice Recognition\n", "abstract": " The robotics domain has a couple of specific general design requirements which requires the close integration of planning, sensing, control and modeling and for sure the robot must take into account the interactions between itself, its task and its environment surrounding it. Thus considering the fundamental configurations, the main motive is to design a system with user-friendly interfaces that possess the ability to control embedded robotic systems by natural means. While earlier works have focused primarily on issues such as manipulation and navigation only, this proposal presents a conceptual and intuitive approach towards man-machine interaction in order to provide a secured live biometric logical authorization to the user access, while making an intelligent interaction with the control station to navigate advanced gesture controlled wireless Robotic prototypes or mobile surveillance systems along desired directions through required displacements. The intuitions are based on tracking real-time 3-Dimensional Face Motions using skin tone segmentation and maximum area considerations of segmented face-like blobs, Or directing the system with voice commands using real-time speech recognition. The system implementation requires designing a user interface to communicate between the Control station and prototypes wirelessly, either by accessing the internet over an encrypted Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) via a HTML web page for communicating with face motions or with the help of natural voice commands like \u201cTrace 5 squares\u201d,\u201cTrace 10 triangles\u201d,\u201cMove 10 meters\u201d, etc. evaluated on an iRobot Create over Bluetooth connectivity using\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["524"]}
