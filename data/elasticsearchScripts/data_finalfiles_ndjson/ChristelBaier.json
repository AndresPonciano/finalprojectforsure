For applications where errors might be expensive and lead to dangerous or even catastrophal situations a precise analysis of the possible system behaviours is an important task. The quality of a parallel system depends on several properties, typically classi ed into safety properties which state that\\nothing bad happens\"(eg mutual exclusion, deadlock freedom or the computation of su ciently exact numerical values) and liveness or progress properties which assert that\\something good will eventually happen\"(eg termination, starvation freedom) OwLa82]. In realistic applications, not only the functionality of a parallel system is important, also quantitative aspects (such as time or probabilities) play a crucial role. For instance, in practice, it is useless to establish a property like\\each request will eventually be answered\" as there is no bound on how much time will pass between a request and the response. Typically, one aims at a property like\\each request will eventually be answered within the next 5 seconds\". Whether or not a property of this type can be established not only depends on the design of the system but also on the reliability of the interface with the environment or the resources that the system uses. For instance, if the response is transmitted via an uncertain medium that might loose messages a property as above can never hold. However, the cases where a physical error happens might be rare.

While the standard ATL modality states the existence of a strategy for a certain coalition of agents without restricting the range of strategies for the semantics of inner SGL formulae, we deal with a more general modality.

{"title": "Decision making improves sperm chemotaxis in the presence of noise\n", "abstract": " To navigate their surroundings, cells rely on sensory input that is corrupted by noise. In cells performing chemotaxis, such noise arises from the stochastic binding of signalling molecules at low chemoattractant concentrations. We reveal a fundamental relationship between the speed of chemotactic steering and the strength of directional fluctuations that result from the amplification of noise in a chemical input signal. This relation implies a trade-off between steering that is slow and reliable, and steering that is fast but less reliable. We show that dynamic switching between these two modes of steering can substantially increase the probability to find a target, such as an egg to be found by sperm cells. This decision making confers no advantage in the absence of noise, but is beneficial when chemical signals are detectable, yet characterized by low signal-to-noise ratios. The latter applies at intermediate distances from a target, where signalling molecules are diluted, thus defining a \u2018noise zone\u2019 that cells have to cross. Our results explain decision making observed in recent experiments on sea urchin sperm chemotaxis.

The optimization problems under consideration are two non-classical variants of the stochastic shortest path problem (SSPP) in terms of expected partial or conditional accumulated weights, the optimization of the conditional value-at-risk for accumulated weights, and two problems addressing the long-run satisfaction of path properties, namely the optimization of long-run probabilities of regular co-safety properties and the model-checking problem of the logic frequency-LTL. To prove the Positivity- and hence Skolem-hardness for the latter two problems, a new auxiliary path measure, called weighted long-run frequency, is introduced and the Positivity-hardness of the corresponding decision problem is shown as an intermediate step. For the partial and conditional SSPP on MDPs with non-negative weights and for the optimization of long-run probabilities of constrained reachability properties (a U b), solutions are known that rely on the identification of a bound on the accumulated weight or the number of consecutive visits to certain sates, called a saturation point, from which on optimal schedulers behave memorylessly.

The purpose of the paper is to illustrate the general feasibility of an alternative approach using probabilistic model checking for families of systems that are obtained by varying, e.g., the hardware-software\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1617"]}
{"title": "Preface to the special issue on probabilistic model checking\n", "abstract": " As guest editors, we are delighted to introduce this special issue devoted to Probabilistic Model Checking to the wider readership. Probabilistic modelling dates back to the work of Markov in early 1900s, and over the years has established itself as a fundamental methodology in science and technology, with numerous applications across several domains. Markovian models feature in probabilistic programming; wireless communication, anonymity and security protocols; performance, reliability and dependability analysis; robotics and planning; scheduling and optimisation; predictive modelling of biological systems; population models of epidemic spread; and techniques such as page ranking of search engines. Probabilistic model checking aims to achieve automated analysis of probabilistic models against specifications given in temporal logic, and involves an intricate combination of conventional model checking\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1617"]}
{"title": "Causality-Based Game Solving\n", "abstract": " We present a causality-based algorithm for solving two-player reachability games represented by logical constraints. These games are a useful formalism to model a wide array of problems arising, e.g., in program synthesis. Our technique for solving these games is based on the notion of subgoals, which are slices of the game that the reachability player necessarily needs to pass through in order to reach the goal. We use Craig interpolation to identify these necessary sets of moves and recursively slice the game along these subgoals. Our approach allows us to infer winning strategies that are structured along the subgoals. If the game is won by the reachability player, this is a strategy that progresses through the subgoals towards the final goal; if the game is won by the safety player, it is a permissive strategy that completely avoids a single subgoal. We evaluate our prototype implementation on a range of different games. On multiple benchmark families, our prototype scales dramatically better than previously available tools.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1617"]}
{"title": "Probabilistic causes in Markov chains\n", "abstract": " The paper studies a probabilistic notion of causes in Markov chains that relies on the counterfactuality principle and the probability-raising property. This notion is motivated by the use of causes for monitoring purposes where the aim is to detect faulty or undesired behaviours before they actually occur. A cause is a set of finite executions of the system after which the probability of the effect exceeds a given threshold. We introduce multiple types of costs that capture the consumption of resources from different perspectives, and study the complexity of computing cost-minimal causes.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1617"]}
{"title": "Responsibility and verification: Importance value in temporal logics\n", "abstract": " We aim at measuring the influence of the nondeterministic choices of a part of a system on its ability to satisfy a specification. For this purpose, we apply the concept of Shapley values to verification as a means to evaluate how important a part of a system is. The importance of a component is measured by giving its control to an adversary, alone or along with other components, and testing whether the system can still fulfill the specification. We study this idea in the framework of model-checking with various classical types of linear-time specification, and propose several ways to transpose it to branching ones. We also provide tight complexity bounds in almost every case.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1617"]}

{"title": "Iterative variable reordering: Taming huge system families\n", "abstract": " For the verification of systems using model-checking techniques, symbolic representations based on binary decision diagrams (BDDs) often help to tackle the well-known state-space explosion problem. Symbolic BDD-based representations have been also shown to be successful for the analysis of families of systems that arise, e.g., through configurable parameters or following the feature-oriented modeling approach. The state space of such system families face an additional exponential blowup in the number of parameters or features. It is well known that the order of variables in ordered BDDs is crucial for the size of the model representation. Especially for automatically generated models from real-world systems, family models might even be not constructible due to bad variable orders. In this paper we describe a technique, called iterative variable reordering, that can enable the construction of large-scale family models. We exemplify feasibility of our approach by means of an aircraft velocity control system with redundancy mechanisms modeled in the input language of the probabilistic model checker PRISM. We show that standard reordering and dynamic reordering techniques fail to construct the family model due to memory and time constraints, respectively, while the new iterative approach succeeds to generate a symbolic family model.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1617"]}
{"title": "Quantitative analysis of communication scenarios\n", "abstract": " Message sequence charts (MSCs) and their higher-order formalism in terms of message sequence graphs (MSGs) provide an intuitive way to describe communication scenarios. Naturally, quantitative aspects such as the probability of failure, maximal latency or the expected energy consumption play a crucial role for communication systems. In this paper, we introduce quantitative MSGs with costs or rewards and stochastic timing information in terms of rates. To perform a quantitative analysis, we propose a branching-time semantics for MSGs as possibly infinite continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) interpreting delayed choice on the partial-order semantics of MSGs. Whereas for locally synchronized MSGs a finite-state bisimulation quotient can be found and thus, standard algorithms for CTMCs can be applied, this is not the case in general. However, using a truncation-based approach we show how\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1617"]}
{"title": "On model checking techniques for randomized distributed systems\n", "abstract": " The automata-based model checking approach for randomized distributed systems relies on an operational interleaving semantics of the system by means of a Markov decision process and a formalization of the desired event E by an \u03c9-regular linear-time property, e.g., an LTL formula. The task is then to compute the greatest lower bound for the probability for E that can be guaranteed even in worst-case scenarios. Such bounds can be computed by a combination of polynomially time-bounded graph algorithm with methods for solving linear programs. In the classical approach, the \u201cworst-case\u201d is determined when ranging over all schedulers that decide which action to perform next. In particular, all possible interleavings and resolutions of other nondeterministic choices in the system model are taken into account. The worst-case analysis relying on this general notion of schedulers is often too pessimistic and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1617"]}
