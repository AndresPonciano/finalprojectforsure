{"title": "A comparison of software effort estimation techniques: Using function points with neural networks, case-based reasoning and regression models\n", "abstract": " Estimating software development effort remains a complex problem attracting considerable research attention. Improving the estimation techniques available to project managers would facilitate more effective control of time and budgets in software development. This paper reviews a research study comparing three estimation techniques using function points as an estimate of system size. The models considered are based on regression analysis, artificial neural networks and case-based reasoning. Although regression models performed poorly on the data set of 299 projects, both artificial neural networks and case-based reasoning appeared to have value for software development effort estimation models. Case-based reasoning in particular is appealing because of its similarity to expert judgment approaches and for its potential as an expert assistant in support of human judgment.", "num_citations": "395\n", "authors": ["1148"]}

Software maintenance is an area of vital importance to industry since most organizations now have a major application portfolio that supports their business operations. Software maintenance ensures that these applications continue to meet organizational and business objectives in an effective way, thereby keeping the organization competitive. Some studies have been published on the workload distribution of maintenance activities. However, most of these studies are founded on surveys (Lientz and Swanson, 1980; Ball, 1987 and Dekleva, 1990), and few are based on actual collected data (Abran and Nguyenkim, 1993). The principal reason for this lack of published data is that the industry does not measure or collect maintenancetype data in a timely and accurate\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1148"]}
{"title": "Reassessing function points\n", "abstract": " Accurate estimation of the size and development effort for software projects requires estimation models which can be used early enough in the development life cycle to be of practical value. Function Point Analysis (FPA) has become possibly the most widely used estimation technique in practice. However the technique was developed in the data processing environment of the 1970's and, despite undergoing considerable reassessment and formalisation, still attracts criticism for the weighting scoring it employs and for the way in which the function point score is adapted for specific system characteristics. This paper reviews the validity of the weighting scheme and the value of adjusting for system characteristics by studying their effect in a sample of 299 software developments. In general the value adjustment scheme does not appear to cater for differences in productivity. The weighting scheme used to adjust system components in terms of being simple, average or complex also appears suspect and should be redesigned to provide a more realistic estimate of system functionality.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1148"]}

The a posteriori validation will establish the degree of quality of the data collected and, wherever required, will eliminate from the comparative studies the data deemed not reliable.

{"title": "Comparison between FPA and FFP: a field experience\n", "abstract": " A requirement for software productivity analysis and estimation is the ability to measure the size of a software product, from a functional perspective rather than from a technical perspective. One example of such a functional size measurement (FSM) technique is Function Point Analysis (FPA)[2]. FPA is now widely used in the MIS domain, where it has become the \u2018de facto\u2019 standard in the industry. However, FPA has not had the same acceptance in other domains, such as real-time software. A new technique was proposed by the University of Quebec in Montreal (UQAM) and the Software Engineering Laboratory in Applied Metrics (SELAM) to extend the functional measure to real-time software. The new technique is called Full Function Points.

{"title": "Functional size measurement patterns: A proposed approach\n", "abstract": " This paper introduces the concepts of functional size measurement (FSM) patterns. These FSM patterns apply to the COSMIC FSM method and may help in solving several issues, such as being able to do an early sizing for estimation, helping inexperienced measurers in learning how to apply the COSMIC method by establishing the relationship between the method rules and the measurement results, avoiding measurement errors, and reducing measurement effort. The approach used to define FSM patterns is Design Science Research. This paper explores the motivation factors, defines the objectives of the solution, and describes the design and development of FSM patterns. FSM patterns can be defined for a portion of a functional process, a single functional process type, a set of functional process types having a main data group - or object of interest - as their common starting point, or a large set of functional\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1148"]}
{"title": "The Strengths and Weaknesses of Functional Measure as a Good Negotiation Tool for New Development Projects\n", "abstract": " The user/contractor negotiations when constructing a software application are not easy. Many factors need to be considered (cost, product deliver, technical issues, competition, risk, etc.). In this article our focus is on the delivery of the product through the different phases of a project, using functional measure. To follow a product though different phases, a measure that can cope with preliminary requirements must be used. So, functional measure is preferable to lines of code (1). But lines of code are not totally eliminated. Some have used FPA (Function Point Analysis) to predict lines of code (1, 2) or to predict FPA from lines of code (backfire)(3). However there has been very little study, to our knowledge, that analyses the performance of FPA as a predictor, from the user requirements through to the implementation of the software (2).The following article relates our experiences measuring, at different project phases (early, intermediary and final), two software development projects using different methodologies for counting and validating function points. We found that it was necessary to consider different types of users when counting software, not only the end user. What one user could see as technical could be seen as a functional requirement by another. This challenges the common view about what functional measure is measuring. In both projects a report generator was seen as the solution for the many reports identified in the requirements. This resulted in a lower number of function points. Other less obvious infrastructure processes were constructed to improve the quality of the product. We were not able to do the count of those processes\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1148"]}
{"title": "New Methods for Measuring Function Points in Outsourcing Contracts\n", "abstract": " Function Point Analysis (FPA) is used by organisations worldwide as one of the measures used to establish the baseline size of their software assets in outsourcing contracts. This paper introduces new techniques, which enable all the functionality delivered and worked on by the supplier to be included in the productivity performance monitoring of these contracts. Typically only the business applications layer can be measured using FPA. The infrastructure software eg Utilities, device drivers and gateway applications, are usually overlooked because FPA is not designed to, nor easily adapted to, measuring internal layers of functions not delivered to the business user. This new Full Function Point Technique, developed by the University of Quebec in Montreal and SELAM, is a refinement of the FPA technique. It is no longer limited to only measuring MIS type applications but was specifically designed to meet the needs of organisations that build and support infrastructure applications and real-time and embedded software.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1148"]}
