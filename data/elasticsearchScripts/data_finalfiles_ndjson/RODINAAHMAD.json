The software cost estimation model, COnstructive COst MOdel (COCOMO), in its last update (COCOMO II) has a set of seventeen cost drivers and a set of five scale factors. Process Maturity (PMAT) is one of the five scale factors and its ratings are based on SW-CMM. This paper investigates the impact of process maturity on software development Schedule (cycle time) by deriving a new set of COCOMO II\u2019s PMAT rating values based on the most recent version of CMM, ie Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI). The precise data for the analysis were collected from the record of 40 historical projects which spanned the range of CMMI Levels, from Level 1 (Lower half and Upper half) to Level 4, where eight data points were collected from each level. The Ideal Scale Factor (ISF) method is applied in order to withhold the effect of the COCOMO II\u2019s PMAT scale factor. All prediction accuracies evaluations were measured using PRED (. 20). The study shows that the proposed model (with the new PMAT rating values) produced better schedule estimates as compared to the generic COCOMO II model\u2019s schedule estimates.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["1356"]}

{"title": "Maintainability dynamic metrics data collection based on aspect-oriented technology\n", "abstract": " The increase dependence on software aspects has led the society to emphasize the importance of software quality and metrics. At present there are two categories of quality metrics; dynamic and static. Although dynamic metrics can provide a clearer insight into the software quality issue; it is observed that static metrics are often used for such a purpose. This is due mainly to the technical difficulties associated with the collection of dynamic metrics. One of the known issues when dealing with dynamic metrics is the need for instrument code by inserting points for data collection. This is a very tedious and counterproductive task. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a promising technology that is currently used to add cross-cutting concerns to the software applications. AOP can be easily used to transparently instrument the code at compile-time. This work proposes AOP as a technique that can be used for collecting software maintainability dynamic metrics data. Therefore, an AOP-based framework for collecting dynamic coupling metric has been designed, implemented; and evaluated. Evaluation results showed that the framework is a reasonable approach for collecting a maintainability dynamic metrics. This approach allowed for the total separation of the metric\u2019s code (the metric aspect) from the application\u2019s source code. Thus, the AOP-based framework provides an effective way for the transparent collection of a maintainability dynamic metrics data. The designed framework can be extended to fit other kinds of quality dynamic metrics.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1356"]}

This destabilization is due to the need for coordination and management of multiple layers of the HetNets that the NC models cannot provide. User-centric (UC) approach is one of the key enablers of 5G wireless cellular networks for rapid recovering from network failures and ensuring certain communication capability for the users. In this paper, we present resource-aware energy-saving technique based on the UC model for LTE-A HetNets. We formulate an optimization problem for UC as a mixed linear integer programming (MILP) that minimizes the total power consumption (Energy Efficiency) while respecting the data rate per user and propose a low complexity iterative algorithm to user terminal (UE)-eNodeB association. In UC model, UE possessing terminal intelligence can establish the transmission and reception with different cells within the LTEA HetNet assuming the existence of coordination between the different cells in the network. The performance is evaluated in terms of energy saving in the uplink and downlink and the added capacity to the network (data rate). The evaluation is carried out by comparing a UC model against a NC model with the same simulation setup. The results show significant percentage of energy saving at eNodeBs and UEs in a UC model. Also, system capacity is enhanced in the UC model in both the uplink and downlink due to utilizing best channel gain for transmission and reception.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1356"]}

The most common tools entail flowchart-based notation as well as programming environments based on icons. More research in this field has revealed that the lack of problem-solving skills, which is considered as one of the prominent shortcomings that novices deal with, is exacerbated by language syntax that the novices employ. Thus, our proposed novel text-to-flowchart conversion approach intend to prompt novices to focus on solution rather than on programming syntax by engaging them in meaningful planning activities and solution designing prior to their attempt to do an implementation.

{"title": "A flowchart-based multi-agent system for assisting novice programmers with problem solving activities\n", "abstract": " In the early stages of learning computer programming, Computer Science (CS) minors share a misconception of what programming is. In order to address this problem, FMAS, a flowchart-based multi-agent system is developed to familiarize students who have no prior knowledge of programming, with the initial stages in learning programming. The aim is to improve students\u2019 problem solving skills and to introduce them to the basic programming algorithms prior to surface structure, using an automatic text-to-flowchart conversion approach. Therefore, students can focus less on language and syntax and more on designing solutions through flowchart development. The way text-to-flowchart conversion as a visualization-based approach is employed in FMAS to engage students in flowchart development for subsequent programming stages is discussed in this paper. Finally, an experimental study is devised to assess the success of FMAS, and positive feedback is achieved. Therefore, using FMAS in practice is supported, as the results indicate considerable gains for the experimental group over the control group. The results also show that an automatic text-to-flowchart conversion approach applied in FMAS successfully motivated nearly all participants in problem solving activities. Consequently, the results suggest additional, future development of our proposed approach in the form of an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) to make the early stages of learning programming more encouraging for students.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1356"]}

Despite this, appropriate research efforts are not made to evade these unexpected consequences of software development outsourcing. The objective of this research is to propose a framework in order to improve the RE process for outsourced software development projects. This framework is based upon empirical studies with pertinent national and multinational organizations and RE practices introduced by Sommerville and Sawyer.

This is part of a study that aims to develop a framework for critical requirements engineering (RE) practices for outsourced software development projects. We used a survey questionnaire as the primary approach to collect data from 193 software development practitioners from 62 companies in Malaysia. The practitioners were asked to identify which RE practices, out of the 66 practices of Sommerville\u2019s framework, are considered critical for outsourced projects. Specifically, the practitioners were asked to assess and categorize the practices into four categories: high, medium, low and zero value. Only two RE practices were assigned a \u2018high value\u2019by the practitioners and another 26 practices were assigned a \u2018medium\u2019value. The findings show that there is an increased awareness of the importance of RE practices among Malaysian practitioners because only a very low percentage of the respondents selected most of the practices as zero-or low-value practices. Secondly, all the 28 practices ranked as \u2018high\u2019and \u2018medium\u2019value practices are critical and should be given high emphasis in the outsourced projects.

{"title": "Applying gqm approach towards development of criterion-referenced assessment model for oo programming courses\n", "abstract": " The most influential programming paradigm today is object oriented (OO) programming and it is widely used in education and industry. Recognizing the importance of equipping students with OO knowledge and skills, it is not surprising that most Computer Science degree programs offer OO-related courses. How do we assess whether the students have acquired the right objectoriented skills after they have completed their OO courses? What are object oriented skills? Currently none of the current assessment techniques would be able to provide this answer. Traditional forms of OO programming assessment provide a ways for assigning numerical scores to determine letter grades. But this rarely reveals information about how students actually understand OO concept. It appears reasonable that a better understanding of how to define and assess OO skills is needed by developing a criterion referenced model. It is even critical in the context of Malaysia where there is currently a growing concern over the level of competency of Malaysian IT graduates in object oriented programming. This paper discussed the approach used to develop the criterion-referenced assessment model. The model can serve as a guideline when conducting OO programming assessment as mentioned. The proposed model is derived by using Goal Questions Metrics methodology, which helps formulate the metrics of interest.

{"title": "Significant Requirements Engineering Practices for Outsourced Mobile Application Development.\n", "abstract": " Abstract The magnitude of Software Development Outsourcing (SDO) is snowballing day by day. However, a considerable proportion of SDO projects cannot acquire the anticipated benefits. In most of such cases, the reasons are often associated to Requirements Engineering (RE) process. The same is true for Mobile Application Requirements Engineering (MARE) process in case of SDO. The aim of this study is to cultivate the MARE process for SDO by identifying and ranking the significant RE practices for the process. To identify the significant MARE practices, we have employed a literature-based list of RE practices. Two online questionnaire surveys have been conducted to complete the two rounds of Delphi method. After the first round, we have identified 86 significant MARE practices for SDO based on 36 responses from SDO experts. The results of the second round have helped us to provide the overall\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1356"]}
{"title": "Coordination issues and its impact on project performance: A systematic literature review\n", "abstract": " Software projects have become increasingly complex and risky caused by the existence of software outsourcing. The complexity of the project is due to the coordination between developers who hindered by a number of issues which then led to affect the performance of the project. Hence, this study intends to synthesize these coordination issues and its impact on project performance. Correspondingly, this paper present Systematic Literature Review (SLR) based on the issues and its impact on performance of the project. Findings indicate there are four main issues, namely, time separation, cultural, organizational and geographic distance which greatly affect project performance.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1356"]}
{"title": "Measuring The Impact of Socio-Technical Congruence in a Different Types of Software Life Cycle\n", "abstract": " Measuring developer coordination is a fundamental challenge and complex task in software development organizations. One way used to conceptualize and measure developer coordination is known as' Socio-Technical Congruence (STC)', which is fit between the coordination requirements established by the dependencies among tasks and the actual coordination activities carried out by the developers. However, STC has not been widely accepted as a broad theory. This is for the reason that, STC is relatively new, and there are many fundamental questions that need to be addressed and understood. This research intend to construct a model of the relationship between STC and project performance in the different types of software development lifecycle. The model constructed can be used to provide additional evidence to the body of knowledge, which will further strengthen the STC theory. Therefore, we outline research questions, the proposed method used to conduct the research, potential contributions and the expected results of the research.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1356"]}
{"title": "Significant software requirements engineering practices in systems engineering context\n", "abstract": " Utilization of the software is increasing day by day. The advancement in hardware and software have paved the way for systems engineering that supports the development of complex systems encompassing software as a part. Such systems need more vigorous Requirements Engineering (RE) practices and guidelines to cater the multidimensional needs. The objective of this study is to identify the significant software RE practices in the systems engineering context. Through the questionnaire survey and by employing four categories for the perceived benefits of RE practices, we have identified 55 RE practices that are significant for improvement of RE process in systems engineering context.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1356"]}
{"title": "A Model of Agile Project Management as a Control System\u2013Data Analysis Based on Literature\n", "abstract": " Agile Project Management (APM) is naturally considered to be as a replacement for Traditional means of Project Management (TPM) in Agile Software Development (ASD) projects. However, there is no clear definition of APM, and particularly even, APM cannot be considered as an exact counterpart of TPM. ASD projects seem to progress smoothly and implicitly as Agile Methods (AM) used and, adapted to various environmental conditions. Therefore, the term APM is considered to be ambiguous particularly if compared to TPM. This study intends to provide a model of APM as a control system that conduct and manage ASD projects through the usage of AM techniques and processes. The result provides an understanding of APM as an implicit set of PM activities in terms of performing AM as is, and compared to those prescriptive activities known as PM existing in TPM that needs to be used separately but in\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1356"]}

{"title": "Personas based support tool for requirements elicitation\n", "abstract": " Lack of user understanding can bring a damaging effect to software development projects. As we acknowledge, there is a wide variety of users in each software project and consequently there are variation of goals, needs and attitudes within the establishment of users' requirements.So, there are difficulties in organizing and categorizing these information and also, in validating these requirements within a development project. Using personas to capture and analyze users can facilitate user\u2019s understanding.However, identifying personas from large user information is difficult.This research examines the persona technique and proposes a software support tool to help developers in gathering and analyzing requirements by using personas.Likewise, the goals and tasks of each persona are established via actual requirements of the users.The creation and utilization of persona have been investigated via proposed tool aimed to elicit and represent users' requirements in a manageable format. A \u201cPersonas based Support Tool for Requirements Elicitation (PSTRE)\u201d facilitates software developers to gather and analyze user requirements.The resulting personas which are suggested by the proposed tool, have to be well understood and well presented to the development team and also provide easy way to extract main functionalities and features of the proposed system.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1356"]}
{"title": "Development of an online image repository system for cardiac modeling\n", "abstract": " The development of digital cardiac models has become an area of research all on its own. These researches intend to assist in the understanding of the heart. The data needed to build a digital cardiac model may come in various formats, including medical image data, such as MRI, CT scans, and other scans such as PET and SPECT. The availability of cardiac images is very important in cardiac modeling research. These images are difficult to come by for researchers who are not in the medical field. Thus, any of such available data stored in an on-line system can be made available to other researchers. This paper discusses and elaborates on the design and the development of this on-line cardiac image repository system. The requirement of the system was acquired using the Attribute Driven Design (ADD) method, which is a method for designing software architecture to satisfy both quality requirements and functional requirements. The online system which was developed has only taken into consideration image data, and not others formats of cardiac data such as ASCII flat files, and video files. The online system allows for downloading and uploading of data. With the availability of the data, researchers can spend more time focusing on the modeling processes rather than on the preprocessing and searching for data.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1356"]}
{"title": "An Asynchronous Software Inspection Model\n", "abstract": " This paper introduces an inspection model that discharges face-to-face meetings among inspectors in the software development group. The model aims at the elimination of the synchronous inspection meeting and the reduction of the asynchronous meeting by filtering out minor defects through the use of incontrovertible voting before the asynchronous meeting. The model goes through eight phases: initiation, overview, private checking, public checking, correlation, explicit voting, asynchronous meeting and rework and follow-up. The model is supported by a web-based tool named WASIT.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1356"]}
