{"title": "Goal-based requirements analysis\n", "abstract": " Goals are a logical mechanism for identifying, organizing and justifying software requirements. Strategies are needed for the initial identification and construction of goals. We discuss goals from the perspective of two themes: goal analysis and goal evolution. We begin with an overview of the goal-based method we have developed and summarize our experiences in applying our method to a relatively large example. We illustrate some of the issues that practitioners face when using a goal-based approach to specify the requirements for a system and close the paper with a discussion of needed future research on goal-based requirements analysis and evolution.", "num_citations": "858\n", "authors": ["1457"]}

{"title": "Analyzing regulatory rules for privacy and security requirements\n", "abstract": " Information practices that use personal, financial, and health-related information are governed by US laws and regulations to prevent unauthorized use and disclosure. To ensure compliance under the law, the security and privacy requirements of relevant software systems must properly be aligned with these regulations. However, these regulations describe stakeholder rules, called rights and obligations, in complex and sometimes ambiguous legal language. These \"rules\" are often precursors to software requirements that must undergo considerable refinement and analysis before they become implementable. To support the software engineering effort to derive security requirements from regulations, we present a methodology for directly extracting access rights and obligations from regulation texts. The methodology provides statement-level coverage for an entire regulatory document to consistently identify and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "395\n", "authors": ["1457"]}

Goals are widely recognized as important precursors to system requirements, but the process of identifying and abstracting them has not been researched thoroughly. We present a summary of a goal-based method (GBRAM) for uncovering hidden issues, goals, and requirements and illustrate its application to a commercial system, an Intranet-based electronic commerce application, evaluating the method in the process. The core techniques comprising GBRAM are the systematic application of heuristics and inquiry questions for the analysis of goals, scenarios and obstacles. We conclude by discussing the lessons learned through applying goal refinement in the field and the implications for future research.", "num_citations": "375\n", "authors": ["1457"]}
{"title": "Towards regulatory compliance: Extracting rights and obligations to align requirements with regulations\n", "abstract": " In the United States, federal and state regulations prescribe stakeholder rights and obligations that must be satisfied by the requirements for software systems. These regulations are typically wrought with ambiguities, making the process of deriving system requirements ad hoc and error prone. In highly regulated domains such as healthcare, there is a need for more comprehensive standards that can be used to assure that system requirements conform to regulations. To address this need, we expound upon a process called semantic parameterization previously used to derive rights and obligations from privacy goals. In this work, we apply the process to the privacy rule from the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). We present our methodology for extracting and prioritizing rights and obligations from regulations and show how semantic models can be used to clarify ambiguities through\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "355\n", "authors": ["1457"]}
{"title": "Goal identification and refinement in the specification of software-based information systems\n", "abstract": " This dissertation introduces the Goal-Based Requirements Analysis Method (GBRAM) for the identification and refinement of goals into operational requirements for software-based information systems. The method evolved as a result of its application to real world systems and processes, and was validated through its application to the redesign of a large commercial system. Further validation of the method was performed via an empirical evaluation. From these evaluations it was concluded that the method's straightforward, methodical approach to identifying system and enterprise goals and requirements suggests goal identification and refinement strategies and techniques through the inclusion of a set of heuristics, guidelines, and recurring question types. Four sets of heuristics are presented: identification heuristics, classification heuristics, refinement heuristics, and elaboration heuristics.

{"title": "Examining Internet privacy policies within the context of user privacy values\n", "abstract": " Internet privacy policies describe an organization's practices on data collection, use, and disclosure. These privacy policies both protect the organization and signal integrity commitment to site visitors. Consumers use the stated website policies to guide browsing and transaction decisions. This paper compares the classes of privacy protection goals (which express desired protection of consumer privacy rights) and vulnerabilities (which potentially threaten consumer privacy) with consumer privacy values. For this study, we looked at privacy policies from nearly 50 websites and surveyed over 1000 Internet users. We examined Internet users' major expectations about website privacy and revealed a notable discrepancy between what privacy policies are currently stating and what users deem most significant. Our findings suggest several implications to privacy managers and software project managers. Results from\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "271\n", "authors": ["1457"]}

The relationships of goals, scenarios, as well as the understanding and description of business processes are discussed. Different methods of goal refinement, and the application of scenarios to support this process of refining goals and roles are reviewed. A case study is presented which serves to exemplify and validate the process of using scenarios in refining business process descriptions. We tried deriving full scenarios for business processes, but obtaining them from the organization's prescriptive goals was difficult. Explanatory scenarios that justify descriptive goals are easier to obtain but are fragmentary. We conclude that both types of scenario and goal analysis are necessary for effective BPR.

{"title": "Addressing legal requirements in requirements engineering\n", "abstract": " Legal texts, such as regulations and legislation, are playing an increasingly important role in requirements engineering and system development. Monitoring systems for requirements and policy compliance has been recognized in the requirements engineering community as a key area for research. Similarly, regulatory compliance is critical in systems that are governed by regulations and law, especially given that non-compliance can result in both financial and criminal penalties. Working with legal texts can be very challenging, however, because they contain numerous ambiguities, cross-references, domain-specific definitions, and acronyms, and are frequently amended via new regulations and case law. Requirements engineers and compliance auditors must be able to identify relevant regulations, extract requirements and other key concepts, and monitor compliance throughout the software lifecycle.

{"title": "Analyzing website privacy requirements using a privacy goal taxonomy\n", "abstract": " Privacy has recently become a prominent issue in the context of electronic commerce websites. Increasingly, Privacy policies posted on such websites are receiving considerable attention from the government and consumers. We have used goal-mining, to extract pre-requirements goals from post-requirements text artifacts, as a technique for analyzing privacy policies. The identified goals are useful for analyzing implicit internal conflicts within privacy policies and conflicts with the corresponding websites and their manner of operation. These goals can be used to reconstruct the implicit requirements met by the privacy policies. This paper interrelates privacy policy and requirements for websites; it introduces a privacy goal taxonomy and reports the analysis of 23 Internet privacy policies for companies in three health care industries: pharmaceutical, health insurance and online drugstores.

This paper presents a taxonomy of privacy requirements for Web sites. Using goal-mining, the extraction of pre-requirements goals from post-requirements text artefacts, we analysed an initial set of Internet privacy policies to develop the taxonomy. This taxonomy was then validated during a second goal extraction exercise, involving privacy policies from a range of health care related Web sites.

In some instances, for example when a project\u2019s budget or schedule time is reduced at short notice, practitioners have been known to adopt a collection of use cases as a suitable substitute for a requirements specification. Given the challenges inherent in managing large collections of scenarios, this shortcut is cause for concern and deserves focused attention. We describe our experiences during a goal-driven requirements analysis effort for an electronic commerce application. In particular, we identify the specific risks incurred, focusing more on the challenges imposed due to traceability, inconsistent use of terminology, incompleteness and consistency, rather than on traditional software project management risks.

{"title": "A framework for modeling privacy requirements in role engineering\n", "abstract": " Privacy protection is important in many industries, such as healthcare and finance. Capturing and modeling privacy requirements in the early stages of system development is essential to provide high assurance of privacy protection to both stakeholders and consumers. This paper presents a framework for modeling privacy requirements in the role engineering process. Role engineering entails defining roles and permissions as well as assigning the permissions to the roles. Role engineering is the first step to implement a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system and essentially a Requirements Engineering (RE) process. The framework includes a data model and a goal-driven role engineering process. It seeks to bridge the gap between high-level privacy requirements and low-level access control policies by modeling privacy requirements as the contexts and obligations of RBAC entities and relationships. A healthcare example is illustrated with the framework.", "num_citations": "133\n", "authors": ["1457"]}
{"title": "Strategies for developing policies and requirements for secure and private electronic commerce\n", "abstract": " While the Internet is dramatically changing the way business is conducted, security and privacy issues are of deeper concern than ever before. A primary fault in evolutionary electronic commerce systems is the failure to adequately address security and privacy issues; therefore, security and privacy policies are either developed as an afterthought to the system or not at all. One reason for this failure is the difficulty in applying traditional software requirements engineering techniques to systems in which policy is continually changing due to the need to respond to the rapid introduction of new technologies which compromise those policies. Security and privacy should be major concerns from the onset, but practitioners need new systematic mechanisms for determining and assessing security and privacy.

When developing and analyzing digital identity technologies, it is important to consider the perceptions and responses of end users. Users are typically concerned about privacy and security, but do not necessarily understand how these issues are impacted by the use of digital identities. In this paper, we discuss preliminary results of a survey regarding authentication technologies used to generate digital identities. Most respondents were unfamiliar with a majority of the technologies in question (eg hand geometry scans), and expressed uncertainty about their use. Perceptions were more positive for the use of authentication technologies in the financial domain, and more negative for their use in the retail domain.
