We use the concept of model-driven engineering to transform AD into VHDL-AMS. This transformation is depicted in two transformations: Activity Diagram (AD) to Petri net (PN) and PN to VHDL-AMS. The first step, although has little importance for simulation, is used for formal verification, domain regularly used in addition with simulation. All simulations were implemented with SystemVision. The second step, allows to execute and simulate a system behaviour modelled by an AD, which is conformed to AD meta-model.", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["1436"]}

We have chosen \"I/O automata\", applying the frame to the model im- plies incompatibilities with parts of the model. In this con- tribution we detect these incompatibilities to measure it.

{"title": "From sequence diagrams uml 2. x to fd-devs by model transformation\n", "abstract": " This work transforms sequence diagrams to Finite and Deterministic DEVS (FD-DEVS) in Model-Driven En- gineering field. The main goal is the formalisation of behaviours, described with UML sequence diagram, to make verification activity by space state exploration and to make validation activity of a set of traces by simu- lation. In this context, we have chosen to elaborate a model transformation. This paper shows how, after the construction of meta-model for sequence diagrams and for Finite and Deterministic DEVS, it is possible to automate the transformation from one instance of source meta-model to one instance of destination meta-model. The source model is a sequence diagram and the target model is a FD-DEVS component.

Fidelity and validity are explained in the framework of the experimental frame and discussed in the context of modeling abstractions.

{"title": "A new specification-based qualitative metric for simulation model validity\n", "abstract": " Informal validation techniques such as simulation are extensively used in the development of embedded systems. Formal approaches such as model-checking and testing are important means to carry out Verification and Validation (V&V) activities.

However, this method remains of limited use as it runs into the problem of combinatorial explosion. Testing and model-checking do not take into account the context of use objectives of the model. Simulation overcomes these problems but it is not exhaustive.

{"title": "Verifying trace inclusion between an experimental frame and a model\n", "abstract": " The concept of experimental frame is employed to define circumstances under which a model is simulated and observed. Verifying the applicability of an experimental frame to a model is a key step to ensure that the intended purpose of a simulation can be achieved. We assume that the specification of an experimental frame and a model are two software components in the formal sense. This paper suggests a component-based approach to build the right simulation used for system models verification and validation. We use Input/Output automata for components' behaviour specification. Behavioural signature is employed to specify the experimental frame and model capabilities. Then we formally define applicability conditions with matching rules to verify the trace inclusion between an experimental frame and a model.
