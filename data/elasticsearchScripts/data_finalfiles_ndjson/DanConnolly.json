{"title": "Tabulator: Exploring and analyzing linked data on the semantic web\n", "abstract": " A web of linked RDF data may be enabled by standards specifying how links should be made in RDF and under what conditions they should be followed as well as powerful generic RDF browsers that can traverse an open web of RDF resources. The Tabulator is an RDF browser, which is designed both for new users to provoke interest in the Semantic Web and give them a means to access and interact with the entire web of RDF data, and for developers of RDF content to provide incentive for them to post their data in RDF, to refine and promote RDF linking standards, and to let providers see how their data interacts with the rest of the Semantic Web. A challenge for Semantic Web browsers is to bring the power of domain-specific applications to a generic program when new unexpected domains can be encountered in real time. The Tabulator project is an attempt to demonstrate and utilize the power of linked RDF data with a user-friendly Semantic Web browser that is able to recognize and follow RDF links to other RDF resources based on the user\u2019s exploration and analysis.", "num_citations": "634\n", "authors": ["1134"]}

{"title": "N3Logic: A logical framework for the World Wide Web\n", "abstract": " The Semantic Web drives toward the use of the Web for interacting with logically interconnected data. Through knowledge models such as Resource Description Framework (RDF), the Semantic Web provides a unifying representation of richly structured data. Adding logic to the Web implies the use of rules to make inferences, choose courses of action, and answer questions. This logic must be powerful enough to describe complex properties of objects but not so powerful that agents can be tricked by being asked to consider a paradox. The Web has several characteristics that can lead to problems when existing logics are used, in particular, the inconsistencies that inevitably arise due to the openness of the Web, where anyone can assert anything. N3Logic is a logic that allows rules to be expressed in a Web environment.

{"title": "Using semantic web technologies for policy management on the web\n", "abstract": " With policy management becoming popular as a means of providing flexible Web security, the number of policy languages being proposed for the Web is constantly increasing. We recognize the importance of policies for securing the Web and believe that the future will only bring more policy languages. We do not, however, believe that users should be forced to conform the description of their policy relationships to a single standard policy language. Instead there should be a way of encompassing different policy languages and supporting heterogeneous policy systems. As a step in this direction, we propose Rein, a policy framework grounded in Semantic Web technologies, which leverages the distributed nature and linkability of the Web to provide Web-based policy management. Rein provides ontologies for describing policy domains in a decentralized manner and provides an engine for reasoning over these descriptions, both of which can be used to develop domain and policy language specific security systems. We describe the Rein policy framework and discuss how a Rein policy management systems can be developed for access control in an online photo sharing application.", "num_citations": "105\n", "authors": ["1134"]}

We then show how the integration of a Semantic Web rules language (N3) with a theorem prover designed for the Web (Cwm) makes it possible to use the Hypertext Transport Protocol (http) to provide a scalable mechanismfor the exchange of rules and, eventually, proofs for access control on the Web.

SGML was designed to give information managers more flexibility to say what they mean, and XML brings that principle to the Web. Because it allows the development of custom tagsets, we can think of XML as HTML without the\" training wheels.\" In this article, we trace the history and evolution of Web data formats, culminating in XML.

We recognize the importance of policies for securing the Web and protecting user information and believe that the future will only bring more policy languages.

Instead there should be a way of encompassing different policy languages and supporting heterogeneous policy systems. As a step in this direction, we propose Rein, a policy framework grounded in Semantic Web technologies, which leverages the distributed nature and linkability of the Web to provide policy management for the Web.

This round-trip integration can lower lag between cohort discovery and establishing a registry. Investigators can also periodically augment their registry cohort as the IDR is enriched with additional data elements, data sources, and patients.
