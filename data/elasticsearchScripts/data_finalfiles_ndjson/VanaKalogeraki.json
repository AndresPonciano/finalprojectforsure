However, existing searching mechanisms in pure peer-to-peer networks are inefficient due to the decentralized nature of such networks.

The second, the Intelligent Search mechanism, uses the past behavior of the P2P network to further improve the scalability of the search procedure. In this algorithm, each peer autonomously decides which of its peers are most likely to answer a given query.

An important aspect that has not been examined in these systems is their energy consumption during the application execution. Reducing the power consumption of modern datacenters is a necessity as datacenters contribute over 2% of the total US electric usage. One way of addressing this energy issue is by scheduling the applications in an energy-efficient way. However, efficiently scheduling applications can be challenging as we need to consider the trade-off between the datacenter's energy usage and per application performance requirements.

Typically sensor nodes are deployed over a geographical area for the purpose of detecting, tracking and monitoring events of interest. Since sensor nodes are deployed in a large land region, the objective is to achieve complete coverage of the region, that is, every location in the region lies in the observation field of at least one sensor node. However the initial placement of sensors may not achieve this goal for various reasons: the number of original sensors may have been too low, the original placement may have been random (for example, sensors deployed from the air) leaving parts of the region uncovered, or, some of the sensors have malfunctioned, leaving coverage holes. In this paper we consider the coverage restoration problem in sensor networks. The goal is to find a minimal set of new sensors, and their locations, such that when they are added to an existing sensor field we can achieve complete coverage of the region under surveillance. The technique we propose is distributed, and minimizes the communication costs. The key idea of our technique is to use an efficient and yet very accurate representation of the uncovered area that uses techniques from discrepancy theory. By representing the uncovered area as a set of points, we can use efficient and simple algorithms for finding small sets of sensors to cover the uncovered areas.

Consequently, it becomes a necessity to develop a platform that will aggregate all the necessary information and will orchestrate it in the best way possible, towards meeting these goals. A main problem that arises in such a setting is the high diversity of the incoming data, obtained from very different sources such as sensors, smart phones, GPS signals and social networks.

{"title": "Attendance maximization for successful social event planning\n", "abstract": " Social event planning has received a great deal of attention in recent years where various entities, such as event planners and marketing companies, organizations, venues, or users in Event-based Social Networks, organize numerous social events (e.g., festivals, conferences, promotion parties). Recent studies show that \"attendance\" is the most common metric used to capture the success of social events, since the number of attendees has great impact on the event's expected gains (e.g., revenue, artist/brand publicity). In this work, we study the Social Event Scheduling (SES) problem which aims at identifying and assigning social events to appropriate time slots, so that the number of events attendees is maximized. We show that, even in highly restricted instances, the SES problem is NP-hard to be approximated over a factor. To solve the SES problem, we design three efficient and scalable algorithms. These algorithms exploit several novel schemes that we design. We conduct extensive experiments using several real and synthetic datasets, and demonstrate that the proposed algorithms perform on average half the computations compared to the existing solution and, in several cases, are 3-5 times faster.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["2095"]}

When bursts occur, incoming requests that exceed maximum processing capacity of the node, instead of being dropped, are diverted to a secondary queue. Requests in the secondary queue are concurrently scheduled with the primary queue, so that they can be immediately executed whenever the node has any processing power unused as the results of burst fluctuations. With this mechanism, processing power of nodes is fully utilized and the bursts are efficiently accommodated.

Even though P2P systems have been used successfully for sharing static multimedia files, using overlay networks to serve dynamic multimedia content has only recently received attention. Applications include Internet telephony and television, audio and video conferencing and streaming of music or movies. Providing multimedia applications over P2P is particularly challenging due to both application and system characteristics. Multimedia applications pose endto-end soft real-time and QoS requirements on data transmission, including fast and reliable transfer, guaranteed minimum throughput, bounded jitter and latency. Peers on the other hand are heterogenous in their processor capabilities, transmission loss rate, and network inbound/outbound bandwidth, and share their resources with other applications. Moreover they are dynamic, in that they can join, leave or fail without a priori notification. In lack of a central manager with an accurate global view of the large-scale system, there is no straightforward way to schedule the independently arriving application requests in order to tradeoff their QoS requirements.

Our approach has been developed in the Kappa architecture that exploits topic-based scalable publish/subscribe (pub/sub) systems like Apache Kafka to efficiently forward the high volume of incoming messages to distributed processing systems (i.e., Apache Spark or Apache Flink) that perform the batch\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2095"]}
{"title": "DIsCO: DynamIc Data COmpression in Distributed Stream Processing Systems\n", "abstract": " Supporting high throughput in Distributed Stream Processing Systems (DSPSs) has been an important goal in recent years. Current works either focus on automatically increasing the system resources whenever the current setup is inadequate or apply load shedding techniques discarding some of the incoming data. However, both approaches have significant shortcomings as they require on the fly application reconfiguration where the application needs to be stopped and re-uploaded in the cluster with the new configurations, and can lead to significant information loss. One approach that has not yet been considered for improving the throughput of DSPSs is exploiting compression algorithms to minimize the communication overhead between components especially in cases where we have large-sized data like live CCTV camera reports.

{"title": "REMI, Reusable Elements for Multi-Level Information Availability\n", "abstract": " Applications targeting Smart Cities tackle common challenges, however solutions are seldom portable from one city to another due to the heterogeneity of city ecosystems. A major obstacle involves the differences in the levels of available information. In this demonstration we present REMI, a reusable elements framework to handle varying degrees of information availability by design from two complementary angles, namely graceful degradation (GRADE) and data enrichment (DARE). In a nutshell, we develop reusable machine learning black boxes for mining and aggregating streaming data, either to infer missing data from available data, or to adapt expected accuracy based on data availability. We illustrate the proposed approach using tram data from the city of Warsaw.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2095"]}
{"title": "On topic aware recommendation to increase popularity in microblogging services (short paper)\n", "abstract": " The flourish of Web-based Online Social Networks (OSNs) has led to numerous applications that exploit social relationships to boost the influence of content in the network. However, existing approaches focus on the social ties and ignore how the topic of a post and its structure relate to its popularity. Our work assists in filling this gap. The contribution of this work is two-fold: (i) we develop a scheme that automatically identifies the topic of a post, specifically tweets, in real-time without human participation in the process, and then (ii) based on the topic of the tweet and prior related posts, we recommend appropriate structural properties to increase the popularity of the particular tweet. By exploiting Wikipedia, our model requires no training or expensive feature engineering for the classification of tweets to topics.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2095"]}
{"title": "State Detection Using Adaptive Human Sensor Sampling\n", "abstract": " With the massive prevalence of smartphones, mobile social sensing systems in which humans acting as social sensors respond to geo-located crowdsourcing tasks, became extremely popular. Such systems can provide significant benefits particularly during crisis management and emergency situations. However, not only querying users can be extremely costly but also human sensors are mobile, subjective and their response delays can highly vary. In this paper we develop a social sensing system that performs sampling on mobile social sensors to achieve accurate and real-time detection of the state of emergency events. Our contributions are two-fold:(i) our approach can capture well emergencies even in large geographical regions, and (ii) our sampling approach considers the individual characteristics of the social sensors to maximize the probability of receiving accurate responses in a timely manner. We provide comprehensive experiments that indicate that our approach accurately identifies critical real-world events, has low overhead and reduces the classification error up to 90% compared to traditional approaches.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2095"]}
{"title": "Mining hidden constrained streams in practice: Informed search in dynamic filter spaces\n", "abstract": " In this paper we tackle the recently proposed problem of hidden streams. In many situations, the data stream that we are interested in, is not directly accessible. Instead, part of the data can be accessed only through applying filters (e.g. keyword filtering). In fact this is the case of the most discussed social stream today, Twitter. The problem in this case is how to retrieve as many relevant documents as possible by applying the most appropriate set of filters to the original stream and, at the same time, respect a number of constrains (e.g. maximum number of filters that can be applied). In this work we introduce a search approach on a dynamic filter space. We utilize heterogeneous filters (not only keywords) making no assumptions about the attributes of the individual filters. We advance current research by considering realistically hard constraints based on real-world scenarios that require tracking of multiple dynamic\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2095"]}

{"title": "A mobile platform for managing mobile mapreduce participatory sensing data\n", "abstract": " The proliferation of powerful, programmable mobile devices along with the availability of wide-area connectivity has created opportunities for participatory sensing applications where users sense and share location, motion and acoustic data in a network of mobile devices. This paper presents a mobile system, based on the MapReduce framework that is designed to manage a large number of mobile users and handle overloads. Our system uses a Voronoi-based algorithm to establish a distributed grid of servers responsible for providing Reduce tasks and final data fusion. A location- and energy-aware scheduler assigns Reduce tasks on mobile phones based on their computational capabilities and geographical position. Our experimental results, using our intelligent transportation service, illustrate the benefits of our approach.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2095"]}
{"title": "Finding representative objects using link analysis ranking\n", "abstract": " Link analysis ranking methods are widely used for summarizing the connectivity structure of large networks. We explore a weighted version of two common link analysis ranking algorithms, PageRank and HITS, and study their applicability to assistive environment data. Based on these methods, we propose a novel approach for identifying representative objects in large datasets, given their similarity matrix. The novelty of our approach is that it takes into account both the pair-wise similarities between the objects, as well as the origin and\" evolution path\" of these similarities within the dataset. The key step of our method is to define a complete graph, where each object is represented by a node and each edge in the graph is given a weight equal to the pairwise similarity value of the two adjacent nodes. Nodes with high ranking scores correspond to representative objects. Our experimental evaluation was performed\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2095"]}
{"title": "On constructing overlay networks to support distributed real-time virtual environment applications\n", "abstract": " Overlay networks provide an attractive solution to distributed real-time virtual applications because of their unique features of scalability, decentralization and cost effectiveness. However, overlay support for distributed real-time virtual applications remains a challenge because of two reasons: 1) Frequent update messages traveling through multiple hops can increase the network traffic and cause long communication and processing delays; and 2) Variable latencies experienced by different participants can violate their consistency requirements and affect the performance of the application. In this paper, we propose techniques that work at two levels to address this problem. First the participants are grouped according to their virtual distance to satisfy their consistency requirements. Second, filters that combine application-level knowledge are utilized at boundary nodes to eliminate unnecessary message\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2095"]}

{"title": "Managing real-time distributed multimedia applications\n", "abstract": " Distributed multimedia applications are characterized by timing constraints and end-to-end quality of service (QoS) requirements, and therefore need efficient management mechanisms to respond to transient changes in the load or the availability of the resources. This chapter presents a real-time distributed multimedia framework, based on the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), that provides resource management and Quality of Service for CORBA applications. The framework consists of multimedia components and resource management components. The multimedia components produce multimedia streams, and combine multimedia streams generated by individual sources into a single stream to be received by the users. The resource management components provide QoS guarantees during multimedia transmissions based on information obtained from monitoring the usage of the system\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2095"]}
