These components were expressed in terms of the experimental coefficients and process parameters like wheel speed, table feed and depth of cut. All the coefficients were determined experimentally by performing grinding tests at specified conditions. The variation of the friction coefficient with process parameters such as wheel speed and work feed has been taken into consideration while calculating the frictional force components.

The uptake of chromium was observed to increase with increase in the concentration for both oxidation states of chromium. For the root, the observed order of uptake was CrIII sand > CrVI sand > CrIII soil > CrVI soil, whereas in the lower shoot, upper shoot and fruit the order was CrVI sand > CrVI soil > CrIII sand > CrIII soil. Significantly high uptake of chromium by roots in the sand culture (CrIII treatment) is attributed to the effect of root exudates and degradation products on the mobilization of CrIII. In aerial parts of the plants a higher uptake was observed when the initial supply was CrVI.

{"title": "Nitric oxide scavenging by the cobalamin precursor cobinamide\n", "abstract": " Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signaling molecule, and a number of NO synthesis inhibitors and scavengers have been developed to allow study of NO functions and to reduce excess NO levels in disease states. We showed previously that cobinamide, a cobalamin (vitamin B12) precursor, binds NO with high affinity, and we now evaluated the potential of cobinamide as a NO scavenger in biologic systems. We found that cobinamide reversed NO-stimulated fluid secretion in Drosophila Malpighian tubules, both when applied in the form of a NO donor and when produced intracellularly by nitricoxide synthase. Moreover, feeding flies cobinamide markedly attenuated subsequent NO-induced increases in tubular fluid secretion. Cobinamide was taken up efficiently by cultured rodent cells and prevented NO-induced phosphorylation of the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein VASP both when NO was provided to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "74\n", "authors": ["1782"]}

Methods In each of 10 states, the largest district and the one most distant from the state capital were selected for study. Four boxes, each containing an electronic temperature recorder and two vials of diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus vaccine, were placed in the state or regional vaccine store for each study state. Two of these boxes were then shipped \u2013 one per facility \u2013 towards the two most peripheral health facilities where vaccine was stored in each study district. The boxes were shipped, handled and stored as if they were routine vaccine supplies.   Findings In state, regional and district vaccine stores and peripheral health facilities, respectively, the temperatures in the boxes exceeded 8\u00a0\u00b0C for 14.3%, 13.2%, 8.3% and 14.7% of their combined storage times and fell below 0\u00a0\u00b0C for 1.5%, 0.2%, 0.6% and 10.5% of these times.

In recent years there have been numerous and far-reaching developments in taxonomy. The past two decades have witnessed a marked change in outlook and methodology, and provided numerous concepts and techniques for systematist. In this book major emphasis has been on some of these recent developments. The recent researches from various disciplines of botany have clearly shown that contributions to systematist can come from any of these branches. Some of these branches have produced new ideas and facts which can not be ignored by plant taxonomist. They have made great impact on our ideas of classification, and of phylogeny. The role of wood anatomy, floral anotomy, embryology, palynology, cytology and chemical constituents of plants in taxonomy is discussed in the chapter on Modern Trends in Taxonomy. The development of numerical methods in taxonomy provided numerous new concepts and techniques. A simplified account of numerical taxonomy is provided in chapter 11.

{"title": "A text book of botany\n", "abstract": " Linnaeus (1754) divided the plant kingdom into 25 classes on the basis of the number of stamens and carpels, their union and their presence or absence in the flower. One of these 25 classes\u2014the Cryptogamia, included all plants having no flowers. Thus Linnaeus was the first to recognize flowerless-plants as a major taxonomic unit. He divided the Cryptogamia into four orders\u2014Filices which included pteridophytes, Musci which included mosses and leafy liverworts, Algae which included algae, lichens and thallose liverworts, and the Fungi. Linnaeus' system was wholly artificial based only on sexual characters of plants. But in the latter systems, called natural systems, plants were grouped according to their true natural affinities. The first such system was proposed by AL de Jussieu in 1789. He divided plants into three major groups-Acotyledones, Monocotyledones and Dicotyledones. His Acotyledones are the approximate equivalent of Linnaeus' Cryptogamia. However, most of the classifications proposed during the first half of the nineteenth century were inadequate so far as the classification of cryptogams was concerned. It was primarily due to insufficient information regarding the life-histories of cryptogams. The scene, however, changed after the publication of German botanist Wilhelm Hofmeister's work in 1851. He studied the life-cycles of a number of different groups of vascular cryptogams and mosses.Although Hofmeister did not fully understand the processes of gametic union and meiosis, but he knew that sperm stimulates the egg to develop into the new sporophyte.

The flow-induced shear stress on the wall of a six strand curved type billet caster tundish has been computed by a 3-D mathematical model. The location of predicted peak wall shear stress was found to be same as observed in the plant after a sequence. Different design parameters of the tundish such as wall inclination angle, curvature radius, and tundish width are studied by analyzing the flow-induced wall shear stress. The role of a pouring chamber is assessed with respect to the wall shear stress. It was found that vigorous circulation around the inlet stream from shroud plays a major role in deciding the extent of the wall shear stress. Use of pouring chamber resulted in lesser wall shear stress than that of a bare tundish. The peak shear stress was found to be decreasing as any of the design parameters increased within a range. A modification in design parameter of the tundish can reduce the wall shear stress, thus may help to improve the sequence life of the tundish.", "num_citations": "40\n", "authors": ["1782"]}

Better mixing within the bath and improved mass transfer between slag and metal is believed to cause better dephosphorisation. Normally an equal amount of gas in passed from each tuyere in bottom stirring throughout the blow. Here a novel bottom stirring scheme has been proposed and investigated where different amount of gas was injected from different tuyeres in last 3 to 5 min of the blow. The investigation was carried out with respect to mixing and mass transfer in a scaled-down physical model having appropriate similarity with the actual steelmaking vessel. The scheme, differential flow bottom stirring, basically redistributes the total bottom gas flow in a manner so that a linear flow gradient is imposed across the bath. It was found that the differential flow bottom stirring scheme gives 30\u201335% improvement in mixing compared to uniform flow through all the bottom tuyeres. The scheme also gave better mass transfer rates than the conventional stirring. A 30% increase in the mass transfer rate was observed. Plant trials with the scheme were conducted to assess the impact on dephosphorisation within the practical BOF vessel.

{"title": "SSTKR: Secure and testable scan design through test key randomization\n", "abstract": " Scan test is the standard method, practiced by industry, that has consistently provided high fault coverage due to high controllability and high observability. The scan chain allows to control and observe the internal signals of a chip. However, this property also facilitates hackers to use scan architecture as a means to breach chip security. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a new method called Secure and testable Scan design through Test Key Randomization(SSTKR). SSTKR is a key based method to prevent hackers from stealing secret information. Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) is used to generate authentication keys to be embedded in test vectors. Unique key is used for every test vector which prevents scan based side channel attacks effectively. Any attempt to steal secret information will lead to a randomized response.

However, lipid productivity in case of microalgae is much higher and has several advantages as compared with crop plants, so it is a better feedstock for biodiesel. In case of Chlorella pyrenoidosa, the heterotrophic cultured cells were found to be better in terms of lipid production, and ultimately biodiesel production, but the bottleneck is that in this mode glucose is used to feed the cells, which amounts to almost 80% of the total cost of biodiesel production.

The height of the leading peak is less than that of the trailing peak at low (near threshold) voltages but grows much larger than the trailing peak at higher voltages. The spectral content of the luminescence in the two peaks is very close. Areas under the two peaks are sensitive functions of the amplitude and the pulse width of the excitation voltage. The results are interpreted by a model that attributes the trailing peak to the presence of shallower or nonequilibrium states at the phosphor-insulator interface.

Gallbladder torsion is more frequently encountered in the elderly with peak incidence in the 65-75 year old group, and a 3:1 female predominance. Gallbladder torsion typically presents as an acute abdomen requiring emergency surgery, and most cases are found as a surprise at surgery since preoperative diagnosis of gallbladder torsion is difficult. We report a case of acute gallbladder torsion in an elderly male and review the clinical aspect of gallbladder torsion. A 54-year old male presented to our department with a 5-day history of sudden onset colicky abdominal pain associated with vomiting, progressive abdominal distension and fever. Laparotomy through a chevron incision was performed and findings at operation included a gallbladder, which was necrotic and gangrenous, not attached to the liver by any mesentery. It was hanging by the attachments of cystic duct and cystic artery only, with a 360-degree clockwise torsion. Gallbladder torsion is rare surgical emergency which requires a high index of suspicion for early preoperative diagnosis and prompt intervention.

Recently, we have shown that native histone H3 protein derived from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), or a synthetic peptide that is homologous with S-Ag peptide M in having six consecutive amino acids, induces experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) similar to that induced by native S-Ag in the Lewis rat. In this study, monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) immunized with histone H3 peptide developed a strong cellular immune response to this peptide as well as to peptide M. However, no significant inflammation or hypervascularization was observed in the retina or the iris during the experimental period, when they were examined clinically with an inverted ophthalmoscope. Histopathological examination showed that all monkeys injected with histone H3 peptide or with native histone H3 lost a large number of photoreceptor rod cells and developed neovascularization in the outer nuclear cell layer of the retina. These histopathological findings in the monkey retina closely resemble those seen in human patients with some types of uveitis.

{"title": "Emotional intelligence: Significance of psychology and spirituality\n", "abstract": " The aim of the present research work was to study emotional intelligence (EI) as a function of different academic subjects of choice, spiritual quotient (SQ), and gender. One hundred and fifty university students doing master degree with age ranging from 21-24 years were selected randomly from three academic departments of Punjabi University, Patiala, Punjab, India, ie, Science, Arts, and Psychology. Emotional Intelligence Scale (Hyde, Pethe, & Dhar, 2001) and Spiritual Quotient Scale (SQ; Chopra, 2002) were administered individually on all the participants. For analysis, participants were further divided into two groups by using median split half technique on SQ scores, ie, those who scored high and those who scored low on SQ. These two groups were compared on EI. One way ANOVA (for three academic subjects of choice) was applied to see whether participants studying different academic subjects of choice differ significantly on EI. t-test was used to see whether participants high and low on SQ and men and women differ significantly on EI. It was concluded that individuals studying Psychology were more emotionally intelligent as compared to the other two groups. Varied levels of SQ had significant effect on emotional intelligence but gender difference was insignificant. This study has important implications for educational psychologists and EI research.", "num_citations": "25\n", "authors": ["1782"]}

A total of 55 patients with lymphoma were examined in this study. Of 55 patients, 30 and 25 were diagnosed as HL and NHL, respectively. The four HL subtypes were observed with the majority of the cases exhibited the mixed cellularity (MC) subtype followed by the nodular sclerosis (NS). The high grade was found to be the commonest subtype of NHL in our sample, followed by the low grade. The presence of EBV was detected by immunostating for expression of latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1). The frequency of LMP-1 expression occurred more frequent in patients with HL (60.0%) than in patients with NHL (32.0%). The frequency of LMP-1 expression was also higher in patients with MC (61.11%) than those patients with NS (28.57%). No age or gender difference in occurrence of EBV infection was observed among patient with HL. By contrast, the prevalence of EBV infection in NHL patients aged below 50 was lower (16.66%) than in NHL patients aged 50 or above (46.15%). In addition, EBV infection was more frequent in females with NHL (38.46%) than in male with NHL (25%). In NHL cases, the frequency of EBV infection in intermediate grade (60.0%) was high when compared with frequency of low (37.5%) or high grades (16.7%). In conclusion, analysis of LMP-1 expression indicates an important role for this viral oncogene in the pathogenesis of EBV-associated malignant lymphoma.

Innovative user services and applications are being built using geotagged images taken from community contributed repositories like Flickr. Only a small subset of the images in these repositories is geotagged, limiting their exploration and effective utilization. We propose to use optional meta-data along with image content to geo-cluster all the images in a partly geotagged dataset. We formulate the problem as a graph clustering problem where edge weights are vectors of incomparable components. We develop probabilistic approaches to fuse the components into a single measure and then, discover clusters using an existing random walk method.

Supporting such pattern retrieval requires not only the formulation of an appropriate scoring function for defining relevant connected subregions, but also the design of new access methods that can scale to large databases. In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem of querying significant sub-regions on spatial data provided as raster images. We design a scoring scheme to measure the similarity of subregions. All the raster images are tiled and each alignment of the query and a database image produces a tile score matrix. We show that the problem of finding the best connected subregion from this matrix is NP\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["1782"]}

Its impact on total phospholipids (TP), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatdylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were measured in liver, plasma and testes. During preparatory phase, in general, the levels for TP, PC, PS, PI and PE decreased after endosulfan exposure in the above tissues. During prespawning and spawning phases, the phospholipids also showed decreasing trend. The postspawning phase, exhibited decline in hepatic levels of PS and PI only and remained unaffected in the other two tissues. During the resting phase too, the hepatic levels of TP, PS and PI declined and remained unaltered in others. The present results indicate that endosulfan have very selective effects on phospholipids classes during different phases of the annual reproductive cycle interfering with the production of lipid deprived energy ie vitellogenin. In general, endosulfan has inhibitory role during reproductive growth affecting phospholipid biosynthesis via hepatic enzyme systems as well as by hormonal imbalance.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["1782"]}

It was assumed in the present study that the emotion- and cognition-based processing dichotomy manifests in the IGT as reward and punishment frequency and the intertemporal attribute. It was further proposed that the delineation of emotion- and cognition-based processing is contingent upon reward and punishment as manifested in the frame of the task (variant type) and task motivation (instruction type). The effects of IGT variant type (reward vs. punishment) and instruction type (task motivation induced by instruction types: reward, punishment, reward and punishment, or no hint) on the intertemporal and frequency attributes of IGT decision-making were analyzed.

The performance overhead of scan design is due to the scan multiplexers added to the inputs of every flip-flop. In today's very high-speed designs with minimum possible combinational depth, the performance degradation caused by the scan multiplexer has become magnified.

It is as yet unknown whether sex-differences in affect and motor lateralization have implications for sex-specific lateralization in the IGT, and specifically, whether sex-difference in performance in the IGT changes with right-handedness or with affect lateralization (decision valence, and valence-directed motivation). The present study (N = 320; 160 males) examined the effects of right-handedness (right-handedness vs. non-right-handedness) as a measure of motor lateralization, decision valence (reward vs. punishment IGT), and valence-directedness of task motivation (valence-directed vs. non-directed instructions), as measures of affective lateralization on IGT decision making. Analyses of variance revealed that both male and female participants showed valence-induced inconsistencies in advantageous decision-making; however, right-handed females made more disadvantageous decisions in a reward IGT. These results suggest that IGT decision-making may be largely right-lateralized in right-handed males, and show that sex and lateralized differences (motor and affect) have implications for sex-differences in IGT decision-making.

ASHAs are women who live in the community and receive performance-based incentives for overseeing maternal and other health-related issues in their village.  Methods and Principal Finding Through conducting interviews with 400 randomly selected ASHAs from four primary health care centers (PHCs), it was observed that their level of knowledge about visceral leishmaniasis (VL) regarding transmission, diagnosis, and treatment was limited. The baseline data indicated that less than 10% of VL cases seeking treatment at the PHCs were referred by ASHAs. To increase the knowledge and the referral rate of VL cases by ASHAs, training sessions were carried out during the monthly ASHA meetings at their respective PHCs. Following a single training session, the referral rate increased from less than 10% to over 27% and the overall knowledge about VL substantially improved. It was not possible, however, to demonstrate that ASHA training reduced the time that individuals had fever before treatment at the PHC.

The paper proposes a graph theoretic model of pipelined processors and develops a systematic approach for delay fault testing of such processor cores using the processor instruction set. Our methodology consists of using a graph model of the pipelined processor, extraction of architectural constraints, classification of paths, and generation of tests using a constrained ATPG. These tests are then converted to a test program, a sequence of instructions, for testing the processor. Thus, the tests generated by our method can be applied in a functional mode of operation and can also be used for self-test.

Towards the above, the mathematical model firstly validated with the online plant measurement data and found to be in good agreement. Based on the plant measurement of magnetic fields at various EMBr ruler current settings, simulations are carried out for different casting speeds and section sizes. Heavy meniscus flow instabilities during EMBr OFF conditions are found to be suppressed through the retarding influence of applied magnetic field. The effect of EMBr causes thinning of the velocity boundary layer and the flow is found more prone to be surface directed. In the mold, magnetic field dampens turbulence and emboldens the formation of large scale vertical structures, whose axis is aligning with the magnetic field vector. The jet hitting the narrow wall becomes more focused and reduced lateral dispersion during EMBr ON condition.

Rhizoctonia diseases cause significant losses in commercial production, for instance, sheath blight of rice, hypocotyl rot of soybean, crown rot of sugarbeet, brown patch of turfgrasses, to name a few. In case of Rhizoctonia bare patch of wheat, nearly 20% of the field can be covered with patches with essentially no yield in the patches (Cook et al., 2002).

It explores the subjective meaning and social significance of religious practice in the context of a rapidly expanding mass religious phenomenon in India. The narrative draws on Weber's insights on the intersections between religion and economy, phenomenological theory, performance studies, and Indian philosophy and popular culture. It shows that religion here is primarily a means of performing to and preparing for an informal economy. It gives the chance to live meaningful social lives while challenging the inequities and symbolic violence of an imposing global capitalist social ethic.

Its impact on total (TP) and different phospholipids-phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatdylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were measured in liver, plasma and ovary. On pesticide exposure, during preparatory phase, the hepatic TP, PC and PE were declined. The plasma levels of TP, PC and PS were declined with the elevation of PE whereas in ovary only PC was lowered after endosulfan exposure. During pre-spawning phase, the hepatic TP, PC and PE declined in liver, plasma and ovary after endosulfan exposure. During spawning phase, only plasma and ovarian phospholipids showed decrease in their levels following endosulfan exposure. In the post-spawning phase, endosulfan elevated the levels of TP, PC and PS in ovary but had no effect on their levels in liver and plasma. During resting phase, the TP, PC and PI were found to be decreasing its levels.

Methods: A vulnerability map has been developed using SINTACS model in order to identify areas where vulnerability of groundwater to contamination is the most. In this analysis, vulnerability index is calculated by considering different hydrogeological parameters such as water table depth, net recharge, unsaturated conditions, soil media, aquifer media, hydraulic conductivity and topographic slope. All the parameters used in this study have been prepared, classified, weighted and integrated in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment. Findings: The value of vulnerability index estimated lies between 121 to 176. Further, result shows that out of total area, 0.26% of the area indicates very low vulnerability 11.58% indicates low vulnerability 81.35% indicates moderate vulnerability and 6.81% of area indicates high vulnerability. It means majority of the study area exhibit moderate vulnerability. The study produces an effective tool for local authorities who manage and monitor the ground water resources.

Presently human activity and modern day agriculture are one of the key factors in the emergence of begomoviruses in various parts of the world. The available disease management options include the organisation of agricultural practice to reduce disease, the use of cultural control such as sanitation programmes, the control of the vector population through the use of insecticides, and the breeding and growing of resistant crop cultivars. Transgenic resistance against begomoviruses has shown limited success despite the use of a number of strategies. Ability of begomoviruses to evolve rapidly by recombination and mutations is the major limitation to all these strategies. In modern-day biotechnology, focus is required on engineering begomovirus resistance through transgenic approach. Expression of various full length or truncated or defective proteins of the virus has been effective in achieving pathogen-derived resistance. Antisense RNA and RNAi technology have also been used with some success.

Debugging errors at this stage requires some arrangement for expanding the observability of internal signals of the design. Limited number of trace buffers help in increasing visibility of these internal states. However, appropriate trace signal selection is very difficult. Restorability of untraced states with the help of traced ones is a popular approach for signal selection although it fails to address the main issue of error detection. We propose a signal selection methodology which combines the restoration capability and error detection ability of these signals. Experimental evaluation of the proposed signal selection approach on benchmark circuits indicates improved error detection for various kind of design errors. Practical consideration like minimizing routing overhead has also been analyzed.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1782"]}

It is very important to estimate the MTOW of the aircraft in order to determine its performance. However, estimating the weight of an aircraft is not a simple task. The purpose of this paper is to present a simplified method to optimize the aircraft MTOW using a genetic algorithm approach. For the optimization of MTOW of transport aircraft, a MATLAB program consisting of genetic algorithm techniques with appropriate genetic algorithm parameters setting was developed. The objective function for the optimization was a minimization of MTOW. The use of genetic real coded algorithm (GA) as an optimization tool for an aircraft can help to reduce the number of qualitative decisions. Also, using GA approach, the time and the cost of conceptual design can considerably be reduced. The model is applicable to the air transport industry.

In this context, Integrated Biomarker Response (IBR) index was used to integrate the biomarkers effects to assess the impact of environmental contaminants in marine gastropod Nerita chamaeleon from Goa, India. Genotoxic (DNA damage as measured by comet assay and alkaline unwinding assay) and biochemical [superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione S-transferase, lipid peroxidation and acetylcholinesterase] biomarkers were measured in snails collected from different sites (Arambol, Anjuna, Sinquerim, Dona Paula, Velsao, Betul and Palolem). Total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in snail tissue were in the range from 5.29 - 12.14 \u03bcg/g wet weight. Standardized values of biomarker response were visualized using star plots, which show unique patterns for different biomarkers. The mean IBR value was found to be highest at Dona Paula (8.07 \u00b1 0.91) followed by Sinquerim (6.95 \u00b1 0.91), Velsao (4.48 \u00b1 0.68), Anjuna (3.28 \u00b1 1.05), Palolem (2.53 \u00b1 0.73), Arambol (1.81 \u00b1 0.21) and Betul (0.88 \u00b1 0.77).

However, it also makes them more susceptible to transient faults effectively decreasing their reliability. Therefore, ensuring correct and reliable operation of these microprocessors at low cost has become a challenging task. This paper proposes a light weight error detection method called REMO which aims to incorporate simple fault tolerance mechanisms as part of the basic architecture. It dynamically verifies the execution results of the instructions by exploiting spatial and temporal redundancy and detects soft errors. REMO shows that with minimal area, power and performance overhead, and a very low detection latency, a very high degree of fault coverage can be achieved.

{"title": "Dual conception of risk in the Iowa Gambling Task: effects of sleep deprivation and test-retest gap\n", "abstract": " Risk in the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is often understood in terms of intertemporal choices, i.e., preference for immediate outcomes in favor of delayed outcomes is considered risky. According to behavioral economics, decision makers refrain from choosing the short-sighted immediate gain because, over time (10 trials), the immediate gains result in a net loss. Instead decision makers are expected to maximize their gains by choosing options that, over time (10 trials), result in net gain. However, task choices are sometimes made on the basis of the frequency of reward and punishment such that infrequent punishments are favored over frequent punishments. The presence of these two attributes (intertemporality and frequency) may correspond to the emotion-cognition dichotomy and reflect a dual conception of risk. Decision making on the basis of the two attributes was tested under two conditions: test-retest gap and sleep deprivation. An interaction between these two was expected to attenuate the difference between the two attributes (n=40 male). Analysis of the effects of IGT attribute type (intertemporal vs. frequency), sleep deprivation (sleep deprivation vs. no sleep deprivation), and test-retest gap (short vs. long) showed a significant effect of IGT attribute type thus confirming the difference between the two attributes. Sleep deprivation had no effect on the attributes, but test-retest gap and the three-way interaction between attribute type, test-retest gap, and sleep deprivation were significant. Post-hoc tests showed sleep deprivation and short test-retest gap to attenuate the difference between the two attributes.

Since continuous soil tillage strongly influence the soil properties, it is important to apply appropriate tillage practices that avoid the degradation of soil structure, maintain crop yield as well as ecosystem stability. The efficiency of input use viz. water, fertilizers, herbicides and others depend on tillage and crop establishment practices. It is therefore, essential that the soil environment be manipulated suitably for ensuring a good crop stand and improve resource-use efficiency. Sustaining production and productivity of any system is of paramount importance by improving the soil\u2019s physical, chemical and biological properties. Conventional tillage operations will alter these properties in every cropping cycle thereby affecting the soil system. Conservation agriculture (CA), practising agriculture in such a way so as to cause minimum damage to the environment is being advocated at a large scale world-wide. Conservation tillage, the most important aspect of CA, is thought to take care of the soil health, plant growth and the environment.

{"title": "An experimental study on the projectile defeat mechanism of hard steel projectile against boron carbide tiles\n", "abstract": " Failure mechanism of 7.62\u2009mm AP projectile impacting boron carbide tiles was studied by post ballistic examination of the failed projectiles. It is found that the projectile failure originates simultaneously from at least two locations in the projectile during ballistic impact, one originating from the target interaction front of the projectile and another from a location near the tail end of the projectile. The failure origination from the target interaction front of the projectile is due to severe deformation at the interaction front. The second failure origination from locations near tail end of the projectile is due to stress wave generated micro-cracks. At the target interaction front of the projectile a temperature rise of above 1160\u2009\u00b0C has been estimated. No remarkable change in failure mechanism of the hard steel projectile with respect to tile thickness (5\u20139.2\u2009mm) or projectile velocity (600\u2013820\u2009m/s) has been observed.

{"title": "A new scan flip flop design to eliminate performance penalty of scan\n", "abstract": " The demand for high performance system-on-chips (SoC) in communication and computing has been growing continuously. To meet the performance goals, very aggressive circuit design techniques such as the use of smallest possible logic depth are being practiced. Replacement of normal flip-flops with scan flip-flops adds an additional multiplexer delay to critical path. Furthermore as the combinational depth decreases, the performance degradation caused by scan multiplexer delay become more critical. Elimination of the scan multiplexer delay off the functional path has become crucial in maintaining the circuit performance. In this work we propose a new transistor level scan cell design to eliminate the scan multiplexer off the functional path. The proposed scan cell uses separate master latch for functional and test mode where as the slave latch is same in both the modes.

Applications with highly diverse cache behavior can be observed in homogeneous as well as heterogeneous multicore processors.

{"title": "Efficient routing by minimizing end to end delay in delay tolerant enabled VANETs\n", "abstract": " Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are special case of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) with predictable mobility constraints. In VANETs, non real-time applications are appreciated as compared to real time applications because of very frequent network partitions caused by high node mobility. The focus of this paper is on Delay tolerant networks (DTNs). DTNs are special type of networks which follows the approach of store and forward. In DTNs, the route is not established before the transmission of data. The vehicles store data and transmit it whenever there is an opportunity to transmit data ie a vehicle in desired direction is available. This is also known as message ferrying technique. In this paper, the mechanism to select proper ferry to forward the data is proposed which is based on fastest ferry and considers dynamic speed of ferries. The selection of fastest ferry in variable blocks makes it adaptive to accommodate high speed vehicles which provide maximum packet delivery ratio.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1782"]}

Amoxicillin/clavulanate has been implicated as a causative agent for drug-induced hepatitis. 8-11 However, in this particular case, the trigger to the histological conversion may never be found. The typical presentation of amoxicillin/clavulanate hepatotoxicity is that of profound cholestasis with occasional hepatocellular involvement. 10 Furthermore, older individuals are generally at higher risk of hepatotoxicity. PGCH is a rare entity. The natural course is usually a fulminant, progressive course to cirrhosis within months, leading to death or a requirement for transplantation. Associations with autoimmune disorders, viral infections, and drug reactions and also with congenital metabolic diseases such as alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency and hemosiderosis have been described. In many cases, no causative event has been found. The presence of autoimmune hepatitis in these patients suggests that there may be an autoimmune component to the pathogenesis of PGCH in a subgroup of patients. Clinicians need to be aware of this potential change in the disease as more aggressive management of the patient may be necessary and expedited liver transplantation may be in order.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1782"]}

Interferon (IFN) mediated antiviral protection was also inhibited in mice treated with TM. The in vitro natural killer (NK) cell reactivity of mice was significantly decreased after in vivo administration of TM; however, TM treatment did not affect the response of the same cells to mitogens. TM also inhibited the boosting of NK reactivity by IFN in vivo. In this paper, we have shown that depletion of NK cells by asialo-GM1 antiserum enhances SFV/EMCV replication in mice. Both TM and anti-asialo GM1 treatment significantly inhibited the large granular lymphocyte (LGL) populations in the spleen. Similar to Swiss mice, the in vitro NK cell activity of athymic nude mice was significantly decreased after in vivo administration of TM and TM also inhibited the boosting effect on NK cells reactivity induced by IFN in vivo. TM treatment of nude mice also enhanced the SFV/EMCV in brains of infected mice and also inhibited the antiviral activity of IFN in nude mice.

Raman studies show that the observed enhancement of polymer interchain interaction at low nanoparticle concentration is due to the tighter packing of polymer chains. Thus, at low nanoparticle concentration, the observed increase in mobility is assigned to both the enhancement in interchain interaction and tunneling of carriers\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1782"]}
{"title": "Water footprint of rice from both production and consumption perspective assessment using remote sensing under subtropical India: A review\n", "abstract": " Consumptive water footprint (WF) reduction in irrigated crop production is essential given the increasing competition for freshwater. The calculated green, blue and grey water footprints of paddy rice are converted into estimations of the green, blue and grey water footprints of derived rice products on the basis of product and value fractions. International virtual water flows related to trade in rice products are estimated by multiplying trade volumes by their respective water footprints in the exporting countries. Reduction in overall consumptive WF always goes together with an increasing ratio of green to blue water footprint. We take both a production and a consumption perspective. Total water footprint of rice production is estimated by aggregating the water footprints per production region and the water footprint of rice consumption is estimated by looking in which regions of the world the rice that is consumed in that nation is produced. The water footprint of rice consumption in a nation is calculated by aggregating the water footprints in the regions where the rice consumed in a nation is grown by using a higher spatial resolution. In India water foot print of per unit and total rice production and percolation was 1403 (m3ton-1) and 432.9 (billion m3yr-1). The per-capita water footprint of rice consumption is quite high in Thailand (547 m3cap-1yr-1) compared to India (239 m3cap-1yr-1), with their water footprints related to rice consumption 63,364 and 250,305 (Mm3yr-1), respectively.

Growers rely on the use of insecticides to control this pest. However, some insecticides do not reduce the feeding of B. tabaci fast enough to prevent the direct and indirect damage produced by this insect. The effect of a new insecticide, cyantraniliprole 10OD (CyazypyrTM), on the feeding of B. tabaci adults, was studied under laboratory conditions. Cyantraniliprole 10OD is an insecticide that belongs to the IRAC Group 28 with a new mode of action for sucking insects, which provides rapid feeding cessation by impairing muscle function, resulting in reduced transmission of important insect vectored crop diseases. Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the effect of cyantraniliprole along with some other commercially available insecticides on the feeding of B. tabaci adults by measuring the excretion of honeydew as an indirect assessment of insect feeding. In these experiments, cyantraniliprole resulted in significantly higher reduction of honeydew excretion (64.0%) by Q biotype B. tabaci adults during the first 30 minutes of exposure than diafenthiuron, triazophos, acetamiprid and spiromesifen, with all treatments having no adult mortality. Observations between 1 and 48 hours after exposure indicated that cyantraniliprole had numerically higher or similar reduction in honeydew production as the other insecticides, but by 48 hours (mid and high rate) and 96 hours (high rate) of exposure, cyantraniliprole had significantly higher reduction of honeydew excretion than all other insecticides tested.

All the herbicides applied alone as well as in mixture significantly reduced the dry weight of Phalaris during both the years. Fenoxaprop 140 g/ha provided effective control of Phalaris and it was at par with weed free check in respect of yield and yield attributes. Tank mixture of isoproturon+tralkoxydim 375+250 g/ha provided similar results to fenoxaprop 140 g/ha. Application of fenoxaprop+metribuzin proved poorer, while metribuzin 300 g/ha was effective against Phalaris but toxic to crop.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1782"]}
