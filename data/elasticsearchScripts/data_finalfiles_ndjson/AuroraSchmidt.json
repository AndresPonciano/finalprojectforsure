{"title": "A formally verified hybrid system for the next-generation airborne collision avoidance system\n", "abstract": " The Next-Generation Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS\u00a0X) is intended to be installed on all large aircraft to give advice to pilots and prevent mid-air collisions with other aircraft. It is currently being developed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In this paper we determine the geometric configurations under which the advice given by ACAS X is safe under a precise set of assumptions and formally verify these configurations using hybrid systems theorem proving techniques. We conduct an initial examination of the current version of the real ACAS X system and discuss some cases where our safety theorem conflicts with the actual advisory given by that version, demonstrating how formal, hybrid approaches are helping ensure the safety of ACAS X. Our approach is general and could also be used to identify unsafe advice issued by other collision avoidance systems or confirm their safety.", "num_citations": "81\n", "authors": ["1422"]}
{"title": "Formal verification of ACAS X, an industrial airborne collision avoidance system\n", "abstract": " Formal verification of industrial systems is very challenging, due to reasons ranging from scalability issues to communication difficulties with engineering-focused teams. More importantly, industrial systems are rarely designed for verification, but rather for operational needs. In this paper we present an overview of our experience using hybrid systems theorem proving to formally verify ACAS X, an airborne collision avoidance system for airliners scheduled to be operational around 2020. The methods and proof techniques presented here are an overview of the work already presented in [8], while the evaluation of ACAS X has been significantly expanded and updated to the most recent version of the system, run 13. The effort presented in this paper is an integral part of the ACAS X development and was performed in tight collaboration with the ACAS X development team.", "num_citations": "33\n", "authors": ["1422"]}
{"title": "Complex contagions and the diffusion of popular Twitter hashtags in Nigeria\n", "abstract": " Social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter provide highly granular time-stamped data about the interactions and communications between people and provide us unprecedented opportunities for empirically testing theory about information flow in social networks. Using publicly available data from Twitter\u2019s free API (Application Program Interface), we track the adoption of popular hashtags in Nigeria during 2014. These hashtags reference online marketing campaigns, major news stories, and events and issues specific to Nigeria, including reactions to the kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls in Northeastern Nigeria by the Islamic extremist group Boko Haram. We find that hashtags related to Nigerian sociopolitical issues, including the #bringbackourgirls hashtag, which was associated with protests against the Nigerian government\u2019s response to the kidnapping, are more likely to be adopted among densely\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "31\n", "authors": ["1422"]}
{"title": "Investigating the observability of complex contagion in empirical social networks\n", "abstract": " Social contagion is the mechanism by which ideas and behaviors spread across human social networks. Simple contagion models approximate the likelihood of adoption as constant with each exposure to an\" infected\" network neighbor. However, social theory postulates that when adopting an idea or behavior carries personal or social risk, an individual's adoption likelihood also depends on the number of distinct neighbors who have adopted. Such complex contagions are thought to govern the spread of social movements and other important social phenomena. Online sites, such as Twitter, expose social interactions at a large scale and provide an opportunity to observe the spread of social contagions\" in the wild.\" Much of the effort in searching for complex phenomena in real world contagions focuses on measuring user adoption thresholds. In this work, we show an alternative method for fitting probabilistic complex contagion models to empirical data that avoids measuring thresholds directly, and our results indicate bias in observed thresholds under both complex and simple models. We also show 1) that probabilistic models of simple and complex contagion are distinguishable when applied to an empirical social network with random user activity; and 2) the predictive power of these probabilistic adoption models against observed adoptions of actual hashtags used on Twitter. We use a set of tweets collected from Nigeria in 2014, focusing on 20 popular hashtags, using the follow graphs of the users adopting the tags during their initial peaks of activity.", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["1422"]}

Accurate knowledge of guided wave characteristics could help to dramatically improve performance, but estimating this information from data is often very difficult. In this paper, we present a methodology, based on compressed sensing, that utilizes \u2113 1 -regularized optimization techniques to recover the sparse characteristics of the guided wavefields in the frequency-wavenumber domain. Using simulated guided wave data, we demonstrate the performance of this technique and compare it to a more traditional approach, the 2-dimensional discrete Fourier transform method. We show that, with 10 sensors, our compressed sensing method successfully estimates 1000 points in a wavefield with an average correlation coefficient of more than 0.99 while the 2-dimensional discrete Fourier\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["1422"]}

This system issues advisories to pilots when the risk of mid-air collision is imminent, and is expected to be equipped on all large, piloted aircraft in the future. We developed an approach to efficiently compute the probabilities of generically specified events and the most likely sequences of states leading to those events within a discrete-time Markov chain model of aircraft flight and ACAS X. The probabilities and sequences are computed for all states in the model. Events of interest include near mid-air collisions (NMACs) and undesirable sequences of advisories that affect operational suitability.

The predicate is specialized to analyze sequences of vertical maneuvers, and in the horizontal dimension is modular, allowing it to be safely composed with separately analyzed horizontal dynamics. Unlike previous efforts, this approach enables analysis of aircraft that are turning, and accelerating non-deterministically. It can also analyze the safety of coordinated advisories, and encounters with more than two aircraft.

To approximate the problem as a discrete linear system, the space of source locations is quantized, introducing model error. We propose a model-robust adaptation to basis pursuit to control for the error arising from the spatial quantization.

We use instead semantic attributes: if attributes of yet unseen classes can be determined, then class labels may themselves be decided based on prior knowledge of class to attributes relationships. We present several methods for determining attributes, including (A) an approach based on attribute classifiers, and approaches using (B) MAP and (C) MMSE attribute estimators using image classifiers for known classes.

Using this measure of topical engagement, we filter tweets collected from over 90,000 Nigerian users over a three-year period concerning that country\u2019s head of state, President Goodluck Jonathan. We show that this measure effectively identifies a small set of highly engaged users that produce a disproportionate amount of activity, both in tweet volume and mentions of other users. Additionally, we show preferential within-group activity, with these users disproportionately mentioning other highly engaged users. Lastly, we show the potential of using changes in the percentage of engaged users within the overall user set for gauging the significance of events that occurred in Nigeria over the 2011 to early 2013 period.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1422"]}

However, these techniques may also be used to implant carefully selected input-output pairs. We present initial results on a novel technique for using SMT solvers to fine tune the weights of a ReLU neural network to guarantee outcomes on a finite set of particular examples. This procedure can be used to ensure performance on key examples, but it could also be used to insert difficult-to-find incorrect examples that trigger unexpected performance.
