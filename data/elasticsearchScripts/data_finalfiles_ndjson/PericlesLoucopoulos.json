In the early years, software development was organized using the waterfall model, where the focus of requirements engineering was on a frozen requirements document, which formed the basis of the subsequent design and implementation process. Since then, a lot has changed: software has to be developed faster, in larger and distributed teams, for pervasive as well as large-scale applications, with more flexibility, and with ongoing maintenance and quick release cycles. What do these ongoing developments and changes imply for the future of requirements engineering and software design? Now is the time to rethink the role of requirements and design for software intensive systems in transportation, life sciences, banking, e-government and other areas. Past assumptions need to be questioned, research and education need to be rethought. This book is based on the Design Requirements Workshop, held June 3-6, 2007, in Cleveland, OH, USA, where leading researchers met to assess the current state of affairs and define new directions. The papers included were carefully reviewed and selected to give an overview of the current state of the art as well as an outlook on probable future challenges and priorities.

To this end, the paper discusses the use of a knowledge representation formalism, which provides the necessary foundation for capturing and analysing concepts about an application domain, and a prototype system which assists in this process.", "num_citations": "34\n", "authors": ["1471"]}

Since the early 1990\u2019s, a large number of GOM approaches have been proposed aiming to a better alignment between business strategy and the behaviour of supporting systems. Different GOM approaches focus on different activities in the early stages of system development and propose a variety of strategies for reasoning about goals. A number of researchers have stressed the advantages of integrating different GOM techniques, especially in the context of modern global business environments. This is evidenced in the increasing number of publications in this area. However as each GOM language (even versions of the same language) comes with its own syntactic and semantic singularities, such integration requires a number of complicated transformations which is a major obstacle to model and tool interoperability, and prevent wider adoption by practitioners. In order to provide a unified view of GOM, one needs a common understanding of GOM concepts, their semantics and deployment. To this end, this paper proposes a language independent meta-model based on the analysis of eight GOM languages.

In recent years, the field of Requirements Engineering has received much attention and many research and practical approaches have been proposed. In this paper we present a Requirements Engineering framework that is motivated by the System Dynamics paradigm. The framework consists of four key activities: ontology modelling, goal modelling, process modelling and scenarios generation. It is our premise that the synergy between these four activities results in a robust way of working that provides requirements stakeholders with a systematic approach to articulating, defining, debating, and agreeing on the set of desirable functional and non-functional properties of the intended system. The approach is demonstrated with examples from a very large application and claims substantiated from experiences from this project.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1471"]}

However, these models lack reasoning and dynamic simulation: there is no significant way to simulate discrete and continuous time system behaviour or to build arguments for reasoning about the design options within the OMG specifications. In this paper we propose an approach to overcoming this problem, by integrating a set of modelling tools into one single platform, taking advantage of meta-modelling techniques to integrate new tools with the OMG specifications in a model driven environment.

We demonstrate this approach using an example from an application involving decision making for supporting venue operations for the Doha 2022 World Cup Games. The example focuses on the operations surrounding the strategy for security measures for entrance of spectators to a venue. For this specific example one needs to identify the capabilities required in order to establish a level of service acceptable to spectators within the resource constraints to be offered by the organising committee.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1471"]}
{"title": "Ontology for quality specification in requirements engineering\n", "abstract": " The field of Requirements Engineering (RE) is arguably one of the most crucial areas in the development of systems in support of organisational structures and processes. Eliciting, negotiating, analysing and validating are RE processes that rely on appropriate abstraction mechanisms. This paper focuses on a specific modelling approach, that of Business Process Modelling (BPM), and the use of a specific ontology for modelling and evaluating quality aspects of business processes. This business process ontology provides an explicit specification of the shared conceptualization and understanding of enterprises between IT and none-IT experts. Specification and measurement of requirements based on an ontology fosters communication between experts. This paper proposes an approach that drives specification and measurement of quality requirements. Application of the proposed approach is illustrated for a simplified version of a business process.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1471"]}
{"title": "Identifying NFRs conflicts using quality ontologies\n", "abstract": " Conflict identification and resolution is a key phase of requirements engineering. It is crucial to identify conflicts at early stages of the requirements engineering which in turns helps in establishing a cohesive set of requirements to guide the overall requirements engineering process. Conflicts especially arise due to the self reinforcing or contradictory nature of some NFRs (eg efficiency and usability). This paper describes how quality ontologies can be used to support the identification of NFR conflicts and facilitate discussion towards requirements prioritization tasks in requirements engineering. Our approach is based on using the ISO/IEC 9126 quality ontology to underpin the NFR description and reasoning mechanisms to pinpoint potential NFR conflicts that need to be further discussed by stakeholders. The work is implemented in the ElicitO requirements elicitation tool. We also report results of applying the approach and the tool to identify conflicts in requirements elicitation activities at the student intranet project of the University of Manchester (Manchester Unity Web Project).", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1471"]}

The BMSA approach is founded on three basic premises-(a) organisational modelling and work design,(b) modelling the business process and (c) automated tool support. These issues are bound together by a set of design principles. The BMSA conceptual foundation is based on the UML notation. This allows interfacing with other development methods and tools.

In most cases these patterns are represented in a \u2018flat\u2019 fashion making their use difficult especially when there is a large number of patterns to consider in a particular application. In this paper we propose an analysis pattern retrieval (APR) approach under a classification schema in order to enable the automatic re-use of analysis patterns. The proposed classification scheme associates a problem to a set of pre-defined terms whereas the retrieval approach based on a Boolean model provides the necessary support to help a designer to locate and select analysis patterns that better solve the conceptual problem that he has in hands. An APR approach under a classification schema has the potential to make large analysis patterns collections easier to use and understand.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1471"]}

{"title": "DELOS: Development Environment Located Over SIS\n", "abstract": " Computer community's view of applications has changed in several manners over the years. While applications were isolated in early 80's, they became networked after'85 so that we ended to web-paged applications nowadays. Along with every social change, applications' interaction with data evolved. The latter were initially saved in file systems or in hierarchical databases during the 80's. The development of relational databases enabled the fast and effective access of voluminous data. The applications' complexity during the last years, forced the employment of the Object Oriented approach in application development, while on the same time the development of the OODBs enabled the transformation of application modules to objects that may reside in the OODBs and are integrated with the data. All the above explains the fact that the integration of www and OO technology has been widely accepted by the software development groups. The advantages seem to be obvious since a plethora of different needs are thought to be accommodated that way: a huge and easily approached www application base is starving for real applications; the around the world digital libraries are waiting to be exploited; customized, localized applications are on demand; web applications' development time is vital; the reuse of software objects is essential. In the meanwhile, a new key player in the space of www-OO application development appears: Java (http://www. javasoft. com/aboutJava/index. html) is the new native OO language providing a set of unique features, like platform neutral binary code, dynamic loaded classes, remote method invocation etc., that\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1471"]}
{"title": "Development and evaluation of an application in a deductive environment\n", "abstract": " This paper presents the design, implementation and evaluation of an application following the deductive approach. The application concerns a safety critical system and for modelliig the application domain two conceptual models were used the Entity Relationship Time (ERT) for the structural part and the Conceptual Rule Language(CRL) for constraints, derivation and event-action rules. The mapping from the conceptual level to the deductive DBMS platform, namely MegaLog, is described with some sample results. An overview of the system, along with a simple user interface for creating different application scenarios are presented and are followed by some statistic results of a real life case study and an evaluation of the proposed approach.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1471"]}

{"title": "From software engineering to business engineering: ESPRIT projects in information systems engineering\n", "abstract": " During this talk it will be argued that approaches to the development and evolution of information systems need to progress from the traditional'information viewpoint'to also encompass the'enterprise viewpoint'. It will be argued that future development paradigms will need to provide advanced support to business system analysis in developing, maintaining and evolving high level, formal conceptual models for business applications. To this end, a number of research projects, in the context of ESPRIT, will be discussed and a number of future research directions will be outlined.Pericles Loucopoulos is a professor of Information Systems in the Department of Computation, the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST). He joined UMIST in 1984 after several years of commercial work in the systems department of a major firm of financial brokers. He holds a Ph.

{"title": "AMORE\u2014Object Oriented Extensions to Prolog for the RUBRIC Implementation Environment\n", "abstract": " The RUBRIC paradigm to developing information systems is based on the premise that the development process should be viewed as the task of constructing or augmenting an organisation knowledge base which is declaratively defined.Such an approach requires a number of features of its implementation environment. These features are provided by the AMORE language which is discussed in this paper. The primary objective of the AMORE language is to provide support for the information base of RUBRIC and to offer facilities for developing a set of tools which assist in the specification and maintenance of this information base.This language has been designed as an extension to Prolog offering Object Oriented concepts. The integration of the two approaches offers a flexible environment for the development of advanced information systems.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1471"]}
{"title": "An Ontology Driven Quality Requirements Specification and Measurement\n", "abstract": " The field of Requirements Engineering (RE) is arguably one of the most sensitive areas in the development of systems in support of organisational structures and processes. Eliciting, negotiating, analyzing and validating are RE processes that need to be facilitated by appropriate abstraction mechanisms. In this paper, our focus is on a particular modeling approach, that of Business Process Modeling (BPM) and the use of ontology for modeling and evaluating quality aspects of business processes. Business process ontology provides an explicit specification of the shared conceptualization and understanding of enterprises between IT and none-IT experts. Specification and measurement of requirements upon such ontology foster communication by avoiding ambiguities arising in situations involving experts from different domains. In this paper, we propose a business process ontology that drives specification and measurement of quality requirements. Application of the proposed approach is illustrated via an example.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1471"]}
