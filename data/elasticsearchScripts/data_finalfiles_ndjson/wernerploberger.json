For example, the results apply to tests of one-time structural change with unknown change-point. Several other examples are discussed in the paper. The results of the paper are of interest, because the testing problem considered is nonstandard and the classical asymptotic optimality results for the Lagrange multiplier (LM), Wald, and likelihood ratio (LR) tests do not apply. A weighted average power criterion is used here to generate optimal tests. This criterion is similar to that used by Wald (1943) to obtain the classical asymptotic optimality properties of Wald tests in \"regular\" testing problems.

We therefore applaud the courage of the organizers of the Tilburg Conference in fostering an interdisciplinary treatment of these twin themes. The interdisciplinary nature of the subject means that most readers of this volume will be specialists in fields other than our own primary interest, which is econometrics, and are therefore most likely to be interested in the main ideas of our work on this topic rather than the technical details. Consequently, this chapter passes over most technicalities and seeks to explain why econometricians are interested in a particular aspect of Rissanen\u2019s theorem.

{"title": "Asymptotic power of the integrated conditional moment test against global and large local alternatives\n", "abstract": " In Bierens and Ploberger (1994) we have analyzed the local power of the ICM test. In particular, we showed that the ICM test has nontrivial asymptotic power against\u221a n-local alternatives. These results are briefly reviewed in section 2. Note that, next to the conditional moment tests based on extensions of Bierens\u2019(1982) approach, there is also a class of alternative consistent tests of functional form based on comparison of parametric and (semi-) nonparametric models. See, eg, Wooldridge (1992), Yatchew (1992), Gozalo (1993), Hardle and Mammen (1993), Horowitz and Hardle (1992), Fan and Li (1992a, b, c), Hong and White (1991), White and Hong (1993), and Zheng (1993), among others. However, it seems that these type of tests have only nontrivial power in all local directions for local alternatives that shrink to the null at a slower rate than 1/\u221a n. Therefore, these tests are less powerful than the ICM test. In Bierens and Ploberger (1994) we also showed that the ICM test is admissible, in the sense that asymptotically there does not exist a uniformly more powerful test. Moreover, we solved the size problem that hampered the application of original ICM test of Bierens (1982) by deriving sharp upperbounds of the critical values of the ICM test. 2", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1034"]}
