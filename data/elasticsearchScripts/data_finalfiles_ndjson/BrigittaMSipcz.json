Our analysis is based on a new sample of rotation periods in the main-sequence cluster Praesepe (age 600 Myr). From photometric light curves obtained with the Isaac Newton Telescope, we measure rotation periods for 49 objects, among them 26 in the VLM domain. This enlarges the period sample in this mass and age regime by a factor of 6. Almost all VLM objects in our sample are fast rotators with periods <2.5 d, in contrast to the stars with M > 0.6 M\u2299 in this cluster which have periods of 7\u201314 d.

{"title": "A highly unequal-mass eclipsing M-dwarf binary in the WFCAM Transit Survey\n", "abstract": " Star formation theory predicts that short-period M-dwarf binaries with highly unequal-mass components are rare. First, the mass ratio of close binary systems is driven to unity due to the secondary preferentially accreting gas with high angular momentum. Secondly, both dynamical decay of multiple systems and interactions with tertiary stars that tighten the binary orbit will eject the lowest mass member. Generally, only the two most massive stars are paired after such interactions, and the frequency of tight unequal-mass binaries is expected to decrease steeply with primary mass. In this paper, we present the discovery of a highly unequal-mass eclipsing M-dwarf binary, providing a unique constraint on binary star formation theory and on evolutionary models for low-mass binary stars.

We discuss key aspects to realize this endeavor, namely (i) the design and exploitation of scalable and computationally efficient AI algorithms for Multi-Messenger Astrophysics; (ii) cyberinfrastructure requirements to numerically simulate astrophysical sources, and to process and interpret Multi-Messenger Astrophysics data; (iii) management of gravitational wave detections and triggers to enable electromagnetic and astro-particle follow-ups; (iv) a vision to harness future developments of machine and deep learning and cyberinfrastructure resources to cope with the scale of discovery in the Big Data Era; (v) and the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["889"]}

{"title": "Apparent Novae in M31\n", "abstract": " Kamil Hornoch, Astronomical Institute, Ondrejov; and Jesus M. Corral-Santana and Jorge Casares, Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias and Universidad de La Laguna, report their discovery of a probable nova in the galaxy M31 on co-added 720-s narrow-band H_alpha and 360-s Sloan r'CCD frames taken by Corral-Santana and Casares with the 2.54-m Isaac Newton Telescope (+ WFC) at La Palma on July 10.210 and 10.200 UT, respectively. The new object, designated M31N 2010-07b, is visible on single images used for the co-added frame and is faintly visible also on many pre-discovery co-added frames taken during June, but it is not present on numerous archival images taken at Ondrejov and other observatories. M31N 2010-07b is located at RA= 0h43m07s. 50, Decl.=+ 41o17'58\". 6 (equinox 2000.0), which is 261\" east and 110\" north of the center of M31.

{"title": "Spectroscopic Transit Search: a self-calibrating method for detecting planets around bright stars\n", "abstract": " Aims. We aim to search for transiting exoplanets around the star \u03b2 Pictoris using high-resolution spectroscopy and Doppler imaging that removes the need for standard star observations. These data were obtained on the VLT with UVES during the course of an observing campaign throughout 2017 that monitored the Hill sphere transit of the exoplanet \u03b2 Pictoris b. Methods. We utilized line profile tomography as a method for the discovery of transiting exoplanets. By measuring the exoplanet distortion of the stellar line profile, we removed the need for reference star measurements. We demonstrated the method with white noise simulations, and then looked at the case of \u03b2 Pictoris, which is a \u03b4 Scuti pulsator. We describe a method to remove the stellar pulsations and perform a search for any transiting exoplanets in the resultant data set. We injected fake planet transits with varying orbital periods and planet radii into the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["889"]}
{"title": "WTS-2 b: Too close for comfort?\n", "abstract": " We report the discovery of WTS-2 b, a typical hot Jupiter in an unusually close 1.02-day orbit to a K-dwarf star. This is the second planet to be discovered in the infrared light curves of the WFCAM Transit Survey (WTS) and is only one-and-a-half times the separation from its host star at which is would be destroyed by Roche lobe overflow. The predicted remaining lifetime of the planet is just 38\u2009Myrs, assuming a tidal dissipation quality factor of Q'* = 106. The magnitude of Q'* is largely unconstrained by observations, thus WTS-2 b provides a useful calibration point for theories describing how frictional processes within a host star affect the tidal orbital evolution of its companion giant planets. It is expected that stars with large convective envelopes are more efficient at dissipating the orbital energy of the planet, and WTS-2 b provides an observational constraint in the sparsely populated K-dwarf regime.

{"title": "Algorithms and Statistical Models for Scientific Discovery in the Petabyte Era\n", "abstract": " The field of astronomy has arrived at a turning point in terms of size and complexity of both datasets and scientific collaboration. Commensurately, algorithms and statistical models have begun to adapt --- e.g., via the onset of artificial intelligence --- which itself presents new challenges and opportunities for growth. This white paper aims to offer guidance and ideas for how we can evolve our technical and collaborative frameworks to promote efficient algorithmic development and take advantage of opportunities for scientific discovery in the petabyte era. We discuss challenges for discovery in large and complex data sets; challenges and requirements for the next stage of development of statistical methodologies and algorithmic tool sets; how we might change our paradigms of collaboration and education; and the ethical implications of scientists' contributions to widely applicable algorithms and computational modeling. We start with six distinct recommendations that are supported by the commentary following them. This white paper is related to a larger corpus of effort that has taken place within and around the Petabytes to Science Workshops (https://petabytestoscience.github.io/).", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["889"]}
{"title": "The Growing Importance of a Tech Savvy Astronomy and Astrophysics Workforce\n", "abstract": " Fundamental coding and software development skills are increasingly necessary for success in nearly every aspect of astronomical and astrophysical research as large surveys and high resolution simulations become the norm. However, professional training in these skills is inaccessible or impractical for many members of our community. Students and professionals alike have been expected to acquire these skills on their own, apart from formal classroom curriculum or on-the-job training. Despite the recognized importance of these skills, there is little opportunity to develop them - even for interested researchers. To ensure a workforce capable of taking advantage of the computational resources and the large volumes of data coming in the next decade, we must identify and support ways to make software development training widely accessible to community members, regardless of affiliation or career level. To develop and sustain a technology capable astronomical and astrophysical workforce, we recommend that agencies make funding and other resources available in order to encourage, support and, in some cases, require progress on necessary training, infrastructure and policies. In this white paper, we focus on recommendations for how funding agencies can lead in the promotion of activities to support the astronomy and astrophysical workforce in the 2020s.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["889"]}
