{"title": "Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy (4th edition)1\n", "abstract": " In 2008, we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing research in autophagy. Since then, this topic has received increasing attention, and many scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Thus, it is important to formulate on a regular basis updated guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Despite numerous reviews, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to evaluate autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we present a set of guidelines for investigators to select and interpret methods to examine autophagy and related processes, and for reviewers to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of reports that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a dogmatic set of rules, because the appropriateness of any assay largely depends on the question\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "10228\n", "authors": ["219"]}

Biol. 14, 3676-3682). An in vitro PLD assay was developed to study G protein involvement in v-Src-induced PLD activity. Maximal PLD activity in membranes isolated from v-Src-transformed cells was dependent upon both GTP and cytosol. In this report, we present three lines of evidence demonstrating that v-Src-induced PLD activity is mediated by Ras. First, a neutralizing Ras monoclonal antibody (Y13-259) inhibits PLD activity in membranes isolated from v-Src-transformed Balb/c 3T3 cells. Second, immobilized Ras protein depleted cytosol of the ability to stimulate PLD activity. This effect was dependent upon preloading\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "116\n", "authors": ["219"]}
{"title": "Efficiency enhancement of inverted structure perovskite solar cells via oleamide doping of PCBM electron transport layer\n", "abstract": " An amphiphilic surfactant, oleamide, was applied to dope the PCBM electron transport layer (ETL) of inverted structure perovskite solar cells (ISPSCs), resulting in a dramatic efficiency enhancement. Under the optimized oleamide doping ratio of 5.0 wt %, the power conversion efficiency of the CH3NH3PbIxCl3-x perovskite-based ISPSC device is enhanced from 10.05% to 12.69%, and this is primarily due to the increases of both fill factor and short-circuit current. According to the surface morphology study of the perovskite/PCBM bilayer film, oleamide doping improves the coverage of PCBM ETL onto the perovskite layer, and this is beneficial for the interfacial contact between the perovskite layer and the Ag cathode and consequently the electron transport from perovskite to the Ag cathode. Such an improved electron transport induced by oleamide doping is further evidenced by the impedance spectroscopic study\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "115\n", "authors": ["219"]}

Several government-furnished datasets, which were collected through the infrared spectrum method, were thoroughly analyzed. Two similarity measures-the spectral angle mapper and spectral information divergence-were investigated in order to provide a quantitative comparison basis with respect to the performance of the applied spectral unmixing methods in the existence of similar and distinct agents. The use of the similarity measures provided valuable information about the signature characteristics of the agents, which led to a better understanding about the capabilities of the investigated methods.

{"title": "Does psychological need satisfaction matter when environmental or financial safety are at risk?\n", "abstract": " Grounded in self-determination theory, the present study addressed the question whether the relation between satisfaction of the psychological needs for relatedness, competence, and autonomy and well-being would be constrained by satisfaction of the need for safety. In Study 1, we investigated environmental safety in a sample of young adults (N\u252c\u00e1=\u252c\u00e1224) in South Africa, a country known for its low public safety. In Study 2, we focused on financial safety within a socio-economically deprived adult Chinese sample (N\u252c\u00e1=\u252c\u00e1357). Although safety satisfaction yielded a positive relation to well-being in both studies, satisfaction of the psychological needs contributed to well-being above and beyond safety satisfaction and its contribution was not dependent upon the level of safety satisfaction. Further, across both studies, individuals high in safety satisfaction desired less psychological need satisfaction.

{"title": "HaploMerger: reconstructing allelic relationships for polymorphic diploid genome assemblies\n", "abstract": " Whole-genome shotgun assembly has been a long-standing issue for highly polymorphic genomes, and the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies has made the issue more challenging than ever. Here we present an automated pipeline, HaploMerger, for reconstructing allelic relationships in a diploid assembly. HaploMerger combines a LASTZ-ChainNet alignment approach with a novel graph-based structure, which helps to untangle allelic relationships between two haplotypes and guides the subsequent creation of reference haploid assemblies. The pipeline provides flexible parameters and schemes to improve the contiguity, continuity, and completeness of the reference assemblies. We show that HaploMerger produces efficient and accurate results in simulations and has advantages over manual curation when applied to real polymorphic assemblies (e.g., 4%\u0393\u00c7\u00f45% heterozygosity).

The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of miR-23a in modulating RPE cell survival and gene expression in response to oxidative damage.Methods.: The expression level of miR-23a was measured in macular retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells of donor eyes with aged-related macular degeneration (AMD) and age-matched normal eyes by using qRT-PCR. Cultured human ARPE-19 cells were transfected with miR-23a mimic or inhibitor. Cell viability was assessed by the MTT assay. Apoptosis was determined by incubating cells with hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) or t-butylhydroperoxide (tBH). Caspase-3 activity and DNA fragmentation were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The protein relevant to apoptosis, such as Fas expression level, was analyzed by Western blot analysis.Results.: miR-23a expression was significantly downregulated in macular RPE cells from AMD eyes. H 2 O 2-induced ARPE-19 cell death and apoptosis were increased by an miR-23a inhibitor and decreased by an miR-23a mimic. Computational analysis found a putative target site of miR-23a in the 3\u0393\u00c7\u2593 UTR of Fas mRNA, which was verified by a luciferase reporter assay. Forced overexpression of miR-23a decreased H 2 O 2 or tBH-induced Fas upregulation, and this effect was blocked by downregulation of miR-23a.Conclusions.: The protection of RPE cells against oxidative damage is afforded by miR-23a through regulation of Fas, which may be a novel therapeutic target in retinal degenerative\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "102\n", "authors": ["219"]}

The detailed regulation of this process remains unclear. We report here that golli protein, an alternatively spliced product of the myelin basic protein gene, plays a critical role in regulating calcium influx in T cells. Golli-deficient T cells were hyperproliferative and showed enhanced calcium entry upon T cell receptor stimulation. We further found that golli regulates calcium influx in T cells through the inhibition of the store depletion-induced calcium influx. Mutation of the myristoylation site on golli disrupted its association with the plasma membrane and reversed its inhibitory action on Ca2+ influx, indicating that membrane association of golli was essential for its inhibitory action.

The composition and microstructure of the coatings have been analyzed by using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and conventional and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). XRD analysis shows that the preferential orientation growth along the (111) direction is reduced in the multilayer coatings. TEM analysis reveals that the grain size of the coatings decreases with increasing bilayer number. HRTEM imaging of the multilayer coatings shows a high density misfit dislocation between the TiN and TiAlN layers. The cross-plane thermal conductivity of the coatings was measured by a pulsed photothermal reflectance technique. With\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "81\n", "authors": ["219"]}

Bortezomib has been proposed to stimulate autophagy, but scientific observations did not always support this. Interactions between ERK activity and autophagy are complex and not completely clear. Autophagy proteins have recently been shown to regulate the functions of ERK, and ERK activation has been found to induce autophagy. On the other hand, sustained activation of ERK has also been shown to inhibit the maturation step of the autophagy process. In this study, we sought to identify the mechanism of autophagy regulation in cancer cells treated with bortezomib. Our results indicate that bortezomib blocked the autophagic flux without inhibiting the fusion of the autophagosome and lysosome.

In our proposed structure, the period of the T-shaped structures becomes less and the multiple LSPP peaks are suppressed, which result in the sideband of absorption peaks very low.

A TaqMan PCR assay based on the gyrase B gene (gyrB) sequence of V. parahaemolyticus was developed for quantitative detection of V. parahaemolyticus in seafood. The study involving 27 V. parahaemolyticus and 10 strains of other species indicated that the real-time PCR test was highly specific. The sensitivity of the assay was approximately a single CFU per PCR in pure culture and six to eight CFU per PCR in spiked raw oyster, respectively. Real-time PCR values of artificially inoculated oyster homogenates correlated well with plate counts determined using culture methods. A total of 300 seafood samples were analyzed and 78 (26%) of these samples were positive for V. parahaemolyticus using a conventional culture method and 97 (32.3%) using the real-time PCR assay.

{"title": "Learning kernels with radiuses of minimum enclosing balls\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we point out that there exist scaling and initialization problems in most existing multiple kernel learning (MKL) approaches, which employ the large margin principle to jointly learn both a kernel and an SVM classifier. The reason is that the margin itself can not well describe how good a kernel is due to the negligence of the scaling. We use the ratio between the margin and the radius of the minimum enclosing ball to measure the goodness of a kernel, and present a new minimization formulation for kernel learning. This formulation is invariant to scalings of learned kernels, and when learning linear combination of basis kernels it is also invariant to scalings of basis kernels and to the types (eg, L1 or L2) of norm constraints on combination coefficients. We establish the differentiability of our formulation, and propose a gradient projection algorithm for kernel learning. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms both SVM with the uniform combination of basis kernels and other state-of-art MKL approaches.", "num_citations": "56\n", "authors": ["219"]}

{"title": "Intravenous administration of Gd-DTPA prior to DWI does not affect the apparent diffusion constant\n", "abstract": " MRI measurements of water diffusion and blood perfusion are increasingly used for the evaluation of organ functionality and tissue viability (e.g., in tumors). While diffusion-weighted imaging is performed without contrast agents, measurement of blood perfusion is normally performed based on the administration of paramagnetic substances such as gadolinium diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA). Simultaneous measurements of these two parameters are often preferred. However, it may be argued that Gd-DTPA causes constriction of small blood vessels or alters hemodynamic parameters such as blood viscosity, thereby corrupting subsequent measurements of the apparent diffusion constant (ADC).

However, the role of SATB1 in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) remains unknown. In the present study, we sought to investigate the contribution of aberrant SATB1 expression in the progression of NPC and its association with the Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP-1). Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to detect SATB1 and LMP-1 protein in clinical samples, and the association of SATB1 protein expression with patient clinicopathological characteristics and LMP-1 expression were analyzed. SATB1 expression profiles were evaluated in well-differentiated NPC cell line CNE1, poorly-differentiated CNE2Z, undifferentiated C666-1 and immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelia NP-69 cells using quantitative RT-PCR, western blotting and fluorescent staining. After inhibition the SATB1 expression by using SATB1 specific small interfering RNA in these cell lines, the change of cell proliferation was investigated by western blotting analysis of PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) expression and CCK-8 assay, and the cell migration was assessed by Transwell migration assay. Finally, the expressions of SATB1 and PCNA were examined in CNE1 cells that forced LMP-1 expression by fluorescent staining and RT-PCR.

Our present study investigated the pattern of genetic variation and differentiation among five natural populations of H. rhamnoides, occurring along an altitudinal gradient that varied from 1,800 to 3,400 m above sea level in the Wolong Natural Reserve, by using ISSR markers. Based on fingerprinting patterns generated by fifteen primers, high levels of genetic variation were present within populations and subpopulations. Substantial genetic divergence was observed among populations, and also among female and male subpopulations, the GST values equaling 0.182, 0.222, and 0.238, respectively. Such considerable divergence present among populations and subpopulations may be caused by complex topography which effectively restricts gene flow, and by variable climatic conditions at different altitudes which may cause varying selective pressures. A significantly positive correlation between genetic and altitudinal distances was detected for the five populations and female subpopulations of H. rhamnoides. The cluster analysis including all populations or male subpopulations resulted in three altitude groups. Our results suggest that altitudinal gradients may be the prime cause affecting the genetic variation pattern of different populations and subpopulations in H. rhamnoides in the Wolong Nature Reserve, Southwest China.", "num_citations": "34\n", "authors": ["219"]}

The results showed Nanhaipotamon to be a monophyletic taxon with four clades which correspond to the topography of the coastal region of southeastern China and Taiwan Island. Mountains appear to play an important role in the distribution. The genus occurs only from east of the Wuyishan Range (Zhejiang and Fujian) and south of the Nanling Range (Guangdong) in southern China, and is also present west of the Central Range in Taiwan. The molecular and geological data suggest that Nanhaipotamon originated in an area between the Wuyishan and Nanling\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "30\n", "authors": ["219"]}

{"title": "The evolution of vertebrate tetraspanins: gene loss, retention, and massive positive selection after whole genome duplications\n", "abstract": " The vertebrate tetraspanin family has many features which make it suitable for preserving the imprint of ancient sequence evolution and amenable for phylogenomic analysis. So we believe that an in-depth analysis of the tetraspanin evolution not only provides more complete understanding of tetraspanin biology, but offers new insights into the influence of the two rounds of whole genome duplication (2R-WGD) at the origin of vertebrates. A detailed phylogeny of vertebrate tetraspanins was constructed by using multiple lines of information, including sequence-based phylogenetics, key structural features, intron configuration and genomic synteny. In particular, a total of 38 modern tetraspanin ortholog lineages in bony vertebrates have been identified and subsequently classified into 17 ancestral lineages existing before 2R-WGD. Based on this phylogeny, we found that the ohnolog retention rate of tetraspanins after 2R-WGD was three times as the average (a rate similar to those of transcription factors and protein kinases). This high rate didn't increase the tetrapanin family size, but changed the family composition, possibly by displacing vertebrate-specific gene lineages with the lineages conserved across deuterostomes. We also found that the period from 2R-WGD to recent time is controlled by gene losses. Meanwhile, positive selection has been detected on 80% of the branches right after 2R-WGDs, which declines significantly on both magnitude and extensity on the following speciation branches. Notably, the loss of mammalian RDS2 is accompanied by strong positive selection on mammalian ROM1, possibly due to gene loss-induced\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "29\n", "authors": ["219"]}

However, the role of SnoN in the regulation of TGF-\u256c\u2593/Smad signaling in DN is still unclear. In this study, diabetic rats were randomly divided into a diabetic control group (DC group) and a proteasome inhibitor (MG132) diabetes therapy group (DT group). Kidney damage parameters and the expression of SnoN, Smurf2, and TGF-\u256c\u2593 were observed. Simultaneously, we cultured rat glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs) stimulated with high glucose, and SnoN and Arkadia expression were measured.

However, these changes diminished after treatment with MG132.

In this setting, the learning system is dealing with samples and labels provided by multiple teachers, who in common cases, are non-expert. Their labeling styles and behaviors are usually diverse, some of which are even detrimental to the learning system. Thus, simply putting them together and utilizing the algorithms designed for single-teacher scenario would be not only improper, but also damaging. The problem calls for more specific methods. Our work focuses on a case where the teachers are composed of good ones and irresponsible ones. By irresponsible, we mean the teacher who takes the labeling task not seriously and label the sample at random without inspecting the sample itself. This behavior is quite common when the task is not attractive enough and the teacher just wants to finish it as soon as possible. Sometimes, the irresponsible teachers could take a considerable part among all the teachers. If we do not take out their effects, our learning system would be ruined with no doubt. In this paper, we propose a method for picking out the good teachers with promising experimental results.

{"title": "A dual-porosity reservoir model with an improved coupling term\n", "abstract": " A new dual-porosity model is developed for single-phase flow in fractured/porous media. As in the commonly-used approach, flow is assumed to take place through the fracture network, and between the fractures and matrix blocks. The matrix blocks are treated in a lumped-parameter manner, with a single average pressure used for each matrix block. However, instead of assuming that fracture/matrix flux is proportional to the difference between the fracture pressure and matrix pressure at each point, as in the Warren-Root model, a nonlinear equation is used which accurately models the flux at both early and late times. This flux equation is verified against analytical solutions for spherical blocks with prescribed pressure variations on their boundaries. This equation is then used as a source/sink term in the numerical simulator TOUGH. The modified code allows more accurate simulations than the conventional Warren-Root method, and with a large savings in computational time compared to methods which explicitly discretize the matrix blocks.", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["219"]}

According to the principle of long-range dependence analysis of time series based on Hurst coefficient, as well as the R/S analysis and the fractional Brownian motion theory, a hydrological alteration analysis method was proposed which could identify and test the alteration of time series and its alteration degree on the whole. Firstly, the R/S analysis method was used to calculate the Hurst coefficient of time series and its correlation function value.

METHODS: The expression of CAS protein in HCC and its paracarcinoma tissues, non-tumor liver cirrhosis and hepatitis tissues were detected by immunohistochemistry. Meanwhile, HBsAg, HBcAg and HBV DNA in HCC tissues with HBV infection were examined by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization respectively. RESULTS: The expression of CAS protein was significantly higher in HCC than in its paracarcinomas tissues (P< 0.01), and higher in paracarcinomas tissues than in non-tumor liver cirrhosis and hepatitis tissues (P< 0.01). Poorly differentiated tumors immunochemically stained stronger than moderately or well differentiated (P< 0.01). CAS protein expression was significantly higher in HBV-infected HCC tissues than that of in non-HBV infection (P< 0.01). Meanwhile, in HBV-infected HCC tissues, the staining intensity score of CAS protein in HBV DNA positive HCC tissues was significantly higher than HBV DNA negative tissues (P< 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Higher expression of CAS protein is found in HCC tissues, and the intensity of CAS protein expression is related closely to tumor differentiation. We suggested that CAS protein might serve as a marker for HCC diagnosis and differentiation estimation, and deduced that CAS might play an important role in the initiation of HBV infection associated HCC through upregulating expression of CAS.", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["219"]}

Most TRIAC dimmable LED drivers use bleeding circuits to help supply enough holding current in order to keep the TRIAC on.

This paper proposes a new dimming approach that allows the dimmer to turn off if the dimmer current drops below the holding threshold. The input capacitance is actively discharged by the boost circuit. The boost operation restores the input phase without keeping the TRIAC conduction. Therefore it avoids the multi-firing and dimmer turn-off inconsistency. Both the bleeding and holding functions are integrated into the boost circuit.", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["219"]}

{"title": "Anti-inflammatory effect of emodin on lipopolysaccharide-induced keratitis in Wistar rats\n", "abstract": " Emodin, a major bioactive extract of several Chinese herbs, has been shown to have a number of biological activities including antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, anti-fibrosis etc. In the present study, we investigated the effects of emodin as an anti-inflammatory agent on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced keratitis in Wistar rats. Clinical score, slit-lamp microscope were used to determine corneal inflammatory response. Corneal structure was observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining and transmission electron microscopy. Messenger ribonucleic acid levels of tight junction protein and cytokines were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u256c\u2551B) was detected with Western blot. We found that disorganized corneal tissue and cellular structures were observed in keratitis rats and emodin could deduce inflammatory response and improve corneal\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["219"]}
{"title": "Sources of value gains in minority equity investments by private equity funds: Evidence from block share acquisitions\n", "abstract": " Using block share acquisitions made by private equity (PE) funds, we examine the sources of value gains in PE minority equity investments. We find that compared with non-PE acquirers, PE acquirers are more likely to place representatives with finance experience or those with experience in the target's industry on the target's board when the need for target oversight and/or advice is higher. The targets in PE acquisitions, particularly poorly performing targets, targets with high R&D intensity, and targets with PE-appointed directors who have experience in the target's industry, realize both higher announcement returns and better post-acquisition operating performance than do targets in non-PE acquisitions. These findings suggest that the governance and operational engineering that PE acquirers apply to their targets constitutes important sources of value creation in PE minority equity investments.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["219"]}
{"title": "Decreased effective connectivity from cortices to the right parahippocampal gyrus in Alzheimer's disease subjects\n", "abstract": " The purpose of this study was to detect effective connectivity (EC) changes in the default mode network and hippocampus network in 20 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 20 cognitively normal (CN) subjects, using multivariate Granger causality. The authors used the maximum coefficients in the multivariate autoregression model to quantitatively measure the different EC strength levels between the CN and AD groups. It was demonstrated that the EC strength difference can classify AD from CN subjects. Further, the right parahippocampal gyrus (PHP_R) showed imbalanced bidirectional EC connections. The PHP_R received weaker input connections from the neocortices, but its output connections were significantly increased in AD. These findings may provide neural physiological mechanisms for interpreting AD subjects' memory deficits during the encoding processes.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["219"]}

Our study focused on the evolution of cohesion time and remaining percentage of TTCP/DCPA phosphate cement with changing factors in order to uncover the dependence of the cohesion of CPC on setting solutions and incubation liquids. Several factors were considered, including incubation liquids, concentration of setting solutions, powder to liquid (P/L) ratio, and polymer additive in setting solution. Results showed that the total ion osmotic pressure of both setting solutions and incubation solutions had significant influence on cohesion. Using physiological saline and simulation body fluid as incubation liquids indicated that the species of ions sometimes had much more profound effect on cohesion.

The results are as follows:(1) The variations of atmospheric circulation and rainfall in China are characterized by interannual and interdecadal scales. The variations of atmospheric circulation and rainfall are composed of interannual and interdecadal variations. It is necessary to separate those two time scales when climate changes and forecast are studied.(2) The variations of China rainfall are due to the interaction of multi-factors rather than single factors.

Platelet (111In) and fibrin (125I) deposition was assessed on ePTFE surfaces in the presence and relative absence of vWf, achieved by use of polyclonal anti-vWf antibody (anti-vWf Ab). A total of 29 perfusions were performed. Increasing shear rate was associated with greater platelet deposition in the presence of vWf (P < 0.001). This shear-dependent rise in platelet deposition was not observed when vWf was blocked by anti-vWf Ab (P < 0.1), confirming the role of vWf in platelet deposition at high shear rates. Fibrin deposition increased with increasing shear rate in the presence of vWf (P < 0.01). Inhibiting vWf\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["219"]}

{"title": "k-dominant skyline queries on incomplete data\n", "abstract": " The skyline query has been extensively explored as one of popular techniques to filter uninteresting data objects, which plays an important role in many real-life applications such as multi-criteria decision making and personalized services. This query has also been incorporated into commercial database systems for supporting preference queries. However, a skyline query may retrieve too many objects to analyze intensively especially for high-dimensional datasets. As a result, k-dominant skyline query has been introduced to control the number of the objects retrieved. Existing algorithms for k-dominant skyline queries only aim at complete data, which is not well-suited for incomplete data, even though incomplete data is pervasive in scientific research and real life, due to delivery failure, no power of battery, accidental loss, etc. In this paper, we systematically study the problem of k-dominant skyline queries on\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["219"]}

This study is completed in complex domain, because of the presence of the non-proportional damping caused by the dampers utilized in sub-systems. The sub-systems constructed herein could degenerate to the conventional supports and sub-systems, and be arbitrarily placed. Accordingly, the solution is also suitable for multi-span beams. The argument principle method (APM), which does not need initial values and iteration, is employed to solve the characteristic equation in complex domain. Nevertheless, the presence of multi-valued square root functions due to the axial loading renders the function non-analytic in complex domain. A variable substitution method, in which the main branch of logarithmic function is chosen, is proposed to solve this problem.

A model for its ability to recognize tRNATrp in B. subtilis was proposed by using computer modelling. This was based on the the fact that there is high homology among bacterial TrpRSs [Chen, Jiang, Jin and Wang (2001) Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sinica 33, 687\u0393\u00c7\u00f4690], in which the enzyme dimer binds to two tRNATrp molecules and each tRNATrp is bound to two different domains across the surface of the dimer. In this work, three deletion mutants of TrpRS were constructed and their products were purified. After determining the kinetic parameters of the mutants in the two-step reaction, it was found that the relative activities of wild-type and mutant enzymes had changed little in the ATP-pyrophosphate exchange reaction. In contrast, the activities of three mutant proteins were much decreased in the tRNATrp aminoacylation assay\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["219"]}

Several members of this family, including IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3 and IFIT5, have been heavily studied in mammals. Avian species contain only one family member, IFIT5, and little is known about the role of this protein in birds. In this study, duck IFIT5 (duIFIT5) full-length mRNA was cloned by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of the cDNA ends (RACE). Based on the sequence obtained, we performed a series of bioinformatics analyses, and found that duIFIT5 was most similar to homologs in other avian species. Also, duIFIT5 contained eight conserved TPR motifs and two conserved multi-domains (TPR_11 and TPR_12). Finally, we used duck hepatitis virus type 1 (DHV-1) and polyriboinosinicpolyribocytidylic acid (poly (I:C)) as a pathogen or a pathogen-associated molecular pattern induction to infect three-day-old domestic ducklings. The liver and spleen were collected to detect the change in duIFIT5 transcript level upon infection by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). DuIFIT5 expression rapidly increased after DHV-1 infection and maintained a high level, while the transcripts of duIFIT5 peaked at 8h after poly (I:C) infection and then returned to normal. Taken together, these results provide a greater understanding of avian IFIT5.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["219"]}
{"title": "Identification of biomarkers for diagnosis of gastric cancer by bioinformatics\n", "abstract": " Background: We aimed to discover potential gene biomarkers for gastric cancer (GC) diagnosis. Materials and Methods: Genechips of 10 GC tissues and 10 gastric mucosa (GM, para-carcinoma tissue, normal control) tissues were generated using an exon array of Affymetrix containing 30,000 genes. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between GC tissues and normal control were identified by the Limma package and analyzed by hierarchical clustering analysis. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses were performed for investigating the functions of DEGs. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was performed to measure the effects of biomarker candidates for diagnosis of GC. Results: Totals of 896 up-regulated and 60 down-regulated DEGs were identified to be differentially expressed between GC samples and normal control. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that DEGs were highly differentially expressed and most DEGs were up-regulated. The most significantly enriched GO-BP term was revealed to be mitotic cell cycle and the most significantly enriched pathway was cell cycle. The intersection analysis showed that most significant DEGs were cyclin B1 (CCNB1) and cyclin B2 (CCNB2). The sensitivities and specificities of CCNB1 and CCNB2 were both high (p< 0.0001). Areas under the ROC curve for CCNB1 and CCNB2 were both greater than 0.9 (p< 0.0001). Conclusions: CCNB1 and CCNB2, which were involved in cell cycle, played significant roles in the progression and development of GC and these genes may be potential biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of GC.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["219"]}

The selection process operates on an extended sequence of triangles annotated by test planes, created by our off-line preprocessing stage. Based on these test planes, a simple run-time procedure uses the given viewpoint to select a subsequence of triangles for rasterization. Selected subsequences are statically presorted by depth and contain each input triangle exactly once.

METHODS: Neuron-specific enolase (NSE), chromogranin A (CgA) and synaptophysin (SYN) were detected in 42 cases of NSCLC by using Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Electron microscopy was also used to observe the ultrastructure of NE granule in above specimens. The relationship between the chemotherapeutic responsiveness and the differentiation of NE in carcinoma tissues was evaluated. RESULTS:(1) The positive rate of NE detected by Western blot is higher than that detected by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy.(2) There is no relationship between the expression of NE and the type of lung carcinoma as well as the differentiated degree of carcinoma.(3) The positive rate of three markers detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot methods in the group of responsive to chemotherapy is higher than that in non-responsive group (P< 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There is a high rate of NE differentiation in NSCLC, of which NSE's rate is highest, SYN takes second place, and CgA's rate is lowest. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot method are both very useful for the diagnosis of NE differentiation in NSCLC. The sensitivity of Western blot is higher than immunohistochemistry.

In biotechnological or bioremediation processes it is often the aim to promote biofilm formation, and maintain active, high density biomass. In other situations, biofouling can seriously restrict effective heat transport, membrane processes, and potentate macrofouling with loss of transportation efficiency. Heterogeneous distribution of microbes and/or their metabolic activity can promote microbially influenced corrosion (MIC) which is a multibillion dollar problem. Consequently, it is important that biofilm microbial ecology be understood so it can be manipulated rationally. It is usually simple to select organisms that form biofilms by flowing a considerably dilute media over a substratum, and propagating the organisms that attach. To examine the biofilm most expeditiously, the biomass accumulation, desquamation, and metabolic activities need to be monitored on-line and non-destructively. This on-line monitoring becomes even more valuable if the activities can be locally mapped in time and space within the biofilm.

{"title": "A Lake Eutrophication Stochastic Assessment Method by Using Bayesian-Formula and Its Verification\n", "abstract": " In order to correctly evaluate the trophic state of a lake and then to establish scientific basis for the prevention of lake eutrophication, a lake eutrophication stochastic assessment method (LESAM) by u-sing Bayesian formula is proposed. In this method, according to the maximum likelihood ordering principle, the assessment order of each water quality index of an actual lake was firstly derived through calculating the probability of each of those water quality indices belonging to the assessment order used in the lake eutrophication assessment criteria. Secondly, the assessment order of lake eutrophication is derived by u-sing the weighing average method. The characteristics of LESAM are that the method is simple, and the computation work is moderate. LESAM, together with other two methods, ie the lake eutrophication fuzzy assessment method (LEFAM) and the lake eutrophication gray assessment method (LEGAM), has been tested against the measured data of 30 lakes all over the country. It is found that the difference of assessment results among those three methods is not greater than 1 order in 29 lakes, ie 96. 6% of the total lakes. It is concluded that all these three methods (LESAM, LEFAM, and LEGAM) have comparable computation precision. Though in lake eutrophication assessment we can calculate the weight of each water quality index according to the correlation coefficient between each water quality index and chlorophyll, this method only suits the lakes of phytoplankton type. As to the equally weighting average method, it can be used for any kind of lakes. For there is a lot of uncertainty involved both in determining the number and\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["219"]}

The two-sample t-test was conducted to detect the differences in corticostriatal connectivity between 44 cirrhotic patients with hyperintensity at the bilateral GP and 20 healthy controls. Decreased connectivity of the caudate was detected in the anterior/middle cingulate gyrus, and increased connectivity of the caudate was found in the left motor cortex. A reduction in functional connectivity was found between the putamen and several regions, including the anterior cingulate gyrus, right insular lobe, inferior frontal gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus, and anterior lobe of the right cerebellum; increased connectivity was detected between the putamen and right middle temporal gyrus. There were significant correlations between the corticostriatal connectivity and neuropsychological performances in the patient group, but not between the striatal connectivity and GP signal intensity. These alterations in the corticostriatal functional connectivity suggested the\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["219"]}

Success of the VE is highly dependent on participators, and thus selection of partners becomes a crucial issue. Partner selection can be considered as a multi-attribute decision-making problem involving variable criteria and a large number of alternatives. However, decision makers are usually uncertain of their preferences owing to changeable types of criteria and incomplete information on candidates. Therefore, an integrated approach is presented in this paper. First, a decision matrix is flexibly established according to the requirements, and then attribute weights of the decision matrix are calculated using the combination weighting method. Subsequently, the preference-order of candidates is provided to enable decision makers to choose suitable partners using grey\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["219"]}

VISSIM simulations were employed to provide capacity data for probability distribution calibrations. Typical percentile capacities of the lanes were calculated. An evaluation method for reliability of capacity was proposed when arriving volume was considered as a random variable. The sensitivity of reliability of capacity to the mean value of the conflicting pedestrian and bicycle volumes was analyzed. The results show that the impedance effects of pedestrians and bicycles result in great randomness of the exclusive turning lane capacities, but result in relatively little changes of random fluctuations of the shared lane capacities. Normal distribution is applicable to model the probability distribution of the capacities during 10 minutes or longer intervals. With a higher arriving vehicle volume, the reliability of capacity is more sensitive to the mean values of the pedestrian and bicycle volumes.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["219"]}

{"title": "Impacts of mangrove vegetation on macro-benthic faunal communities\n", "abstract": " Mangrove ecosystems, found on marine coasts of the sub-tropics and tropics, have high biological productivity and rich faunal diversity. Mangrove ecosystems provide organic matter and nutrients critical to marine benthic fauna, primarily through litter-fall which is a major component of the detrital food chain. The macro benthic fauna, in turn, provide an important link between mangrove detritus at the base of the mangrove food web and consumers at higher trophic levels. Benthic fauna also may modify the physical and vegetation structure of mangrove ecosystems. Thus, the community of macro benthic fauna needs to be considered in mangrove restoration if holistic ecosystem restoration is to be achieved. This overview examines the current knowledge of macro benthic fauna in mangroves, and the effects of mangrove vegetation on the faunal community in China.

The conclusions are as follows: The slip mass started diversity from source area, scraped rock-soil body of slope surface at the slope area, and then glided or flied into Wenjia gully, continued to downslide along the gully, meanwhile scraped the both valley side slopes. The rock mass occurred five times large-scale collisions with the bank slopes, disintegrated into debris gradually. The debris began to slow down and accumulate in large-scale after the third collision. Finally some sediments reached the valley mouth.

The scheme is aimed to help the networks to recover to service as much as possible after a disaster strike, by maintaining the connection between Base Stations (BSs) and nodes via multi-hopping, where if a node cannot connect to a BS directly, it switches its working mode from cellular mode to ad-hoc mode. A location-based routing protocol has been proposed for building a route from the node to the BS. Simulation results shows that even if only a small part of the nodes can directly connect to a BS, most of the nodes can find a route to a BS via multi-hopping.

Cervical biopsies from 56 HPV-18-positive women with cervical neoplasia were assayed by PCR amplification and sequencing of all eight genes (E1, E2, E4, E5, E6, E7, L1, L2) of the HPV-18 genome. The most frequently observed variation was a C to G transversion at nucleotide 287 of E6, which was found in 48.2% of samples. Analysis of E7 revealed only one specimen as having sequence variations. In addition, we have identified several novel variations: A551C in E6, G6906A in L1, and C4915T and C5147A in L2. The mutations in E6 and L2 are silent, while the E7 mutation results in a single amino acid change. This study complements and expands on previous descriptions of HPV-18 variants. The sequence variation data presented here provides a foundation for future research on HPV-induced oncogenesis and may prove valuable for developing diagnostic probes and in the design of HPV vaccines for targeted populations.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["219"]}

Subsequent routine clinical scans are aligned using the positioning determined by the AAS. To deal with changes in patient position that may occur after the AAS has been collected, we also collect a 1 second multi-slice EPI autocorrect reference (ACR) volume immediately after the AAS.

However, its underlying molecular pathogenesis is still only vaguely understood. Recently, LIM mineralization protein-1 (LMP-1) was reported to be an essential positive regulator of osteoblast differentiation. In the present study, we found that the expression of LMP-1 is downregulated in OS tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Moreover, we restored the expression of LMP-1 through a recombinant adenovirus. Overexpression of LMP-1 inhibited cell proliferation and invasion, arrested cell cycle progression, and induced apoptosis in vitro. Finally, ectopic LMP-1 expression suppressed the expression of Runx2 and BMP-2 in OS cells. These data demonstrate that LMP-1 is an essential tumor suppressor in the OS pathological process, which will provide a new opportunity for discovering and identifying novel effective treatment strategies.

What is more, the inherent frequency of the device can be expanded by adjusting the span between its two piezoelectric vibrators. It is also found that the output of the device depends badly on the external load resistance.

For an interference channel with K links where each link has a channel freedom (independent channels) of L, zero-forcing algorithm can achieve a diversity gain of L-K +1 for each link and a sum diversity gain of K(L - K + 1) for the whole network. The question we want to answer is whether interference alignment can provide a higher diversity gain, which will help determine the optimal DMT of interference channels.

The analyses of dihedral angles and disulfide bonds of lysozyme show that the conformation of lysozyme is severely damaged in the lysozyme-water cluster system compared with that in the lysozyme-water system. This difference can be attributed to the formation of larger number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between lysozyme and water cluster.

The sand hill at Shaling is situated in Liaohua town of Xingzi county. The relative height of this sand hill is about 100 m and it covers an area of about 10 km2. Ridgslike landform develops on the side facing the Poyang Lake. These ridges trending to merge downwind parallel to the prevailing wind and were assumed to be the sand ridge (longitudinal dune). Although the ridge lines are relatively straight, both the space between contiguous ridges and the length of ridge are different from each other. Based on the wind data measured between 2005-10 and 2006-09, we calculate the bedform trend (132o) with maximum gross normal transport and resultant transport direction (42o) using Trend program. The result demonstrates that only transverse dunes can develop under present wind regime which might be similar to those when ridgelike landform formed because Shaling region is controlled by the funnel effect. Sand mining along the shore expose sections that reveal the sediment structure of the ridgelike landform. Some ridges are composed of two layers, ie the surface layer and the interior layer. The surface layer (about several tens of centimeters in thickness) shows massive structure, while the interior layer shows parallel bedding truncated by the former on both sides of the ridge. This structure indicates the slideface is absent within these ridges, and that these ridges are of erosion landform instead of accumulation landform. The erosion postdates the deposition of the interior layer and predates the deposition of the surface layer. Optically\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["219"]}

Luciferase reporter assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detected the duRIG-I significantly activated NF-\u256c\u2551B and induced the expression of IFN-\u256c\u2593 when polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly[I:C], synthetic double-stranded RNA) challenges  chicken embryonic fibroblasts cells (DF1 cells), while the duRIG-I was inactive in the absence of poly[I:C]. Further analysis revealed that the CARDs (duRIG-I-N) induced IFN-\u256c\u2593 production regardless of the presence of poly[I:C], while the CARD-lacking duRIG-I (duRIG-I-C) was not capable of activating downstream signals. These results indicate that duRIG-I CARD domain plays an important role in the induction of IFN-\u256c\u2593 and provide a basis for further studying the function of RIG-I in avian innate immunity.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["219"]}

Three-dimensional moisture flow simulations are conducted, that show how the stratigraphic units and fault offsets and properties at Yucca Mountain create complex three-dimensional flow patterns. Even for areally uniform infiltration rates, these geological complexities result in large lateral flow components and often concentrated flow into the water table. When the major faults are assumed to act as capillary barriers, moisture buildup occurs close to the faults. Conversely, when the faults are assumed to readily absorb water and allow for vertical migration, lateral flow is greatly enhanced and relatively dry conditions are found in the rock matrix adjacent to the faults. These results suggest that careful observations of saturations and rock matrix conditions in rock masses near major faults may help determine the hydrological characteristics of the faults.

The model was developed based on three behavioral characteristics of human travel. First, as income grows, demand for more and faster mobility increases. Second, on average, individuals allocate 1-1.5 hours per capita per day for travel. Third, people allocate 10-15% of per capita personal income for transportation related expenses. Measured by person-kilometers of travel (PKT), the total mobility demand in the Triangle region is projected to grow nearly four times from 480 billion in year 2000 to 1.8 trillion in year 2050. Per capita PKT is expected to increase from 32,700 to 61,000 for the same time period. The projections show that more than 70% of the year 2050 travel demand likely comes from highspeed travel at 600 km per hour..

Oxygen isotope stratigraphy indicates that the core spans a time period of 480 ka. Magnetic susceptibility curve displays glacial-interglacial variations in general, but with prominent peaks. Ten out of thirteen MS peak layers, which are thicker than 4 cm, correlate well with the volcanic ash layers recognized in core MD972142 offshore northwestern Palawan. The result indicates that the volcanic material from the Philippine seismic zone could have reached the western part of the South China Sea during the last 480 ka. The content of size fraction 16\u256c\u255dm is relatively high in the layers of high MS values. In addition, grain size distribution of these layers shows distinct double-mode, indicating input from volcanic activities. MS and grain size features of the sediments can be used as an indicator of volcanic activities, which otherwise can't be examined easily by naked-eye.

The result shows that the friction-induced vibration is stationary during the whole process from its initial generation to disappearance. It suggeststhat no nonlinear factor is involved during the formation and disappearance of friction-induced vibration. The physical phenomenon correlated with this characteristic is also discussed.

A small amount of Mg can prolong the secondary and tertiary stages of creep, thus resulting in increases of stress rupture life and ductility for 1.5-2.5 and 2-3 times respectively. The optimum content of Mg will be moved to lower level by the high temperature long time exposure. Magnesium behavior in both alloys has been illustrated as equilibrium segregation to grain boundaries by AES, IMA and thin foil TEM analyses. The segregation rate of Mg has been demonstrated to be very slow. Magnesium can also refine grain boundary carbide M6C and depress grain boundary cellular precipitation of delta-Ni3Nb in GH220 and GH169 respectively.

Enzyme kinetics parameters Ki and IC50 values were estimated to determine the types and strength of inhibition. ctDNA could specifically inhibit the metabolism of CYP2C9 probe substrates, with the IC50= 0.9955 \u252c\u2561g/ml, while it was not able to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 (IC50> 100\u252c\u2561g/ml). The results showed that ctDNA was a potent inhibitor of CYP2C9 enzyme, and has the metabolic interaction potential with the model drugs which are metabolism substrates of CYP2C9. The inhibition mechanism study suggested ctDNA may inhibit CYP2C9 by decreasing the activity of CYP450 reductase.

The robust stability is required to design ABS with respect to these uncertain parameters. Descriptor representation and linear fractional transformation (LFT) are adopted to obtain an equivalent polytopic representation of dynamics, which is multi-affine to the uncertain parameters.

As an alternative to diagonal left-turns, Copenhagen Left operations can be used, in which left-turning bicyclists are required to go straight along with through automobiles from the same approach, stop, wait for the green interval for the cross street, and then go straight along the cross street to finish the maneuver. The objective of this study was to compare Copenhagen Left with diagonal left-turn maneuver in terms of impacts on capacity of automobile traffic and delay of bicyclists. To this end, an analytical capacity model was developed based on the observed behavioral patterns of automobiles when impeded by diagonally left-turning bicyclists. Micro-simulation models were used to assess delays incurred to bicyclists under both Copenhagen Left and diagonal left-turn operations. Numerical results evidenced that the capacities estimated by the proposed model were consistent with micro-simulation method. While Copenhagen Left enhances capacities of automobiles, it is not universally appropriate for all situations. Copenhagen Left can considerably increase delay for left-turning bicyclists at low-volume, small-sized intersections, which may lead to low compliance rate by bicyclists. A successful implementation of Copenhagen Left does not rely only on proven operational benefits, but also on sufficient storage space for the resulting standing bicyclists, clear pavement striping and signage, and effective education for the traveling public.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["219"]}

Thrombolytic therapy for critical pulmonary embolism in nephrotic syndrome patients was rarely reported and remains controversial in the regimen selection so far. We reported a case of fatal pulmonary embolism, complicating in hepatitis B virus-associated nephrotic syndrome. The patient presented with chest pain, hemoptysis and shortness of breath on admission and his initial vital signs showed a high risk of developing hypotension. Urgent radiological examinations confirmed massive embolisms in bilateral pulmonary arteries. Prompt thrombolytic therapy was performed right after the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism with an intravenous infusion of urokinase (20 000 U/kg) in 2 h.

{"title": "Impact of solar forcing on thermospheric densities and spacecraft orbits from CHAMP and GRACE\n", "abstract": " The thermosphere is the outer gaseous shell of a planet\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s atmosphere that exchanges energy with the space plasma environment. The energy deposition of solar irradiation and magnetospheric inputs into the upper atmosphere can change the thermospheric density significantly. From a practical standpoint, unanticipated changes in the density of the thermosphere cause satellites to deviate from their anticipated paths, or ephemerides. Many studies have been pursued to investigate the variations of thermospheric densities caused by solar forcing, which includes solar irradiation and magnetospheric energy deposition [1-12]. However, the quantitative examination of the impact of thermospheric density changes associated with solar forcing on satellite orbits is rare, given that the simultaneous measurements of thermospheric density and precise tracking data of satellite are sparse.Recently, we utilized the measurements obtained from the Challenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites to study the impact of solar irradiation and solar wind forcing on thermospheric density and satellite orbits as well [eg, 13-14]. The CHAMP and GRACE satellites provided simultaneous observations for both thermospheric density and satellite orbit data. The CHAMP satellite was launched in July 2000 at 450 km altitude in a near-circular orbit with an inclination of 87.3. Meanwhile, two identical satellites GRACE-A and GRACE-B were launched in March 2002 at approximately 500 km altitude, in near-circular 89.5 inclination orbits with GRACE-B following approximately 220 km behind GRACE-A\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["219"]}

The temperature distribution in the tube wall was obtained. The effects of heat flux at inner wall on heat transfer coefficient and temperature at inner wall were analyzed and corresponding empirical correlations were presented. The heat transfer coefficient of vertical downward flow was compared with that of vertical upward flow. The experimental results show that at subcritical and near critical pressures, dryout and departure from nucleate boiling occur in vertical downward tube. With the increase of inner wall heat flux, heat transfer deterioration occurs ahead and the peak wall temperature increases obviously after heat transfer deterioration. At supercritical pressures, the wall temperature increases slowly with fluid enthalpy when the bulk temperature is lower than the pseudo-critical temperature and increases considerably when the bulk temperature is higher than the pseudo-critical temperature. In the pseudo-critical enthalpy region, the heat transfer is enhanced.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["219"]}
{"title": "Effect of hypoxia on the expression of matrix metalloproteinase and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase mRNA in human periodontal ligament fibroblasts in vitro\n", "abstract": " OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of hypoxia on the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP) in human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (HPDLF). METHODS: HPDLF were cultured in \u256c\u2592-minima essential medium (\u256c\u2592-MEM) and subcultured at confluence. In the hypoxic groups, cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 1% O (2), 5% CO (2), 94% N (2) at 37 C for 12, 24 and 48 h, respectively. In the normoxic control group, cells were incubated under normoxic conditions of 20% O (2), 5% CO (2), 75% N (2). The mRNA expression of MMP and TIMP was measured using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

To minimize the decision-making risk, a computational model of the risk-loss was built, and a new classification algorithm which needs no priori knowledge was given. The algorithm used model conditions to determine the range of parameters value which minimized the risk-loss, then divided the range into several equal grids, got the smallest range of parameters through searching these grids, and the smallest range was the optimal threshold. At last, a three-decision-making classifier was built by using the threshold, and then this classifier and Bayesian classifier were applied to part of UCI data sets.

{"title": "Beaconless location-based routing with signal strength assisted for ad-hoc networks\n", "abstract": " Routing in ad-hoc networks is challengeable due to the mobility of the nodes. Location-based routing protocols, unlike other protocols which rely on flooding, excel in network scalability. Further more, new location-based routing protocols, like BLR[1] , IGF[2], & CBF[3] have been proposed, with the feature of being beaconless, which improve more in terms of scalability and battery consumption. Such beaconless routing protocols can work efficiently in dense network area. However, these protocols' algorithms have no immunity from routing into sparse area. In this article, historical signal strength has been added as a factor into the BLR algorithm, which improves in avoidance of routing into sparse area, and consequently improves the global routing efficiency.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["219"]}

{"title": "Game theoretic behavior features change prediction in hostile environments\n", "abstract": " Prediction of adversarial course of actions (COA) is critical to many applications including: crime prediction, Unmanned  Aerial Vehicle (UAV) threat prediction, and terrorism attack prevention. Researchers have shown that integrating  behavior features (or preferences/patterns/modes) into prediction systems, which utilize random process theory and  likelihood estimation calculations, can improve prediction accuracy. However, these calculations currently assume  behavior features that are static and will not change during a long time horizon, which make such models difficult to  adapt to adversary behavior feature changes. This paper provides an approach for dynamically predicting changes of  behavior features utilizing the tenets of game theory. An example scenario and extensive simulations illustrate the  feature prediction capability of this model.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["219"]}

METHODS: Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury was induced by the occlusion of left anterior descending branch of the coronary artery. Apoptosis was evaluated by DNA laddering assay and the activities of caspase 3, 8, or 9 was measured with Caspase Colorimetric Assay Kit. Expression of heat shock proteins was detected by Western blotting analysis. To explore the effect of heat shock pretreatment on myocardium against apoptosis, mice were pretreated with whole body hyperthermia before the myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. RESULTS: Ischemia-reperfusion injury induced myocardial apoptosis and activation of caspase-3, 8, 9. Heat shock pretreatment induced the expression of several family members of heat shock proteins and inhibited myocardial apoptosis and activation of the above caspases. CONCLUSION: Mitochondria and death receptor signaling pathways play important roles in myocardial apoptosis induced by ischemia-reperfusion injury. Heat shock pretreatment may increase the expression of several HSP, and inhibit the activation of both mitochondria and death receptor signaling pathways and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes induced by myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["219"]}

Both the valence band and the core level peaks of the Si photoemission spectra shift rigidly with increasing Er coverage in the submonolayer region. Upon depositing 0.6 monolayers of Er on the Si (100) surface at room temperature, the surface Fermi level is ultimately pinned at 0.29 eV above its initial value, which is equivalent to a Schottky barrier height of 0.67 eV.

During 7 or 21 (for the carrots experiments) days, respectively, volatilization and mineralization, uptake by plants via roots and via leaves, and conversion to soil-bound and plant-bound residues were determined. Mineralization to 14CO2 within 7 days varied between 17 and 25 %. More than four fifths of the radioactivity left in soil after 7 days was due to unextractable residues. Uptake of 14C into plants mostly was foliar uptake of 14CO2 from the air; bioaccumulation factors of root uptake were below 1 except for barley with a bioaccumulation factor of 2.5. Considerable portions of the radioactivity found in plants were due to unextractable residues.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["219"]}

Employment oppor-tunities have served as a magnet attracting rural minorities and immigrants to urban areas. However, the demand and supply of jobs and the labor force size have not usually been equated either in terms of numbers or skill. Thus, urban areas have high unemployment rates and other concomitant ills. The minority urban community especially suffers from high unemployment, crime, and low quality of life. Urban development strategies have often focused on social pro-grams to upgrade life quality while ignoring the economic aspects of causes. Since minority communities are usually hard hit by urban ills, urban development programs should address the economic issues of jobs and revenue flows as a salve to urban ailments. Expansion of present firm capacity cannot meet job demands because additional economies of scale are not significant. Therefore, additional and new job opportunities are needed. This is why entrepreneurship is of strategic importance.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["219"]}

Here we report that SjE16.7 is a potent macrophage activator, inducing macrophage chemotaxis and stimulating cytokine production. Treatment of murine primary macrophages with SjE16.7 resulted in upregulation of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-12, IL-6 and TNF-\u256c\u2592), as well as phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs).

{"title": "Across scanner platform optimization to enable EUV lithography at the 10-nm logic node\n", "abstract": " EUV lithography is expected to be introduced in volume manufacturing at the 10-nm and 7-nm node. Especially in these first EUV nodes, critical layer patterning will be balanced with the use of ArF immersion. As a consequence a good overlay and placement matching between both lithography methods becomes an enabling factor for EUV. In this paper we present an integral method to optimize critical layer patterning across the EUV and ArF scanner platform, such that good overlay and device pattern placement is achieved. It is discussed that besides classical overlay control methods, also the optimization of the ArF and EUV imaging steps is needed. Best matching is achieved by applying high-order field-to-field overlay corrections for both imaging and overlay.

{"title": "A long-term static immersion experiment on the leaching behavior of heavy metals from waste printed circuit boards\n", "abstract": " Printed circuit boards (PCBs) are the main components of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE). Waste PCBs contain several kinds of heavy metals, including Cu, Pb and Zn. We characterize the leaching of heavy metals (Cu, Pb, Zn and Ni) from waste PCBs in a pH range of 3.0 to 5.6 using a novel approach based on batch pH-static leaching experiments in this work. The results indicate that the leaching behavior of Cu, Pb, Zn and Ni is strongly dependent on pH. Leaching behavior also varies with different pH values and leaching times. The maximum concentrations of Cu, Pb, Zn and Ni in leachate from waste PCBs were 335.00, 17.57, 2.40 and 2.33 mg L\u0393\u00ea\u00c61, respectively.

To determine the present status of Chinese giant salamander resources in this country scientifically, this paper made an investigation on the distribution area and the quantity of giant salamander resources. The distribution area is mainly located at the 14 sites such as Chuandongxia, Yanzi, Quanhe and so on. These sites are flowed across by north and south headstream of Li Water and You Water respectively. The results showed that the distribution area of wild giant salamander in the county is continuously reduced to discontinuous punctuation and the quantity of wild giant salamander resources in this county still declined in recent years which was only about 976 individuals. Cultured Chinese giant salamander mainly located at the Wudaoshui Town and Hurongqiao Villages, its amount increased largely and the quantity was about 26 400. According to the above status, this paper puts forward some effective suggestions to solve these problems. In order to restore the wild giant salamander resources gradually, it must strengthen the protective management, pay great attention to protection of their habitat environment and investigate basic biological knowledge of them, and increase the field releasing quantity of cultured Gaint salamander. At the same time, it should continuously develop the artificial cultivation of Chinese giant salamander as to increase the amount of cultural giant salamander resources.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["219"]}

{"title": "Improved automatic web-page classification by neighbor text percolation\n", "abstract": " Automatic Web document classification is a very important issue to help users effectively find highly relevant information. However, traditional content-analysis schemes suffer a problem that documents that lack rich descriptive content cannot be effectively classified. In this paper, we present an improved classification scheme by incorporating a link-analysis-based method to enrich the textual content with neighbor documents. To study the improvement, we apply our scheme to a typical content-based scheme proposed by Jenkins and Inman (J&I) and have conducted preliminary experiments. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy is elevated from 76.3% to 85%. In addition, only one page cannot be classified in our approach, contrast to the result of four pages in the J&I approach. From the working experience, we believe that the neighbor text percolation scheme can be applied to other content-based approaches.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["219"]}

Two hundred and sixteen patients were recruited with NMIBC who were available for follow-up visits in hospital, including 62 cases treated with partial cystectomy, 90 cases treated with TURBT and 64 cases with holmium laser resection. Analysis was made on the cases with tumor relapse in the two years, on operation time, blood loss, time for indwelling urinary catheter, hospital stay and complications after operation. Results were compared to the clinical efficacy of these operation patterns. It was found that the two-year relapse rate for TURBT group, partial cystectomy group and Holmium laser resection group was 41%, 31%, and 33% respectively, and the difference had no statistical significance (p> 0.05). Both the TURBT group and holmium laser resection group had shorter operation time, hospital stay and time for indwelling urinary catheter as well as much less blood loss when compared with the partial cystectomy group; the difference had statistical significance (p< 0.001). In terms of complications, the TURBT group was likely to induce obturator nerve reflex and bladder perforation while the partial cystectomy group was likely to induce bladder spasm. Therefore, this study presumes that holmium laser resection and TURBT are much safer and quicker for recovery and obviously superior to the partial cystectomy.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["219"]}

METHODS: A total of 103 CHD patients treated in our hospital between October, 2013 and May, 2014 were enrolled, including 39 with stable angina pectoris (SAP), 39 with unstable angina (UA), and 25 with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), with 38 non-CHD volunteers as the control group. The serum levels of ICTP, MMP-2, and MMP-9 were detected in all the subjects using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: No significant difference in serum levels of MMP-2, MMP-9, or ICTP was found between the control and SAP groups or between UA and AMI groups (P> 0.05), but the latter two groups had significantly higher serum levels of MMP-2, MMP-9, and ICTP than the former two groups (P< 0.05). Serum ICTP level was found to negatively correlated with the fibrotic area and positively with the lipid component in the plaques (P< 0.05). Regression analysis revealed significant positive correlations of serum ICTP with MMP-2 and MMP-9 (P< 0.05). CONCLUSION: An elevated serum ICTP level is indicative of the presence of unstable plaques in CHD patients.

The proposed method combines the DE algorithm with the dynamic search strategy, which improves the performance of the algorithm. DE is the main optimizer in the method proposed. While chaotic sequences are applied to obtain the dynamic parameter settings in DE, dynamic search strategy which consists of two steps, global search strategy and local search strategy, is used to improve algorithm efficiency. To accelerate convergence, a new infeasible solution handing method is adopted in the local search strategy; meanwhile, an orthogonal crossover (OX) operator is added to the global search strategy to enhance the optimization search ability. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methods are demonstrated by three test systems, and the simulation results reveal that the IDEBDSS method can obtain better solutions with higher efficiency than the standard DE and other methods reported in the recent literature.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["219"]}

The results of power spectrum analysis show that the annual maximal peak flow series at upper reaches of the Yellow River has a few period harmonics, and they can not pass test of the building-up determinacy model. So it is difficult to forecast the maximum peak flow by establishing determination model. Through the correlativity statistic analysis and grey relational degree computation between macula cyclic change and flood of upper reaches of the Yellow River, the results show that the big dimension weather system of upper reaches of the Yellow River and macula have very good correlativity.

Are there fundamental psychological needs, whose satisfaction is functionally beneficial for human functioning across individuals and cultures?   The present dissertation aims to examine the culture-specific and universal aspects of the role of psychological needs, as postulated in n Self- Determination Theory (SDT, Ryan & Deci, 2000). We focused on three psychological needs, namely, autonomy, relatedness, and competence. After presenting how both perspectives conceive psychological needs, we outline the three main goals of the present dissertation.  First, we focus on autonomy because it is a complex construct that has been used as an umbrella term to denote different concepts in the cross-cultural and adolescent psychology literature (see review in Van Petegem, Vansteenkiste, & Beyers, in press). Before examining whether the benefits of autonomy are culture-bounded or universal, it is critical to be aware of the conceptualizations of autonomy from both sides of the debate as to ensure that the debate is grounded in a shared understanding of the notion of autonomy. To this end, the present dissertation aimed to empirically disentangle the two prevailing concepts and\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["219"]}

There basically are no defects, such as pinholes, on the interface between multilayers and Al alloy substrate and the adhesion is high. The multilayers characterize the obvious layer growth and there is a clear interface between the individual layers. The TiN individual layer in multilayers has obvious (111) preferred grain orientation as same as single TiN film. The TiN individual layer in every modulation period grows in column characteristic. The corrosion potential of polarization curves, electrochemical impedance and radius of capacitive reactance increase respectively, namely, the corrosive resistance of multilayers improves, with shortening the modulation period. The corrosive resistance of the small modulation period films is improved because more interfaces reduce the chance of the contact between the corrosive solution and substrate by decreasing the quantity of penetrating pinholes and defects.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["219"]}

Four societal factors contribute to the trend: increase in dual earner households, advance in information and communications technologies, new concept of arranging work time weekly, and people's changing attitude towards travel. In the field of urban transportation planning, commuting has been studied in individual metropolitan areas in a one-day time frame. LDC/TRC traverse multiple metros and the commuting behavior cannot be better understood without going beyond the one-day convention. Studying LDC/TRC corresponds to the growing interest worldwide in planning for megaregions. Up to date, the phenomenon of weekly commuting has been explored only by a few European researchers in the fields of geography and sociology. This study analyzed LDC/TRC using national datasets available in the US. They are American Travel Survey, National Household Travel Survey, and Census Transportation Planning Package. Further detailed analyses were conducted for the Texas Triangle megaregion. The national travel surveys are helpful in portraying large pictures of LDC/TRC but limited in offering insights into LDC/TRC behavior. Based on the preliminary study, the next phase of the study will conduct qualitative research by interviewing selected LDC/TRC individuals in the Texas Triangle megaregion.\"", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["219"]}

Now child protection is being given more and more attention by car manufacturers. To keep up with global developments, China NCAP (CNCAP) has also started conducting child occupant safety assessment in high speed impact tests from Jan. 2010. SAIC Motor company has carried out a series of CNCAP and Euro NCAP tests using several brands of CRSs: 50kph full frontal rigid barrier (FRB) tests, 64kph offset deformable barrier (ODB) tests, and 50kph moving deformable barrier (MDB) side impact tests. In this paper, safety performance of different types of CRSs were compared on the basis of the test results. Child dummy kinematics and responses were influenced by both the vehicle crash pulse and the safety performance of the CRS itself. The injury assessment values for P3 on the barrier overlap side in the 64kph ODB tests were generally lower than those in the 50kph FRB tests. In front impact tests, the vehicle crash pulse had much more influence on the head acceleration than the chest acceleration, while the chest acceleration was more dependent on the CRS internal restraint system. In the side impact test, the P1. 5 head of the struck side was contained within the boundary of the CRS shell during the entire crash event. The head accelerations for both P1. 5 and P3 dummies in the side impact test were all much better than the threshold value indicated for better performance in Euro NCAP testing.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["219"]}

The sedimentation was mainly represented by the grain size, sorting and shale content, and the diagenesis mainly includes the compaction, pressolution and cementation. Using the method of classic single impedance threshold only resolves the vertical variation of acoustic impedance. As a result, the paper proposes a more effective method of impedance threshold volume.

In order to distinguish the evolution of the local clusters in the cooling process of Al nanowires with different cooling rates, pair analysis technique was employed. The simulation results indicated that the microstructure of the nanowires changed from amorphous to helical multi-shelled structure with the decrease of cooling rate. The helical multi-shelled structure owed some features of amorphous structure, but it was more stable than the later. Moreover, even if the cooling rate decreased to 1\u251c\u00f9 109 K\u252c\u2556 s-1, Al nanowires still kept the helical multi-shelled structure.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["219"]}

METHODS: 53 Chinese adult liver transplant recipients were randomly divided into three groups (group C (0), n= 17; group high level C (2), n= 18; group low level C (2), n= 18). Blood chemistry reflecting heart, liver and renal function and CsA level were examined at certain interval during follow-up. The change of immune status and episodes of rejection were also observed closely. RESULTS: The group low level C (2) had the lowest CsA oral dose (2.51+/-0.37 mg/kg/d), and had significant difference compared with the other groups (P< 0.01). The best liver, heart and renal function was observed in group low level C (2). The CD (4)(+)/CD (8)(+) ratio of group low level C (2) was 1.04+/-0.68, which had no significant difference with C (0) group. The rejection incidence of the three groups had no significant difference. group low level C (2) had highest clinical benefit ratio (72.22%), while the clinical benefit of group high level C (2) is the lowest (11.11%).

Traditional diagnostic tests for V. parahaemolyticus are laborious and always present false negative results. Therefore, it is important to develop a nucleic acid-based test for quantitative detection of V. parahaemolyticus. A TaqMan PCR assay was presented for quantitative detection of V. parahaemolyticus in pure cultures and oysters. The primers and probe were designed according to the gyrase B gene (gyrB) sequence of V. parahaemolyticus strains. Amplification of DNAs from 12 bacterial strains comprising 9 genera showed that all of the strains of V. parahaemolyticus tested (n= 4) were positive and all other species of strains tested (n= 8) were negative. The results of the TaqMan PCR with raw oysters inoculated with V. parahaemolyticus were comparable to those of pure cultures. The sensitivity of the assay was 1 CFU PCR Mixture (-1) and 10 CFU PCR Mixture (-1) in pure culture and inoculated raw oyster, respectively. The correlation rate was 0.99 (gamma2= 0.99).

A mathematical expression describing the protein retention in metal chelate chromatography has been derived. It is proposed that the eluting power of the salt solution can be expressed by the eluent strength exponent epsilon. According to the retention characters of protein under different chromatographic conditions, the interaction between the various metal chelate ligands and proteins is discussed. The protein retention on the metal chelate column is a cooperative interactions of coordination, electrostatic and hydrophobic interaction. For the strong combined metal column with proteins such as IDA-Cu, the coordination is the most important, and the electrostatic interaction is secondary in chromatographic process. However, for the weak combined metal columns with proteins such as IDA-Ni, IDA-Co and IDA-Zn, the electrostatic interaction between the metal chelate ligands and proteins is the chief one, while the coordination is the next in importance. When the mobile phase contains high concentration of salt which can't form complex with the immobilized metal, the hydrophobic interaction between the protein and stationary phase will be increased. As the interaction between the metal chelate ligand and proteins relates to chromatographic operating conditions closely, different elution processes may be selected for different metal chelate columns. The gradient elution is generally performed by the low concentration of salt or different pH for weakly combined columns with\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["219"]}

METHODS: Twenty neonatal rats were randomly divided into 2 groups. Group A: the cardiac myocytes were gained by means of enzymic digestion and tubularis-blowing; Group B: the cardiac myocytes were gained by means of enzymic digestion and rotator-stirring. The cardiac myocytes in both groups were purified by means of differential attachment technique and BrdU inhibition and were identified with immunofluorescence staining. Viability was assessed with trypan blue staining and pulsation was assessed under microscope. RESULTS: The rates of cardiac myocyte's viability, pulsation and purity in group A were (89.90+/-2.92)%,(91.30+/-2.00)% and (94.90+/-1.79)% respectively; The corresponding rates in group B were (94.70+/-2.31)%,(95.00+/-1.24)% and (95.60+/-1.43)% respectively. The rates of cardiac myocyte's viability, pulsation in group B were significantly higher than that of group A, which was statistically different (P> 0.05). The rate of cardiac myocytes purity in group B was a bit higher than group A, but which wasn't statistically different (P< 0.05).

It is emphasized in both Edgewise technique and Begg technique that proper steps should be taken to maintain the anchorage. Generally tip-back bend would be applied to archwire to resist mesial molar tipping. Straight wire appliance is developed from Edge-wise appliance and has been the mainstream technique over decades. In this technique NiTi wires are widely used for alignment of teeth at the initial stage of treatment because of the property of good elasticity. However they are too elastic to be bent which makes it impossible to make use of the classical tip-back bend to preserve molar anchorage. X Buccal Tube (XBT) is developed to solve this dilemma. It is uniquely designed with a tip-back tube and an archwire slot.

METHODS: The isolated strains were identified based on TEF-1alpha gene sequence and morphological characteristics. The whole nucleotide sequence of beta-tubulin gene was analyzed from different sensitive strains by the primers designed according to the nucleotide sequence of beta-tubulin gene from the sequenced strain 7600 of F. verticillioides. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was applied to analyze the expression pattern of beta-tubulin gene from different sensitive strains treated with or without carbendazim. RESULTS: The full-length nucleotide sequence of beta-tubulin gene (Accession Number: JQ026022) was cloned from different sensitive strains of F. fujikoroi, which spanned 1671 bp with 4 introns, encoding 447 amino acids. This gene showed 100% nucleotide sequence homology between sensitive and resistant strains. The expression of the beta-tubulin gene in 2 sensitive strains was significantly higher than 3 resistant strains when these strains were cultured on carbendazim-free media (p= 0.05). Carbendazim at the concentration of their EC50 caused the expression of the gene from the five strains increasing significantly (p= 0.05) in comparison with that of strains treated without carbendazim. However, there was no significant difference between strains when treated with carbendazim.

METHODS: Forty SD male rats were randomly divided into normal control group (n= 10) and model group (n= 30). Type 2 diabetes models were induced by feeding with high-sucrose-high-fat diet and intraperitoneal injecting 25 mg/kg streptozotocin. 20 successful models were rearranged to two groups: diabetic group and GbE treatment group, 10 rats in each. Then the saline and 8 mg/(kg xd) of GbE were respectively intraperitoneal injected, once a day continuously for 8 weeks. Then diaphragm contractility was assessed using Peak twitch tension (Pt), Maximum tetanic tension (P0) and fatigue index (FI) in vitro diaphragm strip preparations. Cytochrome oxidase (CCO), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in diaphragm were detected and the varieties of diaphragm ultrastructure were observed. RESULTS: Compared with control group, Pt, P0 and FI in diabetic group decreased significantly (P< 0.01); the activity of CCO, LDH and SDH in the tissues was more obviously reduced than those in control group (P< 0.01). The ultrastructure in diabetic group under electron microscope indicated that diaphragm mitochondrions swelled and degenerated. The above changes were inhibited by GbE. CONCLUSION: GbE can enhance contraction capacity of diaphragm from type 2 diabetic rats by increasing the aerobic oxidation capacity, glycolytic capacity and the function of respiratory chain.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["219"]}

METHODS: The expression of AT1 and AT2 receptor was detected by immunofluorescence staining. Cultured human skin fibroblasts were treated with Ang II (10 (-9)-10 (-7) mol/L), with or without an AT1 receptor blocker, valsartan or an AT2 receptor antagonist, PD123319. The phosphorylation of Akt was detected by western blotting, and PI3K activity was measured by Assay of PI3-K activity. RESULTS: Immunofluorescence staining showed that cultured fibroblasts derived from hypertrophic scars expressed both AT1 and AT2 receptors. Ang II increased Akt phosphorylation and PI3K activity in cultured hypertrophic scar fibroblasts in a dose-and time-dependent manner. Additionally, Ang II-induced Akt phosphorylation was blocked by wortmannin, a PI3-K inhibitor. This Ang II-activated PI3-K/Akt cascade was significantly inhibited by valsartan, an AT1 receptor specific blocker (P< 0.05), whereas enhanced by PD123319, an AT2 receptor antagonist (P< 0.05).

Results showed that loss of CTC was not detected in the absence of MnO2. But CTC was rapidly degraded along with the generation of Mn2+ in the presence of MnO2, which indicated that this process was an oxidation-reduction reaction. In order to explain the adsorption of CTC on MnO2 surface, two different approaches (filtration and oxalic acid addition) were used to quench the reactions. Oxidation was observed dominantly in the initial stage compared with adsorption, and adsorption become noticeable after the reaction reached an equilibrium level. The reaction rate of CTC increased with the increase of MnO2 initial concentration and temperature of the reaction system. In addition, the reaction rate of CTC also decreased significantly as the pH of reaction mixture increased from 3.77 to 7.41, which was caused by the decreased adsorption of CTC on MnO2 with the increase of pH. Over the entire pH range (3.77-7.41), the speciation of CTC transited from cation and then zwitterion to anion, however, the MnO2 surface exhibited all with negative charges because its zeta-potential (pH point of zero charge) was 2.25. Thus, pH increase would result in the decline of the adsorption force between CTC speciation and the MnO2 surface.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["219"]}

The hydrogeologic settings and the Piper triangular graph reveal that there are 4 types of groundwater in the study area, and the calcium and magnesium concentrations in deep groundwater in the confined Cretaceous aquifer are generally higher than those in groundwater in other aquifers. The hydrogeologic properties of water samples can be identified by the relationships between tritium and the concentrations of other common minerals. Most oxygen and hydrogen isotopes reveal that groundwater in the study area is mainly recharged by permeation of precipitation, but there is somewhat oxygen shift in shallow\" mixed\" groundwater due to the violent evaporation and the change of isotopic compositions. Finally, both the provenances of main water ions and the hydro-geochemical effects involving in the rock leaching, deposition and evaporation in groundwater recharge are analyzed.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["219"]}

The combination of these primarymodes in the airsea system orchestrates a complex climate system. The multi2mode low2frequency variability in SST is investigated based on 22 a SST records from 1982 through 2003. The variation of SST in the past two decades undergoes a different combination of these dom2 inant climate modes over different regions, which leads to an interesting new classification of the global ocean based on the relative importance of these modes. The new classification can provide ideal locations for bettermonitoring of these low2frequencymodes in the scientific proof sense. Moreover, two no2annual variation and 14 no2semiannual variation oceanic points, termed annual and semiannual amphidromes, have been well defined in the AC and SC phase maps.

The relationship between the region of straylight and the positions of the stop aperture is presented for three-mirror optical system used in field bias. It may not depend on the outside baffle to block once straylight when the ratio of block is too small, for example 1/4, and the field angle is large, such as 0.77. Under the condition of not using outside baffle, how to reckon the baffle lengths of the primary mirror and secondary mirror is given to make the linear ratio of block as small as 1/2.6. As the field angles are different between direction of flight and its perpendicularity, the baffle is made non-symmetrical, so the ratio of block may below 1/3.3. The methods on how to reduce the block of the optical system continuously is offered. Finally, the ratio of block drops to 1/3.6.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["219"]}

The results show that different solders have different loops; the shape of the loops will change less, and finally become a line along with the thermal cycle increase. The shear module decreases along with the thermal cycling process. But the creep index of the solder joints is not sensitive to the cycling process, which fluctuates between 5 and 7. Because the elements of the solder and matrix materials diffuse during the process, the voids induced in the solder joints expand. The expansion of the voids will lead to the crystal lattice aberrance of solder crystal.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["219"]}

This study was designed to determine the in vitro anti-tumor efficiency of ADV-TK, a recombinant construct previously developed in our laboratory. METHODS: Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) gene was transduced into 14 types of cultured tumor cells with different histological origins using adenovirus vector followed by ganciclovir (GCV) medication. The killing efficiency was measured using MTT assay. RESULTS: At the dosage of 1x10 (9) viral particles/per well in the presence of 100 microg/ml GCV, ADV-TK/GCV caused effective killing of 11 out of total 14 types of tumor cells with a rate higher than 74%, the other 3 tumor cells, laryngeal epithelial cancer cells (Hep-2), hepatic cancer cells (Bel7402), and human colon cancer cells (HCT-8) were less sensitive to the ADV-TK/GCV treatment with the killing rates of 55.3%+/-2.0%, 61.3%+/-2.0%, and 63.7%+/-2.5%, respectively. Except for Hep-2, the killing efficiency caused by ADV-TK/GCV treatment was similar to that caused by cisplatin at a dosage equal to the in vivo peak concentration (5 microg/ml) in tissue. CONCLUSION: ADV-TK is highly efficient for active killing of tumor cells in vitro and is promising for future clinical application.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["219"]}

METHODS: The model of burn sepsis was replicated by subjecting the rats to 30 percent total body surface area (TBSA) III degree burn followed immediately by administration of endotoxin (6 mg/kg) into the peritoneal cavity. The rats were randomly divided into 2-and 6-hour groups and a normal control group, with 9 rats in each group. The expressions of ubiquitin mRNA in the diaphragmatic muscle was determined with Northern blot analysis. The expressions of ubiquitin protein in the diaphragmatic muscle were assayed with immunohistochemical method. RESULTS: The expressions of the ubiquitin mRNA (2.4 kb and 1.2 kb) in diaphragmatic muscle of burn rats with sepsis were significantly higher than that of normal control group, especially the 2.4 kb stripe (all P< 0.01). A notable increase in the expressions of the ubiquitin mRNA was found in the 6-hour group compared with the 2-hour group (all P< 0.01). The expressions of the ubiquitin protein in diaphragmatic muscle of burn rats with sepsis were significantly increased after injury compared with the normal control group. CONCLUSION: The expressions of mRNA and protein of ubiquitin in diaphragmatic muscle are continuously increased soon after injury, suggesting that the protein degradation rate is increased in burn with sepsis.

This cooperative situation evolved as the Nash equilibrium is basically considered as a long-term sustainable development strategy for species coexistence. A host demands a lambda-free environment by skill improvement for normal growth. Meanwhile, lambda chooses a less virulent strategy to maintain host viability for the sake of its survival. Virulence reduction of lambda enhances the coexistence of lambda and E coli; thus, moderate induction results.

The effects of the oxide additives on to the distribution of organic and inorganic bromine in solid, liquid and gas phases of the pyrolysis products were studied by ion chromatography and oxygen bomb combustion methods. The results indicate that the Fe-based and Ca-based oxides can significantly reduce bromine content in the pyrolysis liquids, with most bromine distributed in the solid phase. Fe3O4 and CaCO3 display better debromination effect than other Fe and Ca oxides. The distribution of bromine in the pyrolysis oil reduces from 72.10% without any oxide to 8.91% and 7.69% with Fe3O4 and CaCO3. The efficiency of organic-inorganic bromine conversion increases from 46.42% to 82.25% and 92.13%, respectively. As a result, 78.74% and 90.84% of bromine exists in pyrolysis residues is inorganic bromine. Meanwhile, the Al-based oxides can obviously increase water content of the pyrolysis liquid. In addition, most bromine in the WPCB including organic bromine in the oil phase and inorganic bromine in the water phases is transferred into the pyrolysis liquid. The types and amount of bromine compounds in the oil phase were analyzed by GC/MS. In conclusion, Fe-based and Ca-based oxides are better for debromination applications comparing to Al-based oxides.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["219"]}

{"title": "Object Retrieval Method Based on Randomized Visual Dictionaries and Contextual Semantic Information\n", "abstract": " There are several problems existing in the conventional bag of visual words methods, such as low time efficiency and large memory consumption, the synonymy and polysemy of visual words, furthermore, they may fail to return satisfactory results if the object region is inaccurate or if the captured object is too small to be represented with discriminative features. An object retrieval method based on randomized visual dictionaries and contextual semantic information is proposed for the above problems. Firstly, E 2 LSH (Exact Euclidean Locality Sensitive Hashing) is used, and a group of scalable random visual vocabularies is generated; then, a new object model consisting of contextual semantic information is devised, which is drawn from the visual elements surrounding the query object; finally, the Kullback-Leibler divergence is introduced as a similarity measurement to accomplish object retrieval.

{"title": "Method of calculating VLBI phase delay based on DOR signal of a satellite\n", "abstract": " In deep space exploration, the VLBI technique is a precise method for the angular measurement, which can give the plane-of-sky position information. The group delay of DOR signal can usually be obtained with an accuracy of nanosecond in the VLBI observation. The accuracy of group delay can bring an orbital error of lunar probe about a hundred meters for a baseline of about 2000 kilometers. Especially in the further deep space exploration, the orbital error will be much larger. A method to calculate the small biased phase delay of VLBI is proposed in this paper in order to improve the accuracy of the orbit and position determination. The small biased phase delay is acquired by using the phase delay with ambiguity approaching the middle of bandwidth synthesis group delay of DOR signal. The method both in continuous and discontinuous observation is feasible, proved by processing the data from CE-2 satellite A DOR experiments. The relationship between the group delay and phase delay is discussed. Both of the closure group delay and the closure phase delay of three baselines of SH-BJ, SH-UR and BJ-UR are calculated, and the errors of them are analyzed. The phases of the carrier and the DOR tones are compared to prove the validity of the method. The phase delay's error, especially the random error, can be reduced. The system error will be acquired hopefully during the further processing of orbital determination.[Fund]: \u03a3\u2555\u00a1\u03c3\u00a2\u255c\u03c4\u00ba\u00e6\u03c3\u00a1\u00aa\u0398\u00d6\u00f3\u03c4\u00d6\u255b\u03a3\u2551\u2551\u03a6\u00ab\u00ed\u03c3\u00ea\u00c6;; \u03c3\u00a2\u255c\u03c3\u00ab\u2562\u03a6\u00e7\u00ac\u03c4\u00e4\u2562\u03c4\u00ba\u00e6\u03c3\u00a1\u00aa\u03c3\u0192\u2551\u0398\u00e7\u00e6 (11273049 11073048);; 863 \u03a6\u00ab\u00ed\u03c3\u00ea\u00c6 (2012AA121603);; \u03c4\u2310\u2551\u0398\u00f9\u2524\u00b5\u00bb\u00bd\u03c4\u2592\u2502\u00b5\u2502\u00f3 VLBI \u0398\u00ff\u2561\u03c3\u00ea\u00f9\u03a6\u00e2\u00ee\u00b5\u00d6\u00bb\u03c3\u20a7\u00ef\u03c3\u00c5\u2556 (XDA04060705);; \u03a3\u2555\u00a1\u03c3\u00a2\u255c\u03c4\u00ba\u00e6\u03c3\u00a1\u00aa\u0398\u00d6\u00f3\u03c3\u2591\u00e4\u03c4\u00f6\u2561\u03c3\u00f1\u2310\u00b5\u00fb\u00e7\u0398\u00e7\u00ec\u03c4\u00e9\u2563\u03c3\u00ab\u20a7\u0398\u00ac\u00ee\u03c3\u00ab\u00f1;; \u03a3\u2555\u00e8\u00b5\u2561\u2556\u03c3\u2555\u00e9\u03c4\u2310\u2551\u0398\u00f9\u2524\u03c3\u00bb\u255d\u03a6\u00ea\u00ac\u03a3\u2555\u00c4\u03c3\u00ab\u00dc\u03a3\u255c\u00ec\u00b5\u00e8\u00c7\u00b5\u00a3\u00bb\u0398\u00e7\u00ec\u03c4\u00e9\u2563\u03c3\u00ab\u20a7\u0398\u00ac\u00ee\u03c3\u00ab\u00f1\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["219"]}

The test results(applicable only to the grooved surface texture adopted herein) show that the normal load has little influence on the friction noise level of the groove-textured surface, but significant influence on that of the smooth surface. Friction noise has a greater tendency to be generated at the groove-textured surface under low normal load.

Long-term evolution (LTE) has been heralded as the new-generation mobile communication standard to meet the demand for high-speed data transmission. But the heavy processing on the user equipment (UE) implies excessive power consumption. Discontinuous reception (DRX) is one of the strategies to combat the problem. With the use of DRX, UE can turn off part of its RF circuit and enter sleep state when not scheduled to receive data from the base station. While saving energy, the approach can lead to delay of packets when they arrive while UE is in sleep state. This paper presents a quantitative analysis of the delay. Simulation results show that the analysis is accurate. The impact of the values of key parameters on delay is also examined.'", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["219"]}

The stress-strain relationship and the characteristics of excess pore water pressure after liquefaction were studied. It is found that the relationship between deviatoric stress and axial strain presented a sigmoid curve; and there is a good linearity relationship between normalized pore water pressure and deviatoric stress. On this basis, a constitutive model of stress-strain relationship and a dissipation model of excess pore water pressure are established. It is found that the results predicted by the two models are in good agreement with the experimental data. The influence of relative densities and confining pressure on the characteristics of liquefied soil are studied. The results show that the relative densities and initial effective confining pressure all have an important influence on the stress-strain relationship of liquefied saturated sand.

{"title": "Study on the Mechanism of the Improvement of Dehydrogenating Properties of MgH_2 Systems by Metal Fluorides [J]\n", "abstract": " The dehydrogenating properties of MgH2 systems were improved by the addition of metal fluorides as the catalyst; the energy of substitution for the Mg atom, the Mg vacancy formation energy, the energy to remove H atoms and electronic structure change of MgH2 systems were calculated by Dmol4. 1 program based on the density functional theory. The mechanism of improvement of dehydrogenating properties of MgH2 systems by the addition of metal fluorides was discussed. The results show that the Mg vacancy formation energy is significantly higher than that of Fe, Ti, Zr, V, Ni, Nb, Cr or Cu substitution, which means that the substitution of these elements at the Mg site is more favorable for dehydrogenation of MgH2 system than the Mg vacancy formation at lower temperatures. NiF2, NbF5 and ZrF4 all benefit for the dehydrogenation of MgH2 systems, and the calculation results of improvement of the dehydrogenating properties of MgH2 systems are in agreement with experimental results. The Ni, Nb and Zr atoms replace a Mg atom of MgH2 systems respectively, the corresponding reactions of NiF2+ 3MgH2= MgF2+ Mg2NiH4, 2NbF5+ 5MgH2= 5MgF2+ 2NbH+ 4H2 and ZrF4+ 2MgH2= 2MgF2+ ZrH2 are accelerated; therefore, MgH2 with the higher stability can be changed into the other hydrides, such as Mg2NiH4, NbH and ZrH2. Compared with the density of states (DOS) of MgH2 systems, it is found that when the Ni, Nb or Zr atom replaces Mg atom, the valence electron numbers below Fermi level in octahedral areas made of the supercell center atom and its first-nearest, second-nearest H atom increased in the order of Ni, Ti, Zr, meaning\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["219"]}

METHODS: A rat model of migraine with hyperactivity of liver-YANG was established through electrical trigeminal ganglion stimulation and syndrome of oral administration of Fuzi decoction. The total proteins of the lymphocyte in the rats were separated by immobilized pH gradient-based 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), and the 2-DE image was analyzed by PDQuest 7.0 software. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and the SWISS-PORT and MSDB database were used to identify differential proteins. RESULTS: The formulae for calming the liver and suppressing YANG could also improve headache. Well-resolution and reproducible 2-DE patterns of rat lymphocyte from normal, model, and therapy tissues were obtained. Eleven of the total 13 differential protein spots were successfully identified by MALDI-TOF-MS.

{"title": "Biology and immunotherapy advance of interleukin 2 and interleukin 15-review\n", "abstract": " IL-2 and IL-15 play an important roles in regulating the lymphocyte function and homeostasis. Advances in understanding of the cellular and molecular biology of IL-2 and IL-15 and their receptor complex have provided rationale to better utilize them to expand and activate immune effectors in patients with cancer. These two cytokines stimulate similar responses from lymphocytes in vitro, but play markedly distinct roles in lymphoid biology in vivo. Their distinct physiological functions can be ascribed to distinct signaling pathways initiated by distinct cytokine receptor subunits, differential expression patterns of their receptors. Recently, the discovery of a novel mechanism of IL-15 cytokine signaling, trans-presentation, has provided insights into the divergent ways of these cytokine function. Although their heterotrimeric receptors have two receptor subunits in common, these two cytokines have contrasting roles in adaptive immune responses. The unique role of interleukin 2 is in the elimination of self-reactive T cells to prevent autoimmunity. By contrast, interleukin 15 is dedicated to the prolonged maintenance of memory T-cell responses to pathogens. As discussed in this article, the biology of IL-2 and IL-15 two cytokines will affect the development of novel treatment for malignancies and autoimmune diseases.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["219"]}

The infants were divided into 2 groups: prophylactic group (PG) which was given BNCPAP before development of dyspnea or immediately after admission with X-ray changes and non-prophylactic group (NPG) which was given a BNCPAP after the development of dyspnea or X-ray changes.[Results] With 31 infants in PG, 27 infants did not have respiratory distress syndrome, and the prophylactic achievement ratio was 87.1%. Only four infants got dyspnea after 4-6 h of BNCPAP, and two of them finally improved the syndrome. Two infants needed PS and mechanical ventilation 10 h after treatment of BNCPAP and finally one died of NRDS and infective shock in the 27th week. The success rate was 96.7%, while the mortality rate was 3.3%. With 25 infants in NPG, 24 of them improved, and the success rate was 96%. Only one of them got dyspnea after 4-6 h of BNCPAP and needed PS and mechanical ventilation 24 h after the treatment of BNCPAP. There was no pneumothorax or carbon dioxide retention.[Conclusions] Early BNCPAP (pressure of 8 cmH2O) was significantly effective in prophylaxis and treatment of infants born more than 28-week gestation with\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["219"]}

METHODS: A retrospective study on birth defect was conducted in two counties, Shanxi province, China, which covered birth defects among fetuses after 20 weeks' gestational age from 2002 through 2004. Data collected on birth defect cases mainly included extrinsic and visceral anomaly. RESULTS: The occurrence rates of the monitored structural birth defects significantly increased with the increase of age. The occurrence rates were 17.6, 34.0, 43.6, and 53.7 per 1000 births, for different statistical range, from 20-week to 27-week gestational age, 7 days, 1 year and 3 years after birth, respectively. The range from 28-week gestational age to 7 days after birth was usually regarded as the routinely monitored range. If the occurrence rate was calculated from the 20-week gestational age, it appeared a 2.1-time increase. However, if the range was changed to 1 or 3 years after birth, the occurrence rate increased to 2.7 or 3.3 times high, respectively. The distribution of time when birth-defect was identified was significantly different by categories with majority of neural tube defect cases diagnosed at antepartum or 7 days after birth. Visceral defects were mainly found at 7 days after birth but increased with age, even some were diagnosed at 1 year after birth.

Much attention has been paid to capillary electrophoresis (CE) microchips owing to their high degree of integration, portability, minimal solvent and reagent consumption, high performance, and speed [1\u0393\u00c7\u00f43]. These microchip analysis systems hold considerable promise for applications such as environmental monitoring, biomedical and pharmaceutical analysis, clinical diagnostics, and forensic investigations. Many microfluidic systems were produced on glass substrates using standard photolithographic techniques [3\u0393\u00c7\u00f45], whereas some polymer chips were fabricated based on techniques such as in situ polymerization [6], laser ablation [7], imprinting [8], and injection molding [9]. As with other analytical techniques, sample introduction and sample pretreatments are extremely important. The analytical procedures based on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices and systems starts with a sampling step. The sample usually undergoes some kind of sample preparation or pretreatment step before being submitted to the actual analysis. This step may involve extracting the sample from its matrix, removing large matrix components from the sample, masking or removing interference species, derivatizing the sample to make it detectable, or performing a sample preconcentration step.

This anomalous erosion is commonly referred to as cross corner effect. It is usually thought to be mainly caused by the weaker magnetic field at the curved section. However our further experiments indicate that the different radius at which the magnetic field line is tangent to the cathode surface will also contribute to the nonuniformity. In this paper, a Monte Carlo method is used to investigate the origin of the effect. By adjusting the magnetic field, a series of electron trajectories are simulated. It is found that the high-energy electrons tend to drift faster under weaker magnetic field or larger radius.

Method: Ten mongrel dogs weighting between 15 to 20 kg were divided into two groups, one as heart donors and the other as recipients. Eviscerate the heart from the donors with zero thermal ischemic time, manicure it and protect the myocardium, then transplant the heart into the recipient according to standard skills. Take off the assistant circulation after the embedded heart rebeats and the circulation leveled off, examine the inosculation and early cardiac function. Result: From 5 simulated experiments, the planted hearts rebeat autonomously in 2 cases, or rebeat after 1 to 4 times of tip-and-run defibrillation in 3 cases. The mean time of cold ischemia in donor hearts is 130 minutes; the time for donor heart inosculation is 90 minutes. All inosculation are in good condition except for leakage in one case at the top of left-atrium. Assistant circulation was withdrawn in all of the 5 cases when the circulation leveled off. In 1 case is observed that the tested dog regain consciousness. Conclusion: Perfuse and then take away the donor heart, and keep zero the time of thermal ischemia as well. Pay attention to the exact volume and prevent the heart from over-expanding while perusing. Cutting the donor heart should be begun from left to right, and from down to top, which would be more convenient and shortcut. Leave aside a little more vascular tissue for clipping as far as possible. During cold ischemia, the donor heart should be iced evenly.

METHODS: Six dogs were anesthetized and pulmonary perfusion with mECS (4 degrees Celsius) was performed before the lungs were isolated thereafter and stored at 4 to 8 degrees Celsius for 30, 60, 120, 180, 240 min respectively, after which tissue samples of the donor lung were taken for morphological observation with both light and transmission electron microscope. RESULTS: Immediately after reperfusion, the pulmonary tissues exhibited clear and intact structures, showing that mitochondrion swelled slightly in the alveolar epithelial cells (AECs). Mild edema occurred in the alveolar wall and the tissues around the veins at 30 min after preservation, which exacerbated to dilapidation of the alveolar wall and obvious tumefaction of the mitochondrion in the AECs at 60 min. At 180 min, rupture of alveolar wall and emergence of the alveolus was observed at 120 min, and a few pulmonary bullae were formed, the AECs (I) of which presented vacuolar changes in the cytoplasma and mitochondrion, with disappearance of the tiny villus of the AECs (II) at 240 min.

Under the calcium-deficient treatment, growth of seedlings was seriously inhibited. Chilling-induced total soluble protein, boiling stable proteins, soluble sugars, soluble calcium and total calcium all increased with calcium application and grafting. This study suggests higher carbohydrate content of grafted seedlings might be caused by variation in cellular calcium levels. The variation of calcium content was potentially the main reason that grafted seedlings had higher chilling resistance than self-rooted seedlings.

The concentration and dispersion of MWNTs in the polymerization electrolyte was found to have a significant effect on the thickness of polymer coated on each MWNT and hence the loading of MWNTs in the films produced. It has been shown that for an increasing concentration of MWNTs in the polymerization electrolyte, the thickness of polymer coated on each MWNT decreases. This relationship made it possible to minimize ionic diffusion distances within the nanoporous MWNT-PPy films produced, reducing their electrical and ionic resistance and increasing their capacitance relative to similarly prepared pure PPy films.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["219"]}

They could be aluminu. m-adhesive-core materials, or fiberglass reinforced composite sheet-adhesive-core materials, even ceramic coating-adhesive-core materials, for example. A disband could be found between any two layers as shown in Fig. 1 in which three layers with subsurface defects are displayed. To detect the disbands and any defects where in the structure is an important task for scientists and engineers. Recently, pulse-echo thermal wave imaging developed by Wayne State University and Thermal Wave Imaging, Inc.[l-4] has been recognized as a powerful tool for the NDE of materials. Based on this technique, the thermal wave image is produced in real time, and of course, it is a nondestructive method. In principle, once a pulse of heat, for instance generated by a set of flash lamps is launched to the exterior surface of a material, the thermal waves propagate into the interior and are reflected by subsurface defects which may occur in the material. An IR video camera and its associated electronics are used to form and store an image of the subsurface defects. In section 2, we present a three-dimensional model for the propagation of a pulsed thermal wave in a multilayered material with subsurface defects, thereby, generalizing the theory suitable for a single layer developed by Crowther et al.[l]. Briefly speaking, our theory is based on using eigenfunctions and integral transforms for a set of the thermal conduction equations,", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["219"]}

It has been found that AMAA is difficult to polymerize by free-radical initiation or heating due to the enol formating of beta-diketonic moiety in the monomer. After the protection of the enol form in AMAA by treatment with trimethylsilyl chloride, the free-radical polymerization of AMAA can take place smoothly.

However, the difference between the oxidation states of Fe and Cu means that Fe will bring the excess oxygen into lattice to keep the charge balance. We show that, for the evidence of the excess oxygen., the bonding energy of Fe-cluster in Cusingle bondO layer reach its minimum when Fe make a shift from the center of Cusingle bondO square network.

The results showed that maximal plasma concentration with oral ATRA at 15 mg/m2 was high enough (10 (-6) mol/L) to induce APL cell differentiation. Based on these results, 27 cases of de novo APL patients were treated with oral ATRA at a dose of 15-20 mg/m2/day and 24 of the 26 (92%) evaluable cases achieved clinical complete remission (CR) after 13 to 67 dyas of ATRA treatment. No patient experienced retinoic acid syndrome (RAS) and DIC. The Cmax with a single dose of ATRA on day 1 of treatment and immediately after obtaining of CR with ATRA in three cases demonstrated similar values in one patient and an about 2 fold decrease in two patients. Moreover comparison with a relatively well-matched previous group of 20 APL patients treated with high-dose ATRA showed that low-dose ATRA is as effective as high-dose in treating APL patients and may provide the advantages of decrease of the degree of hyperleukocytosis and side effects.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["219"]}

The results are compared with previously reported cases and show significant differences. For example, for a well deviation of 45, dimensionless time of 10, dimensionless formation thickness of 100, kr/kz of 100, the dimensionless pressure calculated using the line source solution will be greater by 265% than that calculated using the more correct surface source solution.

{"title": "Ideal and resistive MHD equilibria and states of minimum dissipation\n", "abstract": " Ideal magnetohydrodynamic equilibria have been the organizing conceptual framework for interpreting fusion confinement experiments. In hydrodynamics, bounded, ideal equilibria are equally plentiful, but the only ones even approximately attainable in the laboratory are those which lie close to equilibria with small but non-zero dissipation coefficients. If the same criteria are demanded in MHD, the range of possibilities is greatly restricted. If the additional common requirements of axisymmetry and zero equilibrium flow velocity are demanded, we are left with a nearly empty set of solutions, and not very interesting ones at that. For example, in cylindrical periodic geometry with a dielectric-coated conducting liner, the sole possibility seems to be the uniform-current-density profile, if uniform resistivity is assumed. It has begun to seem likely that interesting MHD equilibria may all contain flows: and not just small-scale, turbulent,\" dynamo\" velocities, but organized flows that can affect the current distribution over its channel. These states seem to be approximatable as states of minimum energy dissipation rate. Experimental searches for flow velocities, on MHD plasmas cool enough to permit internal probes, seem to be indicated. Issues of MHD equilibrium, at a level more sophisticated than ideal, axisymmetric assumptions permit, need to be reopened. At present, the most important and revealing experiments that can be done seem to be numerical ones.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["219"]}

This conclusion, however, is based on a small group of different coals (8 coals only) and should be verified further with a larger sample of coals. The fact that the yield of individual components can be correlated with the maceral composition, offers excellent possibilities for the use of maceral content-based correlations in the analysis of kinetic data from flash hydrogenation, and possibly for similar processes. It should be kept in mind that different macerals can present different selectivities towards individual components. Also, secondary reactions of the individual components (eg, in the gas phase) could introduce deviations in the correlations. As a final conclusion, correlations based on the petrographic composition of coals are a promising tool that could allow prediction of reactivities, total volatile yields and product distribution for any coal in flash hydrogenation given only its maceral content.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["219"]}

And zero-knowledge proof of double discrete logarithm has some particular properties, so it has been widely applied in many security systems. But the efficient problem of zero-knowledge proof of double discrete logarithm has not been solved to this day, since there are some special difficulties in computing this kind of knowledge proof. Hence, the time complexity and the space complexity of existing schemes are all O(k), where k is a security parameter. After redesigning the basic construction of knowledge proof, we provide a new zero-knowledge proof of double discrete logarithm, which is the first scheme with O(1) time complexity and O(1) space complexity. If introducing an off-line TTP (trusted third party), we can provide two additional zero-knowledge proof schemes of double discrete logarithm, one is even more efficient than the first one, the\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["219"]}

In this paper, the friction is divided into three components, nonlinear term including static friction and coulomb friction, Stribeck effect and linear term including viscous friction. Nonlinear friction and Stribeck effect are considered as disturbance. These are compensated by designing controller including integrator and loop shaping. In contrast, linear term friction can be considered in framework of linear control synthesis. Second difficulty is that the change in mass of load affects the system response.

{"title": "The Application of PEC Thermography to Multiple Surface Defects Detection of Metal Material\n", "abstract": " Currently there is an increasing interest in the application of infrared thermography on the defect detection for metal materials. As one new infrared thermography techniques, pulsed eddy current thermography is powerful to detect surface defects of metals, in which the temperature field is excited by the eddy current and the surface defects can be detected over a relatively wide area within a short time. This paper focuses on the application of pulsed eddy current thermography in multiple surface defects detection on metal. We tested two samples of ferromagnetic and non-ferromagnetic metals which have multiple surface defects simultaneously. The influences of excitation time and location of the coil on the detection results were investigated. The work shows that a metal part with multiple surface defects can be efficiently inspected using pulsed eddy current thermography with optimized setting of inspection parameters. The experimental results indicate that the optimal excitation time is of great difference for ferromagnetic and non-ferromagnetic metals with multiple defects. The results also show that the location of excitation coils influences the detection accuracy in different degrees for various defects on different metal materials.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["219"]}
{"title": "Application of discrete mathematics in urban transportation system analysis\n", "abstract": " Urban transportation system is of foremost importance to support the passengers and freight mobility requirements of urban agglomerations. Transportation in urban areas is highly complex because of the modes involved, the multitude of origins and destinations, and the amount and variety of traffic. Analysing the urban transportation system is the process of attempting to examine the behaviour patterns of the elements of urban transportation system and the interactions among them, which is very critical for urban traffic planning and management. Discrete mathematics is the branch of mathematics dealing with objects that can be assumed by only distinct, separated values. Since the behaviour of travellers and vehicles, which are the main elements in urban transportation system, is in an individual level, compared with traditional aggregated methods, the techniques of discrete mathematics are more suitable to be adopted in urban transportation system analysis. Therefore, discrete mathematics is gradually becoming the popular method to analyse transportation system and has attracted much attention of the researchers. Within this context, this special issue serves as a forum to highlight the most significant recent developments in the techniques of discrete mathematics, especially discrete choice models, Bayesian network, and so on, and to apply these techniques on urban transportation system analysis, such as travel behaviour, taxi\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s driving pattern, and delivery route selection.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["219"]}

{"title": "Wide-area power system stabilizer design based on joint geometric index\n", "abstract": " The selection of control locations and feedback signals is a key step in designing wide-area power system stabilizers (WPSSs). The residue method, which is the most commonly used method to select locations and feedback signals, suffers a scaling problem when comparing different signals. The joint observability/controllability geometric index is used to select the most effective stabilizing signals and control locations. The observability of different types of signals such as tieline active power flows, bus voltage angle differences, center-of-inertia (COI) difference between areas, generator output powers and generator rotor speeds are considered in this method. The tie-line active powers are found to be the most effective input signals, considering the requirement of measurement devices and communication channels in actual power systems. Taking a 2-area power system as case study, the joint geometric index based WPSS design procedure is illustrated. The importance and feasibility of the method are also discussed in the same study.

{"title": "Solidification Analysis during Laser Cladding Process Based on Finite Element\u03b5\u00c7\u00e2\n", "abstract": " Finite element was used to analyze effects of the temperature variations on the solidification organization for laser cladding. The influences of the temperature gradient G and the cooling rate (cooling part of temperature changing rate) were discussed. A feature controlling factor K was used to study the solidification performance in the laser cladding process. The results show that the grains precipitate along the vertical direction below the heat source center and the cooling rate plays an important role in refining the grains. The larger the cooling rate is, the less the grains are. It is also found that the solidification structure is significantly dependent on the occurring time of the highest cooling rate and on that of K at the melting point of the cladding or the substrate. It is demonstrated that, if the largest cooling rate is achieved prior to K at the melting point, the structure is of the cellular-grain form. Otherwise, it is of column-dendrite grain form. And when K is in the range of 80\u251c\u00f9 10 6~ 120\u251c\u00f9 10 6\u0393\u00e4\u00e2\u252c\u2556 s, the solidification structure is of densely arranged cellular-grain form whose grain size is larger.

By edge collapse mesh simplification, our algorithm simplifies the original shape to a reduced mesh, which contains the salient feature of the original 3D shape. For the reduced mesh, we specify an affine transformation for each vertex called key point. According to the user's manipulation, the fixed or moved constraints are imposed on some key points. Using a nonlinear optimization, the transformation matrixes of all the key points are solved. Then, for the original shape, all the vertexes can be mapped, based on the affine transformation of key points, to the new position to realize 3D shape deformation. Our algorithm resolves the transformation matrix of the key points instead that of all the vertexes of original shape, such that it can retrench the computational cost and realize real-time display, while gain the detail preserved 3D deformation.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["219"]}

It focuses on mining the associations of hidden attributes as the signatures of objects in unstructured data by trigger-pair model. It can group tokens which help identify objects and filter out noise. Then it assigns weight to tokens properly which makes feature vectors more representative for identifying objects. After these steps, it gains fine-grained object-based clustering result from unstructured data. Experiments on real datasets show that this algorithm can filter out most noise and assign weight for features properly, and improves the clustering results greatly.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["219"]}

{"title": "Improving grid performance by dynamically deploying applications\n", "abstract": " Grid applications are normally deployed on computing nodes beforehand, which may cause the undesirable situation that some of these nodes (with hot applications deployed) are always busy whereas the others are consistently idle. Therefore, the overall performance (e.g. throughput and load balancing) of such a Grid system would be seriously degraded. In this paper, we present the idea of Hierarchical and Dynamic Deployment of Application (HDDA) in Grid to improve the system performance. With HDDA, an application can be dynamically deployed and undeployed when necessary. In order to reduce the overhead caused by HDDA, the Average Latency Ratio Minimum (ALR\u0393\u00c7\u00c9MIN) replacement strategy is also proposed. It deploys applications to nodes with minimum ALR of Node (NALR), and evicts applications with minimum increment of ALR.

The results indicate that the temperature of frictional couple rises continuously in the process of friction and wear, and the wear valume of sliding strip increases with increasing of temperature. And the temperature of the frictional couple with electric current is higher than that without electric current. Without electric current, the friction coefficient firstly increases and then decreases with increasing of the temperature. With electric current, the friction coefficient decreases gradually with increasing of the temperature. Through observing the surface topography of the carbon sliding strip before and after wear, it is found that the wear surface becomes smoother and smoother with increasing of the temperature.

METHODS: 35 patients with medicamentosa-like dermatitis induced by TCE were chosen as the patient group, and 35 healthy workers as control group. The real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with TaqMan minor groove binding (MGB) probes was used to test single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of CYP2E1, CYP1A1 and IL-4 in the patients with medicamentosa-like dermatitis as well as in the control. The genotypes and the frequency of genotype or allele were compared between the patients and control with statistical analysis. RESULTS: The frequency of allele G within CYP1A1 gene (rs1048943) was significantly higher in TCE patients (37.1%) than that in control (P< 0.05); the frequency of allele T within CYP2E1-1053 C/T was significantly higher in TCE patients (41.4%) than that in control (P< 0.01); the frequency of T/T within IL-4-588 C/T (rs2243250) was significantly higher in TCE patients (75.0%) than that in control (P< 0.01), and the frequency of allele T within IL-4-588 C/T (rs2243250) was also significantly higher in TCE patients (87.5%) than that in control (P< 0.01).

The U937 cell lines were treated with E. coli at different time or together with SB203580, an inhibitor for p38. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. p38 activities were detected by Western blotting. E. coli induced apoptosis in cultured U937 cell lines in a time-dependent manner. The phosphorylation of p38 was induced after 10 minutes infection, reached the peak after 20 minutes, and started to decline after 30 minutes. In contrast, the level of total p38 protein was not changed in whole experimental period. Inhibition of p38 with SB203580 significantly inhibited E. coli induced apoptosis in U937 cells. The activation of the p38 MAPK in U937 cell lines by E. coli is a major pathway to mediate the apoptosis.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["219"]}

A mathematics model was established to estimate electrode face diameter by applying the characteristic that servo gun can detect axial wear online but not equip additional measurement apparatuses. Firstly the precision of servo gun was compensated to assure it can meet the requirement of axial wear measurement online. Then the model was established to estimate electrode face diameter online by a minimum amount of experiment data to determine the numerical constant in the model. To verify the model, electrode life tests for welding different galvanized steels were carried out. It was shown that estimation results of the model agreed well with the experiment results and spot welding the steels with higher electrode wear rate would result in a shorter electrode life", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["219"]}

As for a partially strain\u0393\u00c7\u00c9relaxed In0.1Ga0.9N MQW laser diode (LD) structure with cracking in underlying epitaxial layers, LLO did not cause the blue shift in CL spectra as expected, but rather the red shift induced by the indium diffusion from its abundant regions around cracks. This result could be proved by the monochromated scanning CL images taken at 390 nm and 408 nm not having the same obvious complementary as those of original ones.

The carbonate content curve runs mostly parallel to the benthic foraminiferal \u256c\u252418O curve, showing that the higher values of CaCO3 content correspond to the lower \u256c\u252418O values. The CaCO3 cycle in this area is mainly influenced by terrigenous dilution, displaying the\" type of Atlantic Ocean\". Both the appearance of CaCO3 peaks and content change are found earlier than oxygen isotope during deglacial periods, indicating the effect of\" Carbonate Pump\" on CO2 and temperature in the lower latitude sea area. The content curve of terrigenous clasts (grainsize 3~ 5 \u256c\u255dm) is parallel to the oxygen isotope curve and mainly controlled by sea level change, which can be used as an indirect index for sea-level changing. The sediments with grain-size of 1.5~ 2.5 \u256c\u255dm are mainly suspended in water and transported by river, and their content is influenced by the Asia Summer Monsoon and precipitation, so it might reflect the change of the summer monsoon intensity. By the spectrum analysis, the 0.1 Ma eccentricity, 40 ka obliquity, 20 ka precession and 10 ka semi-precession cycles are all recognized in the monsoon records of marine sediments in the southern South China Sea, showing the high response of the tropic sea area climate changes to the orbital cycle.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["219"]}

As the flash density increases to giga-bits (Gb), the critical dimensions are scaling down to sub-90nm. It is commonly understood that for 45 nm and beyond, the traditional floating gate (FG) flash will have retention issue due to tunnel oxide thinning. Trapped charge based non-volatile memory is one of the top choices to resolve the above scaling issue.

METHOD: Rat peritoneal macrophages were treated with LPS, and at the same time given different doses of tetramethylpyrazine. The secreation of VEGF was determined by ELISA test, and MTT assay was used to examine cells proliferation. Western blot assay was used to examine the expression of HIF-1alpha. RESULT: 100 microg x mL (-1) and 10 microg x mL (-1) tetramethylpyrazine decreased the secretion of VEGF and also inhibited the expression of HIF-1alpha by LPS-induced macrophages. But these doses of tetramethylpyrazine had no effect on the cells proliferation. CONCLUSION: Tetramethylpyrazine could inhibit the secretion of VEGF by LPS-induced macrophages, and the mechanism must be associated with inhibiting the expression of HIF-1alpha.

The present public telephone voice communication networks, which utilize digital technology via circuit switching, provide satisfactory quality service. In contrast, the Internet telephony switching network, which is a packetswitched network, does not provide a guarantee of quality service at all, since such networks have packet losses. Moreover, the performance of ASR systems deteriorates when such ASR systems are used in adverse environments. For measuring the influence of missing speech packets on the ASR system performance, we use a Soekris net 4501 IP simulator in order to control packet loss rate.

{"title": "CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES IN PERFORMANCE-BASED DESIGN OF STRUCTURES UNDER EARTHQUAKE LOADS\n", "abstract": " Performance-based design of structures differs from the conventional prescriptive approach mainly in two technical aspects. One is to relate the design to structural performance directly, and the other is to design a structure for multiple performance objectives. Due to load and strength uncertainties, however, it is impossible to design a structure for specific performance objectives with complete assurance. In this paper, a framework involving structural control and system identification emerging technology is proposed to reduce the load and strength uncertainties, and to introduce a new design concept for the optimized balance of the load and strength under multiple performance objectives. It involves four main components: new definition of design earthquakes to minimize the variability of ground motions, bounded control on the seismic responses of a structure for further reduction of the variation of seismic load, on-line system identification of hysteretic behavior for reduction of the strength uncertainty, and damping-enhanced strengthening methodology for the optimal performance of the structure. The needs and approaches to develop these concepts are discussed, and some of the preliminary results are presented towards their development with a simple structure.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["219"]}

{"title": "Study on distribution of face contour of Chinese and design of biological protective mask\n", "abstract": " In order to design the biological protective mask fitting the face contour of Chinese, representative group of people was selected for measuring precisely the parameters such as the breadth and length of human face, the distance between 2 jugal points, the nose middle breadth and nose middle height. The results showed that the face breadth range of Chinese people was 115~ 165 mm, the face length was 62~ 122 mm, the distance between 2 jugal points was 72~ 136 mm, the nose middle breadth was 20~ 45 mm and nose middle height was 8~ 27 mm,. The nose middle height showed the greatest variation among them. The results suggest that the face length and the distance between 2 jugal points are the essential parameters for designing the size of the external contour of the mask and the nose middle breadth and nose middle height are important parameters for designing the airtight structure of the nose part which is the key factor for designing the mask.. According to the results of investigation, the reference size for designing half-face mask was proposed.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["219"]}

METHODS: The clinical data of 13 patients, 6 with malignant tumors and 7 with benign tumors, who received the use of blood salvage machine during oncologic surgeries based on informed consent, were analyzed. RESULTS: In total 42,575 ml of packed red blood cells were collected during surgery with a mean value of 3 275 ml (400-1500 ml) per patient. The average amount of allogenic transfusion per patient was 1 530 ml (0-8,000 ml). The number of blood salvage machine use in oncologic surgeries accounted for 8.6%(13/152) of the total number of blood salvage machine use in surgeries in that period. The perioperative mortality rate of the oncologic surgeries with the use of blood salvage machine was 7.7%(1/13). The post-operative metastasis rate of liver and lung was 15.4%(2/13). CONCLUSION: The use of blood salvage machine during oncologic surgeries improves the blood sparing effect.

{"title": "Human activity response and prevention strategies on soil and water loss in Sichuan Province\n", "abstract": " Ten major factors have been selected to judge the degree of disturbance from human activity and the corresponding relationship of the impact on soil and water loss in Sichuan Province. Correlation analysis has demonstrated that stock-carrying capacity, percentage of land reclamation, population density, GDP per capita, mineral modulus and percentage of forest coverage are the 6 most relevant human activity factors. The analysis on the degree of disturbance has shown that population pressure, excessive or unreasonable activities in development of resources and destructive behavior of humans are the main causes of soil and water loss. Consequently, solving the various problems in the negative activity of humans and regulating human behavior are the first tasks that should be tackled in the conservation of water and soil. In the new era, the prevention and rectification of soil and water loss are measures based on the foundation of the ecosystem, which is a kind of management strategy for sustainable development. The foundation of this method is made up of the system innovations and breakthroughs in terms of aims, philosophy, measures, and aspects of the prevention and rectification of soil and water loss, simultaneous advance from the conceptual, policy, spatial, technical and mode levels and system integration on the treatment strategies.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["219"]}

METHODS: Such fusion peptide was constructed by linking the gene of Staphylococcal AgrD pheromone with the gene of C-terminal (I626) of colicin Ia pore-forming region (K544-I626) with site-directed mutation. Mutated plasmid was transformed into E. coli TG1 cells to produce fusion peptide, peptides were purified by CM sepharose ion-exchange column. In vitro bactericidal assays were made to identify the bioactivity of fusion peptide. RESULTS: Fusion peptide presented a specific bactericidal activity which was over one hundred times as effective as that of penicillin/oxacillin against tested Staphylococcus aureus strains. CONCLUSION: Fusion peptide behaved with a targeting bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus which was lacking at two precursors, Staphylococcal pheromone and colicin Ia pore-forming region. These results suggest that an engineered multidomain protein machine with specific bactericidal activity has been constructed in the present study.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["219"]}

{"title": "Probabilistic assessment of contamination using the two-phase flow model\n", "abstract": " A physically motivated model is indispensable for a successful analysis of the impact of leaching from nuclear waste storage sites on the environment and public health. While most analyses use the single-phase flow model for modelling unsaturated flow and solute transport, the two-phase flow model considering the resistance of gas to water flow is a more realistic one. The effect of the two-phase flow model on the water content is theoretically investigated first in this study. Then, by combining a geostatistical generator using the turning bands method and a multi-phase transport code TOUGH2, an automatic process is used for Monte Carlo simulation of the solute transport. This stochastic approach is applied to a potentially polluted site by low-level nuclear waste in Taiwan. In the simulation, the saturated hydraulic conductivity is treated as the random variable.

METHODS: Blood and saliva samples were collected from 308 unrelated individuals in the three populations. DNA was extracted by chelex-100 method and amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR products were analyzed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining. RESULTS: The genotype distributions of D4S1647 and D6S2414 loci were in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The frequencies of alleles showed no significant differences among the three populations. Analyses of Han families indicated that the alleles agreed with Mendelian inheritance law.

METHODS: The clinical data of 17 cases of bronchial rupture caused by chest trauma was analyzed retrospectively. The surgical approaches and post-trauma complications were described. RESULTS: End-to-end anastomosis was performed in 14 cases. Among the other 3 patients, one received lobectomy after bronchial repair, another had tracheal repair, and resection of the stenosed segment along with end-to-end anastomosis during thoracotomy was necessitated in the last case. Anastomotic stricture occurred early after the operation in 2 of all these cases, while 2 months postoperatively, all the patients were free from such strictures. CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis and operation in such cases can be life-saving, and may warrant early recovery of the pulmonary function. Accurate diagnoses of bronchial rupture can be obtained by bronchoscopy, with which the surgeons can easily locate the rupture during surgery.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["219"]}

{"title": "Estrogen decrease cerebral inflammation induced by ischemia-reperfusion [J]\n", "abstract": " Objective We have shown that estrogen exerted profound protection in ischemia induced by permanent middle cerebral artery occultation. In the present study, we examined whether chronic estrogen depletion or repletion affects inflammation after cerebral ischemia reperfusion. Methods Adult female rats were randomly assigned to 3 groups (ie, control, ovariectomized and estrogen replacement groups). In the last group, E 2 valerate (200 microgram/kg) was subcutaneousely injected once a week after the OVX. Four weeks later, all rats were subjected to MCAO and then killed at various points of time. We examined expressions of nuclear factor \u256c\u2551B (NF \u256c\u2551B) by immunohistochemistry method and determined the leukocytes infiltration in cerebral ischemia in all rats. Results Serum estrogen level was 0.185\u252c\u25920.124 pg/ml in intact female rats, 0.138\u252c\u25920.065 pg/ml in OVX rats and 0.404\u252c\u25920.156 pg/ml in E 2 treated OVX rats.

The different isothermal specimens have different superelastic behavior due to the change of the ratio of stress-induced gamma'(1) and beta'(1). The superelasticity of gamma'(1) phase tends to that of beta'(1) phase with cycling. Typical stabilization of stress-induced martensite above A (P)* results in residual deformation. Due to the reverse transformation of gamma'(1) there is a deviation of pseudo-yield stress from linear relation with temperature at relatively low stress.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["219"]}

Methods: Serum NSE concentrations were examined on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 14 after ictus in 54 patients with spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage by enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Volume of parenchymal hematoma and secondary intraventricular hemorrhage was also determined. Clinical outcome was assessed on day 30 after ictus with the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). Results: Serum NSE concentrations on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 14 after intracerebral hemorrhage were found significantly higher than those of controls (P 0.05). Peak levels of serum NSE were correlated significantly with the volume of parenchymal hemorrhage (r= 0.56, P0. 01) and clinical outcome (r=-0.59, P0. 01), but not with intraventricular hemorrhage volume (r= 0.06, P= 0.67). A higher mean serum NSE value was found in the group with a greater hematoma 3 days after the onset of hemorrhage (P0. 01). None of patients with NSE concentration above 25 \u256c\u255dg/L survived. A sudden increased serum NSE level indicated an unfavorable outcome. Conclusions: Serum NSE concentrations in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage correlate with the volume of hematoma and severity of the disease, and can predict the shortterm neurological outcome reliably.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["219"]}

{"title": "Osteoporotic lumbar spine finite element analysis\n", "abstract": " The objective of this study is to investigate the fracture behavior of osteoporotic lumbar spine using the three dimensional finite element approach. For compression loading in normal spine, due to the spongy bone strength was far weaker than cortical shell, end-plate would deform into a concave shape in the center region. The end-plate then distributed the loading to the cortical shell and resulted in a bending effect on cortical shell which generated the tension stresses in the anterior superior region of the cortical shell. In the simulation of osteoporotic spine. When the Young's modulus of the cortical shell reduced less than 75% and spongy bone decreased more than cortical shell, the end-plate concave deformation become more serious, which resulted in biconcave fracture of the spine. When the Young's modulus of the cortical shell reduced less than 75%(accompany with spongy bone lose) this would enhanced superior tension stress of cortical shell and probably cause the anterior wedge fracture of the spine. When the cortical shell vanished (cortical shell Young's modulus reduced 99%), the stresses of the spongy bone increased dramatically which might be the reason of the crush fracture of the spine. Considering the flexion loading condition, the stresses pattern of normal spine model was altered into a more crucial case, and this phenomenon was more sensitive in osteoporotic model which will increase the probability of osteoporotic fracture.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["219"]}

The aim of this work is to establish the animal model of HCV infection for studying the biosynthesis and pathogenesis of HCV structural protein in transgenic mice. The structural genes (C+ E1+ E2) and 5'-uncoding region gene (5'UCR) of HCV isolated from China was inserted into pcDNA3 vector. The transgenic mice were produced by microinfecting this plasmid into mouse (C57BL/6 x ICR) embryos and the integrated mice were identified. The expression of core protein of HCV and mFas molecule were confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis using monoclonal antibody. The results revealed that the expression of core protein was detected in many mouses' tissues with nuclear staining, while the heart tissue was with cytoplasmic staining. The expression level in tissues was indicated as: heart> lung> kidney> liver. At meantime, Fas molecule was detected in heart, kidney and liver tissues, and the expression of Fas was parallel to that of core protein. Transgenic mouse containing HCV structural gene was established and the expression of Fas molecule may be associated with the expression of core protein of HCV. The Fas system or other signaling pathway to the programmed cell death may play important roles in HCV infection. Our transgenic mouse will provide a useful animal model to critically address issues of immune pathogenesis, direct cytopathic potential and carcinogenesis of the structural protein of HCV.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["219"]}

Comparisons are made with simulations carried out using discretization of both the fractures and matrix blocks. The new semi-analytical cOde is shown to be accurate, and typically requires an order of magnitude less computational time.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["219"]}
{"title": "Studies on Structures of Electrodeposited Ni-Fe Alloys by Using Mossbauer Spectroscopy and X-ray Diffraction [J]\n", "abstract": " Electrodeposited Ni-Fe alloys with different Fe contents have been studied by means of Mossbauer spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction technique. Those deposits containing less than 46 at% Fe, were identified as \u256c\u2502-phase, those containing 46 at%-63 at% Fe as \u256c\u2592+ \u256c\u2502 phases, and those containing more than 63 at% Fe as \u256c\u2502-phase. Partially ordered Ni3Fe was found to exist in deposits containing about 25 at% Fe and Fe-rich phase in the range of 35 at%-46 at% Fe. In general, the lattice parameters of \u256c\u2502-phase increase with Fe content increasing. However, in the deposits containing about 25 at% Fe (20 at%-30 at%) the lattice parameters decrease slightly with the increasing of Fe content, which is due to the presence of partially ordered Ni3Fe in the deposits. The lattice parameter is almost constant in deposits with Fe content from 46 at% to 63 at%.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["219"]}
{"title": "Thermally-Induced Optical Nonlinearity during Transient Heating of Thin Films\n", "abstract": " This work studies the temperature field and\u252c\u00ed he optical response of weakly absorbing thin films with thermally induced optical nonlinearity during picosecond to nanosecond pulsed-laser heating. A one-dimensional model is presented that examines the effects of the temperature dependent optical constants and the nonuniform absorption caused by interference. The energy equation is solved numerically, coupled with the matrix method in optica/multilayer theory. Both cadmium sulfide (CdS) thin films and a zinc selenide (ZnSe) interference filter are considered. The computational results compare favorably with available experimental data on the ZnSe interference filter. This study shows that the transient temperature distributions in the films are highly nonuniform. Such nonuniformity yields Airy's formulae for calculating the thin-film reflectance and transmittance inapplicable. Applications of the work include optical\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["219"]}

Reactions against two strains of T.vulgaris were shown in 46.7% and 66.7% of the patients group, which were significantly higher than in the controls, while the percentage of reactions against Faenia rectivirgula and A.fumigates were low in the patients group and had no significant difference with the controls. The results indicate that the main etiological agents were some strains of T.vulgaris.

{"title": "Asymptotic behavior of multigroup diffusion equations with Xe feedback\n", "abstract": " It is well known that fission product 135Xe has a very large absorption for thermal neutrons. A small fraction of this nuclear species is formed directly in fission and a major part results from the decay of 135I. The behavior of 135Xe density can affect neutron flux distribution and hence reactor operation in a thermal reactor. The aim of this paper is to give a nonlinear study of time dependent multigroup diffusion equations coupled with Xe feedback through the notion of the upper-lower solution and the monotone iterative method. The study includes the construction of neutron flux, explicitly upper and lower bounds of the neutron flux, and the asymptotic behavior of neutron flux under Xe feedback. Finally, we also obtain sufficient conditions for supercriticality and subcriticality of the coupled system.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["219"]}
