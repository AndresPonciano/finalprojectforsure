These attitudes are acquired by the agents by executing so called mental actions. Behaviours of multi-agent systems are represented by prime event structures. The prime event structure when augmented with utility functions de ned on the terminal nodes of the structure may be viewed as games in extensive form de ned on local states rather than on global states as in the classical de nition. The de nition of knowledge, in our framework, captures the change of state due to action executions. A notion of local knowledge-based protocols is de ned. A game theory method of backwards induction is applied in order to obtain a very natural de nition of rationality in agent's behaviours. All the notions are exempli ed using the running example.

The method presented expands on one for CTL exploit ing SAT Modulo Monotonic Theories solvers. Similarly to the CTL case, our approach appears to be very efficient. The experimental results show that we can quickly test the satisfiability of large ATL formulae that have been out of reach of the existing approaches.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1645"]}

In this paper, we introduce the notion of agency as an extension to the reaction systems formalism, leading to distributed reaction systems. Adding agents in the reaction systems setting, allows for the natural modelling and representation of multi-agent and distributed systems. To support the specification of temporal epistemic properties of distributed reaction systems, we introduce rsCTLK and present its associated model checking procedure. Finally, we show that model checking for rsCTLK is PSPACE-complete.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1645"]}

{"title": "Hybrid Planning by Combining SMT and Simulated Annealing.\n", "abstract": " We present a new approach to the concrete planning (CP) shown to be a NP-hard problem [7]. This is the third stage of Web service composition (WSC) in the PlanICS framework [1]. The first two phases, namely an abstract planning and offer collecting, basing on an ontology, a user query, and a service registry provide data necessary for CP. A new hybrid algorithm (HSA), which combines Simulated Annealing (SA)[6] with Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)[3], has been designed and implemented. The main idea of our hybrid solution relies upon generating an initial individual by an SMT-based procedure. Then, in the subsequent iterations of SA, the individual is improved. The experimental results show that HSA is superior to the other methods we have applied to the CP problem, including these based on Genetic Algorithm (GA)[4], SMT used separately [10], and SMT combined into the hybrid algorithms RH and SRH [9], as well as the IPH algorithm [8].Our direct motivation to develop hybrid algorithms is based on the observation that every method applied separately to WSC yields fair results, but suffers from some disadvantages. While the SMT-based algorithm is able to find always the optimal solution, its main problem is a long execution time and large memory consumption. On the other hand the evolutionary methods are quick and demand less resources, but at the price of the quality and a lower probability of finding solutions. We are aiming at combining the algorithms in order to get a trade-off between speed and quality. Recently, we have developed three planning methods based on joining GA and SMT: RH (Random Hybrid), SRH\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1645"]}

We introduce a novel planning technique based on a combination of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver, which allows to obtain better results than each of the methods separately. We give three versions of a hybrid algorithm. Two of them involve a modification of the standard GA in such a way that after every couple of iterations of GA, several top-ranked individuals are processed by the SMT-based algorithm in order to improve them. The third one exploits an SMT-solver in order to generate the initial populations for GA, which results in a substantial improvement in the overall algorithm efficiency.

{"title": "Verifying timed properties of security protocols\n", "abstract": " In this paper we offer a methodology for verifying correctness of (timed) security protocols whose actions are parametrised with time. To this aim the model of a protocol involves delays and timeouts on transitions, and sets time constraints on actions to be executed. Our approach consists in specifying a security protocol, possibly with timestamps, in a higher-level language and translating automatically the specification to a timed automaton (or their networks). Moreover, we generalise the correspondence property so that attacks can be also discovered when some time constraints are not satisfied. Then, one can use each of the verification tools for timed automata (e.g., Kronos, UppAal, or Yerics) for model checking generalised time authentication of security protocols. As a case study we verify generalised (timed) authentication of KERBEROS, TMN, Neuman Stubblebine, and Andrew Secure Protocol.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1645"]}

The logic is powerfull enough to express most of the partial order properties of distributed systems like serializability of database transactions, snapshots, parallel execution of program segments, or inevitability under concurrency fairness assumption. We show that a model checking problem for the logic is NP-hard, even if past modalities cannot be nested. Then, we give a one exponential time model checking algorithm for the logic without nested past modalities. We show that all the interesting partial order properties can be model checked using our algorithm. Then, we show that it is possible to extend the model checking algorithm to cover the whole language and its extension to CTL* P.

{"title": "Strategic Abilities of Asynchronous Agents: Semantic Paradoxes and How to Tame Them\n", "abstract": " Recently, we proposed a framework for verification of agents' abilities in asynchronous multi-agent systems, together with an algorithm for automated reduction of models. The semantics was built on the modeling tradition of distributed systems. As we show here, this can sometimes lead to paradoxical interpretation of formulas when reasoning about the outcome of strategies. First, the semantics disregards finite paths, and thus yields counterintuitive evaluation of strategies with deadlocks. Secondly, the semantic representations do not allow to capture the asymmetry between active agents and the recipients of their choices. We propose how to avoid the problems by a suitable change of the semantics, and prove that the model reduction scheme still works in the modified framework.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1645"]}

{"title": "Improving Efficiency of Model Checking for Variants of Alternating-time Temporal Logic.\n", "abstract": " Multi-agent systems describe interactions of multiple entities called agents, often assumed to be intelligent and autonomous [1, 14]. Alternating-time temporal logic (ATL\u22c6) and its fragment ATL [2] are logics which allow for reasoning about strategic interactions in such systems, by extending the framework of temporal logic with the gametheoretic notion of strategic ability. Hence, ATL\u22c6 enables to express statements about what agents or their groups can achieve. Such properties can be useful for specification, verification, and reasoning about interaction in agent systems [12, 13], as well as about security and usability in e-voting protocols [4, 9]. They have become especially relevant due to active development of algorithms and tools for verification [16], where the \u201ccorrectness\u201d property is given in terms of strategic ability. While model checking of ATL under perfect information seems to be feasible in practice [5], model checking of ATL under imperfect information [17] is still applicable only to small and medium size systems [10]. This lecture is about selected approaches which can make model checking ATL\u22c6, ATL and its time extension TATL more efficient.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1645"]}

The concrete model of an abstraction is proved to be in a stuttering bisimulation with the one of the original system.
