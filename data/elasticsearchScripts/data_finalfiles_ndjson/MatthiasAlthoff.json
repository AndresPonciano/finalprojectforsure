The latter expression has recently become more popular when the interconnection between the computational and physical elements is strong.Besides an improvement in eg the efficiency or functionality, cyber-physical systems provide a better reliability and safety compared to conventional solutions. Examples are driving assistant systems in passenger cars or search and rescue robots. The drawback of cyber-physical systems is that they are complex and thus difficult to analyze. This contradicts the objective of improving the safety of such systems, since the correct operation of these systems has to be ensured first.

The popularity of interval arithmetic stems from the fact that the possible outcomes of almost all frequently occurring mathematical expressions can be bounded. A disadvantage of interval arithmetic is that due to the negligence of dependencies of variables in expressions, results can be overly conservative. For this reason, interval arithmetic is typically used in formal verification tools when formulas are not contributing much to the accuracy of the overall approach, but do not belong to a restrictive class of expressions and are thus hard to evaluate. Although a lot of textbooks and software manuals for interval arithmetic exist, we have not found a complete and detailed description of how all standard mathematical functions are evaluated. This work changes this situation and describes concisely the evaluation of all standard mathematical functions. The described techniques are implemented as a class in CORA, a free MATLAB tool for continuous reachability analysis. Previously, CORA used the MATLAB toolbox INTLAB, but this tool is no longer freely available.

An often overlooked aspect is that motion planning is usually done using simplified models, which do not always sufficiently conform to the real behavior of vehicles. Thus, collision avoidance and drivability is not necessarily ensured. We address this problem by modeling vehicles as differential inclusions composed of simple dynamics and set-based uncertainty; conformance testing is used to determine the required uncertainty. To quickly provide the set of solutions for these uncertain models, we use pre-computed reachable sets (i.e., the union of all possible solutions) for pre-selected motion primitives.

This is achieved by efficiently generating robust control invariant sets based on so-called loiter circles, where the position of the aerial robot follows a circular pattern. Verification of aerial robots is challenging due to the nonlinearity of their dynamics, the high dimensionality of their state space, and their potentially high velocities.

This requires using non-deterministic models for prediction. While stochastic models are useful for long-term planning, we use set-valued non-determinism capturing all possible behaviors in order to verify the safety of planned maneuvers. To reduce the set of solutions, our earlier work considers traffic rules; however, it neglects mutual influences between traffic participants. This work presents the first solution for establishing interaction within set-based prediction of traffic participants. Instead of explicitly modeling dependencies between vehicles, we trim reachable occupancy regions to consider interaction, which is computationally much more efficient.

The human body is composed of joints and links, suiting approximation by a kinematic chain, but the control strategy of the human is completely unknown, meaning the potential occupancy grows very fast and it is difficult to compute tightly in real time. As such, most previous work considers only specific, known, or probable movements, and usually does not account for a range of human dimensions. Focusing on the human arm, we analyze archetypal movements performed by test subjects to create a dynamic model. Motion-capture data of subjects are fitted, for modeling purposes, to two abstractions: a 4-degree of freedom (DOF) model and a 3-DOF model, to obtain dynamic parameters.

Robots are selected because their kinematic structure and strength suit the task requirements, and their motions are preprogrammed by a skilled programmer. In flexible manufacturing environments, tasks can change daily or hourly. The classic approach to automation is less suitable here; buying a dedicated robot for each set of tasks is inefficient, and coding each task is very time-consuming.

{"title": "Ensuring motion safety of autonomous vehicles through online fail-safe verification\n", "abstract": " Safety is undoubtedly the most important factor for the success of autonomous vehicles [13]. However, ensuring their safety is a challenging task since they operate in highly uncertain environments with multiple dynamic obstacles whose future motions are unknown [25, 24]. Even when trying to accurately predict and consider the most likely trajectory of obstacles, planned motions might become unsafe when obstacles deviate from the prediction, which regularly happens in real traffic. As a result of the arising uncertainties, most motion planning methods cannot exclude the possibility that the autonomous vehicle causes a collision. For instance, a residual risk of 0.1% per journey can imply one collision in 1,000 journeys. In order to solve safe motion planning, novel approaches need to be developed which 1) provably guarantee safety even if obstacles suddenly deviate from the predicted behavior and 2) are able to cope with any new occurring traffic situation and measurement uncertainties on the fly.II. RELATED WORK Many planning approaches compute trajectories which are collision-free against the predicted most likely trajectories of obstacles within the planning horizon of typically 5s to 12 s [26, 27, 10]. In safety-critical situations, the approaches in [1, 6] plan evasive trajectories while accounting for likely collisions with obstacles. However, when only predicting single behaviors, the safety of planned trajectories only holds if all obstacles do not deviate from this behavior. One way to guarantee the safety of the autonomous vehicle is logical reasoning. Here, planned motions are checked whether they comply with certain rules and axioms, eg\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1806"]}

We refer to location compliance as an allowed translational and rotational positioning of a vehicle on a road network, i.e., the vehicle does not enter forbidden lanes or regions reserved for other traffic participants, such as bike lanes or dedicated bus routes. Previous work has mostly focused on efficient collision detection between traffic participants and static obstacles represented as bounded sets. We formulate location compliance as a set enclosure problem, which cannot be solved directly with collision detection; thus, different algorithms from computational geometry have to be applied.

Such predictions should be simple and fast for real-time calculation and collision-checking, but account even for unexpected movement. We use a complex biomechanical model to search for extreme human movement, to validate such a prediction. Since the model has a large input space and highly nonlinear dynamics, we use an exploration algorithm based on RRTs to efficiently find the extreme movements. We find that the simple prediction encloses all arm positions found by the exploration algorithm, except where the biomechanical model does not account for collision between body tissue.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1806"]}
{"title": "Determining the maximum time horizon for vehicles to safely follow a trajectory\n", "abstract": " Dealing with the unknown future behavior of other traffic participants is one of the main challenges when generating safe trajectories for autonomous vehicles. When the ego vehicle (i.e., the vehicle to be controlled) follows a given trajectory, an emergency maneuver should be kept available for all times in order to avoid collisions. However, generating an emergency maneuver for each time step is computationally expensive and often not required. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for determining the maximum time horizon under which the ego vehicle can safely follow a given trajectory. First, an upper and a lower bound of this time horizon are computed. Then, binary search is used to find the maximum time horizon for which safety is still guaranteed. Our algorithm reduces the frequency of generating emergency maneuvers while still guaranteeing collision-free trajectories.

This separation of concerns provides reliable systems, but potentially degrades the performance compared to centralized control. Performance losses are acceptable for most control tasks, but for collision avoidance systems one should not compromise on safety. We investigate the performance loss for collision avoidance systems when an underlying yaw stabilization controller is used, which can be found in many modern vehicles under various product names, such as electronic stability control (ESC). Since electronic stability control differs from vehicle to vehicle, we use an idealized controller that performs better than or equally well as an actual realization.

{"title": "Privacy preserving set-based estimation using partially homomorphic encryption\n", "abstract": " Set-based estimation has gained a lot of attention due to its ability to guarantee state enclosures for safety-critical systems. However, it requires computationally expensive operations, which in turn often requires outsourcing of these operations to cloud-computing platforms. Consequently, this raises some concerns with regard to sharing sensitive information and measurements. This paper presents the first privacy-preserving set-based estimation protocols using partially homomorphic encryption in which we preserve the privacy of the set of all possible estimates and the measurements. We consider a linear discrete-time dynamical system with bounded modeling and measurement uncertainties without any other statistical assumptions. We represent sets by zonotopes and constrained zonotopes as they can compactly represent high-dimensional sets and are closed under linear maps and Minkowski addition. By selectively encrypting some parameters of the used set representations, we are able to intersect sets in the encrypted domain, which enables guaranteed state estimation while ensuring the privacy goals. In particular, we show that our protocols achieve computational privacy using formal cryptographic definitions of computational indistinguishability. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by localizing a mobile quadcopter using custom ultra-wideband wireless devices.

{"title": "Hierarchical genetic path planner for highly redundant manipulators\n", "abstract": " This paper is concerned with path planning of highly redundant manipulators, which are particularly well suited for flexible manufacturing. We envision that highly redundant manipulators will be composed of a set of standard modules. In order to find the optimal configuration of modules, one has to perform a discrete search on possible assemblies of modules combined with a continuous search of each assembly to verify the feasibility for completing the given task. This requires efficient planning techniques in the workspace since configuration space conversion is too demanding when considering many possible assemblies. For this reason, we propose a hierarchical path planner consisting of a global path planner (GPP) and a local motion planner (LMP). The GPP generates multiple collision-free paths in the workspace by using the free space structuring algorithm MAKLINK. The GPP passes the paths to the LMP, which determines their feasibility. If one path is found to be unfeasible, another one is chosen automatically. Along the path the LMP selects a number of points as intermediate goals and for each goal it solves the inverse kinematics problem. The LMP is based on a genetic algorithm that reuses the population from one intermediate goal to the next. This nonrandom initial population technique significantly reduces the joint angle variations, thereby increasing the probability that a collision-free path exists in the configuration space.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1806"]}

In contrast, the open-source CommonRoad benchmark suite contains diverse testing scenarios in different settings, such as highways, urban environments, dense traffic, and settings where interaction with bicyclists and pedestrians is particularly important. In addition, CommonRoad provides a motion planning framework in Python, which enables rapid prototyping of motion planners, along with additional tools, such as an efficient drivability checker, a map format converter, and interfaces to the traffic simulators SUMO and CARLA.

Subsequently, the best candidate is verified using reachability analysis; if the candidate solution does not satisfy the specification, an initial condition violating the specification is extracted as a counterexample. Based on this counterexample, candidate solutions are refined until eventually a solution is found (or a user-specified number of iterations is met).

Zonotopes are a popular set representation used eg for reachability analysis of dynamic systems, set-based observers and robust control. The complexity of algorithms that work on zonotopes strongly depends on their order (ie their number of generators and dimensions), which is often increased by operations like the Minkowski sum. Thus, to keep computations efficient, zonotopes of high orders are often over-approximated as tight as possible by zonotopes of smaller order.
