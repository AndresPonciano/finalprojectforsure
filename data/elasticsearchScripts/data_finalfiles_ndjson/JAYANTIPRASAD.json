On 17 August 2017 the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors observed GW170817, a strong signal from the merger of a binary neutron-star system. Less than 2 seconds after the merger, a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) was detected within a region of the sky consistent with the LIGO-Virgo-derived location of the gravitational-wave source. This sky region was subsequently observed by optical astronomy facilities, resulting in the identification of an optical transient signal within  arcsec of the galaxy NGC 4993. These multi-messenger observations allow us to use GW170817 as a standard siren, the gravitational-wave analog of an astronomical standard candle, to measure the Hubble constant. This quantity, which represents the local expansion rate of the Universe, sets the overall scale of the Universe and is of fundamental importance to cosmology. Our measurement combines the distance to the source inferred purely from the gravitational-wave signal with the recession velocity inferred from measurements of the redshift using electromagnetic data.

The GW signature from the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817, along with its coincident electromagnetic (EM) transient associated with the host galaxy NGC4993, led to a first standard-siren measurement of H0 (Abbott et al. 2017a).

A particularly promising source is an accreting NS in a low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB); accretion torque spins up the NS into the frequency band of the detectors, and the accretion can generate an asymmetric mass or current quadrupole that acts as the source for the GWs (Watts et al. 2008). An approximate equilibrium between the accretion spinup and GW spin-down, as well as other spin-down torques can produce a signal that is nearly periodic in the NS\u2569\u255ds rest frame, and then Doppler-shifted due to the orbital motion of the NS\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "48\n", "authors": ["10"]}

Much of the progress in understanding the physics of galaxy formation and comparison with observations would not have been possible without N-body simulations. Given the importance of this tool, it is essential to understand its limitations as ignoring these can easily lead to interesting but unreliable results. In this paper, we study the limitations due to the finite size of the simulation volume. We explicitly construct the correction term arising due to a finite box size and study its generic features for clustering of matter and also on mass functions. We show that the correction to mass function is maximum near the scale of non-linearity, as a corollary we show that the correction to the number density of haloes of a given mass changes sign at this scale; the number of haloes at small masses is overestimated in\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "48\n", "authors": ["10"]}

{"title": "Narrow-band search for gravitational waves from known pulsars using the second LIGO observing run\n", "abstract": " Isolated spinning neutron stars, asymmetric with respect to their rotation axis, are expected to be sources of continuous gravitational waves. The most sensitive searches for these sources are based on accurate matched filtering techniques that assume the continuous wave to be phase locked with the pulsar beamed emission. While matched filtering maximizes the search sensitivity, a significant signal-to-noise ratio loss will happen in the case of a mismatch between the assumed and the true signal phase evolution. Narrow-band algorithms allow for a small mismatch in the frequency and spin-down values of the pulsar while coherently integrating the entire dataset. In this paper, we describe a narrow-band search using LIGO O2 data for the continuous wave emission of 33 pulsars.

{"title": "First narrow-band search for continuous gravitational waves from known pulsars in advanced detector data\n", "abstract": " Spinning neutron stars asymmetric with respect to their rotation axis are potential sources of continuous gravitational waves for ground-based interferometric detectors. In the case of known pulsars a fully coherent search, based on matched filtering, which uses the position and rotational parameters obtained from electromagnetic observations, can be carried out. Matched filtering maximizes the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio, but a large sensitivity loss is expected in case of even a very small mismatch between the assumed and the true signal parameters. For this reason, narrow-band analysis methods have been developed, allowing a fully coherent search for gravitational waves from known pulsars over a fraction of a hertz and several spin-down values.

Their innovative designs, comprising a large number of small elements, pose several challenges in digital processing and optimal observing strategies. The Giant Metre-wave Radio Telescope (GMRT) presents an excellent test-bed for developing and validating suitable observing modes and strategies for transient experiments with future arrays. Here we describe the first phase of the ongoing development of a transient detection system for GMRT that is planned to eventually function in a commensal mode with other observing programs. It capitalizes on the GMRT's interferometric and sub-array capabilities, and the versatility of a new software backend.

We quantify the effect of collapsed haloes on perturbations at larger scales using the two-point correlation function, moments of counts in cells and the mass function. The purpose of the study is twofold and the primary aim is to quantify the role played by collapsed low-mass haloes in the evolution of perturbations at large scales; this is in view of the strong effect seen when the large scale perturbation is highly symmetric. Another reason for this study is to ask whether features or a cut-off in the initial power spectrum can be detected using measures of clustering at scales that are already non-linear. The final aim is to understand the effect of ignoring perturbations at scales smaller than the resolution of N-body simulations. We find that these effects are ignorable if the scale\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["10"]}

Planar collapse\n", "abstract": " We study the interplay of clumping at small scales with the collapse and relaxation of perturbations at much larger scales. We present results of our analysis when the large-scale perturbation is modelled as a plane wave. We find that in the absence of substructure, collapse leads to formation of a pancake with multistream regions. Dynamical relaxation of the plane wave is faster in the presence of substructure. Scattering of substructures and the resulting enhancement of transverse motions of haloes in the multistream region lead to a thinner pancake. In turn, collapse of the plane wave leads to formation of more massive collapsed haloes as compared to the collapse of substructure in the absence of the plane wave. The formation of more massive haloes happens without any increase in the total mass in collapsed haloes.

It is indispensable to have robust and reliable ways of evaluating the effectiveness of these measures. In this work, we assume that, at a very coarse-grained level of description, the overall effect of all the mitigation measures is that we can still describe the spread of the pandemic using the most basic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed ($SEIR$) model but with an \"effective contact rate\" ($\\beta$) which is time-dependent. We then use the time series data of the number of infected individuals in the population to extract the instantaneous effective contact rate which is the result of various social interventions put in place. This approach has the potential to be significantly useful while evaluating the impact of mitigation measures on the spread of COVID-19 in near future.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["10"]}

{"title": "A data first approach to modelling Covid-19\n", "abstract": " The primary data for Covid-19 pandemic is in the form of time series for the number of confirmed, recovered and dead cases. This data is updated every day and is available for most countries from multiple sources. In this work we present a two step procedure for model fitting to Covid-19 data. In the first step, time dependent transmission coefficients are constructed directly from the data and, in the second step, measures of those (minimum, maximum, mean, median etc.,) are used to set priors for fitting models to data. We call this approach  a \"data driven approach\" or \"data first approach\". This scheme is complementary to Bayesian approach and can be used with or without that for parameter estimation.  We  use the procedure to fit a set of SIR and SIRD models, with time dependent contact rate, to Covid-19 data for a set of 45 most affected countries. We  find  that SIR and SIRD models with constant transmission coefficients cannot fit  Covid-19 data for most countries (mainly because social distancing, lockdown etc., make those time dependent). We find that any time dependent contact rate, which falls gradually with time, can help to fit SIR and SIRD models for most of the countries. We also present constraints on transmission coefficients and basic reproduction number R0~ as well as effective reproduction number R(t).  The main contributions  of our work are as follows.

We have presented results from the GMRT observations at 153 MHz, which was used to characterize the statistical properties of the diffuse radiation, using the multi-frequency angular power spectrum, across sub-degree angular scales. We have detected fluctuations in the diffuse emission on angular scales greater than 10'in a low galactic latitude area. The total intensity angular spectrum shows a power-law behaviour, while the detection of diffuse emission at smaller angular scales is limited by residual point sources.

{"title": "Extranatural inflation redux\n", "abstract": " The success of a given inflationary model crucially depends upon two features: its predictions for observables such as those of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and its insensitivity to the unknown UV physics such as quantum gravitational effects. Extranatural inflation is a well-motivated scenario that is insensitive to UV physics by construction. In this five-dimensional model, the fifth dimension is compactified on a circle, and the zero mode of the fifth component of a bulk U (1) gauge field acts as the inflaton. In this work, we study simple variations of the minimal extranatural inflation model in order to improve its CMB predictions while retaining its numerous merits. We find that it is possible to obtain CMB predictions identical to those of, eg, the R+ R 2 Starobinsky model of inflation and show that this can be done in the most minimal way by having two additional light fermionic species in the bulk, with the same\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["10"]}
{"title": "Multi-messenger observations of a binary neutron star merger\n", "abstract": " On 2017 August 17 a binary neutron star coalescence candidate (later designated GW170817) with merger time 12: 41: 04 UTC was observed through gravitational waves by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor independently detected a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) with a time delay of 1.7 s~ with respect to the merger time. From the gravitational-wave signal, the source was initially localized to a sky region of 31 deg2 at a luminosity distance of 40 8 8-+ Mpc and with component masses consistent with neutron stars. The component masses were later measured to be in the range 0.86 to 2.26 M\u2229\u00fc\u00d1. An extensive observing campaign was launched across the electromagnetic spectrum leading to the discovery of a bright optical transient (SSS17a, now with the IAU identification of AT 2017gfo) in NGC 4993 (at 40 Mpc~) less than 11 hours after the merger by the One-Meter, Two Hemisphere (1M2H) team using the 1 m Swope Telescope. The optical transient was independently detected by multiple teams within an hour. Subsequent observations targeted the object and its environment. Early ultraviolet observations revealed a blue transient that faded within 48 hours. Optical and infrared observations showed a redward evolution over\u0393\u00ea\u255d 10 days.

{"title": "Studies on sex-inheritance of papaya hybrids (carica papaya L.)\n", "abstract": " Papaya is an important fruit of tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Its cultivation is besieged with several limitations including variable sex-forms. Since papaya is a highly cross-pollinated and sexually propagated plant, it exhibits wide variability in vigour, sex-forms, bearing potentiality and fruit quality. Sex-inheritance in papaya is determined as polygamous, which is polygenically controlled and influenced by invironmental factors. The sex-ratio in segregating population is the result of interaction of three allelic genes (Gammie and Patwardhan, 1; Hofmeyr, 3; Storey, Ie; Ram and Majumder, 7). The combination of these genetic factors through hybridization may attribute to heterotic effect on expression of stable sex and yield components.
