{"title": "Principles of computerized tomographic imaging\n", "abstract": " The purpose of this book is to provide a tutorial overview on the subject of computerized tomographic imaging. We expect the book to be useful for practicing engineers and scientists for gaining an understanding of what can and cannot be done with tomographic imaging. Toward this end, we have tried to strike a balance among purely algorithmic issues, topics dealing with how to generate data for reconstruction in different domains, and artifacts inherent to different data collection strategies. Our hope is that the style of presentation used will also make the book useful for a beginning graduate course on the subject. The desired prerequisites for taking such a course will depend upon the aims of the instructor. If the instructor wishes to teach the course primarily at a theoretical level, with not much emphasis on computer implementations of the reconstruction algorithms, the book is mostly self-contained for graduate\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "10098\n", "authors": ["15"]}

In this communication, we show that this is not always the case. We present our case first by using intuitively plausible arguments and, then, by showing actual results on a face database. Our overall conclusion is that when the training data set is small, PCA can outperform LDA and, also, that PCA is less sensitive to different training data sets.", "num_citations": "3909\n", "authors": ["15"]}
{"title": "Simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART): a superior implementation of the ART algorithm\n", "abstract": " In this paper we have discussed what appears to be a superior implementation of the Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART). The method is based on 1) simultaneous application of the error correction terms as computed by ART for all rays in a given projection; 2) longitudinal weighting of the correction terms back-distributed along the rays; and 3) using bilinear elements for discrete approximation to the ray integrals of a continuous image. Since this implementation generates a good reconstruction in only one iteration, it also appears to have a computational advantage over the more traditional implementation of ART. Potential applications of this implementation include image reconstruction in conjunction with ray tracing for ultrasound and microwave tomography in which the curved nature of the rays leads to a non-uniform ray density across the image.", "num_citations": "1781\n", "authors": ["15"]}

In fact, the possibility exists for the first time to acquire high-resolution range data in real time for modest cost, since only a single projection and single color image are required.

The vision system maintains a model of uncertainty and keeps track of the growth of uncertainty as the robot travels toward the goal position. The estimates of uncertainty are then used to predict bounds on the locations and orientations of landmarks expected to be seen in a monocular image. This greatly reduces the search for establishing correspondence between the features visible in the image and the landmarks.

Contrary to the single feature vector approach which tries to classify the query and retrieve similar images in one step, CQA uses multiple feature sets and a two-step approach to retrieval. The first step classifies the query according to the class labels of the images using the features that best discriminate the classes. The second step then retrieves the most similar images within the predicted class using the features customized to distinguish \"subclasses\" within that class. Needing to find the customized feature subset for each class led us to investigate feature selection for unsupervised learning. As a result, we developed a new algorithm called FSSEM (feature subset selection using expectation-maximization clustering).

{"title": "Distributed object tracking using a cluster-based kalman filter in wireless camera networks\n", "abstract": " Local data aggregation is an effective means to save sensor node energy and prolong the lifespan of wireless sensor networks. However, when a sensor network is used to track moving objects, the task of local data aggregation in the network presents a new set of challenges, such as the necessity to estimate, usually in real time, the constantly changing state of the target based on information acquired by the nodes at different time instants. To address these issues, we propose a distributed object tracking system which employs a cluster-based Kalman filter in a network of wireless cameras. When a target is detected, cameras that can observe the same target interact with one another to form a cluster and elect a cluster head. Local measurements of the target acquired by members of the cluster are sent to the cluster head, which then estimates the target position via Kalman filtering and periodically transmits this\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "177\n", "authors": ["15"]}

Except for a multiplicative constant, the integrated attenuation is equal to the difference of these two frequencies. Also, this method is independent of transmittances at tissue-tissue and tissue-couplant interfaces. Since the attenuation information is derived from frequency shifts rather than the signal amplitudes, this new method is somewhat insensitive to a partial loss of signal caused by beam refraction. This technique is based on the power spectra of transmitted ultrasonic pulses approximating Gaussian functions. The validity of this approach has been checked by computer simulation.

High-level goals (which we refer to as operational goals) are satisfied by adding operations to the plan using a nonlinear, constraint-posting method.

If the geometric configuration of the world prevents this, Spar adds new operations to the plan along with the necessary set of constraints on the execution of these operations. When the uncertainty in the world description exceeds that specified by the uncertainty-reduction goals, Spar introduces either sensing operations or manipulations to reduce this uncertainty to acceptable levels. If Spar cannot find a way to sufficiently reduce uncertainties, it augments the plan with sensing operations to be used to verify the execution of the action and, when possible, posts possible error-recovery plans, although at this point, the verification operations and recovery plans are predefined.", "num_citations": "103\n", "authors": ["15"]}

{"title": "Determination of the identity, position and orientation of the topmost object in a pile\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we first propose schemes for segmenting out the visible part of the topmost object from a pile of planar and curved objects. We then describe our work on using B-splines for the characterization of the topmost object surface when it is curved; the B-splines are used for deriving operators that yield the Gaussian and mean curvatures. This is followed by a description of our identification strategies which depend upon whether the topmost object is judged to be planar or curved. The identification strategy for planar objects revolves around the EGI representation of their visible surfaces and is a function of whether the number of visible planar surfaces is one, two, three, or more. In case the number of sufficiently visible planar surfaces is less than or equal to two, we have incorporated surface boundary information with angular relation between adjoining surfaces to improve the identification process.

{"title": "Depth perception for robots\n", "abstract": " A lack of adequate sensory feedback remains a major limitation of programmable manipulators for computerized manufacturing. Of the four categories of sensors, touch, tactile, proximity, and vision, the latter two are needed not only for automated inspection and recognition of parts and their orientation, but also for controlling a moving manipulator from an initial high speed to a slow approach just before contact, when touch and/or tactile sensors can take over. Depth information is important for both vision and proximity sensing. Although, for obvious reasons, it is critical for the speed control of a manipulator approaching a workpiece, it can also be useful for the analysis and recognition of a three-dimensional scene around the manipulator. It can serve as an additional and important feature for scene segmentation. After all, the surface of an object can be almost totally characterized by the relative depths of the points on the surface from the viewing system. Depth information may also be used to build three-dimensional moments for shape analysis and for determining object orientation. Depth information may be extracted by a number of competing technologies. The most fascinating of these, and also the one that until recently has suffered the most from program complexity and high computational cost, uses a pair of cameras for stereo perception. The computational cost of the traditional stereo algorithms is caused by the many correlations required to solve the correspondence problem, which consists of first selecting\" candidate pixels\u0393\u00c7\u00a5 in one image and then locating their corresponding partners in the other.

{"title": "Interactive content-based image retrieval using relevance feedback\n", "abstract": " Database search engines are generally used in a one-shot fashion in which a user provides query information to the system and, in return, the system provides a number of database instances to the user. A relevance feedback system allows the user to indicate to the system which of these instances are desirable, or relevant, and which are not. Based on this feedback, the system modifies its retrieval mechanism in an attempt to return a more desirable instance set to the user. In this paper, we present a relevance feedback technique that uses decision trees to learn a common thread among instances marked relevant. We apply our technique in a preexisting content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system that is used to access high resolution computed tomographic images of the human lung.

By \"true\" we mean fields that are not limited by the first-order approximations, such as those used in the first-order Born and Rytov calculations. Although the results shown will only include the second-order fields for a multicomponent object, the computational procedure can easily be generalized for higher order scattering effects. Using this procedure we have shown by computer simulation that even when each component of a two-component object is weakly scattering, the multiple scattering effects become important when the components are blocking each other. We have further shown that when strongly scattering components that are large compared to a wavelength are not blocking each other, the scattering effects can be ignored.

Since the algorithm is part of a real-time visual servoing system designed for assembly of automotive parts on-the-fly, the main constraints in the design of the algorithm were: speed and accuracy. That is: close to frame-rate performance, and error in pose estimation smaller than a few millimeters. The algorithm proposed uses only three model features, and yet it is very accurate and robust. For that reason both constraints were satisfied: the algorithm runs at 60 fps (30 fps for each stereo image) on a PIII-800 MHz computer, and the pose of the object is calculated within an uncertainty of 2.4 mm in translation and 1.5 degree in rotation.", "num_citations": "82\n", "authors": ["15"]}

Given a query image, the goal of a CBIR system is to search the database and return the n most visually similar images to the query image.

Specifically, we apply expert-level human interaction for solving that aspect of the problem which cannot yet be automated, we use computer vision for only those aspects of the problem to which it lends itself best-image characterization-and we employ machine learning algorithms to allow the system to be adapted to new clinical domains. We present empirical results for the domain of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the lung. Our results illustrate the efficacy of a human-in-theloop approach to image characterization and the ability of our approach to adapt the retrieval process to a particular clinical domain through the application of machine learning algorithms.", "num_citations": "80\n", "authors": ["15"]}
{"title": "Evidence accumulation using binary frames of discernment for verification vision\n", "abstract": " Vision sensor output can be processed to yield a multitude of low-level measurements, where each is inherently uncertain, which must somehow be combined to verify the locations of an object. It is shown that this combination can be accomplished via Dempster-Shafer theory using binary frames of discernment (BFODs). A special advantage of BFODs is the computational ease with which they allow information from disparate sources to be combined, which is particularly significant in light of recent concerns about the exponential complexity of a brute-force implementation of this theory.< >", "num_citations": "80\n", "authors": ["15"]}

In our new framework, once a violation of the pose-acceptance criterion is detected, we seek the best largest subset of the candidate scene features that fulfill the criterion, and then continue the search until all the model features have been paired up with their scene\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "79\n", "authors": ["15"]}

{"title": "A probabilistic framework for joint segmentation and tracking\n", "abstract": " Most tracking algorithms implicitly apply a coarse segmentation of each target object using a simple mask such as a rectangle or an ellipse. Although convenient, such coarse segmentation results in several problems in tracking - drift, switching of targets, poor target localization, to name a few - since it inherently includes extra non-target pixels if the mask is larger than the target or excludes some portion of target pixels if the mask is smaller than the target. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic framework for jointly solving segmentation and tracking. Starting from a joint Gaussian distribution over all the pixels, candidate target locations are evaluated by first computing a pixel-level segmentation and then explicitly including this segmentation in the probability model. The segmentation is also used to incrementally update the probability model based on a modified probabilistic principal component analysis\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "74\n", "authors": ["15"]}

In this paper, we propose an implementation of the color-based particle filter suitable for SIMD processors. The main focus of our work is on the parallel computation of the particle weights. This step is the major bottleneck of standard implementations of the color-based particle filter since it requires the knowledge of the histograms of the regions surrounding each hypothesized target position.

However, in the real world, such a solution is not adequate and a least-squares approach or an adaptive algorithm must be used.

{"title": "On combining graph-partitioning with non-parametric clustering for image segmentation\n", "abstract": " The goal of this communication is to suggest an alternative implementation of the k-way Ncut approach for image segmentation. We believe that our implementation alleviates a problem associated with the Ncut algorithm for some types of images: its tendency to partition regions that are nearly uniform with respect to the segmentation parameter. Previous implementations have used the k-means algorithm to cluster the data in the eigenspace of the affinity matrix. In the k-means based implementations, the number of clusters is estimated by minimizing a function that represents the quality of the results produced by each possible value of k. Our proposed approach uses the clustering algorithm of Koontz and Fukunaga in which k is automatically selected as clusters are formed (in a single iteration). We show comparison results obtained with the two different approaches to non-parametric clustering. The Ncut\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "59\n", "authors": ["15"]}

{"title": "3D modeling of optically challenging objects\n", "abstract": " We present a system for constructing 3D models of real-world objects with optically challenging surfaces. The system utilizes a new range imaging concept called multipeak range imaging, which stores multiple candidates of range measurements for each point on the object surface. The multiple measurements include the erroneous range data caused by various surface properties that are not ideal for structured-light range sensing. False measurements generated by spurious reflections are eliminated by applying a series of constraint tests. The constraint tests based on local surface and local sensor visibility are applied first to individual range images. The constraint tests based on global consistency of coordinates and visibility are then applied to all range images acquired from different viewpoints. We show the effectiveness of our method by constructing 3D models of five different optically challenging objects. To\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "57\n", "authors": ["15"]}

{"title": "Calculating the 3d-pose of rigid-objects using active appearance models\n", "abstract": " This paper presents two different algorithms for object tracking and pose estimation. Both methods are based on an appearance model technique called Active Appearance Model (AAM). The key idea of the first method is to utilize two instances of the AAM to track landmark points in a stereo pair of images and perform 3D reconstruction of the landmarks followed by 3 D pose estimation. The second method, the AAM matching algorithm is an extension of the original AAM that incorporates the full 6 DOF pose parameters as part of the minimization parameters. This extension allows for the estimation of the 3D pose of any object, without any restriction on its geometry. We compare both algorithms with a previously developed algorithm using a geometric-based approach [14]. The results show that the accuracy in pose estimation of our new appearance-based methods is better than using the geometric-based approach\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "53\n", "authors": ["15"]}

Our approach is semi-automatic, in the sense that a human is called upon to delineate the boundary of the object to be tracked in the first frame of the image sequence. The approach presented requires no camera calibration; therefore it is not necessary that the camera be stationary. The heart of the approach lies in extracting features and estimating motion through multiple applications of Kalman filtering. The estimated motion is used to place constraints on where to seek feature correspondences; successful correspondences are subsequently used for Kalman-based recursive updating of the motion parameters. Associated with each feature is the frame number in which the feature makes its first appearance in an image sequence.

Range maps produced by DSLS require fewer registrations for 3-D modeling. We show that the DSLS system more easily satisfies what are often difficult-to-satisfy conditions for determining the 3-D coordinates of an arbitrary object point. Two specific advantages of DSLS over conventional structured-light scanning are: (1) A single scan by the DSLS system is capable of generating range data on more surfaces than possible with the conventional approach using the same number of camera images. And (2) since the data collected by DSLS is more free of self-occlusions, the object needs be examined from a smaller number of viewpoints.", "num_citations": "51\n", "authors": ["15"]}

The polygonal objects are allowed to be of arbitrary shape, in the sense that there is no restriction that the objects be convex. Moreover, each edge of the polygon is allowed to have different frictional characteristics. Our novel formulation results in a simple and efficient algorithm that finds grasps that tolerate the largest positioning errors for each of the fingertips at the contact points. The algorithm is both complete and correct, meaning that if any force-closure grasp exists for the object, the algorithm will find it; furthermore, all the grasps synthesized by the algorithm are guaranteed to be valid force-closure grasps.", "num_citations": "51\n", "authors": ["15"]}

The robot can function with non-metrical models of the environment in much the same manner as humans. It does not need a geometric model of the environment. It is sufficient if the environment is modeled by the order of appearance of various landmarks and by adjacency relationships. Also, the robot can response to human-supplied commands. This capability is achieved by an ensemble of neural networks whose activation and deactivation are controlled by a supervisory controller that is rule-based. The individual neural networks in the ensemble are trained to interpret visual information and perform primitive navigational tasks such as hallway following and landmark detection.< >", "num_citations": "51\n", "authors": ["15"]}

The second is an algorithm called FSSEM that performs feature selection and clustering simultaneously. The customized queries approach first classifies a query using the features that best differentiate the major classes and then customizes the query to that class by using the features that best distinguish the images within the chosen major class. This approach is motivated by the observation that the features that are most effective in discriminating among images from different classes may not be the most effective for retrieval of visually similar images within a class. This occurs for domains in which not all pairs of images within one class have equivalent visual similarity, i.e., subclasses exists.

{"title": "Multipath artifact corrections in ultrasonic transmission tomography\n", "abstract": " This paper deals with computed imaging techniques for ultrasonic transmission tomography. Cross-sectional images of the refractive index in soft biological tissues can be obtained by measuring the arrival-time of signals that propagate between two transducers. An alternative method to obtain images is to measure the attenuation in the path between the pair of transducers. In practice, images of the refractive index exhibit a better quality than images of the attenuation coefficient. In this report we have shown through computer simulation that some of the degradations in images of the attenuation coefficient are due to the existence of multiple rays that link the transmitting and the receiving transducers. This condition is known as multipath. We have demonstrated two methods to reduce the influence of multipath on reconstructions of the attenuation coefficient. The first method employs homonorphic signal processing\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "47\n", "authors": ["15"]}

{"title": "Hierarchical evidence accumulation in the PSEIKI system and experiments in model-driven mobile robot navigation\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we will review the process of evidence accumulation in the PSEIKI system for expectation-driven interpretation of images of 3-D scenes. Expectations are presented to PSEIKI as a geometrical hierarchy of abstractions. PSEIKI's job is then to construct abstraction hierarchies in the perceived image taking cues from the abstraction hierarchies in the expectations. The Dempster-Shafer formalism is used for associating belief values with the different possible labels for the constructed abstractions in the perceived image.

{"title": "Some structural measures of API usability\n", "abstract": " In this age of collaborative software development, the importance of usable APIs is well recognized. There already exists a rich body of literature that addresses issues ranging from how to design usable APIs to assessing qualitatively the usability of a given API. However, there does not yet exist a set of general\u0393\u00c7\u00c9purpose metrics that can be pressed into service for a more quantitative assessment of API usability. The goal of this paper is to remedy this shortcoming in the literature. Our work presents a set of formulas that examine the API method declarations from the perspective of several commonly held beliefs regarding what makes APIs difficult to use. We validate the numerical characterizations of API usability as produced by our metrics through the APIs of several software systems.

A generalization of the one-dimensional Kalman filter to two dimensions was earlier suggested by Habibi, but it has since been shown that this generalization is invalid since it does not preserve the optimality of the Kalman filter. A new method is proposed here that enables well-established Kalman-filter theory to yield a simple two-dimensional filter for images that can be modeled by two-dimensional wide-sense Markov (WSM) random fields.", "num_citations": "38\n", "authors": ["15"]}

{"title": "A light-weight event-driven protocol for sensor clustering in wireless camera networks\n", "abstract": " We propose a light-weight event-driven protocol for wireless camera networks to allow for formation and propagation of clusters of cameras for the purpose of collaborative processing during object tracking. Cluster formation is triggered by the detection of objects with specific features. Our protocol allows for simultaneous formation and propagation of multiple clusters. Cameras being directional devices, more than one cluster may track a single object since groups of cameras outside each others communication range may see the same object. Entry into a cluster and cluster membership maintenance require a sensor node to confirm the presence of features of the object being tracked. Each cluster elects its own leader among the cameras that observe the same target. When a cluster leader loses track of an object, it assigns the leadership role to another cluster member.

{"title": "A new approach to the use of edge extremities for model-based object tracking\n", "abstract": " This paper presents a robust model-based visual tracking algorithm that can give accurate 3D pose of a rigid object. Our tracking algorithm uses an incremental pose update scheme in a prediction-verification framework. Extended Kalman filter is used to update the pose of a target incrementally to minimize the error between the expected map of the target model and the corresponding gradient edge in the image space. The main contributions of this paper include: 1) A novel approach to how we use the two extremities of straight-lines as features. By taking into account the measurement uncertainties associated with the locations of the extracted extremities of the straight-line, our approach can compare correctly two straight-lines of different lengths. 2) Our use of a test of mean criterion for initiating backtracking and our use of a variable threshold on the output of this criterion that makes nil-matching more effective\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "37\n", "authors": ["15"]}

We conceptually describe how the algorithm can be implemented on a distributed architecture, obviating the need for centralized processing of the entire multi-camera data. The lightweight implementation is made possible by the very affordable memory and communication bandwidth requirements of the algorithm. Notwithstanding its lightweight nature, the performance of the algorithm is comparable to that of the earlier multi-camera approaches that are based on computationally expensive 3D human model construction, silhouette matching using reprojected 2D views, and so on.

{"title": "Building 3D visual maps of interior space with a new hierarchical sensor fusion architecture\n", "abstract": " It is now generally recognized that sensor-fusion is the best approach to the accurate construction of environment maps by a sensor-equipped mobile robot. Typically, range data collected with a range sensor is combined with the reflectance data obtained from one or more cameras mounted on the robot.In much of the past work on sensor fusion in hierarchical approaches to map construction, the fusion was carried out only at the lowest level of the hierarchy. As a result, in those approaches, only the fused data was made available to the higher levels in the hierarchy. This implied that any errors caused by sensor fusion would propagate upwards into the higher level representations of an interior map. Our work, on the other hand, checks for consistency between the data elements produced by the different sensors at all levels of the hierarchy.

{"title": "A rule-based approach to binocular stereopsis\n", "abstract": " Before the famous random-dot stereogram experiments by Julesz [Jul60], it was generally believed that a necessary precursor to binocular fusion was a recognition of monocular cues in each of the two images. The experiments by Julesz caused a paradigm shift of sorts in the psychophysics of the human visual system; suddenly, the preponderance of the research effort shifted toward explaining practically all aspects of human stereopsis in terms of low-level processes, as opposed to high-level cognitive phenomena. One of the high points of this post-Julesz period was the development of the Marr-Poggio paradigm [MP79]. Marr and Poggio presented a computational theory, later implemented by Grimson, that provided successful explanation of the Julesz experiments in terms of the matchings of zerocrossings at different scales, the zero-crossings at each scale corresponding to the filtering of the images\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "31\n", "authors": ["15"]}

{"title": "A truncated least squares approach to the detection of specular highlights in color images\n", "abstract": " One of the most difficult aspects of dealing with illumination effects in computer vision is accounting for specularity in the images of real objects. The specular regions in an image are often saturated - which creates problem for all image processing algorithms that use decision thresholds. Such algorithms include those for edge detection, region segmentation, etc. Detecting specularity and whenever possible compensating for it are obviously advantageous. Along these lines, this paper represents a new specularity detection and compensation method which is based on the notion of truncated least-squares approximation to the function that maps the color distribution between two images of an object under different illumination conditions. We also present a protocol for the evaluation of the current method for specularity detection.

These rules manipulate non-symbolic descriptors in a symbolic framework; the resulting class descriptions are useful both for object recognition and for providing clear explanations of the decision process. We present a simple method for maintaining an optimal description set as new examples (possibly of previously unseen classes) become available, providing needed updates to the description set.

{"title": "Automation of dormant pruning in specialty crop production: An adaptive framework for automatic reconstruction and modeling of apple trees\n", "abstract": " Dormant pruning is one of the most costly and labor-intensive operations in specialty crop production. During winter, a large crew of trained seasonal workers has to carefully remove the branches from hundreds of trees using a set of pre-defined rules. The goal of automatic pruning is to reduce this dependence on a large workforce that is currently needed for the job. Automatically applying the pruning\" rules\" entails construction of 3D models of the trees in their dormant condition (that is, without foliage) and accurate estimation of the pruning points on the branches. This paper investigates the use of Skeleton-based Geometric (SbG) features in a 3D reconstruction scheme. The results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of the SbG features for automatic reconstruction using only two views--the front and the back. Our results show that our proposed scheme locates the pruning points on the tree branches with an accuracy of 96.0%. The algorithm that locates the pruning points is based on a new adaptive circle-based-layer-aware modeling scheme for the trunks and the primary branches\" PBs\" of the trees. Its three main steps are detection, segmentation, and modeling. Localization of the pruning points on the tree branches is a part of the modeling step. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluation are performed on a new challenging apple-trees dataset that is collected for the purpose of evaluating our approach.", "num_citations": "29\n", "authors": ["15"]}

{"title": "Imaging with diffraction tomography\n", "abstract": " The problem of cross sectional (tomographic) imaging bf objects with diffracting sources is addressed. Specifically the area of investigation is the effect of multiple scattering and attenuation phenomena in diffraction imaging. This work reviews the theory and limits of first order diffraction tomography and studies iterative techniques that can be used to improve the quality of tomographic imaging with diffracting sources. Conventional (straight-ray) tomographic algorithms are not valid when used with acoustic or microwave energy. Thus more sophisticated algorithms are needed; First order diffraction tomography uses a linearized version of the wave equation and gives an especially simple reconstruction algorithm. This work reviews first order approximations to the scattered field and studies the quality of the reconstructions when the assumptions behind these approximations are violated. It will be shown that the Born approximation is valid when the phase change across the object is less than it and the Rytov approximation is valid when the refractive index changes by less than two or three percent. Better reconstructions will be based on higher order approximations to the scattered field. This work describes two fixed point algorithms (the Born and the Rytov approximations) and an algebraic approach to more accurately calculate the scattered fields. The limits of each of these approaches is discussed and simulated results are shown. Finally a review of higher order inversion techniques is presented. Each of these techniques is reviewed and some of their limitations are discussed.", "num_citations": "28\n", "authors": ["15"]}
{"title": "Applying uncertainty reasoning to model based object recognition\n", "abstract": " In model based object recognition, the primary objective is to effrciently match features which have been extracted from sensory data to corresponding features in object models; this being done with the constraint that relations between the features in the object models are m'rrored by the relations between the features extracted from the sensory data. A problem which confronts this process is the dificulty in extracting features and relations from sensed data, and precisely determining the values of their relevant attributes. Furthermore, it is ofen the case that the features which are visible from a single viewpoint are not sufficient to uniquely identib the object and its pose. In each of these cases, a system is needed which can formulate and associate credibilities with hypotheses about the possible ia'entities and poses of the objects in the scene. This paper describes an architecture for reasoning with uncertainty about the identities of objects in a scene. The main components of this architecture create and assign credibility to object hypotheses based on feature match, object. relational, and aspect consistencies. We use the Dempster-Shafer formalism for representing uncertainty, so these credibilities are expressed as belieffunctions which are combined using Dempster's combination rule to yield the system's aggregate belief in each object hypothesis. One of the principal objections to the use of Dempster's rule is that its worst case time complexity is exponential in the size of the hypothesis set. We will show how the structure of the hypothesis sets developed by our system allow for a polynom'al time implementation of the combination rule.", "num_citations": "27\n", "authors": ["15"]}

{"title": "Measuring and modeling apple trees using time-of-flight data for automation of dormant pruning applications\n", "abstract": " Dormant pruning is one of the most expensive, labor-intensive, but, unavoidable procedure in the field of horticulture to ensure quality crop production. During winter, skilled farmers remove certain branches that are connected directly with the trunk of a tree carefully using a set of predefined rules. In order to reduce this dependence on a large manpower, our goal is to automate this pruning process by building 3D models of dormant apple trees, which eventually would be fed to an intelligent robotic system. In this paper, we present a semicircle fitting based robust 3D reconstruction scheme for modeling the trunk and primary branches of apple trees. The method involves estimating the diameter-error, creating semicircle fit model of the tree from a single depth image, and reconstructing the final 3D model of the tree by aligning a sequence of depth images.

{"title": "Sensors for intelligent robots\n", "abstract": " Most industrial robots today have little or no sensory capability. Feedback is limited to information about joint positions, combined with a few interlock and timing signals. These robots can function only in environments where the objects to be manipulated are precisely located in the proper position for the robot to grasp. For many industrial applications, this level of performance has been adequate. Until recently most robot applications consisted of taking parts out of die-casting and injection-molding machines. In this task the parts produced are always in exactly the same position in the mold so that the robot needs no sensory capability to find the part or compensate for misalignments. Another principal application has been the spot welding of automobile bodies. Here, the car bodies are positioned and clamped so that each body is always exactly in the same place as the one before. Thus the robot needs no sensory capability to find where to place the welds. Even in those cases where a robot places welds on a moving car body, an optical encoder is attached to the conveyor line to tell the robot how fast the car body is moving. Also, an optical sensor indicates when each car moves into the work area so that the robot can begin its programmed routine. The robot's computer then transforms the coordinate system of the program to follow the conveyor line. Sensory capabilities are necessary for a robot to function with intelligence, by which is meant the ability to interact with a flexible environment. Such intelligence, for example, permits adaptive motion control in which sensory information is used to modify the commands to a programmable manipulator\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "25\n", "authors": ["15"]}
{"title": "Tracking vehicles through shadows and occlusions in wide-area aerial video\n", "abstract": " We present a new approach for simultaneous tracking and segmentation of multiple targets in low frame rate aerial video. We focus on building an accurate background model that accounts for both global camera motion and moving objects in the scene. We then apply a probabilistic framework for simultaneous tracking and segmentation that incorporates this background model. By using a background model, we are able to track the object through dramatic appearance changes caused by shadows and lighting changes. Furthermore, the incorporation of segmentation into the tracking algorithm reduces the impact of common tracking problems, such as drift and partial occlusion. Results are shown for the Columbus Large Image Format (CLIF) 2007 data set, demonstrating successful tracking under significant occlusions, target appearance changes, and near similar moving objects.", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["15"]}
{"title": "A new approach for active stereo camera calibration\n", "abstract": " By active stereo we mean a stereo vision system that allows for independent panning and tilting for each of the two cameras. One advantage of active stereo in relation to regular stereo is the former's wider effective field of view; if an object is too close to the camera baseline, the depth to the object can still be estimated accurately by panning the cameras appropriately. Another advantage of active stereo is that it can yield a larger number of depth measurements simultaneously for each position of the platform on which the camera system is mounted. Panning and tilting over a large angular range, while being the main reason for the advantages of active stereo, also make it more challenging to calibrate such systems. For a calibration procedure to be effective for active stereo, the estimated parameters must be valid over the entire range of the pan and tilt angles. This paper presents a new approach to the calibration\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["15"]}

{"title": "Metrics for analyzing module interactions in large software systems\n", "abstract": " We present a new set of metrics for analyzing the interaction between the modules of a large software system. We believe that these metrics would be important to any automatic or semi-automatic code modularization algorithm. The metrics are based on the rationale that code partitioning should be based on the principle of similarity of service provided by the different functions encapsulated in a module. Although module interaction metrics are necessary for code modularization, in practice they must be accompanied by metrics that measure other important attributes of how the code is partitioned into modules. These other metrics, dealing with code properties such as the approximate uniformity of module sizes, conformance to any size constraints on the modules, etc., are also included in the work presented here. To give the reader some insight into the workings of our metrics, this paper also includes some results\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "23\n", "authors": ["15"]}

Our approach is for the system to automatically propose a sensing opera.-tion, and then to determine the maximum ambiguity that might remain in the world description if that sensing operation were applied. The system then applies that sensing operation which minimizes this ambiguity. To do this, the system formulates object hypotheses and assesses its relative be-lief in those hypotheses to predict what features might be observed by a proposed sensing operation. Furthermore, since the number of sensing oper-ations available to the system can be arbitrarily large, we group equivalent sensing operations using a data structure that is based on the aspect graph. Finally, in order to measure the ambiguity in a set of hypotheses, we apply the concept of entropy from information theory. This allows us to determine the ambiguity in a hypothesis set in terms of the number of hypotheses and the system\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s distribution of belief amongst those hypotheses.", "num_citations": "23\n", "authors": ["15"]}

{"title": "Exploiting spatial code proximity and order for improved source code retrieval for bug localization\n", "abstract": " Practically all information retrieval based approaches developed to date for automatic bug localization are based on the bag\u0393\u00c7\u00c9of\u0393\u00c7\u00c9words assumption that ignores any positional and ordering relationships between the terms in a query. In this paper, we argue that bug reports are ill\u0393\u00c7\u00c9served by this assumption because such reports frequently contain various types of structural information whose terms must obey certain positional and ordering constraints. It therefore stands to reason that the quality of retrieval for bug localization would improve if these constraints could be taken into account when searching for the most relevant files.

The customized-queries approach first classifies a query using the features that best differentiate the major classes and then customizes the query to that class by using the features that best distinguish the subclasses within the chosen major class. This research is motivated by the observation that the features which are most effective in discriminating among images from different classes may not be the most effective for retrieval of visually similar images within a class. This occurs for domains in which not all pairs of images within one class have equivalent visual similarity. We apply this approach to content-based retrieval of high-resolution tomographic images of patients with lung disease and show that this approach yields 82.8 percent retrieval precision.

Structural descriptions of two two-dimensional views of the scene are extracted from one of possibly several available low-level processes. The attributed structural graph is defined as a modeling technique used in an intermediate role in building a general structural description. An information-theoretic distance measure which automatically accounts for the behavior of the image-to-image distortion processes is defined over the primitives comprising the two structural descriptions. This distance measure is used together with relational constraints to select a best interprimitive mapping function between the images.

We review three approaches to model representation: feature spheres, Local Feature Sets, and multipleattribute hash tables. The incorporation of these three representational schemes into the MULTI-HASH binpicking system has resulted in signi cant reductions in time complexity for scene-to-model hypothesis generation and veri cation. We also discuss the signi cant failure modes of the MULTI-HASH system, as well as this system's limitations regarding the recognition of complex industrial objects.

Consequently, if a high-level symbolic goal is on (A,B), SPAR can also entertain the geometric conditions associated with such a goal.

We first point out the fact that linear imaging systems are characterized by two parameters: i) the resolution and ii) the signal-to-noise ratio in the image. While the maximum resolution attainable in an echo imaging system is limited by the bandwidth of the transducer (s) used, the signal-to-noise ratio depends both upon the nature of the electrical signals applied to the transducer and the type of processing performed on the echos.

During winter, a large crew of trained seasonal workers has to carefully remove the branches from hundreds of trees using a set of pre-defined rules. The goal of automatic pruning is to reduce this dependence on a large work-force that is currently needed for the job. Automatically applying the pruning rules entails construction of 3D models of the trees in their dormant condition (that is, without foliage) and accurate estimation of the pruning points on the branches. This paper investigates the contribution of modeling the trunk and primary branches of a tree using semi-circles in a 3D reconstruction scheme. It involves three main steps; estimating the diameter-error, filtering the depth images, and semi-circle-based modeling which estimates the required pruning data.

In this paper, we describe an assembly motion planning system that, given CAD models of the parts and a description of the assembly operation, automatically figures out which motions should be point-to-point and which motions should be force/torque guided. Our planner uses graph search over a potential field representation of parts to calculate candidate assembly paths. Given the tolerances of the parts and other uncertainties, these paths are then analyzed for the likelihood of collisions. Subsequently, the path segments that are prone to collisions are marked for execution under force/torque control.

{"title": "A Local Approach for Robust Optical Flow Estimation under Varying Illumination.\n", "abstract": " The problem of motion estimation, in general, is made difficult by large illumination variations and by motion discontinuities. In recent papers, we and others have proposed global approaches to deal with both problems simultaneously within the regularization framework. A major drawback of such global methods is that several regularization parameters responsible for the integration of the illumination and motion components need to be determined in advance. This has reduced the applicability of global methods. In this paper, a parameter-free local approach, which solves a linear regression problem using a simple parametric model, is presented. To achieve robustness for the linear regression problem, we introduce a modified version of the least median of squares algorithm. We show quantitative error comparisons between the results obtained by our local approach and those produced by several global methods. Our results show that our local method is comparable to the best results obtained by the global approaches yet does not require any manual selection of parameters.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["15"]}
{"title": "An world-independent approach for the calibration of mobile robotics active stereo heads\n", "abstract": " This paper describes an approach for calibrating active stereo heads for which no prior knowledge of the world coordinate system is required. During an automated procedure derived from this approach, the mobile robot can be loosely positioned in front of a calibration pattern. Through our procedure, both the camera calibration and the neck-eye calibration are obtained. With this set of calibration matrices, the XYZ coordinates of a landmark can be determined with respect to the robot coordinate frame. The so calculated XYZ coordinates are accurate regardless of the orientation of the stereo head, even for orientations that were not used for calibration. This paper validates our approach by presenting results as accurate as a few millimeters in the calculation of the XYZ coordinates of objects at 1.5m from the stereo head.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["15"]}

As a consequence, the system is able to quickly compute a path for the assembly motions and isolate those regions of the path where force/torque guided motions must be introduced to cope with possible collisions that may be caused by the prevailing uncertainties in the positions/orientations of the parts and their dimensions.

{"title": "Comparing incremental latent semantic analysis algorithms for efficient retrieval from software libraries for bug localization\n", "abstract": " The problem of bug localization is to identify the source files related to a bug in a software repository. Information Retrieval (IR) based approaches create an index of the source files and learn a model which is then queried with a bug for the relevant files. In spite of the advances in these tools, the current approaches do not take into consideration the dynamic nature of software repositories. With the traditional IR based approaches to bug localization, the model parameters must be recalculated for each change to a repository. In contrast, this paper presents an incremental framework to update the model parameters of the Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) model as the data evolves.

One tracking loop uses fast blob analysis of the camera images for servo control. The other tracking loop, which is more robust but slower, uses model-based line matchings for a more robust calculation of instantaneous pose. A control arbitrator gives a higher priority to the faster blob-analysis based control loop. But should any disturbances in the system cause the loss of servo control with respect to the input received from the blob-analysis based control loop, the control arbitrator automatically switches to the other more robust control loop. As a result, the system shows high level of fault tolerance under non-cooperative conditions, such as severe occlusion and lighting condition changes.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["15"]}

{"title": "Dealing with Uncertainties in CAD-Based Assembly Motion Planning.\n", "abstract": " A common problem in robotic assembly is that of mating tightly fitting parts when the locations and the dimensions of the parts are somewhat uncertain. It is necessary to be able to reason about these uncertainties in conjunction with the geometry of the parts involved in order to develop motion plans for assembly operations. In this paper we will present a method for the treatment of three types of uncertainties usually prevalent in robotic assembly systems: uncertainties in the initial locations of parts, uncertainties in the control of the robot used to assemble these parts and uncertainties in the dimensions of these parts. The method we will present, used by a CAD-based planning system we have developed, discovers which portions of an assembly operation must be carried out using force/torque guided motions because the composite uncertainties exceed the clearance during these portions of the operation. The method further suggests the type of force/torque guided motions that need to be used for these portions. With this knowledge our planning system formulates motion plans for assembly operations. Plans for a variety of assemblies have been produced by our planning system and have been experimentally verified on both a Cincinnati Milacron T3-726 robot and a Puma 762 robot.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["15"]}

Also, FProlog differs from traditional robot assembly languages, such as AUTOPASS, in its generality, and therefore its ability to interface with many different subsystems. As a demonstration of the applicability of FProlog, we also present an FProlog program which is used as the top level in a robot assembly system which\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["15"]}

In this paper, we introduce SPAR, a planning system which reasons about high level operational goals, geometric goals and uncertainty-reduction goals in order to create assembly plans which consist of manipulations as well as sensory operations when appropriate. Operational planning is done using a nonlinear, constraint posting planner. Geometric planning is accomplished by constraining the execution of operations in the plan so that geometric goals are satisfied, or, if the geometric configuration of the world prevents this, by introducing new operations into the plan with the appropriate constraints. When the uncertainty in the world description exceeds that specified by the uncertainty-reduction goals, SPAR introduces either sensing operations or manipulations to reduce that uncertainty to acceptable levels. If SPAR cannot find a way to sufficiently reduce uncertainties, it does not abandon the plan. Instead, it augments the plan with sensing operations to be used to verify the execution of the action, and, when possible, posts possible error recovery plans, although at this point, the verification operations and recovery plans are predefined.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["15"]}

For example, when stereo correspondence information is elicited from a human, his/her job is facilitated by superimposing epipolar lines on the images.

{"title": "Multipath artifacts in ultrasonic transmission tomography\n", "abstract": " This report deals with computed imaging techniques for ultrasonic transmission tomography. Cross-sectional images of the refractive index in soft biological tissues can be obtained by measuring the arrival-time of signals that propagate between two transducers. An alternative method to obtain images is to measure the attenuation in the path between the pair of transducers. In practice, images of the refractive index exhibit a better quality than images of the attenuation coefficient. In this report we have shown through computer simulation that the degradations in images of the attenuation coefficient are due to the existence of multiple rays that link the transmitting and the receiving transducers. This condition is known as multipath. We have demonstrated two methods to reduce the influence of multipath on attenuation coefficient reconstructions. The first method employs homomorphic signal processing to estimate the\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["15"]}
{"title": "A new stereo benchmarking dataset for satellite images\n", "abstract": " In order to facilitate further research in stereo reconstruction with multi-date satellite images, the goal of this paper is to provide a set of stereo-rectified images and the associated groundtruthed disparities for 10 AOIs (Area of Interest) drawn from two sources: 8 AOIs from IARPA's MVS Challenge dataset and 2 AOIs from the CORE3D-Public dataset. The disparities were groundtruthed by first constructing a fused DSM from the stereo pairs and by aligning 30 cm LiDAR with the fused DSM. Unlike the existing benckmarking datasets, we have also carried out a quantitative evaluation of our groundtruthed disparities using human annotated points in two of the AOIs. Additionally, the rectification accuracy in our dataset is comparable to the same in the existing state-of-the-art stereo datasets. In general, we have used the WorldView-3 (WV3) images for the dataset, the exception being the UCSD area for which we have used both WV3 and WorldView-2 (WV2) images. All of the dataset images are now in the public domain. Since multi-date satellite images frequently include images acquired in different seasons (which creates challenges in finding corresponding pairs of pixels for stereo), our dataset also includes for each image a building mask over which the disparities estimated by stereo should prove reliable. Additional metadata included in the dataset includes information about each image's acquisition date and time, the azimuth and elevation angles of the camera, and the intersection angles for the two views in a stereo pair. Also included in the dataset are both quantitative and qualitative analyses of the accuracy of the groundtruthed disparity maps\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["15"]}
{"title": "A variance-based Bayesian framework for improving Land-Cover classification through wide-area learning from large geographic regions\n", "abstract": " Common to much work on land-cover classification in multispectral imagery is the use of single satellite images for training the classifiers for the different land types. Unfortunately, more often than not, decision boundaries derived in this manner do not extrapolate well from one image to another. This happens for several reasons, most having to do with the fact that different satellite images correspond to different view angles on the earth\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s surface, different sun angles, different seasons, and so on.In this paper, we get around these limitations of the current state-of-the-art by first proposing a new integrated representation for all of the images, overlapping and non-overlapping, that cover a large geographic ROI (Region of Interest). In addition to helping understand the data variability in the images, this representation also makes it possible to create the ground truth that can be used for ROI-based wide-area learning of\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["15"]}
{"title": "Estimating head pose with an RGBD sensor: A comparison of appearance-based and pose-based local subspace methods\n", "abstract": " Estimating the head pose with RGBD data when the pose is allowed to vary over a large angle remains challenging. In this paper, we show that an appearance-based construction of a set of locally optimum subspaces provides a good (fast and accurate) solution to the problem. At training time, our algorithm partitions the set of all images obtained by applying pose transformations to the 3D point cloud for a frontal view into appearance based clusters and represents each cluster with a local PCA space. Given a test RGBD images, we first find the appearance cluster that it belongs to and, subsequently, we find its pose from the training image that is closest to the test image in that cluster. Our paper compares the appearance-based local-subspace method with the pose-based local-subspace approach and with a PCA-based global subspace method. This comparison establishes the superiority of the appearance\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["15"]}
{"title": "A QoS evaluation testbed for MAC protocols for wireless camera networks\n", "abstract": " Existing QoS metrics can only be used for wireless sensor networks when the capability of sensor nodes is limited to making simple measurements such as temperature, pressure, etc. These metrics do not capture the communication patterns encountered when sensing is more elaborate, as in wireless camera networks where the need for distributed computation of image data may result in highly bursty communications among the nodes in a cluster. Whether or not a wireless camera network can successfully engage in, say, an object tracking task depends on whether the MAC protocol allows for these communication patterns to succeed with high reliability. Our testbed characterizes a MAC protocol on the basis of the following three criteria: time-bounded parameter-estimation accuracy (TIBPEA), latency, and energy efficiency.

{"title": "Recognition strategies for 3-D objects in occluded environments\n", "abstract": " Two different types of approaches will be discussed: one for a model-driven system and the other for generic shape recognition.

This system achieves its computational efficiency by associating a special a priori defined attribute with each object feature and then organizing the object features with respect to this attribute. The generic shape recognition system, called INGEN, is intended for domains where precise models of the objects involved are not available, such as the postal domain; objects in these domains are categorized by their overall shapes with considerable latitude regarding the metrical parameters involved. A unique feature of INGEN, which sets it apart from 3D-POLY, is that object hypotheses\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["15"]}

It is shown that in a transient experiment on a dipole domain in a transferred electron device, the ratio of change in charge at the domain to the charge transferred at the external terminals is strongly dependent on the magnitude of the bias step. For a small bias step the charge transferred at the external terminals is nearly equal to the change in domain charge, while for a quenching transient the charge transferred at the external terminals is about one-half the initial domain charge.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["15"]}

Duty cycling for wireless camera networks meant for tracking objects is made complex by the nodes having to anticipate the arrival of the objects in their field-of-view. The consequences of an object arriving in the view-region of a camera when it is sleeping need no elaboration. Our work presents a predictive framework to provide nodes with an ability to anticipate the arrival of objects in the field-of-view of their cameras. Our predictive framework differs from others in that the nodes whose duty cycles are increased are at least one step removed from the immediate neighborhood of the nodes where the objects are currently visible.

Consider that the simple act of changing an object's grasp--the change might be necessitated by the nature of some assembly goal--involves the interaction of the geometries of the grasping device and the object if the change is to occur without a collision between the device and the object. Of course, one could ask, Could geometric considerations be divorced from the highly developed symbolic-level planning? That is, could we first synthesize a symbolic plan and then plug in the geometry for the execution of the actions?

{"title": "Applying uncertainty reasoning to planning sensing strategies in a robot work cell with multi-sensor capabilities\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we describe an approach to planning sensing strategies dynamically, based on the system's current best information about the world. Our approach is for the system to automatically propose a sensing operation, and then to detem'ne the maximum ambiguity which might remain in the world description if that sensing operation were applied. When this mimum ambiguity is sufficiently small, the corresponding sensing operation is applied. To do this, the system formulates object hypotheses and assesses its relative belief in those hypotheses to predict what features might be observed by a proposed sensing operation. Furthermore, since the number of sensing operations available to the system can be arbitrarily large. we group together equivalent sensing operations using a data structure that is based on the aspect graph. Finally, in order to memure the ambiguity in a set of hypotheses. we apply the concept of entropy from information theory. This allows us to determine the ambiguity in a hypothesis set in terms of the number of hypotheses and the system's dirtribution of belief amongst those hypotheses.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["15"]}

In this paper, we present a more general Rete network that is particularly suitable for reasoning with fuzzy logic. In our new class of Rete networks, before any facts become available, there are the fuzzy membership functions associated with the di erent terms in the rule-antecedents. Upon the assertion of a fact into the working memory, the pattern matcher\\pushes\" the fact into the appropriate branches of the network and calculates via a sup-min operation the degree of match between the fact and the rule term.

Evidence Accumulation and Flow of Control in a Hierarchical Spatial Reasoning System\n", "abstract": " A fundamental goal of computer vision research is the development of systems capable of carrying out scene interpretation using knowledge of the expected scene. Here, we describe PSEIKI, a framework for expectation-driven interpretation of image data. PSEIKI performs expectation-driven processing by matching elements, such as edges and regions, detected in an image with model-elements front a supplied expected scene. PSEIRI builds abstraction hierarchies in image data using cues taken from the supplied abstractions in the expected scene. Hypothesized abstractions in the image data are geometrically compared with the known abstractions in the expected scene; the metrics used for these comparisons translate into belief values. The Dempster-Shafer formalism is used to accumulate beliefs for the synthesized abstractions in the image data. For accumulating belief values, a computationally efficient variation of Dempster\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s rule of combination is developed to enable the system to deal with the overwhelming amount of information present in most images. This variation of Dempster\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s rule allows the reasoning process to be embedded into the abstraction hierarchy by allowing for the propagation of belief values between elements at different levels of abstraction.

{"title": "An interactive framework for acquiring vision models of 3D objects\n", "abstract": " This paper presents a human-computer interaction (HCI) framework for building vision models of three-dimensional (3-D) objects from their two-dimensional (2-D) images. Our framework is based on two guiding principles of HCI: 1) provide the human with as much visual assistance as possible to help the human make a correct input; and 2) verify each input provided by the human for its consistency with the inputs previously provided. For example, when stereo correspondence information is elicited from a human, his/her job is facilitated by superimposing epipolar lines on the images. Although that reduces the possibility of error in the human marked correspondences, such errors are not entirely eliminated because there can be multiple candidate points close together for complex objects. For another example, when pose-to-pose correspondence is sought from a human, his/her job is made easier by allowing the human to rotate the partial model constructed in the previous pose in relation to the partial model for the current pose. While this facility reduces the incidence of human-supplied pose-to-pose correspondence errors, such errors cannot be eliminated entirely because of confusion created when multiple candidate features exist close together. Each input provided by the human is therefore checked against the previous inputs by invoking situation-specific constraints. Different types of constraints (and different human-computer interaction protocols) are needed for the extraction of polygonal features and for the extraction of curved features. We will show results on both polygonal objects and object containing curved features. Index Terms\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["15"]}

{"title": "A multi-frame based motion estimation for semantic object tracking in the presence of occlusion\n", "abstract": " Motion estimation in the presence of occlusion is a wide open research field. As such, a critical component of the research is formulating a computational framework. A distinguishing aspect of our motion estimation scheme for solving the occlusion problem is that it cleanly handles the situation where the tracked features appear in different frames and, as features become unobservable, new features may need to be incorporated. As opposed to employing a 2D parametric motion model which restricts the object to a planar surface, we use a 3D motion model to capture the object motion and shape vectors. The precise 3D contour of the tracked object is fine-tuned within a predicted potential field.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["15"]}
{"title": "Imaging with higher order diffraction tomography\n", "abstract": " This paper describes several higher order models for the fields scattered by an object and the computational techniques involved. The Born and the Rytov approximations are easily extended to include higher order terms but like most series their range of convergence is limited. Another technique to be described is based on algebraic techniques and can be shown to always converge. Unfortunately, numerical instabilities limit this approach to objects with a refractive index change of less than 20-30%. This paper will describe numerical approaches for each of these higher order models It reports the region of convergence for the Born and Rytov series and objects that lead to stable solutions for the algebraic approach.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["15"]}

{"title": "Distributed online localization of wireless camera-based sensor networks by tracking multiple moving objects\n", "abstract": " We present a distributed algorithm for localizing wireless camera sensors in a network. Due to the complex nature of sensing modality of a camera sensor, the work presented here differs significantly from the previous localization methods. Our system does not require any beacon nodes, but only utilize object features of moving objects in the scene extracted from image sequence. The algorithm is fully distributed, and the localization estimates can be improved throughout the course of network life as more object features are obtained. We show simulations of our system using a graphical simulator we developed specifically for wireless camera sensor networks. Early results indicate that our system is capable of localizing a large network of cameras in different structural environments.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["15"]}
{"title": "A Collaborative Algorithmic Framework to Track Objects And Events\n", "abstract": " One faces several challenges when tracking objects and events simultaneously in multi-camera environments - especially if the events associated with the object require precise knowledge of the pose of the object at each instant of time. To illustrate the challenges involved, we consider the problem of tracking bins and their contents at airport security checkpoints. The pose of each bin must be tracked with precision in order to minimize the errors associated with the detection of the various items that the passengers may place in the bins and/or take out of them. Unfortunately, pose estimation of the bins is made difficult by the fact that as a bin moves away from the camera's optic axis, its appearance changes nonlinearly. This paper presents a collaborative algorithmic framework to address this complexity: The framework includes simple and fast 2D trackers when such tracking can be carried out reliably, and more\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["15"]}

{"title": "A novel visualization tool for evaluating the accuracy of 3D sensing and reconstruction algorithms for automatic dormant pruning applications\n", "abstract": " Pruning is one of the most essential procedures in specialty crop production. During winter, skilled workers have to remove certain primary branches of the dormant trees in order to increase the productivity of those trees. The process is particularly challenging as it needs huge workforce and costs, besides, the unavailability of skilled seasonal workers. In this paper, we introduce a novel multifunctional graphical user interface which operates in two different modes, namely, manual and automatic, and serve the following purposes-(1) validating 3D reconstruction algorithms,(2) automating the decision making process for selecting candidate branches to be pruned,(3) hence, providing an easy interface with any robotic pruners,(4) training unskilled seasonal pruners, and (5) disseminating the knowledge.

The framework consists of a network of distributed agents having different functionalities. The modular structure of the network allows scalability to large surveillance areas and robust operation. The framework does not assume reliable measurements in single cameras (referred to as' sensing agents' in our framework) or reliable communication between different agents. There is a position uncertainty associated with single camera measurements and it is reduced through an uncertainty reducing transform that performs evidence accumulation using multiple camera measurements. Our framework has the advantage that single camera measurements do not need to be temporally synchronized to perform evidence accumulation. The system has been tested for detecting single or multiple humans in the environment. We conducted experiments to evaluate the localization accuracy of the position estimates obtained from the system by comparing them with the ground truth. We also developed a system capable of tracking and interacting with humans in motion to support human activities.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["15"]}

We have shown how many phenomenological aspects of the placement of road networks, tree clusters, populated areas, buildings, etc., can be captured in a computationally-efficient pseudorandom image-generation framework. We generate the underlying terrain with a fast Fourier based procedure. This procedure is seeded with a pseudorandom sequence, so a small number of parameters can characterize a distinctive class of terrain. Within each class, arbitrarily many scenes can be synthesized. We have used procedural definitions for objects; targets or clutter are represented by different models depending on range. For example, at a great distance trees may look like simple cones. But, as the viewpoint nears a tree, finer details will become visible\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["15"]}
