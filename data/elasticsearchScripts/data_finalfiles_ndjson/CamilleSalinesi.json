{"title": "Guiding goal modeling using scenarios\n", "abstract": " Even though goal modeling is an effective approach to requirements engineering, it is known to present a number of difficulties in practice. The paper discusses these difficulties and proposes to couple goal modeling and scenario authoring to overcome them.

Our proposal is to define enactable rules which form the basis of a software environment called L'Ecritoire to guide the requirements elicitation process through interleaved goal modeling and scenario authoring. The focus of the paper is on the discovery of goals from scenarios. The discovery process is centered around the notion of a requirement chunk (RC) which is a pair <Goal, Scenario>.

{"title": "Transforming attribute and clone-enabled feature models into constraint programs over finite domains\n", "abstract": " Product line models are important artefacts in product line engineering. One of the most popular languages to model the variability of a product line is the feature notation. Since the initial proposal of feature models in 1990, the notation has evolved in different aspects. One of the most important improvements allows specify the number of instances that a feature can have in a particular product. This improvement implies an important increase on the number of variables needed to represent a feature model. Another improvement consists in allowing features to have attributes, which can take values on a different domain than the boolean one. These two extensions have increased the complexity of feature models and therefore have made more difficult the manually or even automated reasoning on feature models. To the best of our knowledge, very few works exist in literature to address this problem. In this paper we show that reasoning on extended feature models is easy and scalable by using constraint programming over integer domains. The aim of the paper is double (a) to show the rules for transforming extended feature models into constraint programs, and (b) to demonstrate, by means of 11 reasoning operations over feature models, the usefulness and benefits of our approach.

Analyzing these approaches, we found that one of their main limitations relates to the lack of guidance of requirements engineering activities.

{"title": "Defects in Product Line Models and how to Identify them\n", "abstract": " The history of software and system development shows that abstraction plays a major role in making complexity manageable (Bosch 2000). Thus, abstracting the common and variable artefacts of an undefined collection of products and organising them into a model may be a good option to manage the complexity of a product line. Product line models improve decision-making processes. In addition, the representation of PLMs in different views improves communication of the actors participating in the product line management (Finkelstein et al. 1992). Nuseibeh et al.(1994) describe views as partial representations of a system and its domain.Several approaches have been found in literature to represent commonality and variability of a product line. Most of the approaches use features (Kang et al. 1990) as the central concept of product line models. However, other modelling approaches exist like Orthogonal Variability Models (OVM, cf. Pohl et al. 2005), Dopler variability models (Dhungana et al. 2010), Textual Variability Language (TVL, cf.

{"title": "Towards a requirements specification multi-view framework for self-adaptive systems\n", "abstract": " The analysis of self-adaptive systems (SAS) requirements involves addressing uncertainty from several sources. Despite advances in requirements for SAS, uncertainty remains an extremely difficult challenge. In this paper, we propose REFAS, a framework to model the requirements of self-adaptive software systems. Our aim with REFAS is to address and reduce uncertainty and to provide a language with sufficient power of expression to specify the different aspects of self-adaptive systems, relative to functional and non-functional requirements. The REFAS modeling language includes concepts closely related to these kind of requirements and their fulfillment, such as context variables, claims, and soft dependencies. Specifically, the paper\u2019s contribution is twofold. First, REFAS supports different viewpoints and concerns related to requirements modeling, with key associations between them. Moreover, the modeler can define additional models and views by exploiting the REFAS meta-modeling capability, in order to capture additional aspects contributing to reduce uncertainty. Second, REFAS promotes in-depth analysis of all of the modeled concerns with aggregation and association capabilities, especially with context variables. Furthermore, we also define a process that enforces modeling requirements, considering different aspects of uncertainty. We demonstrate the applicability of REFAS by using the VariaMos software tool, which implements the REFAS meta-model, views, and process.Spanish abstractEl an\u00e1lisis de requerimientos en sistemas auto-adaptativos (SAA) involucra atacar la incertidumbre generada por diversas fuentes.

In so doing, it addresses two key features of a NL interpretation tool. First, genericity towards the design modelling language targeted by the interpretation can be supported owing to the semantic level of analysis of the input scenario. Genericity allows to interpret any kind of textual scenario into any kind of target design model. The second characteristic of the interpretation tool is its modularity which permits to automate partly RE tasks. Tightly embedded in the RE process, the interpretation becomes a powerful support that participates efficiently to the automation of numerous RE tasks.

Although there is a wealth of research works on the theme of FM verification, there is to our knowledge no comprehensive method, technique or tool.

Among the proven benefits are reduced time to market, better asset reuse, and improved software quality [1]. To be successful, PLE must efficiently manage the variability -- the capacity of product line's artifacts to vary -- present in the products that form a Product Line (PL). Several modeling approaches have been proposed to represent the correct combinations of artifacts of a PL, their properties and relationships in a single Product Line Model (PLM) [2]. In this context, being able to reason about the PLM is an important success factor in the PLE strategy. Reasoning on PLMs is achieved by querying the models in order to verify, analyze or configure them [3]. For instance, PLMs can be verified to guarantee that they do not have undesirable properties affecting the correctness of the products they help develop. Several approaches are available in the literature to support automatic reasoning on PLMs [5]. Several approaches consist in transforming the PLMs into a constraint program that can be executed by a solver. For example, Satisfiability (SAT) solvers are used to analyze PLMs specified as Boolean constraints [6]. Others use SAT or constraint over finite domains solvers to find the number of solutions that can be configured on a PLM. Interestingly, it seems that for this task Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) solvers are more efficient [6]. Thus, authors seem to undermine the efficiency of certain reasoning operations to prioritize others.

As for other specific kinds of systems, the expectation is that better value shall be delivered to DIS users (i.e. different sorts of decision maker such as executives, or managers, as well as control managers or operational) if more effort is spent on analyzing their requirements in early phase of DIS\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1474"]}

On the other hand, product line engineering (PLE) is a promising approach for configuring and adapting products by means of configuration and derivation processes. While the literature and industrial experiences show the benefits of PLE methods, techniques and tools, there is still a lack of interest in addressing ERP engineering issues with the product line strategy. Objective: The aim of this paper is to identify and analyze the different ways presented in the literature to improve ERP engineering issues with the methods, techniques and tools provided by PLE. Method: To achieve that objective, we reviewed the literature and analyzed available publications. Results: This literature review analyzes six research papers at the intersection between ERP and PLE. It shows that the product line strategy can indeed be applied for ERP configuration and customization.

{"title": "Requirements monitoring and diagnosis for improving adaptive e-learning systems design\n", "abstract": " Aim/Purpose: In this paper, we highlight the need to monitor and diagnose adaptive e-learning systems requirements at runtime to develop a better understanding of their behavior during learning activities and improve their design. Our focus is to reveal which learning requirements the adaptive system is satisfying while still evolving and provide specific recommendations regarding what actions should be taken and which relevant features are needed to help meet the specified learning requirements. Background: Adaptive e-learning systems research has long focused on user modeling and social learning to personalize each learner experience, while fewer instruments are reported to assess the quality of the solutions provided by such adaptive systems and to investigate their design problems. The design problems may emerge due to ever-evolving requirements being statically specified at design stages and to the changing environments that can be difficult to control and observe. The combination of some or all of these factors can lead to a definition of inconsistent or insufficient adaptation rules, which in turn may prevent these systems from providing appropriate resources to learners even if the needed ones have been accounted for within the knowledge space. Methodology: An empirical study has been performed to check and validate the behavior of a real-world adaptive e-learning system under four stated requirements. The study used a novel monitoring and diagnosing tool that reads the collected data from the system and checks its behavior against constraints that are derived automatically from the requirements specification\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1474"]}

This language, evaluated in this paper, enables the specification of a variety of requirement types, for SASs from different domains, while generating a configuration, all configurations, and number of possible configurations, in milliseconds. This paper presents these results, namely; expressiveness, domain independence and scalability, from the viewpoint of designers and domain\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1474"]}

Specifically in the case of the enterprise, they represent a land of opportunities to grow in efficiency and quality with reduced costs and time-to-market. However, mobile and IoT also exposes enterprises to new challenges, such as security and safety risks, scale, heterogeneity, resources constraints, or context fluctuations. This paper introduces an evaluation framework that elicits the needed capabilities to enroll, control, and manage mobile and IoT devices, towards properly integrating them with the organization workflow, in accordance with internal policies. To demonstrate the usability of the framework, the paper presents a comprehensive review of Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) and Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) solutions.

The purpose with this new production paradigm is no longer to develop a single product but to develop a product family and to generate the products of the line through configuration processes. However, the potential benefits of product line engineering can be missed when dealing with large product lines because the configuration processes become error prone tasks. Consequently, guiding stakeholders during such complex configuration processes and recommending the best configuration alternatives until leading to a satisfying experience becomes a challenge. This paper focuses on enhancing product line configuration processes through process mining techniques.

The automatic analysis of corpora can bring new perspectives on this issue. We show that process mining, a computer science approach for analysing human behaviour, enables the inductive identification of within-turn regularities in digital conversations. We use speech acts as a way to discretise conversations and enable the analysis. To this end, we develop a fine-grained, corpus-independent classification of speech acts that we describe and validate. We perform a manual sentence-by-sentence multi-label contextual annotation of a corpus of digital conversations and we explore it with process mining.

{"title": "Runtime requirements monitoring framework for adaptive e-learning systems\n", "abstract": " As academic learners and companies are turning to e-learning courses to achieve their personal and professional goals, it becomes more and more important to handle service quality in this sector. Despite scientific research conducted to personalize the learning process and meet learner's requirements under adaptive e-learning systems, however, the specification and management of quality attribute is particularly challenging due to problems arising from environmental variability. In our view, a detailed and high-level specification of requirements supported through the whole system lifecycle is needed for a comprehensive management of adaptive e-learning systems, especially in continuously changing environmental conditions. In this paper, we propose a runtime requirements monitoring to check the conformity of adaptive e-learning systems to their requirements and ensure that the activities offered by these learning environments can achieve the desired learning outcomes. As a result, when deviations (ie, not satisfied requirements) occur, they are identified and then notified during system operation. With our approach, the requirements are supported during the whole system lifecycle. First, we specify system's requirements in the form of a dynamic software product line. This specification applies a novel requirements engineering language that combines goal-driven requirements with features and claims and avoid the enumeration of all desired adaptation strategies (ie when an adaptation should be applied) at the design time. Second, the specification is automatically transformed into a constraint satisfaction problem that reduces the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1474"]}

Due to their size and complexity, it is difficult to detect defects in PLMs. The challenge is however important: any error in a PLM will inevitably impact configuration, generating issues such as incorrect product models, inconsistent architectures, poor reuse, difficulty to customize products, etc. Surveys on feature-based PLM verification approaches show that there are many verification criteria, that these criteria are defined in different ways, and that different ways of working are proposed to look for defect.

{"title": "Strategic Alignment Documentation.\n", "abstract": " Information Systems'(IS) strategic alignment has become a top-level concern in most large organizations. Evaluating and documenting strategic alignment is necessary to determine the IS ability to satisfy the most fundamental organization\u2019s requirements. A number of works have demonstrated that evaluating, documenting and analyzing the alignment requires to use models of the object to align, such as business processes, stakeholders' requirements, organization\u2019s strategy, etc. In the context of strategic alignment, the problem is that there are very few modelling techniques available to document organization\u2019s strategic objectives with the level of formality needed to achieve this task and few compatible with the ones used to define the operational goals. This paper intends to fill this gap by proposing an approach to model the organization strategy and the strategic alignment in order to control and ensure the strategic alignment. The proposed modelling approach is adapted from a goal modelling approach used in requirements engineering. The approach is defined formally with a meta-model.

{"title": "Reducing the Language Disparity Issue in ERP Projects Using Goal/Strategy Modelling\n", "abstract": " One of the important obstacles to the success of ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) projects is the mismatch between the business needs and the functionalities provided by the delivered system. In our experience, this mismatch results in large part from the difficulty to analyse the adequacy of the system to the business needs when they are expressed with disparate languages. We identified in a PeopleSoft implementation project at SNCF (the French National Railway Company) that this language disparity issue can be reduced using abstraction mechanisms. Based on our experience in this project, this paper proposes to use a goal modelling language, namely goal/strategy maps, to address the issue of language disparity in ERP implementation projects. Goal/strategy maps are adequate to represent both business needs and the ERP features in a uniform and systematic way. Once the business needs and ERP features have been represented with goal/strategy maps, a systematic matching can be performed. This matching process results in a collection of requirements that tell how the final system should be similar to the ERP and/or to the initial business needs. The paper presents the methodological framework in which this process is achieved and introduces the typology of similarity predicates that we propose to express the final requirements. The application of our methodological framework is illustrated with examples drawn from our PeopleSoft implementation project at SNCF.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1474"]}

We proposed APPLIES, a framework for evaluating the organization\u2019s motivation and preparation for adopting product lines. This article presents the second version of the APPLIES framework as well as the second iteration of the evaluation of this approach. This evaluation consisted of (i) a workshop with a practitioner who had experience in adopting the product line production approach and;(ii) a review of the content by five product line experts. The results obtained from the evaluation resulted in modifications to the framework content, mainly to simplify the statements and eliminate redundant elements. Also, we detected new functionalities and modifications that we expect to be resolved in the following evaluation iterations. Further evaluations and improvements are needed to mature the framework.

A Requirements-driven Comparative Analysis of Business and Developers' Perceptions in the Accountancy Domain.\n", "abstract": " Over the last decade, blockchain has gained popularity and researchers, as well as companies, are investigating new fields that could be impacted by blockchain technology. Among them, accounting has been identified as a promising field, as blockchain is said to bring trust and transparency to data, as well as tamper-resistance. However, there might be some issues in the adoption of such a new technology, for instance for misunderstanding the goals of using blockchain based accounting systems. Hence, the goal of this exploratory paper is to investigate, based on the question of whether blockchain will impact accounting, the differences in the developers and accountants mental models, and to identify goals and high level requirements for blockchain-based accounting software. For this, we used semi-structured interviews, concept analysis and goal based requirement engineering, on the concepts related to transparency and trust, on blockchain potential and challenges. Even though further research is needed, our results highlight that accounting is a socio-technical field, and that blockchain will shift the conception of trust and transparency, but not completely revolutionize the field, rather make it evolve.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1474"]}

It also supports the execution of code through blockchain's smart contracts, adding automation of actions to the network with high trustability. However, as smart contracts are visible by anybody on the network, the business data and logic may be at risk, thus companies could be reluctant to use such technology. This paper aims to propose a pattern that allows the execution of automatable legal contract clauses, where its execution states are stored in an on-chain smart-contract and the logic needed to enforce it wraps it off-chain. An engine completes this pattern by running a business process that corresponds to the legal contract. We then propose a pattern-based solution based on a real-life use case: transportation of refrigerated goods. We argue that this pattern guarantees companies pseudonymity and data\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1474"]}

The user activities are logged in event logs which contain fields as activities\u2019 names, timestamps and involved resources. On the grounds of these kinds of systems, Process Mining [1] aims first at discovering process models from event logs. However, the discovered process models are said to be activity oriented as they represent the activities and their ordering [2]. We believe activity oriented process models are useful when the processes are linear, mature, and do not involve creativity. Strategy oriented process models were proposed [3] to represent creative and flexible processes comprising the concepts of intentions (the objectives to be achieved), and strategies (the different manners to achieve the intentions). Those models are instances of a metamodel named Map, that has proved to be effective at modeling strategic alignment [4], defining actors and roles, specifying the outcome of business process models and naming them [5], supporting guidance [6], describing intentional services [7], expressing pervasive information systems [8], studying users' behavior to identify and name use cases, tailoring methods [9] or defining more flexible methods [9].Our research focuses on Intention mining: the discovery of intentions and strategies from event logs and their formalization in a map process model.

{"title": "An ontology of verification criteria in the product line domain\n", "abstract": " Product Line (PL) based development is a promising approach to develop software intensive systems. The promises are multiple: reduced time to market, better reuse and therefore reduced development costs, etc. While PL modelling languages and PL configuration processes have generated many researches, many efforts remain to verify PL models (PLMs). Adequate PLM verification methods, techniques and tools are needed for better system quality. Indeed, any error in a PLM will inevitably spread to its configurations and will generate PL architecture stability issues, overbudget projects, etc. This paper presents a survey on PLM verification approaches. Based on this survey, we propose an ontology of verification criteria in which each criterion is formalized using first order logic. The survey can be used for three purposes:(a) to better understand the similarities and differences between existing PL model verification approaches;(b) to set a base ground for automated PL model verification tool, based on an off-the-shelf satisfiability solver; and (c) to identify gaps in the literature of model verification in the PL domain.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1474"]}
{"title": "Improving Product Line Engineering Based on the Versatility of Constraint Programming over Finite Domains\n", "abstract": " Product Lines (PL) have proved an effective approach to reuse-based systems development. Several modelling languages were proposed so far to specify PL. Although they can be very different, these languages show two common features: they emphasize (a) variability, and (b) the specification of constraints to define acceptable configurations.It is now widely acknowledged that configuring a product can be considered as a constraint satisfaction problem. It is thus natural to consider constraint programming as a first choice candidate to specify constraints on PL. For instance, the different constraints that can be specified using the FODA language can easily be express ed using boolean constraints, which enables automated calculation and configuration using a SAT solver. But constraint programming proposes other domains than the boolean domain: for instance integers, real, or sets. The integer domain was, for instance, proposed by Benavides to specify constraints on feature attributes. This paper proposes to further explore the use of integer constraint programming to specify PL constraints. The approach was implemented in a prototype tool. Its use in a real case showed that constraint programming encompasses different PL modeling languages (such as FORE, OVM, or else), and allows to specify complex constraints that are difficult to specify with these languages.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1474"]}

Methods are documented in our tool with methodological patterns. The originality of our tool is threefold: (i) the structure of methodological patterns can evolve, (ii) it is also possible to adapt the structure of the pattern repository, and (iii) configuration management features are proposed to enrich the content of the repository collaboratively.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1474"]}
{"title": "Eliciting requirements by analysing threats caused by users\n", "abstract": " Eliciting requirements is an important issue of system development projects. Some approaches propose to identify requirements by analysing system malfunctioning. Different sources of malfunctioning are dealt with by these approaches: obstacles, conflicts, risks, etc. Our proposal is to analyse each of these sources of malfunctioning using a single notion that we call \"threat\". We propose to use this notion in a method that guides the identification and analysing of each of these sources of malfunctioning. The method helps eliciting requirements to prevent the threat. A threat is defined by a number of variables. This paper presents a literature review of all threats that relate to users. The review is based on a framework that includes several perspectives to analyse user error. The user threats is part of a global threats classification that also covers hardware, environment, design and project types of threats.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1474"]}

This paper presents a formalismcalled map-for specifying process models. Process maps describe the intentions of project participants. Each participants\u2019 intentions are identified in an organised collection of process maps together, and specified with the strategies made available by the process model to achieve it. When they enact a methodological process, the project participants have a view of the intentions that the process models are able to guide, and a view of the strategies available to achieve these intentions. Therefore, process maps do not constrain the participant into a rigid process model with pre-defined collaboration and pre-defined sequences of (supposedly necessary) steps to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1474"]}

Several variability approaches were developed to plan requirements reuse, but only little of them actually address the issue of deriving product requirements. This paper presents a method, RED-PL that intends to support requirements derivation. The originality of the proposed approach is that (i) it is user-oriented,(ii) it guides product requirements elicitation and derivation as a decision making activity, and (iii) it provides systematic and interactive guidance assisting analysts in taking decisions about requirements. The RED-PL methodological process was validated in an industrial setting by considering the requirement engineering phase of a product line of blood analyzers.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1474"]}
