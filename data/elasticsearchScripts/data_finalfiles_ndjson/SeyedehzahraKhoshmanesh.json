{"title": "Cohesion between size of commit and type of commit\n", "abstract": " Predicting what type of work was performed by developers in OSS has attracted several researchers. Previous studies have shown that fixing bugs are usually done by modifying very few files. In this study, we try to predict the trends and characteristics of how developers commit source code to version control systems (SVN, CVS, etc.). We want to investigate if number of files that are committed together is an indication of type of activity. In other words, is number of files in a commit related to the type of activity? Interestingly, we found that a strong correlation exits between type of activity and number of files involved in a commit. To make sure our study is not biased for a specific project, we have analyzed ten projects. Parsing messages in commits and processing the results, we found in coherent with previous studies bug fixing involves few files in a commit and commits that affect several files are usually\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1490"]}
{"title": "Evaluation of power consumption in programming models based on map reduce in shared memory systems\n", "abstract": " One of the most common models in parallel programming is Map reduce. In companies which use Map reduce framework, at each time a lot of computers are executing Map and Reduce functions. These functions are executing many times and the authors can estimate the effect of any small changes in response speed or consumed power in each execution of the Map reduce model to be very high. On the other hand, power and energy became an important challenge in computer systems with high performance, so that criteria such as consumed Power are as important as performance criteria. So, finding the parts of the programs which needs more power is of prime importance, because by finding these parts, the authors can find the ways to investigate and improves them in terms of power. In this paper, they investigate the available Map Reduce framework and programs in this regard, from the point of consumed\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1490"]}
