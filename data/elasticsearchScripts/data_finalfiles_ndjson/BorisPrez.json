{"title": "A model driven approach to the analysis of quality scenarios within self-adaptable soa systems\n", "abstract": " Self-adaptive behavior is a feature which architects needs to include in their systems in order to improve its reliability. However, despite several ways to get it, it is still hard to implement a self-adaptive system focused on non-functional properties. Difficulties to express quality attributes in the system without combining business logic with the self-adaptation logic and to include new services on runtime are some of them. In this paper we propose a model-driven analysis approach to offer a mechanism which allow the desired quality requirements to be expressed in a simple and non-intrusive manner, to find the best services available in a system and, to offer a code generation mechanism which takes the models created under the first objective and generates the necessary code for autonomously monitoring and adapting a SOA system.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1331"]}

An analysis of technical debt causes\n", "abstract": " Technical debt is a metaphor used to describe technical decisions that can give the company a benefit in the short term but possibly hurting the overall quality of the software in the long term. Architectural decisions are considered one of the most common sources of technical debt, therefore, it becomes relevant to understand what causes lead to technical debt from the point of view of software architects. To accomplish this task, we used a survey research method to collect and analyze a corpus of 28 software architects from Colombia, as a part of the InsighTD project. Results showed that inappropriate planning is the most cited technical debt cause by software architects. However, results differ when comparison against engineers and manager are performed. Innacurate time estimate and producing more without quality were the most selected causes of technical debt according to engineers and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1331"]}

However, difficulties arise when repayment strategies are defined because software architects need to be aware of the consequences of these strategies over others decisions in the software architecture. This article proposes REBEL, a semi-automated model-driven approach that exploits natural language processing, machine learning and model checking techniques on heterogeneous project artifacts to build a model that allows to locate and visualize the impact produced by the consciously injected ATD and its repayment strategy on the other architectural decisions.

The combination of the extensive catalog of new technologies and multiple big data sources implies a large number of possible software solutions. Hence, organizations managing STS are facing many challenges when requiring fast adoption of these technologies, due to the lack of guidance on finding the right solution architecture.

Finding the best way to transfer knowledge to students, so that they internalize it and can successfully transfer it to the field, is key to the country building. This article measures the quality of a teaching model that can be applied in physics or engineering, which requires a correct theoretical foundation before addressing practical elements. Blended learning is an approach to education that combines online educational materials and opportunities for interaction online with traditional place-based classroom methods. This model was applied in agile software architectures course and measured through an anonymous survey of students in software architecture, who were enrolled for the periods 2015-2018.
