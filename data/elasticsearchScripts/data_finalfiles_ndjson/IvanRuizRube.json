The former refers to those skills specific to the subject studied. The latter, also known as transferable skills, refer to other capabilities that a capable professional has to put into practice to work in real-world. Generic competencies are usually shared amongst most science fields, and include teamwork, leadership and self-criticism. These skills are inherently difficult to assess, as they are not usually considered in traditional engineering assessment procedures. As a result, lectures usually have to assess them using subjective information. This is especially problematic when the number of students increases. In this paper, we introduce Simple Assessment-Specific Query Language (SASQL), a Domain Specific Language (DSL) to alleviate this issue. It is a formal language that can be automatically processed to execute SASQL sentences using an assessment-specific vocabulary. SASQL has a simple syntax, oriented to learning assessments. Using our proposed workflow, a course coordinator can extract different objective indicators to assess competencies defined in the syllabus using simple queries. Such indicators are automatically extracted from the activity logs generated by the Learning Management System (LMS).

These methods are widely used in the Health Sciences and, more recently, also in Computer Science. Despite existing tool support for systematic reviews, more automation is required to conduct the complete process. This paper describes CloudSERA, a web-based app to support the evidence-based systematic review of scientific literature. The tool supports researchers to carry out studies by additional facilities as collaboration, usability, parallel searches and search integration with other systems, The flexible data scheme of the tool enables the integration of bibliographic databases of common use in Computer Science and can be easily extended to support additional sources. It can be used as a service in a cloud environment or as on-premises software.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1377"]}
{"title": "Design of learning activities to access web-based thematic dynamic resources\n", "abstract": " In this paper we present a proposal of designing learning activities to dynamically provide thematic web resources enriched with linked data from a semantic repository. The approach has been implemented as a tool for Learning Activity Management System (LAMS) that provides an interface to automatically select the related resources that are to be delivered to students running a learning activity. It also enables teachers to share a variable set of learning resources and applications related to a given subject and postpone the resource delivery to the deployment or enactment of the course.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1377"]}
{"title": "Semantic Accessibility to E-learning Web Services\n", "abstract": " Semantic web technologies are all the more relevant in modern e-learning environments that are built upon existing web resources, applications and services, which cannot be completely hosted and managed by a centralised web-based system. This paper shows how semantic web and linked data technologies can improve the interoperability between virtual learning environments and external web resources. The ReST architectural principles were applied and a semantically enhanced access interface was defined to enable a richer exploitation of the services provided by external web applications for the aim of the e-learning environment. Following this methodology, several open source web applications have been integrated with a popular course management system, in order to improve web services accesibility from the e-learning system.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1377"]}
{"title": "A Framework to Create Conversational Agents for the Development of Video Games by End-Users\n", "abstract": " Video game development is still a difficult task today, requiring strong programming skills and knowledge of multiple technologies. To tackle this problem, some visual tools such as Unity or Unreal have appeared. These tools are effective and easy to use, but they are not entirely aimed at end-users with little knowledge of software engineering. Currently, there is a resurgence in the use of chatbots thanks to the recent advances in fields such as artificial intelligence or language processing. However, there is no evidence about the use of conversational agents for developing video games with domain-specific languages (DSLs). This work states the following two hypotheses: (i) Conversational agents based on natural language can be used to work with DSL for the creation of video games; (ii) these conversational agents can be automatically created by extracting the concepts, properties and relationships from their\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1377"]}
{"title": "Model-driven development of augmented reality-based editors for domain specific languages\n", "abstract": " Designing visual models to describe and conceptualize objects and systems requires abstraction skills and a predisposition for visual interactions. Readily available modeling tools rely on the users\u2019 logical-mathematical and visual-spatial abilities to support modeling design. However, they fall short of mechanisms to tap into the users\u2019 bodily-kinesthetic abilities. This research presents a model-driven framework to automatically develop visual editors to work with Domain Specific Languages in tangible interaction environments. The framework is illustrated through the development of an editor of entityrelationship models supported by augmented reality. The editor usability evaluation indicates good acceptance by users as well as potential to support alternative interactions and to learn database concepts.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1377"]}
{"title": "Assessment of generic skills through an organizational learning process model\n", "abstract": " The performance in generic skills is increasingly important for organizations to succeed in the current competitive environment. However, assessing the level of performance in generic skills of the members of an organization is a challenging task, subject to both subjectivity and scalability issues. Organizations usually lay their organizational learning processes on a Knowledge Management System (KMS). This work presents a process model to support managers of KMSs in the assessment of their individuals\u2019 generic skills. The process model was deployed through an extended version of a learning management system. It was connected with different information system tools specifically developed to enrich its features. A case study with Computer Science final-year students working in a software system was conducted following an authentic learning approach, showing promising results.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1377"]}

La m\u00e1s importante es que el est\u00e1ndar ha tenido poca aceptaci\u00f3n en la industria, en parte debido a la propia complejidad del lenguaje, a ciertas carencias existentes en aspectos como la gesti\u00f3n de la variabilidad de los procesos y su ejecutabilidad, y la falta de mecanismos para la automatizaci\u00f3n del despliegue sobre herramientas de soporte.
