Capturing the relationship between a model and its context is a key issue in Modeling and Simulation (M&S). A better driving of the M&S life cycle requires the objectives, assumptions and constraints in disguise behind this relationship to be explicit. A sound systemic-based foundation is provided here to achieve this goal in a clear abstract form. To this end, we give a thorough development to the concept of experimental frames introduced by the DEVS framework, and we erect a specification hierarchy. An application to fire spreading is shown. This work points out several benefits: firstly, it becomes easier to capture and to manipulate some M&S fundamental and advanced concepts, and then to enhance our understanding about them.

Although some interesting challenges remain to efficiently and elegantly support this view, we consider in this paper that this problem is solved. Instead, we propose here to focus on a new point of view on dynamic system specifications: the activity exhibited by their discrete event simulation. We believe that such a viewpoint introduces a new way for analyzing, modeling and simulating systems. We first start with the definition of the key notion of activity for the specification of a specific class of dynamic system, namely discrete event systems. Then, we refine this notion to characterize activity regions in time, in space, in states and in hierarchical component-based models.

By using template metaprogramming, we developed the DEVS-MetaSimulator (DEVS-MS); instead of proposing one simulator meant to be used with every DEVS models, our library provides several metaclasses defining families of simulators. This way, each simulator instantiation is really specialized for a particular model. Doing so, we increase the detection of errors at compile-time, and we greatly reduce the execution time by removing several runtime computations that are instead performed by the compiler.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1403"]}

The required flexibility for such a framework can be achieved by modeling the modeling process itself. The essence of this process lies in refining successive abstraction levels, each level into a lower one. The traversal of these abstraction levels, from the highest level (the more abstract) to the lowest one (the more detailed) involves two aspects:(1) System knowledge reside at different levels of a specification hierarchy;(2) many formalisms are often required for knowledge specification. As multi-formalism modeling provides a powerful means to deal with many formalisms, we show that modeling in addition the specification hierarchy provides the means to support many modeling processes. Both means are combined in a common meta-theoretic approach to enhance flexibility of the integrative framework.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1403"]}

{"title": "A proposal of using DEVS model for process mining\n", "abstract": " Process mining is a relative young research area which consists of process modeling and data mining. Process discovery as a part of the process mining focuses on converting event logs into process models. Petri Nets formalism is identified as the most convenient resulting process model. However, it is not entirely satisfying and needs to be improved with the purpose of covering the temporal aspects of the studied system. Compared with it, DEVS has the advantage of explicit and concurrent time and separating model from simulation. The objective of this paper is to specify DEVS model as the resulting process model. Based on the existing Two-Phased Approaches in process mining, a region-based approach with the suitable mapping is designed to convert the transition system directly to DEVS. A study case is presented to implement this approach. This paper is a position paper and it needs to be completed. In addition, a dynamic semantic should be designed to solve some typical representational limitations and a simulation engine should be selected. 1. INTRODUCTION Nowadays, the development of the information systems cannot be separated by the operational process. Moreover, more and more events with abundant process information are recorded. Despite the omnipresence of event data, most of the organizations analyze and build models based on expert assumption rather than quantified collected fact.

{"title": "Application of model-driven engineering and metaprogramming to DEVS modeling & simulation\n", "abstract": " The multiplication of software environments supporting DEVS Modeling & Simulation is becoming a hindrance to scientific collaboration. Indeed, the use of disparate tools in the community makes the exchange, reuse and comparison of models very difficult, preventing practitioners from building on previous works to devise models of ever-increasing complexity. Tool interoperability is not the only issue raised by the need for models of higher and higher complexity. As models grow, their development becomes more error-prone, and their simulation becomes more resource-consuming. Consequently, it is necessary to devise techniques for improving simulators performance and for providing thorough model verification to assist the practitioner during model design. In this thesis, we propose two innovative approaches for DEVS Modeling & Simulation that tackle the aforementioned issues. The first contribution described in this document is a model-driven environment for modeling systems with the DEVS formalism, named SimStudio. This environment relies on Model-Driven Engineering to provide a high-level framework where practitioners can create, edit and visualize models, and automatically generate multiple artifacts, most notably model specifications compatible with various DEVS simulators. The core of SimStudio is a platform-independent metamodel of the DEVS formalism, which provides a pivot format for DEVS models. Based on this metamodel, we developed several model verification features as well as many model transformations that can be used to automatically generate documentation, diagrams or code targeting various DEVS\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1403"]}

{"title": "From dust to dusts: solid/solid hybrid mixture explosions\n", "abstract": " If solid/solid hybrid mixtures are often encountered in various industries, there are only few available data related to their ignition and explosion behaviors. Thus, an experimental investigation was carried out to determine the evolution of the ignition sensitivity and the explosion severity of such mixtures as a function of their compositions. Various mixtures were studied. Here, the peculiar case of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC)/sulphur is presented. It demonstrates that the introduction of small amounts of highly combustible powders such as sulphur to a less flammable dust such as MCC could strongly influenced the ignition sensitivity as well as the explosion severity. It notably has been shown that the ignition sensitivity of the mixture significantly rises up since 10 to 5% wt. of sulphur is introduced. As for dusts explosivity, a peculiar behavior has been observed due to reactions between both products. These results were also extended to flammable dust/solid inertant mixture. It clearly shows that the concentration in solid inertant at which the ignition is not observed anymore could reach 95% wt.

{"title": "Standardizing DEVS model representation\n", "abstract": " As discussed in the previous chapter, the idea of Standardizing DEVS model representation is to allow a platform-independent DEVS model representation to be executed by a DEVS-based simulator. In this case, a DEVS model is executed in a single processor or parallel/distributed simulation environment. This allows model reusability without the need for performing longdistance distributed simulation. Typically, models are stored in repositories and retrieved as needed. This type of interoperability is very important to achieve, because often modelers already have or can easily install a DEVS simulator on their machine. However, it is much more difficult for them to retrieve and reuse already existing models that were intended to run on a specific DEVS environment. Therefore, we need some way to provide access and share these numerous models. Having a platform independent DEVS model representation format allows us to go a step further in automatic model transformations and generate entire local copies of distant models.Using transformations based on code parsing, we can generate the XML description of existing models written for a specific framework. These files can be stored in model repositories, accessible through Internet, so that anyone (with the proper authorizations) can access them [1]. When facing a problem to which Modeling & Simulation (M&S) will be applied, the modeler starts by searching for an existing model that could fulfill the requirements. If there is none, the modeler can write their own but still take advantage of existing models by reusing them in their coupled models.

Therefore, one of the major research fields is the definition of architectures for integrating heterogeneous DEVS components, meaning simulators and/or models written in different frameworks and programming languages. In this work, we present three different strategies for providing such interoperability between DEVS components. The first focuses on standardizing exchanges between simulators, and has been explored in previous works. The two others strategies are more prospective; in keeping with Model-Driven Engineering, they place the model at the center of their architecture and make extensive use of model transformations.

{"title": "Conditions for model component reuse\n", "abstract": " As Modeling and Simulation activities grow from modeling in the small to modeling in the large, model reuse becomes a key issue. Indeed, modeling is an objective-driven activity, and using an existing sub-model to build a larger one requires that the smaller model be checked for being able to achieve objective-based requirements of the larger one. A key problem is the capturing of these requirements in a way that automated (or semi-automated) semantic-based verification processes can be performed. Trying to achieve this goal, we introduce the OOAC paradigm. Generalizing the concept of experimental frame introduced by the multifaceted modeling framework, and formalizing the model/frame duality, we try to link the composability and reuse problem to the frame applicability problem, ie when does a model be suitable for an experimental frame. Our answer falls into three satisfaction conditions: Objectives satisfaction, Constraints satisfaction, and Assumptions satisfaction. We specify for each condition a boolean satisfaction function, as well as a way to define an interval of confidence in the case of partial satisfaction.

We report on the use of the supported titania nano-photocatalyst in a pilot solar reactor for AMX removal in aqueous solutions. Titanium oxo-alkoxy nanoparticles were prepared in a sol-gel micromixing reactor and coated on a 5-mm diameter borosilicate glass beads. Further heat treatment resulted in anatase coatings of 8 nm thickness. About 450 g of the beads were placed in a main tube of a photocatalytic pilot solar reactor of 150 cm length and 5 cm diameter. Aqueous solutions of AMX 10 mg/L in distilled water were prepared and submitted to the solar tests. Thereafter, pH of the solution was adjusted at 3.5, 7.5 and 9.5 using H 2 SO 4 and NaOH. The total duration of one run was 240 min and the accumulated UV energy was about 35 kJ uv /L of solution depending on time of day. The obtained results showed that AMX degradation reaches 76% after 240 min exposure for pH 9.5 and 60% for pH 7.5. The photocatalytic reactor yield remained unchanged after 6 cycles of 240 min treatment; no appreciable deactivation and/or degradation of the nano-photocatalyst were observed.

In this paper, we propose a centralized cache based approach that is the actual dump of all the numerical operations computed during the simulation execution. Thus, this cache can be used as a witness to track all the numerical variations down to operations level. This allows the finest grain of debuggability in case of numerical errors, which is essential.

Benefiting from recently developed techniques of protein engineering, oxidoreductase industrial applications such as laccases, tyrosinases, and various oxygenases have been recognized as a promising alternative technique as compared with the conventional treatment processes of industrial textile effluents. However, the lack of long-term operational stability and reusability of the above-mentioned enzymes may limit their further large-scale industrialization. To overcome this, a novel biocatalyst was developed by immobilizing laccase from Trametes versicolor onto ultraporous gamma-alumina powders (laccase@ UPA (\u03b3)), followed by transferring it into a portable and easy-to-carry bioreactor for Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR) dye biodegradation.

Concerning the efficiency of the produced materials to lead to safe water in case of emergency, three main parameters were considered: organic matter degradation, heavy metal elimination and anti-bacterial properties.

These capabilities are enabled through a model-to-model transformation, in which the source model is CMMN models, and the target model is DDML (DEVS-Driven Modeling Language) models, where DDML is a high level modeling language for the simulation of discrete event systems. A case study is given to demonstrate the essential principles of CMMN to DDML\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1403"]}

The size-selected 5.2-nm TiO 2 nanoparticles (Nano Building Blocks-NBB) are generated in a sol-gel reactor with turbulent fluids micromixing. The surface exchange between propoxy and MAPTMS groups under vacuum pumping results in a stable nanoparticulate precursor available for 2-photon laser polymerisation. The hybrids demonstrate quantum yield of photoinduced charges separation 6 % and can steadily trap photoinduced electrons at number density of 6% Ti atoms. The materials are suitable for 3D-microstructuring.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1403"]}
{"title": "On the Interoperability of DEVS Components\n", "abstract": " During the last years, the DEVS community provides many contributions towards the realization of a worldwide platform for collaborative Modeling & Simulation. The goal of such a platform would be to enable the sharing and reuse of models between scientists, as well as the seamless simulation of distributed and heterogeneous models. Therefore, one of the major research fields is the definition of architectures for integrating heterogeneous DEVS components, meaning simulators and/or models written in different frameworks and programming languages. In this work, we present three different strategies for providing such interoperability between DEVS components. The first focuses on standardizing exchanges between simulators, and has been explored in previous works. The two others strategies are more prospective; in keeping with Model-Driven Engineering, they place the model at the center of their architecture and make extensive use of model transformations. To make this possible, we defined a platform and language-independent format for describing and sharing DEVS models, called DEVS Markup Language.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1403"]}
{"title": "Modelling the colonisation dynamics of Scots in French areas, impact of possible atmospheric carbon changes\n", "abstract": " The target of this work was to explore the impact of the atmospheric CO2 variations on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) dynamics occurring in two French sites: the plateau de Caussols (Mediterranean bioclimate) and the Cha\u00eene des Puys (Mountain-Oceanic bioclimate). To this end, we built a spatial individual-based model (AFFORSIMulator) which simulates the extension of Scots pine forest on abandoned lawns. This model takes into account inter-tree competition by computing the light occultation the trees endure from their neighbours. Individual tree growth is based on classical differential equations, weighted by the photosynthetic production calculated from both the atmospheric annual CO2 concentration and the light value. Three scenarios simulating the variations of the atmospheric CO2 through time were implemented. The results of the model mainly suggest that even if the Pine settlement is faster under\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1403"]}
