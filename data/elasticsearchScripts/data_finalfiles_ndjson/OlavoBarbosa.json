{"title": "A systematic mapping study on software ecosystems\n", "abstract": " Software ecosystem is an approach that investigates the complex relationships among companies in the software industry. Companies work cooperatively and competitively in order to achieve their strategic objectives. They must engage in a new perspective considering both their own business and third party ones. Inspired from properties by natural and business ecosystems, a software ecosystem covers technical and business aspects of software development as well as partnership among companies. In this paper, we undertake a systematic mapping study to present a wide review of primary studies on software ecosystems. Systematic mapping is a methodology that gives, after a systematic research process, a visual summary map of its results. The search procedure identified 1026 studies, of which 44 were identified as relevant to answer our research questions. This study mapped what is currently known about software ecosystems perspective. We conclude that software ecosystems research is concentrated in 8 main areas in which the most relevant are open source software, ecosystem modeling, and business issues. The paper is intended to practitioners and academics investigating the field of software ecosystems. It contributes to summarize the body of knowledge in the field and direct efforts for future research in software ecosystems.", "num_citations": "139\n", "authors": ["757"]}
