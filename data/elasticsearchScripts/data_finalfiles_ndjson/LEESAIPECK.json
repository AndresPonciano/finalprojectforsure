The safety and efficacy of multiple intramuscular adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ATMSC) injections in CLI patients was determined in the study. Methods and Results: The study included 15 male CLI patients with ischemic resting pain in 1 limb with/without non-healing ulcers and necrotic foot. ATMSC were isolated from adipose tissue of thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) patients (B-ATMSC), diabetes patients (D-ATMSC), and healthy donors (control ATMSC). In a colony-forming unit assay, the stromal vascular fraction of TAO and diabetic patients yielded lesser colonies than that of healthy donors. D-ATMSC showed lower proliferation abilitythan B-ATMSC and control ATMSC, but they showed similar angiogenic factor expression with control ATMSC and B-ATMSC. Multiple intramuscular ATMSC injections cause no complications during the follow-up period (mean follow-up time: 6 months). Clinical improvement occurred in 66.7% of patients. Five patients required minor amputation during follow-up, and all amputation sites healed completely. At 6 months, significant improvement was noted on pain rating scales and in claudication walking distance. Digital subtraction angiography before and 6 months after ATMSC implantation showed formation of numerous vascular collateral networks across affected arteries.

We study how an adversary can systematically query a classifier to elicit information that allows the attacker to evade detection while incurring a near-minimal cost of modifying their intended malfeasance. We generalize the theory of Lowd and Meek (2005) to the family of convex-inducing classifiers that partition their feature space into two sets, one of which is convex. We present query algorithms for this family that construct undetected instances of approximately minimal cost using only polynomially-many queries in the dimension of the space and in the level of approximation.

Here, we demonstrate that BMP-2 promotes chondrogenesis by activating p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which in turn downregulates Wnt-7a/\u256c\u2593-catenin signaling responsible for proteasomal degradation of Sox9. Exposure of mesenchymal cells to BMP-2 resulted in upregulation of Sox9 protein and a concomitant decrease in the level of \u256c\u2593-catenin protein and Wnt-7a signaling. In agreement with this, the interaction of Sox9 with \u256c\u2593-catenin was inhibited in the presence of BMP-2. Inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway using a dominant negative mutant led to sustained Wnt-7a signaling and decreased Sox9 expression, with consequent inhibition of precartilage condensation and chondrogenic differentiation. Moreover, overexpression of \u256c\u2593-catenin caused degradation of Sox9 via the ubiquitin/26S proteasome pathway. Our results collectively indicate that the increase in Sox9 protein resulting from downregulation of \u256c\u2593-catenin/Wnt-7a signaling is mediated by p38 MAPK during BMP-2 induced chondrogenesis in chick wing bud mesenchymal cells.", "num_citations": "102\n", "authors": ["8"]}

We show here that a specific G1 cyclin transcript is highly clustered in the cytoplasm of large multinucleate cells. This heterogeneous cyclin transcript localization results from aggregation of an RNA-binding protein, and deletion of a polyglutamine stretch in this protein results in random transcript localization. These multinucleate cells are remarkable in that nuclei cycle asynchronously despite sharing a common cytoplasm. Notably, randomization of cyclin transcript localization significantly diminishes nucleus-to-nucleus differences in the number of mRNAs and synchronizes cell-cycle timing. Thus, nonrandom cyclin transcript localization is important for cell-cycle timing control and arises due to polyQ-dependent behavior of an RNA-binding protein.

{"title": "Mechanism of carrier generation in poly (phenylene vinylene): Transient photoconductivity and photoluminescence at high electric fields\n", "abstract": " The carrier generation mechanism in poly (phenylene vinylene), is addressed by studying the transient photoconductivity and the photoluminescence as a function of the external electric field E in samples oriented by tensile drawing. The transient photocurrent is proportional to E at low fields, but increases nonlinearly for E> 10 5 V/cm. The field at which the photoconductivity becomes nonlinear (the onset field, E 0 pc) depends on the degree of alignment: the higher the draw ratio, the lower E 0 pc. The dependence of the photocurrent on E is similar to the dependence of the dark current on E; both imply a field-dependent mobility (rather than field-dependent carrier generation). The onset field for the nonlinear photoconductivity is, however, different from the onset field for quenching the luminescence (E 0 pl).

{"title": "Chfr is linked to tumour metastasis through the downregulation of HDAC1\n", "abstract": " Chfr is a ubiquitin ligase that functions in the mitotic checkpoint by delaying entry into metaphase in response to mitotic stress 1, 2. It has been suggested that Chfr is a tumour suppressor as Chfr is frequently silenced in human cancers 3. To better understand how Chfr activity relates to cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis, we sought to identify Chfr-interacting proteins using affinity purification combined with mass spectrometry. Histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), which represses transcription by deacetylating histones, was newly isolated as a Chfr-interacting protein. Chfr binds and downregulates HDAC1 by inducing its polyubiquitylation, both in vitro and in vivo. Ectopic expression of Chfr in cancer cells that normally do not express it results in downregulation of HDAC1, leading to upregulation of the Cdk inhibitor p21 CIP1/WAF1 and the metastasis suppressors KAI1 and E-cadherin.

{"title": "Noninvasive monitoring of intracranial pressure\n", "abstract": " Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is one of the major causes of secondary brain ischemia that accompanies a variety of pathological conditions, most notably, traumatic brain injury (TBI), stroke, and intracranial hemorrhages. However, aside from a few Level I trauma centers, ICP monitoring is rarely a part of the clinical management of patients with these conditions because of the invasiveness of the standard monitoring methods (which require insertion of a catheter into the cranium), additional risks they present for patients, high costs associated with the procedure, and the limited access to trained personnel, i.e., a neurosurgeon.

ISO/IEC 18000-7 defines the tag collection algorithm using the anticollision algorithm, based on the framed slotted ALOHA for active RFID systems, but it has efficiency problems that reduce tag collection performance. This paper focuses on improvement of tag collection performance in active RFID systems that comply with ISO/IEC 18000-7. To overcome the efficiency problems and improve tag collection performance we propose two mechanisms: (1) a new slot size decision mechanism to allow the reader to choose the optimum slot size flexibly and (2) a broadcast-based sleep mechanism to put collected tags to sleep effectively. These mechanisms require modification of the standard tag collection algorithm so that they can be readily applied to standard-compliant active RFID systems.

{"title": "Magnetic separation and antibiotics selection enable enrichment of cells with ZFN/TALEN-induced mutations\n", "abstract": " The ability to enrich cells with targeted mutations greatly facilitates the process of using engineered nucleases, including zinc-finger nucleases and transcription activator-like effector nucleases, to construct such cells. We previously used surrogate reporters to enrich cells containing nuclease-induced mutations via flow cytometry. This method is, however, limited by the availability of flow cytometers. Furthermore, sorted cells occasionally fail to form colonies after exposure to a strong laser and hydrostatic pressure. Here we describe two different types of novel reporters that enable mutant cell enrichment without the use of flow cytometers. We designed reporters that express H-2Kk, a surface antigen, and the hygromycin resistance protein (HygroR), respectively, when insertions or deletions are generated at the target sequences by the activity of engineered nucleases. After cotransfection of these reporters and the engineered nuclease-encoding plasmids, H-2Kk- and HygroR-expressing cells were isolated using magnetic separation and hygromycin treatment, respectively. We found that mutant cells were drastically enriched in the isolated cells, suggesting that these two reporters enable efficient enrichment of mutants.

The molecular basis of how the translation of mRNAs encoding guidance proteins could be closely tied to the pace of cytoskeletal assembly is poorly understood. Previous studies have shown that the F-actin-microtubule crosslinker Short stop (Shot) is required for motor and sensory axon extension in the Drosophila embryo. Here,we provide biochemical and genetic evidence that Shot functions with a novel translation inhibitor, Krasavietz (Kra, Exba), to steer longitudinally directed CNS axons away from the midline. Kra binds directly to the C-terminus of Shot, and this interaction is required for the activity of Shot to support midline axon repulsion. shot and kra mutations lead to weak robo-like phenotypes, and synergistically affect midline avoidance of CNS axons.

{"title": "Inventory models with fixed and variable lead time crash costs considerations\n", "abstract": " Most of the literature pertaining to inventory problems assumes lead time to be a prescribed parameter and thus not subject to control. In many practical situations, inventory lead time can be shortened at the expense of additional cost. Hence, the variable lead time can be regarded as a decision variable since it can be decomposed into several components, each having a crash cost function for the respective reduced lead time. However, in the related research each such crash cost is often treated only as a function of the reduced lead time. In this paper, crash cost is represented as a function of both the order quantity and the reduced lead time. An inventory model with normal demand is first presented and another model with unknown demand distribution is also discussed. Numerical examples are included to illustrate the procedures of the algorithms. These examples also show that the crash priority changes as\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "65\n", "authors": ["8"]}

Recently, protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) has emerged as a key phosphatase of p53, which modulates the interaction of p53 with its regulatory protein mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) and transcriptional activity. In the present study, we demonstrate the potential role of PP1 nuclear targeting subunit (PNUTS) in regulating the phosphorylation and apoptotic activities of p53. Hypoxia significantly increased mRNA and protein expression of PNUTS in various cell lines concomitantly with increases in p53. Promoter analysis confirmed the presence of hypoxia response elements in the promoter region of the PNUTS gene, which respond to hypoxia and forced expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 \u256c\u2592.

Several studies have demonstrated that endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), adult stem cells contributing to the regeneration of vascular endothelium, are dysfunctional under diabetic condition resulting in impaired peripheral circulation and delayed wound healing. In this study, we investigated the cellular alteration of EPCs under high glucose condition, to elucidate the mechanisms underlying diabetes-associated EPC dysfunction. EPCs were isolated from bone marrow and cultured in normal glucose (5.5 mM)-or high glucose (HG; 30 mM)-containing medium. High glucose treated-EPCs showed decreased ability to form tubule-like networks in Matrigel compared to EPCs under normal glucose, which matched well to the clinical observation of diabetic EPC dysfunction. Conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II was increased in EPCs under HG condition, showing that HG induced autophagy in EPCs. Flow cytometric analysis revealed generation of oxidative stress and disruption of mitochondrial permeability in HG exposed EPCs. Increased mitochondrial oxidative stress was also observed by mitochondria-specific superoxide indicator, MitoSOX TM. Taken together, we demonstrated that autophagy and mitochondrial impairment were induced in EPCs under high glucose condition, giving a new insight into the mechanism underlying dysfunction of diabetic EPCs.

{"title": "Low T cell receptor expression and thermal fluctuations contribute to formation of dynamic multifocal synapses in thymocytes\n", "abstract": " Mature T cell activation and selection of immature T cells (thymocytes) are both initiated by binding of T cell receptor (TCR) molecules on the surface of T cells to MHC peptide (MHCp) molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. Recent experiments have shown that the spatial pattern of receptors and ligands in the intercellular junction (synapse) is different during thymocyte selection compared with mature T cell activation. Using a statistical mechanical model, we show that lower TCR expression in thymocytes contributes to effecting these differences. An analogy with the phase behavior of simple fluids helps clarify how, for low TCR expression, thermal fluctuations lead to the dynamic synapse patterns observed for thymocytes. We suggest that a different synapse pattern resulting from lower TCR expression, which could mediate differential signaling, may be the reason why TCR expression level is low in\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "49\n", "authors": ["8"]}

The outcome of requirements prioritization is an ordering of requirements which need to be considered first during the software development process.

Although several requirements prioritization methods have been proposed so far, no particular method or approach is presented to consider both functional and nonfunctional requirements during the prioritization stage. In this paper, we propose an approach which aims to integrate the process of prioritizing functional and nonfunctional requirements. The outcome of applying the proposed approach produces two separate prioritized lists of functional and non-functional requirements. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been evaluated through an empirical experiment aimed at comparing the approach with the two state-of-the-art-based approaches, analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and hybrid assessment method (HAM).

Endoscopic sclerotherapy and medical therapy are considered as first-line management with surgical shunts reserved for refractory situations. Surgical shunts can be associated with a high mortality in this population and may complicate subsequent OLT. The transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) has been recommended in these patients as a bridge to OLT. This is a new modality that has not been compared with previously established therapies such as the distal splenorenal shunt (DSRS). In this study we report our experience with 35 liver transplant recipients who had a previous TIPS (18 patients) or DSRS (17 patients) for variceal bleeding. The TIPS group had a significantly larger proportion of critically ill and Child-Pugh C patients. Mean operating time was more prolonged in the DSRS group (P= 0.014) but transfusion requirements were similar. Intraoperative portal vein blood flow measurements averaged 2132+/-725 ml/min in the TIPS group compared with 1120+/-351 ml/min in the DSRS group (P< 0.001). Arterial flows were similar. Mean ICU and hospital stays were similar. There were 3 hospital mortalities in the DSRS group and none in the TIPS group (P= 0.1).

For the low temperature annealing, the carbon dissolution into lamellar ferrite due to strain aging would enhance not only the increase of strength but also the occurrence of delamination. However, as annealing temperatures and annealing time increase further, age softening, including such as the break-up and the spheroidization of lamellar cementite, starts to operate. Consequently, the reduction of carbon content dissolved in lamellar ferrite would result in the decrease of tensile strength and suppress the occurrence of delamination. The voids formed at the surface of globular cementite particle, which were produced during post-deformation annealing at high temperatures for a long time, would act as one of the origins for delamination during\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "41\n", "authors": ["8"]}

Most studies have focused on gas-phase doping with chemical vapor deposition. However, that requires a complicated transfer process that causes undesired doping and defects by residual polymers. Here, we report a solid-phase synthesis of doped graphene by means of silicon carbide (SiC) substrate including a dopant source driven by pulsed laser irradiation. This method provides in situ direct growth of doped graphene on an insulating SiC substrate without a transfer step. A numerical simulation on the temperature history of the SiC surface during laser irradiation reveals that the surface temperature of SiC can be accurately controlled to grow nitrogen-doped graphene from the thermal decomposition of nitrogen-doped SiC.

Common term-weighting techniques may not be optimal to deal with text data from software repositories due to the origin of term-weighting techniques from a natural language context.ObjectiveThis paper describes how the consideration of when the terms were used in the repositories, under the condition of weighting only the noun terms, can improve a feature location approach.MethodWe propose a feature location approach using a new term-weighting technique that takes into account how\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "38\n", "authors": ["8"]}

High cholesterol diet induced nitric oxide production in the plasma of Ldlr-/-mice. Tilianin reduced the level of nitric oxide (NO) in plasma from Ldlr-/-mice induced by the high cholesterol diet. Tilianin also inhibited the NO production from the primary culture of peritoneal macrophages treated with lipopolysaccharide. The inhibition of NO production was caused by the suppression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene expression in peritoneal macrophages isolated from Ldlr-/-mice. Moreover, tilianin inhibited the transcriptional activation of iNOS promoter that has NF-\u256c\u2551 B binding element. Thus, these results provide the first evidence that tilianin inhibit iNOS expression and production\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "36\n", "authors": ["8"]}

{"title": "Theoretical verification on the motion error analysis method of hydrostatic bearing tables using a transfer function\n", "abstract": " A new method using a transfer function is introduced in the present paper for analyzing the motion errors of hydrostatic bearing tables. The relationship between film reaction force in a single-side hydrostatic pad and the form error of guide rail is derived at various spatial frequencies by finite element analysis, and it is expressed as a transfer function. This transfer function clarifies so called'the averaging effect of an oil film'quantitively. It is found that the amplitude of film force is reduced as the spatial frequency increases or the relative width of the pocket is reduced. The motion errors of a multi pad type table are estimated using a transfer function, the form errors of a guide rail and the geometric relationship between the pads. The method is named as the Transfer Function Method (TFM). The motion errors calculated by the TFM show good agreement with the motion errors calculated by the Multi Pad Method considering the entire table as an analysis object. From the results, it is confirmed that the proposed TFM is very effective to analyze the motion errors of hydrostatic tables.", "num_citations": "36\n", "authors": ["8"]}

{"title": "TRP channels in skin: from physiological implications to clinical significances\n", "abstract": " TRP channels are expressed in various cells in skin. As an organ system to border the host and environment, many nonneuronal cells, including epidermal keratinocytes and melanocytes, express several TRP channels functionally distinct from sensory processing. TRPV1 and TRPV3 in keratinocytes of the epidermis and hair apparatus inhibit proliferation, induce terminal differentiation, induce apoptosis, and promote inflammation. Activation of TRPV4, 6, and TRPA1 promotes regeneration of the severed skin barriers. TRPA1 also enhances responses in contact hypersensitivity. TRPCs in keratinocytes regulate epidermal differentiation. In human diseases with pertubered epidermal differentiation, the expression of TRPCs are altered. TRPMs, which contribute to melanin production in melanocytes, serve as significant prognosis markers in patients with metastatic melanoma. In summary, not only act in sensory processing, TRP channels also contribute to epidermal differentiation, proliferation, barrier integration, skin regeneration, and immune responses.

{"title": "Small heterodimer partner-targeting therapy inhibits systemic inflammatory responses through mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2\n", "abstract": " The orphan nuclear receptor, small heterodimer partner (SHP), appears to play a negative regulatory role in innate immune signaling. Emerging evidence warrants further study on the therapeutic targeting of SHP to suppress excessive and deleterious inflammation. Here we show that fenofibrate, which targets SHP, is required for inhibiting systemic inflammation via mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2). In vivo administration of fenofibrate ameliorated systemic inflammatory responses and increased survival upon experimental sepsis through SHP. An abundance of SHP was observed in mice fed fenofibrate and in cultured macrophages through LKB1-dependent activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase pathway. Fenofibrate significantly blocked endotoxin-triggered inflammatory signaling responses via SHP, but not via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-\u256c\u2592. In addition to the known mechanism by which SHP modulates innate signaling, we identify a new role of fenofibrate-induced SHP on UCP2 induction, which is required for the suppression of inflammatory responses through modulation of mitochondrial ROS production. These data strongly suggest that the SHP-inducing drug fenofibrate paves the way for novel therapies for systemic inflammation by targeting SHP.", "num_citations": "33\n", "authors": ["8"]}

The haplotypes were not associated geographically and had a shallow genealogy. Pairwise  tests and a two-dimensional scaling analysis revealed no significant genetic differentiation among most of the populations. The low pairwise comparison values, but significant genetic differentiation of a northeastern population from all other populations, might have been influenced by a restriction in gene flow caused by hydrographic conditions such as ocean boundaries.

In this study, we investigated the association between 3 polymorphisms of PON1 located in intron 5 (17899insdelTT and 17974CT) and exon 6 (192QR) and serum PON1 activity. The genetic polymorphisms and serum activity of PON1 were analyzed in 153 healthy Koreans by using a direct sequencing assay and spectrophotometric method, respectively. A significant linkage disequilibrium (LD) was observed between all tested single nucleotide polymorphisms, with the strongest LD observed between 17899insdelTT and 192QR (D'= 0.984). The 17899insdelTT, 17974CT and 192QR genetic polymorphisms were associated with significant differences in serum paraoxonase activity. In multiple regression analyses, smoking, triglyceride level, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level, and the 17899insdelTT and 192QR genetic polymorphisms were significant determinants of serum paraoxonase activity, while age, smoking, triglyceride level, HDL level, and the 192QR genetic polymorphism were significant determinants of serum arylesterase activity. These results suggest that although the 192QR genetic polymorphism in the coding region of PON1 is primarily associated with serum PON1 activity, the intronic polymorphisms are also involved in serum PON1 activity, and this association may be mediated by LD.", "num_citations": "33\n", "authors": ["8"]}

By the fitting analysis, some physical parameters are extracted and different annealing effects can be explained by the parameters. The improvements in diode characteristics by post implantation annealing can be explained by the changes of trap density, donor concentration, minority carrier lifetime, and generation lifetime.

This paper presents a new friction compensation method that estimates the machine tool load in real time and considers its effect on friction characteristics. A friction observer based on a Kalman filter with load estimation is proposed for friction compensation control considering the applied load change.

PMN harvested from heparinized blood were incubated with iron dextran (0-20 mM) in culture medium (RPMI) for 24 hours at 37 degrees C with 5% CO2 following which function and viability were assessed by flow cytometry using appropriate fluorescent labels. RESULTS: Unstimulated, S. aureus and N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP)-stimulated hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production was significantly higher in PMN unexposed to iron dextran from HD patients compared to those from healthy subjects. Iron dextran had no impact on unstimulated PMN H2O2 production in either group. In the healthy group, the only significant change occurred with 4-beta-phorbol 12-beta-myristate 13-alpha-acetate (PMA) stimulation, where cells exposed to 0.2 and 2.0 mM iron dextran produced less H2O2 relative to PMN unexposed to iron dextran (p< 0.05). In the HD group, all concentrations of iron dextran significantly attenuated H2O2 production stimulated by S. aureus, fMLP and PMA compared to PMN unexposed to iron dextran.

Analysis of hydrographic observations in the subpolar seas reveals freshening signals in the 2010s. The sources of this freshening are yet to be determined. In this study, the relationship between the surplus Greenland freshwater flux and this freshening is tested by analyzing the propagation of the Greenland freshwater anomaly and its impact on salinity in the subpolar North Atlantic based on observational data and numerical experiments with and without the Greenland runoff. A passive tracer is continuously released during the simulations at freshwater sources along the coast of Greenland to track the Greenland freshwater anomaly.

{"title": "Application of multisection packing concept to sorption-enhanced steam methane reforming reaction for high-purity hydrogen production\n", "abstract": " Hydrogen has been gaining popularity as a new clean energy carrier, and bulk hydrogen production is achieved through the steam methane reforming (SMR) reaction. Since hydrogen produced via the SMR reaction contains large amounts of impurities such as unreacted reactants and byproducts, additional purification steps are needed to produce high-purity hydrogen. By applying the sorption-enhanced reaction (SER), in which catalytic reaction and CO2 byproduct removal are carried out simultaneously in a single reactor, high-purity hydrogen can be directly produced. Additionally, the thermodynamic limitation of conventional SMR reaction is circumvented, and the SMR reaction process becomes simplified. To improve the performance of the SER, a multisection packing concept was recently proposed. In this study, the multisection packing concept is experimentally demonstrated by applying it to a sorption\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "29\n", "authors": ["8"]}

However, whether the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mediates EGF-enhanced HNSCC metastasis remains unclear. Interestingly, we found that EGF induced COX-2 expression mainly in HNSCC. The tumor cell transformation induced by EGF was repressed by COX-2 knockdown, and this repression was reversed by simultaneously treating the cells with EGF and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2). The down-regulation of COX-2 expression or inhibition of COX-2 activity significantly blocked EGF enhancement of cell migration and invasion, but the addition of PGE 2 compensated for this inhibitory effect in COX-2-knockdown cells. COX-2 depletion inhibited EGF-induced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, and fibronectin expression\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "29\n", "authors": ["8"]}

Further, we find weak evidence that the size of dividend changes is related to future profitability. We also find that dividend increases in the recovery years of the Asian 1997 financial crisis are related with one year ahead of earnings increases.

Behavior measurement can thus be used to evaluate safety performance and prevent serious accidents. However, the time-consuming task involved in field observation has made it difficult to monitor workers' behavior on a jobsite.

First, prior models representing unsafe actions are collected through experiments and used to identify similar actions in site videos. Then, 3D human skeleton models are extracted from these videos, and both these skeleton models and prior models are transformed onto the same space for motion detection. As a case study, motion data for actions during ladder-climbing are collected and tested.

The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) is a globally used tool to measure QoL after PCa treatment that comprises urinary, bowel, sexual, and hormonal domains. Acknowledging the need for such a tool applicable to Korean PCa patients, we translated EPIC into Korean and validated the new version.Materials and MethodsThe Korean version of EPIC was devised by translation, back-translation, and reconciliation. Subsequently, we randomly selected 153 patients with localized PCa treated with radical perineal prostatectomy (67, 43.8%), radical retropubic prostatectomy (19, 12.4%), laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (12, 7.8%), robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (36, 23.5%), and high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation of the prostate (19, 12.4%) and asked them to complete EPIC. Reliability was assessed by test-retest correlation and Cronbach's alpha. Validity was assessed by factor analysis, interscale correlation, and correlation with Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P).ResultsTest-retest correlation and Cronbach's alpha were high in each of the domains (0.92, 0.91, 0.76, 0.84 and 0.86, 0.84, 0.92, 0.83, p< 0.0001).

The nanocrystals were synthesized by partial oxidation of silicon-germanium, Si0.54Ge0.46, films. Under constant current density bias in accumulation and inversion, Ge nanocrystals with diameters of 5 and 10nm exhibit strong luminescence at 1350nm. The 1350nm EL peak is only observed in the presence of elemental Ge and is enhanced with the formation of Ge nanocrystals. The introduction of hydrogen during annealing passivates the dangling bonds at the interfaces of nanocrystals, thus minimizing the energy spread in the 1350nm peak. The 1350nm peak intensity is a function of the injected carrier density, while the peak location remains constant in energy and independent of the applied bias.

It was confirmed from the scanned photocurrent curves that the essential role of FGRs is to disperse the curved equipotential lines at the lateral junction periphery and to give a low field route for a carrier beneath the FGRs. FGR effect mainly depends on guard ring spacing and it also depends on the magnitude of the applied bias.

We find some evidence for a secondary dependence of ICO on radiation field; in the LMC, ICO at a given AV is smaller in regions of high Tdust, perhaps because of an increased photodissociating radiation field.

The software cost estimation model, constructive cost model, in its last update (constructive cost model II) has a set of seventeen cost drivers and a set of five scale factors. Process maturity is one of the five scale factors and its ratings are based on software capability maturity model.

Forced expression of a FAF1 mutant mimicking phosphorylation at Ser-289 and Ser-291 (FAF1 DD), but not phosphorylation-deficient FAF1 (FAF1 AA), reduced Aur-A expression. However, transfection of FAF1 DD failed to reduce Aur-A expression in the presence of MG132 and MG115, indicating that this decrease is proteasome-mediated. Additionally, transfection of FAF1 DD suppressed the expression of Aur-A in ts20-BALB cells lacking E1 ubiquitin (Ub) activating enzyme activity at restrictive temperatures and also reduced the expression of Aur-A S51D, a mutant resistant to Ub-dependent degradation.

{"title": "Development of a process model to support integrated design for energy efficient buildings\n", "abstract": " To improve energy efficiency of existing buildings, various analyses, computational simulations and performance monitoring are conducted throughout the lifecycle of the building, especially during the planning and design phases. One of the most common shortcomings in the current computing infrastructure is that there are bottlenecks in the building processes due to imperfect information exchange, causing frequent and significant delays as, for example, the missing information and data need to be re-produced. This paper discusses the development of a building systems process model being developed as a part of a major energy efficient building initiative that focuses on energy-efficient renovation of medium-sized commercial and multi-family residential buildings.

In order to characterize the thermal conductivity and viscosity of grout materials used for backfilling ground heat exchangers, nine bentonite grouts, one marine clay from Boryung, and cement grouts adapted in the United State have been considered in this study. The bentonite grouts indicate that the thermal conductivity and viscosity increase with the content of bentonite or filler (silica sand). In addition, material segregation can be observed when the viscosity of grout is relatively low. The marine clay turns out to be unsuitable for backfilling the ground heat exchanger due to its insufficient swelling potential. The saturated cement grouts appear to possess much higher thermal conductivity than the saturated bentonite grouts, and the reduction of thermal conductivity in the cement grouts after drying specimens is less than that in the case of the bentonite grouts.

STUDY DESIGN: Patient data were collected from 37 hospitals nationwide, the Korean Research Institute of Trophoblastic Disease registry and CHA University Comprehensive Gynecologic Cancer Center from the years of 1970s through the year 2002. Demographic data, pretreatment evaluation, treatment modality, chemotherapeutic regimen and their results according to the clinical International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics classification and World Health Organization prognostic score were analyzed. Management of high-risk gestational trophoblastic tumor (GTT) was reviewed in depth. RESULTS: The nationwide incidence of hydatidiform mole and GTT dropped from 40.0 per 1,000 deliveries and 5.0 per 1,000 deliveries, respectively, in the 1970s to 2.0 per 1,000 deliveries and 0.5 per 1,000 deliveries, respectively, in the 1990s. The rate of decline was slower in 2000-2002. Significant changes were also noted in age distribution, interval between the preceding pregnancy and disease, gravidity and parity, and distribution of low-and high-risk groups of GTT. CONCLUSION: The dramatic improvement in GTD over the past 5 decades in South Korea can be attributed to the following factors: refinement in terminology and classification, advances in pretreatment evaluation, development of effective chemotherapeutic agents, application of multimodal treatment and novel chemoagents for high-risk GTT.", "num_citations": "25\n", "authors": ["8"]}

The ability to observe the animated sequence of the construction process and track the construction status of each building component is just one of many possibilities offered by 4D modeling applications. However, as with the proliferation of any new technology, one of the inherent challenges with 4D modeling tools is a lack of agreed-upon visualization standards for representing building elements and tasks. Specifically, each tool typically has its own standards for viewing and navigating the model and schedule\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "23\n", "authors": ["8"]}

In recent studies, it has been reported that some effect of P. grandiflorum is derived from its antioxidant activity, although there is still a lack of evidence to establish its oxy-radical scavenging activity. In this study, total oxy-radical scavenging capacity (TOSC) assay was used to evaluate antioxidant activity of total extracts (T-PG), polysaccharide fraction (Po-PG), and saponin fraction (Sa-PG) isolated from P. grandiflorum against peroxyl radicals and peroxynitrites. And MTT assay was taken to assess cyto-protective effects of T-PG, Po-PG and Sa-PG in H4IIE cells treated with hydrogen peroxide and tert-butylhydroperoxide. In the TOSC assay, Sa-PG showed strong oxy-radical scavenging capacity compared with T-PG and Po-PG. In cell-based assay, T-PG and Po-PG protected cells from oxidative stress, but Sa-PG did not protect cells because of cytotoxicity of Sa-PG.

The receptor expression was examined separately in gerbils between embryonic days 15 (E15) and postnatal weeks 3 (PNW 3). The NGF-IR was first observed in the spinal cord at E21, which might be related to the maturation. The GFAP reactivity was peaked at the postnatal days 2 (PND2), while the highest CNTF-reaction was expressed at PNW 2.

{"title": "Enhanced fast handover mechanism using MIH services in MIPv6\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we propose an enhanced handover mechanism with new additional primitives and parameters to the media independent handover (MIH) services as defined in IEEE 802.21. The proposed scheme can reduce handover latency for MIPv6 (mobile IPv6) by removing the router discovery time. Moreover, when the proposed mechanism is applied to a FMIPv6 (fast handovers for MIPv6), we can increase the probability that FMIPv6 can be per-formed in a predictive mode by reducing the handover initiation time. As a result, we can get the reduced handover latency in FMIPv6. In addition, with the proposed scheme, we can design the cost-effective network by reducing cover-age overlap between adjacent cells. This is due to the decreased handover initiation time in FMIPv6. From simulation results, it is proven that the proposed scheme can provide a higher goodput for UDP and TCP because it has\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["8"]}

We have identified MAST205, a microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase with a molecular mass of 205 kDa that interacts with NHE3. MAST205 contains a S/T kinase domain and a PDZ domain that mediates interaction with NHE3. Northern blot analysis showed that MAST205 is highly expressed in human and rat kidney. Expression in opossum kidney (OK) cells showed that MAST205 is predominantly expressed in the apical membrane of the cells. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated the presence of MAST205 at the apical region of the renal proximal tubules. Heterologous expression of MAST205 in OK cells inhibited endogenous NHE3 activity, and this inhibition required the presence of the kinase domain of MAST205\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["8"]}

We evaluated the effect of PFD for the prevention of renal fibrosis using a spontaneous progressive glomerulosclerosis animal model, FGS/Kist mice. Male and female FGS/Kist mice were fed a diet containing 0.5% PFD or the same control diet (CD) without PFD, for 1, 2, or 3-month periods. Body weight was monitored for the general effect of PFD on the mice. Proteinuria and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were evaluated for renal function. The sclerosis index was examined for the morphological changes. There were no significant changes in body weight between the PFD and control groups in both sexes. Proteinuria levels were low in all the PFD groups compared to the corresponding CD groups. The sclerosis scores were also reduced in both sexes of the 3-month PFD groups (p< 0.05), and glomerular filtration rates were increased in both sexes of the 3-month PFD groups compared to the CD groups. The treatment of PFD for 1 or 2-month periods did not have statistic significances but the treatment for 3 months had statistic significances in sclerosis and GFR compared to CD groups.

Because transcription of most pro-inflammatory cytokines is dependent on the activation of nuclear factor (NF)-\u256c\u2551B, NF-\u256c\u2551B could be a good potential target to suppress the cytokine cascade. Cytokine-induced activation of NF-\u256c\u2551B requires phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of I\u256c\u2551Ba.

The cross-talk effects between strips and sectors have been studied extensively. The high voltage plateau, which satisfies the CMS requirements for efficiency and the number of strips fired per cluster, extends to at least 300 V. The time resolution has been measured to be better than 1.3 ns in this HV plateau region.

{"title": "Antioxidant properties of tannic acid and its inhibitory effects on paraquat-induced oxidative stress in mice\n", "abstract": " The tannins represent a highly heterogeneous group of water-soluble plant polyphenols that may play an important role in antimutagenic and antioxidant properties. We investigated the antioxidant function of tannic acid in comparison to other phenolic compounds including catechin, chlorogenic acid, cinnamic acid, ellagic acid, and gallic acid for their ability to scavenge several stable radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as , , hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical, and superoxide radical. The ability of tannic acid to decrease paraquat-induced lipid oxidation in mouse liver and lung through its antioxidant properties was also assessed. The results showed that almost all the tested compounds have stable radical scavenging activity except cinnamic acid. Tannic acid, gallic acid, and ellagic acid demonstrated remarkable ROS scavenging properties toward , ,  and especially only tannic acid could inhibit paraquat-induced lipid peroxidation effectively in mouse liver and lung. Based on these results, it appears that increased number of galloyl and ortho-hydroxyl groups enhances the antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds and tannic acid is evaluated as the most effective antioxidant among all the tested compounds. These results suggest that the tannins, especially tannic acid, can be used as therapeutic agent for various diseases caused by ROS.", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["8"]}

This study was performed to investigate whether using PCs in PC game rooms may induce MSDs of the upper limbs. 284 young male Koreans were included. A self-administered, structured questionnaire was used to gather information about game room use, perceived subjective stress, and the symptoms related to MSDs. Urinary concentrations of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine were measured in spot urine. The symptom prevalence of MSDs of the upper limbs increased according to the increase of the duration of game room use. The intensity of perceived subjective stress showed a significant dose-response relationship with the frequency of MSDs symptoms in neck and shoulder areas. However, the urinary level of catecholamines was not significantly correlated with the symptom prevalence of MSDs in the upper limbs. These findings suggest that using PCs in game rooms produce physical stress on the upper limbs, strong enough to induce MSDs.", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["8"]}

A follow-up colonoscopy was performed within 60 days in 235 (53.4%) among 440 enrolled patients.RESULTSSeventy-three (31.0%) of 235 patients with polyps on initial colonoscopy were missed polyps and 37 (23.2%) of 159 patients with adenomas on initial colonoscopy were missed adenomas. As the number of polyps on the initial examination increased, the miss-rate increased significantly (p= 0.01). The most frequent size of missed polyp was 3~ 4 mm (55.5%, p= 0.00) and the most frequent location was sigmoid colon (27.3%, p= 0.00).CONCLUSIONIt may be a fallacy to declare that all colorectal polyps are removed just after one session of colonoscopy.

Here, we report that ERR\u256c\u2502 directly regulates CREBH gene expression in response to ER stress. ERR\u256c\u2502 bound to the ERR\u256c\u2502 response element (ERRE) in the CREBH promoter. Overexpression of ERR\u256c\u2502 by adenovirus significantly increased expression of CREBH as well as C-reactive protein (CRP), whereas either knockdown of ERR\u256c\u2502 or inhibition of ERR\u256c\u2502 by ERR\u256c\u2502 specific inverse agonist, GSK5182, substantially inhibited ER stress-mediated induction of CREBH and CRP. The transcriptional coactivator PGC1\u256c\u2592 was required for ERR\u256c\u2502 mediated induction of the CREBH gene as demonstrated by the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showing binding of both ERR\u256c\u2502 and PGC1\u256c\u2592 on the CREBH promoter.

Interdigitated electrodes of 2-/spl mu/m widths and 15-/spl mu/m spacings are designed to maximize the responsivity, and enable MSM photodetectors to reach a maximum responsivity at 1.53-/spl mu/m wavelength. By employing a two-step InP/InGaAsP transition layer, the dark current density of 45 fA//spl mu/m/sup 2/ was achieved at 10-V bias and at room temperature. Dark current-bias voltage curves were measured as a function of temperature from 40 to 270 K to estimate the activation energy. A 3-dB bandwidth of 210 MHz was obtained at a 10-V bias, and the measured result was compared with the designed bandwidth.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["8"]}

Semiconducting n-ZnO films have been deposited on p-Si substrate by RF sputtering at 300, 480 and 550 C. An optimum static photo-response was achieved from the photodiode prepared at 480 C as characterized by photocurrent measurements using a continuous monochromatic red illumination. Temporal photo-response of 35 ns was obtained from the same n-ZnO/p-Si diode to which a high frequency modulation of 1.5 MHz was applied for the dynamic response measurements.

The 3C-SiC thin films were first hetero-epitaxially grown on Si (100) substrate and then the SiC surface was flattened using a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) technique. 3C-SiC films were again homo-epitaxially grown on the flattened surfaces of the SiC/Si substrates at various growth temperatures (1180-1280. deg. C), reactor pressures (4-400 Torr), and source gas flow rates (1-3 sccm). The CMP process was employed to reduce the surface roughness of and the defects in the hetero-epitaxially grown SiC films. The homo-epitaxially grown SiC thin films were single-crystalline 3C-SiC (100). The growth rate of the films increased with increasing growth temperature, reactor pressure, and TMS flow rate.

The area dependence and temperature acceleration (25-150/spl deg/C) of TDDB, defect generation rate, and critical defect density of CVD HfO/sub 2/ gate stacks are studied.

This excellent reliability characteristics of HfO/sub 2/ gate stack is mainly attributed to the thicker physical thickness of HfO/sub 2/, resulting in significant reduction of tunneling leakage current by a factor of 10/sup 3//spl sim/10/sup 4/ while maintaining comparable Weibull slope factor.

The onset of picosecond transient PC and the onset of steady-state PC are both found to coincide with that of optical absorption. The peak transient PC is proportional to the electric field, independent of temperature, and proportional to the light intensity. Since the transient PC is an order of magnitude smaller than that of PPV, early recombination is more probable due to the large side groups of MEH-PPV. This has been checked through photoinduced charge-transfer studies; both the magnitude and lifetime of the transient PC increase substantially on addition of dilute concentrations of C60 into MEH-PPV. Thus, ultrafast photoinduced electron transfer reduces early recombination and\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["8"]}

Early penetration phenomena of wave and crack propagation have been observed by means of high-speed camera. Microcracks always occur behind the shock wave front. Release waves reflected from the side boundaries of target can result in secondary cracking in front of main fracturing. The wave interaction due to different impedance on the target boundaries affects crack propagation. Thus, size of target and confining materials may play important roles of protection capability against the penetrator.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["8"]}

Furthermore, the effects of chlorophyll on UVB-induced cellular responses have not been investigated. Solar UV radiation, in particular its UVB component, is the primary cause of many adverse biological effects, which is responsible for the photoaging and skin cancer. We investigated the preventive effects of chlorophyll a on UVB-mediated responses in human immortalized HaCaT kerationocytes and normal human fibroblast. We found that treatment of chlorophyll a markedly inhibited UVB-induced generation of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation. Chlorophyll a also prevented UVB-induced MMP-1 expression and MMP-2 activation and increased Type I pN collagen synthesis.

Stimulation of guanylate cyclase activity in detector neuroblastoma cells was used as an indirect measure of the generation of NO in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The muscarinic agonist carbachol induced marked time- and concentration-dependent enhancement of the activity of NO synthase. Activation of neuronal NO synthase by M2 muscarinic receptors was associated with a small increase in the concentration of intracellular Ca2+. These data suggest the presence of alternate mechanisms of activation of neuronal NO synthase which might be operative in the absence of large changes in the concentration of cellular Ca2+. These findings help to understand the mechanisms of activation of NO synthase.", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["8"]}

By burying the nanoislands with an insulating layer and adopting coaxial p\u0393\u00c7\u00f4n junction nanowire structures, nanowire-based LEDs were shown to exhibit superior device performance, including highly rectifying and monochromatic electroluminescent characteristics.

This model considers the generated axial force (GAF) of a TCV joint with different lubricate conditions.

The similar variation of tensile strength to the amount of \u256c\u2592\u0393\u00c7\u2593-martensite with aging temperature indicated that tensile strength of an aged steel is significantly influenced by the amount of \u256c\u2592\u0393\u00c7\u2593-martensite formed during cold deformation.

{"title": "Temperature dependence of carrier transport of a silicon nanowire Schottky-barrier field-effect transistor\n", "abstract": " In this paper, temperature dependence of the characteristics of a silicon nanowire (SiNW) Schottky-barrier (SB) MOSFET device has been investigated in detail. Palladium or titanium source and drain SiNW MOSFETS integrated with an Al 2 O 3 /TaN/Ta gate stack have been fabricated and characterized at different temperatures. Results show that SB SiNW MOSFETs operate with different principles, compared to conventional MOSFETs. From the I ON  and transconductance variation with temperature, it is found that the device operation is dominated by carrier injection at the interface of the source and channel rather than the carrier transport inside the NW channel. Furthermore, this carrier injection is determined by the competition between SB tunneling and thermionic emission. Therefore, the SB height and width play an important role in SB SiNW mosfet operation, and effective barrier height has been extracted\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["8"]}

Nonequilibrium single-electron tunneling measurements at 1.4K show that the second Coulomb peak, associated with a two-electron occupation, splits into two side peaks, and that their separation displays a strong magnetic-field dependence for various interdot coupling constants. Moreover, for some fixed magnetic fields, the separation of the side peaks decays exponentially as a function of the interdot coupling. We attribute this behavior to electron spin exchange and spin swapping between singlet and triplet states in the coupled double dot in the presence of a magnetic field.", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["8"]}

{"title": "Regulation of the mouse cellular retinoic acid-binding protein-I gene by thyroid hormone and retinoids in transgenic mouse embryos and P19 cells\n", "abstract": " The regulation of mouse cellular retinoic acid-binding protein-I (CRABP-I) gene expression by the retinoids and thyroid hormones was examined, by using a \u256c\u2593-galactosidase (lacZ) reporter gene and a CRABP-I specific antibody, in transgenic mouse embryos and a mouse embryonal carcinoma cell line P19. The CRABP\u0393\u00c7\u00f4lacZ reporter gene expression recapitulated the expression pattern of endogenous CRABP-I in the developing central nervous system. In mid-gestation mouse embryos the expression of both the transgene and the endogenous protein was elevated under the condition of hypovitaminosis A, suggesting that depletion of retinoic acid (RA) induced CRABP-I expression in embryos. Consistently, this reporter was suppressed by RA in P19 cells. In co-transfection experiments it was demonstrated that the expression of RAR\u256c\u2593, RAR\u256c\u2502 or RXR\u256c\u2592 suppressed this reporter expression. In experiments designed to alter the thyroid hormone status in animals it was demonstrated that both the reporter gene and the endogenous CRABP-I expression were reduced by triiodothyronine injection and were elevated in a hypothyroidic condition induced by feeding with iodine-deficient diet supplemented with 6-propyl-2-thiouracil. In co-transfection experiments it was also demonstrated that the expression of T3R\u256c\u2593 suppressed the reporter expression in P19 cells. It was concluded that RA had a suppressive effect on CRABP-I gene expression in embryos and P19 cells and the effect could be mediated through RAR\u256c\u2593, RAR\u256c\u2502 or RXR\u256c\u2592.

In this study, in vitro biological assays were used to investigate the endocrine disrupting activity and genotoxicity in dust samples collected from a university located in southern Taiwan. Contents of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in indoor dust were also analysed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Our results showed that significant aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist, antiandrogenic, antithyroid hormonal, and genotoxic activities were found in dust samples. In particular, high AhR agonist activities were found in indoor dust collected from computer room and laboratory (16112 and 9686 ng benzo(a)pyrene equivalent/g dust dry weight), whereas AhR agonistic PAHs were responsible for only a small percentage of the bioassay-derived activities. Higher antiandrogenic and genotoxic activities were found in indoor dust from office and classroom, respectively, suggesting that contaminants varied in different indoor dust samples. After fractionating by high performance liquid chromatography, AhR agonist activities were detected in several fractions of indoor dust from computer room and laboratory, indicating the presence of unknown AhR agonist contaminants in these indoor dust samples. Further isolation and identification of novel AhR agonistic and antiandrogenic contaminants is necessary to protect the environment and human health.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["8"]}

We examined whether maternal CIT supplementation can prevent N G-nitro-l-arginine-methyl ester (l-NAME, NO synthase inhibitor)-induced programmed hypertension and examined their effects on the renal transcriptome in male offspring using next generation RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats received l-NAME administration at 60mg/kg/day subcutaneously via osmotic minipump during pregnancy alone or with additional 0.25% l-citrulline solution in drinking water during the whole period of pregnancy and lactation. Male offspring were assigned to three groups: control, l-NAME, and l-NAME+ CIT. l-NAME exposure induced hypertension in the 12-week-old offspring, which CIT therapy prevented. Identified differentially expressed genes in l-NAME and CIT-treated offspring kidneys, including Guca2b, Hmox1, Hba2, Hba-a2, Dusp1, and Serpine1 are related to regulation of blood pressure (BP) and oxidative stress. In conclusion, our data suggests that the beneficial effects of CIT supplementation are attributed to alterations in expression levels of genes related to BP control and oxidative stress. Our results suggest that early nutritional intervention by CIT has long-term impact on the renal transcriptome to prevent NO depletion-related programmed hypertension. However, our RNA-Seq results might be a secondary phenomenon. The implications of epigenetic regulation at an early stage of programming deserve further clarification.

From the test results, it can be concluded that cement grouting has a higher effective thermal conductivity than bentonite grouting, and the efficiency of graphite better performs than silica sand as a thermally-enhancing addictive. In addition, a new 3 pipe-type heat exchanger provides less thermal interference between the inlet and outlet pipe than the conventional U-loop type heat exchanger, which results in superior thermal performance.

The similarities in the clinical and cellular features of NBS and A-T have led us to hypothesize that the two corresponding gene products may function in similar ways in the cellular signaling pathway. Thus, we sought to identify genes\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["8"]}

{"title": "Sequence dependence of polymer dynamics in quenched disordered media: Weak attraction facilitates transport\n", "abstract": " We study the dynamics of polymers in a random disordered medium of fixed obstacles using kinetic Monte Carlo methods. The polymers can have monomers which have attractive (A-type), repulsive (R-type) or neutral (H-type) interactions with the fixed obstacles that comprise the disordered medium. Several classes of homopolymers and heteropolymers with diverse sequences have been studied. Our most noteworthy result is that, above a threshold temperature, polymer bearing monomers that are attracted to the disordered medium translocate faster through the medium than those bearing neutral or repulsive monomers. We discuss how a delicate balance between energetic and entropic factors leads to this counterintuitive outcome. By examining heteropolymers with different sequences, we also find that the dependence of mobility on average composition is stronger than that on higher order correlations\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["8"]}

The proposed approach is layered hypernetworks consisting of two layers which are the layer of modality-dependent hypernetworks and of an integrating hypernetwork. The layered hypernetwork model is suitable for detecting relationships between heterogeneous modalities. Applied to the analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression profiles on multiple human cancers, the proposed model identifies oncogenic miRNA-mRNA regulatory modules.

The functional significance of HDAC-associated proteins in the progression of the cell cycle and in cell death remains to be established. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which methyl CpG-binding domain protein 3 (MBD3), a component of the HDAC complex, modulates these processes via its functional interplay with HDAC. Depletion of MBD3 induced an arrest at the G2/M transition and resulted in defective mitosis in cancer cells. These effects appear to be associated with the transcriptional modulation of key cell cycle-regulator genes, including CylinB1, Plk1, and Survivin. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that the transcription of these cell cycle regulators is modulated by MBD3, supporting its direct role in their transcriptional repression.

The software cost estimation model, COnstructive COst MOdel (COCOMO), in its last update (COCOMO II) has a set of seventeen cost drivers and a set of five scale factors. Process Maturity (PMAT) is one of the five scale factors and its ratings are based on SW-CMM. This paper investigates the impact of process maturity on software development Schedule (cycle time) by deriving a new set of COCOMO II\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s PMAT rating values based on the most recent version of CMM, ie Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI). The precise data for the analysis were collected from the record of 40 historical projects which spanned the range of CMMI Levels, from Level 1 (Lower half and Upper half) to Level 4, where eight data points were collected from each level. The Ideal Scale Factor (ISF) method is applied in order to withhold the effect of the COCOMO II\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s PMAT scale factor.

The major components of criteria for wastewater reclamations are color, organic matter, and pathogens. An advanced oxidation process with low-pressure ultraviolet and hydrogen peroxide addition (UV/H2O2 system) has been employed for removal of the major components in the criteria for reuse of wastewater. Sand filter pretreatment was applied to remove turbidity and to improve performance of UV irradiation. The results showed that total coliforms were effectively inactivated by the UV irradiation alone with the contact time of 30 minutes but color was remained. The addition of H2O2 significantly improved the removal of color and dissolved organic matter in the same contact time.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["8"]}

The effects of processing conditions on the consolidation, together with microstructural evolutions of the materials have been investigated. The explicit representation of fiber array, which is coupled with deformation behavior of matrix materials, is modeled in finite element simulation to determine the effect of geometrical arrangements on densification process. The approach is then used to model the densification behavior of porous plastic materials using the parameters obtained, and comparisons are made with experimental data. As shown by the results, either increasing temperature or pressure leads to increasing densification rate but the conditions should be determined by the precisely controlled geometrical\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["8"]}

It is still unknown if the RPCs coated with linseed oil can be operated under such a high-radiation environment over the lifetime of CMS. Non-oiled RPCs may be one of the options since phenolic or melamine-coated bakelite is chemically stabler than linseed oil. We have constructed oiled and non-oiled RPCs at the high eta region of CMS using phenolic bakelite and tested them in the Gamma Irradiation Facility at CERN. While both RPCs show the same characteristics in the efficiency and the strip multiplicity, the non-oiled RPC generates an intrinsic noise rate of 50 Hz/cm 2, compared to only 5 Hz/cm 2 for the oiled RPC, both at 10.0 kV which is about 100 V above the 95% knee of the efficiency curve.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["8"]}

At 6th hour, the TNF- and IL-6 production was not affected by each solutions. However, at 24th hour, the TNF- and IL-6 production was affected by itself (p< 0.05). Each solution in the presence of C. albicans decreased the C. albicans-induced TNF- and IL-6 production compared with C. albicans only (p< 0.05, p< 0.01).

The binding parameters, such as the number of moles of bound drug per mole of protein, the number of binding sites per protein molecule, and the association constant, were estimated using the Scatchard plot. The serum binding of nifedipine, verapamil, and diltiazem was displaced with addition of GLZ, and the decreases of Ks for serum were observed. GLZ decreased the association constants of three drugs for HSA and AAG, while the binding capacity remained similar with addition of GLZ.

Ondemand computing resource provisioning, often referred as virtual lab, is one of the requirements in great demand. Most current virtual lab systems are proprietary and thus their detailed software architectures are not accessible to developers. The lack of transparency in virtual lab architecture makes it hard for educational institutions to perform experimental testing and prototyping on these systems to determine their effectiveness in meeting certain service level requirements. To lead to an effective virtual lab development, it is important to ensure that all non-functional requirements, or commonly known as quality attributes, stated in the service level agreement (SLA) are realizable in the required order of priority. While a quality attribute can be achieved by applying one or more software development guidelines, software development guidelines may have different effects on different quality attributes and may also conflict with one another. In addition, priority assessment of the quality attributes are needed in order to focus on the higher priority ones while ensuring that the bare minimum expectation of the remaining ones are attainable. This paper aims to apply fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) during the pre-negotiation stage of SLA to identify quality attributes and rank them based on their priorities. Based on the results, a set of suitable development guidelines are chosen to help realize and achieve the prioritized quality attributes in the virtual lab architecture, thus paving a way to facilitate architecture evaluation.

We found that the BiNPs crystallites would transform from cubic to tetrakaidecahedron crystals on increasing the Ru content from 0 to 54 at%. This reduces the particle size and the size distributions during the nucleation-growth of the crystal. In the meantime, the unfilled d state and the heteroatomic intermixing of Pt atoms along with the MOR reactivity of the BiNPs will be enhanced. By increasing Ru >54 at%, the BiNPs would transform into an ellipsoid-like crystallite with a Ru rich core.

Based on the resulting atomic configurations due to the misalignments, the details of the observed relationship between bandgap and the lattice mismatch are investigated. It is observed that in general, misalignment in the transverse direction results in a decrease in the interaction between the two layers, giving rise to a larger EG. On the other hand, misalignment in the longitudinal direction, i.e. along the edges, leads to an oscillation in EG due to the periodic change of the GNR stacking order.

MSW was collected from underground of Han-Dong in Jeju Island, and freely given to high fat diet (HFD)-fed C57BL/6 mice for 10 weeks. Although there were no significant differences in the body weight changes and plasma lipid levels, hepatic triglyceride levels were significantly lower in the MSW group than in the normal tap water (TW)-drunken control group. Furthermore, the activity of fatty acid synthase (FAS) was significantly decreased and carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) activity was increased in MSW group compared to TW group. Similarly, real-time PCR analysis revealed that mRNA expressions of lipogenic genes were lowered in MSW groups compared to the control group. In a morphometric observation on the liver tissue, accumulation of fats was remarkably reduced in MSW group. Meanwhile, in vitro assay, free radical scavenging activity measured by using diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) was increased in MSW group. The 2'-7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) staining followed with fluorescent microscopy showed a low intensity of fluorescence in MSW-treated HepG2 cells, compared to TW-treated HepG2 cells, which indicated that the production of reactive oxygen species by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) in HepG2 cells was decreased by MSW treatment.

In the present study, we used Western blot analysis to show that 3 out of 6 HCC cell lines, HA59T, HA22T and HCC36, exhibited overexpression of cyclin A, among which the HCC36 cell line also expressed a higher Skp 2 protein level. Moreover, we used the antisense oligonucleotide phosphorothioates to down regulate the overexpression of cyclin A and Skp 2 proteins to determine whether or not these two proteins are involved in the mitogenesis of HCC36 cells.

Many of the jobs assigned to workers can be very physically demanding and result in injury. In addition, men and women may lack physical capacity to fulfil the requirements of such jobs. To satisfy Canadian Human Rights legislation requirements of equal opportunity, regardless of age and gender, the establishment of task-related physical performance standards is an appropriate and desirable approach. These standards must be based on the physical requirements of the jobs and should be within the physiological capacities of the workers.

Formal approaches like Coloured Petri Nets (CPNs) are based on strong mathematical notations and proofs as basis for executable modeling languages. Transforming UML diagrams to executable models that are ready for analysis is significant, and providing an automated technique that can transform these diagrams to a mathematical model such as CPNs avoids the redundancy of writing specifications. The use of UML diagrams in modeling Object Oriented Diagrams (OODs) leads to a large number of interdependent diagrams. It is necessary to preserve the diagrams consistency since they are updated continuously. This research proposes a new structure for the mutual integration between OODs and CPNs modeling languages to support model changes, the proposed integration suggest a new structure (Object Oriented Coloured Petri Nets (OOCPN)) to include set of rules to check and maintain the consistency and integrity of the OOCPN model based on OODs relations.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["8"]}

The rapid increase in unemployment rates in the recent 20 years has heightened the importance of university career centers, yet a systematic career service model has not been devised to reflect the diverse career needs of college students. This article investigates the current situation of service delivery of university career centers in South Korea. A total of 15 career centers responded to the questions about how often they provided specific career services and how important each service was in their service delivery. Results showed that the career centers focused more on career placement than career exploration services. Also, there were discrepancies between the most frequently offered services and the most important services. Based on the results, future tasks for career centers are discussed in terms of the balance between career exploration and placement services, staff expertise, technology use, and tailored programs for specialized career fields.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["8"]}

The effects of shear rate, concentration, and molecular weight on the steady shear flow properties were reported in detail from the experimentally measured data, and then the results were interpreted using the concept of a material characteristic time.

Main results obtained from this study can be summarized as follows:(1) At low shear rates, aqueous PEO solutions show a Newtonian viscous behavior which is independent of shear rate. At shear rate region higher than a critical shear rate, however, they exhibit a shear-thinning behavior, demonstrating a decrease in steady flow viscosity with increasing shear rate.(2) As an increase in concentration and/or molecular weight, the zero-shear viscosity is increased while the Newtonian viscous region becomes narrower.

The VCS was implemented in an upper level construction management course in 2006 and 2007 and demonstrated benefits for teaching construction scheduling. However, the current VCS application lacks specific project-based constraints that would motivate consideration of the most feasible construction sequence.

Methods: Pts with mCRC screened UGT1A1 genotyping (*28 and *6) and were stratified into one of 3 groups according to the number of defective allele (DA): 0 (none of *28 or *6 allele), 1(only one of *28 or *6 allele), and 2 (*28/*28, *6/*6, or double heterozygous for *28 and *6). The dose of CPT-11 was escalated as following: Level -I:200, I:240, II:280, III:320, IV: 350, V: 380 mg/m2 (IV, once every 3 weeks).

Behavior of the impinging spray was visualized using a planar laser scattering method. It is shown that the spray path penetration of the wall-impinging spray increases with increases in injection pressure, wall distance, wall temperature, or wall angle. On the other hand, the spray path penetration of the wall-impinging spray decreases with increases in ambient pressure.

{"title": "An application of congested transit network loading with the Markov chain approach\n", "abstract": " Uncertainty and unreliability is a topic for all modes of transport. Car drivers as well as public transport users might not arrive at their destination in time, or in severe cases, not arrive at all. Du and Nicholson (1997) distinguished two sources of uncertainty. Firstly, supply variations such as road or track blockage leading to network degradations. Secondly, demand variations engendered by peak periods or sporting events, which can lead to capacity problems for the road network as well as for the public transport systems. Both sources of variation can lead to unpredictable delays and uncertainty in travel times. The nature of the delays is, however, different for public and private transport. Car-users will spend more time in their vehicles waiting in queues or driving with reduced speed, but the in-vehicle time for public transport users keeps relatively constant (except maybe for longer dwelling times). In congested situations transit network users might, however, not be able to board the first vehicle arriving at their bus stop or platform because of insufficient space. This uncertainty in waiting time, because of a non-zero probability that the transit vehicle is overcrowded, seems to be underresearched in the context of transit assignment.This paper discusses an absorbing Markov Chain approach to transit network loading and its application to the congested transit assignment problem. The approach, set out in Bell and Schm\u251c\u2562cker (2001), respects priority rules and capacity constraints (for example, passengers boarding upstream have priority over those who want to board at stops or stations downstream where the vehicle might be full).

Within the scope of the present study, the focus was placed on investigating the effect of confinement provided by the reinforcing composite grid tube on the compressive strength of concrete columns. The hybrid columns were subjected to uni-axial compression. The same test was performed on a pure concrete column as well for benchmarking. It was identified that the composite grid tube could substantially increase the compressive strength and toughness of concrete columns.

The aim of this study is to investigate the incidence of syphilis in hemodialysis patients, possible nosocomial infection and methods of treatment. A total of 556 uremic patients on maintenance hemodialysis at our hospital on June 1996 were enrolled in the study. They all received syphilis screening tests. The rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test was used as the primary screening tests and Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay (TPHA) test as the confirmation test. According to the test results, patients were classified into false and true-positive groups. The titer of both tests were recorded. The patients in the true-positive group were further divided into the untreated and treated group depending on whether they had already received treatment. The serial change of RPR test titer of the treated group was reviewed. Thirty-one patients (5.6%) had positive RPR test results and 10 patients (1.8%) had false-positive results. The titers of both RPR and TPHA tests were rather low in the positive groups. Most of the confirmed syphilis patients were asymptomatic and diagnosed serologically. In the treated group, the RPR test titer did not show significant decline and no seroconversion was noted after treatment. We observed that infectious syphilis patients exist in our hemodialysis unit and survey for this disease is necessary. The titers of both positive RPR and TPHA tests are low.

The sample consisted of one thousand one hundred non-institutionalized individuals, aged 65 or over, living in three metropolitan cities and two rural provinces. The modified Cornell Medical Index, ADL, IADL, and existing medical diagnosis were used to measure the health status of the elders. Rural elders reported significantly more health problems than urban elders. Differences in ADL and IADL scores were not statistically significant. There was a difference in the types of health problems between the urban and rural elders. While more rural elders reported that they were diagnosed as having neuralgia and arthritis, more urban elders reported that they had diabetes. The results of this study demonstrated that rural elders had significantly more health problems than urban elders even after all the other variables were controlled. However, in Korea, most health care resources available to elders are concentrated in large urban cities. This study suggests that it is important to invest more health care resources in rural areas to meet the needs of all elders in Korea.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["8"]}

{"title": "Identification of forming limits of sheet metals for automobile parts by asymmetric deep-drawing experiments\n", "abstract": " Identification of forming limits of sheet metals is an important task to be done before the sheet metal forming processes. The information of the forming limit is indispensable for design of deformed shapes and related forming processes. This procedure becomes more important than ever as the auto-body becomes complicated and the number of auto-body parts is reduced for lower production cost. To identify the forming limit of sheet metals stretching with a hemispherical punch has gained popularity because of the convenient experimental procedure. The stretching experiment however has localized deformation or the shear band is originated from the non-unifrom deformation in the critical circum-stance instead of the absolute criterion. More accurate information of the forming limit therefore could be obtained by a more appropriate experiment to the real process. In this papaer an experiment program is devised to practivally identify the forming limits of sheet metals for auto-body parts. The experiment program contains not only stretching but deep-drawing Both forming experiments use the same hemispherical punch while they use different specimens. Deep-drawing experiments use speci-mens cut out in circular arc on both sides of circular blank to make it torn during the deep-drawing They also use speciments cut out straight in one side of a circular blank to make it deformed unevenly which causes local deformation during the deep-drawing.

{"title": "Development of dynamic force measurement capabilities at AEDC Tunnel 9\n", "abstract": " The strain gauge force balances used in the AEDC Tunnel 9 provide very accurate force and moment measurements in hypersonic flows for static or quasi-static loads during continuous pitch sweeps. The frequency response of conventional strain gauge balances is typically below 30 Hz so that the high sensitivity and low crosstalk requirements for such measurements are met, however this range is insufficient for accurate measurement of transient loads during impulsive events such as the unstart of scramjet inlets, 1, 2 mode switching, 3 shroud separation, 2, 4, 5 stage separation, 6 and divert thrusters firing. 7 These dynamic events involve large unsteady forces on millisecond timescales and are generated by complex flow physics such as shock interaction and boundary layer separation which pose considerable modeling challenges. Because large uncertainties exist when computing these complex flows\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["8"]}
{"title": "Design of two-rotored UAV Cyclocopter\n", "abstract": " A cyclocopter or cyclogyro is a type of rotorcraft that is operated by a cycloidal blade system with several blades rotating about a horizontal axis that lies perpendicular to the flight direction [1, 2]. Figure 1 shows a cycloidal blade system with a typical pitch motion of a blade rotating on the orbit. The pitch angle of the blade is in cyclic varying motion. Therefore, the direction of the thrust is roughly the position of maximum pitch angle, or \u2567\u00e5= 90deg. Owing to the periodic pitch angle variation, a cycloidal blade system has a unique ability that it can change direction and magnitude of the thrust force almost immediately. Moreover, this characteristic enables the system to capable of VTOL maneuver and a forward flight. The cycloidal blade system was studied at NACA, University of Washington, etc., from 1920\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s to 1940\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s [3].

{"title": "Formation of sub-10 nm width InGaAs finFETs of 200 nm height by atomic layer epitaxy\n", "abstract": " As FETs are scaled, the dielectric and semiconductor channel thicknesses must be reduced to suppress short-channel effects. Even using fin field effect transistors (finFETs) and gate all around FETs (GAAFETs), [1],[2], whose electrostatic performance is excellent, at 4nm gate length the channel should be less than 2nm thick. To obtain high drive current per unit IC die area, the fin height should be many times the fin pitch, i.e. tens to hundreds of nm. Dry-etching a fin of few-nm width and > 100 nm height presents severe challenges in control of etch sidewall slope and in minimizing surface damage. Here we report an InGaAs finFET fabrication flow which form fins of sub-10nm width and 200 nm height. Fin width is controlled by atomic layer epitaxial (ALE) growth and by semiconductor selective crystallographic wet etching. We further demonstrate self-aligned source-drain regrowth in this process [3],[4]. This facilitates\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["8"]}

{"title": "UML extension for defining the interaction variants of design patterns\n", "abstract": " Design patterns provide a way to transfer design knowledge and reusable solutions to recurring problems. The patterns include structural and interaction information that, if captured in a catalog, can act as a useful reference guide for developers when making design decisions. However, for the same design pattern structure, there can be different ways for interactions to occur. We call these interaction variants, and they haven't yet been defined explicitly in existing work. This article introduces an approach to define the interaction variants that exist in design patterns as extensions to UML sequence diagrams. The authors have applied the approach on several commonly used patterns. The approach has proved useful for paving the way toward support for cataloging design pattern interactions and interaction variants in a visual modeling tool to be used during software design.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["8"]}

We processed salt dried rockfish samples. The salinity of rockfish samples was within 1% following salting with 25% salt brine for 3 h. The moisture content of salt dried rockfish was found to reduce linearly from 70.12 to 39.5 g/100 g over the same time interval. The water activities of salt dried rockfish by sun and cold-air drying were 0.94 and 0.87, respectively, after three days of drying. Acid values (AV) were 10.71 and 5.96 mg KOH/g, respectively, after the three day drying period. The ADH activity in a water extract from salt dried rockfish following sun and cold-air drying for 24 h was 228.5% and 226.1% at 13.3 mg/mL, respectively, and was higher than that when drying lasted for 48 and 72 h. The ALDH activity was not affected but both ADH and ALDH activity tended to decrease as the drying time increased from 24 to 72 h. The conditions of processing for the best quality of salt dried rockfish were determined to be drying with a cold-air system for 24 h. These results indicated that water extracts from salt dried rockfish have valuable biological attributes owing to the metabolizing of alcohol and can provide useful information for the design of drying systems for salt dried rockfish.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["8"]}

The short-term NEBs showed that algal response in the treatments spiked phosphorus (P, 2P, and 4P) were significantly (p< 0.05) greater than the response in the control (C), and nitrogen-spike. Also, the response in 4P-treatment was greater than those in the P-and 2P-treatments. In contrast, there was no significant differences (p> 0.20) between the -N and -N treatment. The outcomes of the NEBs suggest that phosphorus limited the phytoplankton growth and nitrogen was not limited in this system. Furthermore, in the N+ P treatments, the response was minimum, compared to all other treatments and the control, indicating that even if the system is evidently P-limited system, when added the nitrogen, the response showed the inhibition.

The main spawning ground was divided into four sub-areas: the South Sea of Korea (R1), the southern waters off Jeju, Korea (R2), the southwestern part of Kyushu, Japan (R3), and the northern part of Okinawa, Japan (R4). Interannual and decadal fluctuations in water temperatures correlated well with squid catches in the East/Japan Sea. In particular, water temperatures at a depth of 50 to 100 m in sub-areas R3 and R4 showed higher correlation coefficients (0.54 to 0.59, p< 0.01) in relation to squid catches in the East/Japan Sea than for R1 and R2, which had correlation coefficients of 0.40 or less (p> 0.05). Air temperature and wind velocity fluctuations in each sub-area are correlated with water temperature fluctuations and were closely connected with variations in the surface mixed layers. Water, air temperatures and wind velocities at the main spawning grounds are linked to the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) with higher signals in the ca. 2-4-year band. Strong changes in a specific band and phase occurred around 1976/77 and 1986/87, coincident with changes in squid catches.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["8"]}

The aim of the analysis is to determine the maximum vibration amplitudes of the two rotor bladerows for a range of configurations and speeds. Unlike typical axial-flow compressors, a significant part of the unsteady aerodynamic excitation is due to the distortion of the inlet flow over the cockpit and fuselage, a situation that creates several low engine-order harmonics. In addition, the main blade passing harmonics, arising from the bladerows immediately upstream, also need to be considered.

The proposed algorithm finds an optimal schedule that meets all the timing and other constraints, where timing constraints such as release times and deadlines are determined in advance through bidding-based production reservation. Even if the algorithm is terminated prematurely, it would still provide a complete schedule that is at least as good as any schedule currently obtained. Furthermore, it assists in managing unpredicted events by increasing marginal time space between the expected completion time of a task and its deadline.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["8"]}
{"title": "Mathematical Modeling for Cornering of Unmanned Vehicle\n", "abstract": " Unmanned vehicles have to decide their velocities suitable for the paths which should be generated by the vehicles themselves, based on the kinematic and dynamic aspects of vehicles. For this purpose, this paper is to propose a mathematical modeling of tuning trace for the cornering of an unmanned vehicle by using normal-tangent coordinates as well as extracting the characteristics of behavior for car drivers in cornering. In the proposed modeling, the limitations of velocity can be determined based on the knowledge that the handling of drivers means the control of radius of curvature. The proposed modeling can reduce computational load and generate turning angles and velocities suitable for the cornering of unmanned vehicles.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["8"]}

The purpose of this paper is to provide a solution by using framework-based software engineering to solve these problems. Framework-based software engineering is the idea of constructing software systems based on the integration of reusable components rather than developing software from scratch. The manufacturing application framework proposed in this paper is to be developed as a set of integrated reusable components, which can be adapted to suit specific manufacturing applications. This paper focuses on two subdomains of the manufacturing domain, ie, Production Management (PM) and Statistical Quality Control (SQC). A generic model is defined based on the structure and behavior of each of the PM and SQC subdomains, from which the design infrastructure of the application framework is derived, based on the concept of design pattern.

The cloud computing offers significant storage space and other required computing resources necessary for processing large-scale and complex SWFAs. Consequently, cloud computing can better handle scalability and flexibility challenges of SWFAs. In the literature, various Workflow Scheduling (WFS) mechanisms such as traditional heuristic, hybrid, and hyper-heuristic mechanisms have been proposed to optimize WFS in cloud computing. The hyper-heuristic mechanisms achieved better performance in terms of completion time compared to other optimization mechanisms. However, most current state-of-the-art approaches use a random mechanism for Low-Level Heuristics (LLH) selection. An intelligent LLH involving Genetic Algorithm, Practical Swarm, and Invasive Weed Optimization selection based on the defined performance criteria before initiating iteration has been argued to be able to optimize the overall computational cost. In this paper, we propose a Hyper-Heuristic Approach (HHA) to optimize the computational cost of SWFAs in a cloud computing environment. Furthermore, to intelligently select a LLH, we propose a new prioritization strategy based on computational cost as one of the performance criteria. Consequently, it enables the proposed approach to dynamically select the most suitable LLH from a list potential heuristics based on the historical information of achieved performance before performing a new iteration.

We find that the subprime crisis has resulted in a temporary cointegration in the groups during the peak of the crisis, but cointegration is weak or absent in the pre-and post-crisis periods. We also find that cointegration is strongest in the Malaysian and European market groups and surprisingly weak in the group involving Malaysia and its neighbouring emerging markets. The results of the causality and variance decomposition analyses strongly indicate that Malaysia is largely unrelated with other markets.

The roles of pro-inflammatory cytokines and residual kidney function (RKF) in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients with vascular calcification have not been investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 157 stable PD patients were enrolled. All patients had plain X-ray film examination including chest (posterior-anterior view, CXR) and pelvis. Vascular calcification was interpreted as calcified deposit over aortic arch and linear calcification of pelvic arteries. Relevant biochemical data, pro-inflammatory markers, and PD-related factors were measured and collected. RESULTS: Vascular calcification prevalence in CXRs was higher than that in pelvis films (38.2% vs. 22.3%, p< 0.05). Patients with vascular calcification in CXR had higher incidence of calcification in pelvis films (p< 0.05). Only a minor portion (14.6%) had two calcification sites. Regression analysis revealed that age, PD duration, body mass index, and RKF were independent factors associated with vascular calcification in CXR. Age, diabetes, IL-10 and RKF were factors associated in pelvis films. Factors independently related to vascular calcification in both films were age, duration, diabetes, IL-10, and RKF.

Although many studies have concentrated on its pathogenesis, the hypothesis concerning the pathogenesis of vitiligo has not yet been fully elucidated. Vitiligo has various clinical features, which have been reported by many investigators, but the number of patients studied is limited and there is no uniform classification that all clinicians agree upon. However, understanding these characteristics can give us valuable information not only in differentiating vitiligo from other pigmentary disorders, but also in treating vitiligo with the proper modalities and predicting the prognosis of vitiligo up to a certain degree. Currently, a classification describing vitiligo as generalized or localized type according to the distribution of lesions is widely used (Table 3.1). Localized type is subdivided into focal, segmental, and mucosal subtypes, while generalized type is subdivided into acrofacial, vulgaris, and universal subtypes. An overlap of various types can be classified as mixed type [3]. In 1977, Koga performed a sweat secretion stimulation test using physostigmine, and accordingly reclassified vitiligo into non-segmental type (type A) and segmental type (type B)[4].

The emission peak in the solid films shifted from 628 to 659 nm as the doping concentration of DCM changed from 0.9% to 11%. The optically pumped waveguide lasers were fabricated by coevaporation of Alq films with 1.3 wt\u0393\u00c7\u00e8% DCM onto gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrates using silicon dioxide (SiO2) and magnesium fluoride (MgF2) as cladding layers.

The method uses numerical simulation together with knowledge of the conventional curing process for thin laminates. Once the process control parameters have been introduced, an iterative procedure is employed to arrive at the optimal heating cycles for thick laminates. Autoclave curing processes have been carried out using conventional cycles for (1 mm) laminates, as well as optimised cycles for thick section (12.5 mm) laminates. The interlaminar shear strengths of thick laminates, processed using the two types of curing cycles have been determined.

The driving element of the motor is a three-layer laminated plate. A piezoelectric layer is sandwiched between two anti-symmetric composite laminae. Because of the material anisotropy and the anti-symmetric configuration, torsional vibration can be induced through the inplane strain actuated by the piezoelectric layer. The advantages of the motor are its magnetic field immunity, simple structure, easy maintenance, low cost, and good low-speed performance. In this paper, the motor is considered to be a coupled dynamic system. The analytical model includes the longitudinal and torsional vibrations of the laminate and the rotating motion of the rotor under action of contact forces.

METHODS: 81 cases treated at our institution between 1980 and 1994 were reviewed. The results of the different lymphadenectomies and biopsies performed were analyzed. Tumors were staged according to the Jackson and TNM classifications; in 62 cases the pathological samples were reexamined by the same pathologist to determine the grade of cellular differentiation according to the Broders classification. A p value of< 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: We did not obtain reliable results with the biopsies done and variable results in the lymphadenectomies performed. The grade of cellular differentiation and local stage were both statistically significant with respect to the presence of positive lymph nodes. We found statistically significant differences for survival according to the stage of the positive lymph nodes.

Body heights of enrolled subjects exhibited a significant positive correlation (r= 0.458, p< 0.01) with manometry measured esophageal lengths. Mean radionuclide esophageal transit time was 7.61+/-2.51 sec (3.1-13.57 sec). These transit times exhibited a positive correlation with esophageal lengths (r= 0.6, p< 0.001).

The transient PC (lifetime and magnitude) of MEH-PPV increases substantially on increasing the concentration of C60 in OMEH-PPV/C60 composite films; ultrafast photoinduced electron transfer minimizes early-time recombination and enhances the quantum yield for photogeneration of free charge carriers.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["8"]}

{"title": "Electrical characteristics of 2D and 3D microelectrodes for high-resolution retinal prostheses\n", "abstract": " In order to provide high quality visual information to patients who have implanted retinal prosthetic devices, the number of microelectrode should be large. As the number of microelectrode is increased, the dimension of the microelectrode is decreased, which in turn results in the increased interface impedance of microelectrode and decreased dynamic range of injection current. In addition, the reduced maximum limit of injection current may not be sufficiently large to stimulate the ganglion cells in a retina. In order to improve the trade-off envelope between number of microelectrode and current injection limit, a 3D microelectrode structure can be used as an alternative. From the advancement of microfabrication technology, the fabrication of highly-accurate 3D structures with small dimensions is possible.

Due to the nature of the constrained hand-movement situations on the steering column, we are confronted with at least two challenging research issues, namely varying illumination conditions and noisy hand gestures. The first difficulty is alleviated by utilizing the contrast for background-foreground separation and skin model adaptation. We also adopt sub-letter stroke modeling to reduce the noisy frames of the beginning and ending parts of the letter gestures followed by the trajectory re-normalization. Moreover, the geometric relationship between letter pairs is also utilized to distinguish highly confusable letters. Finally, score fusion between whole-letter and sub-stroke models can be used to further improve the performance.

METHOD: The charts of 14 patients with extramammary Paget's disease were retrospectively reviewed, and the clinicopathologic data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: From January 1990 to July 2009, 14 patients were treated at our institution. Most patients (11/14 patients) had delayed diagnosis. Two patients (14.3%) had associated malignant neoplasms. Eight of 14 patients (57.1%) had positive surgical margins; of these patients, five patients had no evidence of recurrence. In the six patients with negative surgical margins, two patients (33.3%) developed recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of extramammary Paget's disease is commonly delayed. Because of the possible association with other malignancies before or after the diagnosis of extramammary Paget's disease, thorough examinations are recommended.

Part of the research effort of this work included the application of well-known design patterns in order to build the framework. We present how consistent application of design patterns allowed us to build a fully working persistence framework.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["8"]}

{"title": "Organic light-emitting diodes with F16CuPC as an efficient hole injection layer\n", "abstract": " We report a new hole-injection material, copper hexadecafluorophthalocyanine (FCuPC) for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) consisting of N,N'-di(1-naphthyl)-N,N'-diphenylbenzidine (-NPD) as a hole-transport layer and 8-tris-hydroxyquinoline aluminum (Alq) as a light-emitting and electron-transport layer. The insertion of the FCuPC between indium-tin oxide (ITO) and -NPD reduces the operating voltage significantly and thereby increases the luminous efficiency. By measuring the device characteristics for various FCuPC thicknesses, we find that an optimum FCuPC thickness is about 15 nm. At a luminance of 1000 cd/m, the device with 15-nm-thick FCuPC shows a luminous efficiency of 1.5 lm/W and a device operating voltage of 7.2 V while the device without the FCuPC layer shows 1.1 lm/W and 10.4 V. The significant decrease in a driving voltage and increase in the luminous efficiency can be attributed to the high hole-injection efficiency when FCuPC is inserted between ITO and -NPD", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["8"]}

In addition, we did not observe any interface adhesion issues found in other reports when WF is modulated by dopants such as As or Sb. We also show that reliability is similar to Ni FUSI.

{"title": "Segment weighted random BIST (SWR-BIST): a low power BIST technique\n", "abstract": " This paper presents a segment weighted random built-in self test (SWR-BIST) technique for low power testing. This technique divides the scan chain into segments of different weights. Heavily weighted segments have more biased probability than lightly weighted segments. Heavily weighted segments are placed closer to the end of scan chain than the lightly weighted segments so the scan-in transitions are minimized. In addition, scan cells in segments of the same weight are reordered to further reduce the scan-out transitions. Experiments on ISCAS circuits show that, compared with the pseudo random BIST, SWR-BIST effectively reduces the test power by 74%. The SWR-BIST circuitry is very small and it grows slowly with the CUT size. The penalty of this technique is area and routing overhead for scan chain reordering", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["8"]}

As such, design simplicity is essential. The hybrid manipulator consists of a planar 2-link parallel mechanism coupled to a translational mechanism. Detailed kinematics are employed to understand the resultant workspace, feasible paths, and manipulability. Based on the analysis, optimal design parameters are selected using a manipulability-based approach to allow for dexterous operations over a full highway lane width. A simple but effective redundancy resolution method is developed to partition motion between the two mechanisms.

However, foundation constructions are highly variable due to the fact that construction process faces difficult problems like poor soil conditions, congested traffic and unpredictable weather. Designers are often unable to obtain reliable production rates in order to improve the accuracy of project time estimation that often leads to more delays and disputes.

The hole injection enhancement was caused by the reduced hole injection barrier, attributed to an interfacial electric field induced by the partial charge transfer from the metal to the CFx layer.

The levels of plasma BUN and creatinine, urinary protein and systolic blood pressure were significantly increased in FGS/Nga, compared with those of the parental strains. RFM/Nga mice showed slightly elevated levels of all biochemical makers. In histological analysis, a higher glomerulosclerosis index was observed in FGS/Nga than the two parental strains. RFM/Nga mice appeared to have slight sclerotic lesions of glomeruli, but no renal failure was observed in CBA/N mice. These results suggest that at least one mutant gene that causes the progression of renal lesion in FGS/Nga mice is derived from RFM/Nga.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["8"]}

This study was focused on the analysis of the mechanism and on screening candidate chemicals inducing the anti-metamorphosis of the silkworms. Rearing temperatures or initial body weight of the final instar larvae did not affect a normal larval to pupal metamorphosis of B. mori. However, pyriproxyfen (a juvenile hormone (JH) agonist) induced follicle patency significantly even at its 10$\\^ $-8/M concentration and inhibited metamorphosis of B. mori in both developmental time and dose dependent manners. Pyriproxyfen induced JH esterase (JHE) activity and downregulated expression of JH binding protein of 5. mori. These results suggests that pyriproxyfen induced JHE activity as a JH agonist and that the elevated JHE activity degraded endogenous JH and resulted in JHBP gene expression. Based on the fact that the JH agonist induced follicle patency and inhibited metamorphosis of B. mori, follicle patency bioassay suggested that three commercial pesticides including simazine, molinate or alachlor were proved to give potent JH agonistic effect on B. mori. Further direct exposure experiments to these candidates are required to determine the chemicals responsible for the non-spinning syndrome of 8. mori.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["8"]}

Both cDNA clones coded for polypeptides of 290 residues and the deduced amino acid sequence identity between YP1 and YP2 was very high (79.0%). Analysis of the secondary structure of the predicted polypeptides suggests that YP1 and YP2 do not form heteromeric proteins because of differences in secondary structure due to the lack of alpha helices in YP1. Northern blot analysis showed that the transcripts for YP1 (1.2\u252c\u00e1kb) and YP2 (1.1\u252c\u00e1kb) were present primarily in the female fat body with only trace levels detectable in the ovary of the adult female.

{"title": "Implications of sonographic identification of duplex kidney in adults.\n", "abstract": " BACKGROUND: Duplication of the renal pelvis and ureter constitutes the most common anomalies of the upper urinary tract. Most patients are asymptomatic and don't need treatment. However, the associated anomaly and acquired renal disease may cause morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of duplex kidney in sonographic examinations and the predictive capability of this method. An analysis of patients with urography-confirmed duplication anomaly was also performed. METHODS: During a period of 9 year (from 1988 to 1996), sonographic examination records of 19,287 patients were reviewed. Patients with a diagnosis of duplex kidney were enrolled. Their clinical characteristics and radiological images were recorded and evaluated. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-three patients were found by sonography to have duplex kidney, for an prevalence of 0.85%. Urography studies were done on 64 (39.2%) patients, and 42 patients were proven to have duplex kidney. The positive predictive rate of sonography was 65.6%. Eighty percent of patients with duplex kidney had associated ureteral duplication. No associated anomalies were found. Four patients had urolithiasis, and 3 patients had recurrent urinary tract infection. One patient had coexisting uroepithelial malignancy, and 1 patient had refractory gross hematuria. CONCLUSIONS: Duplex kidney is an uncommon finding during adult sonographic examinations. The sensitivity and specificity of sonography in identifying this anomaly are controversial. An experienced hand with good knowledge of the anomaly and its sonographic signs is helpful in\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["8"]}

Water mass showing characteristics of Tsushima Warm Current (TWC) exists over the continental shelf. The depth is shallower than 200m and its width and thickness are 190km and 200m, respectively. Minimum level of dissolved oxygen occurred at the layers of maximum salinity. In the current structure, a noteworthy phenomenon is that the positions of the high-salinity water (more than 34.6 psu) match well with the distributions of the southwestward flow. In June of 1995 and June of 1996, a southwestward flow were separated into two parts along line C and line G. Current directions derived from the temperature and salinity match well with the distributions of the geostrophic currents in the vertical sections. The isothermal lines and the isohaline, which exist horizontally along the coastal area of the Japan, change abruptly at the frontal area of the Noto Peninsula, then turn toward the center of the East Sea. The dynamic depth anomalies centering around the region far northwest of the Noto Peninsula were relatively high, compared to those of other regions.

{"title": "Expression and characterization of recombinant E2 protein of hepatitis C virus by insect cell/baculovirus expression system\n", "abstract": " The E2 protein of HCV (hepatitis C virus) is thought to have a potential role in the development of subunit vaccines and diagnostics. To express it by the insect cell/baculovirus expression (Bacu) system, we constructed a recombinant Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcIL3E2), determined the most appropriate expression conditions in terms of host cell line and culture medium, and characterized the expressed HCV E2 protein. A culture system using Trichoplusia ni BTI-TN5Bl-4 cells and SF 900IISFM medium expressed a relatively high level of HCV E2 protein. It was revealed that its glycosylation properties and subcellular localization were almost the same as the ones in the mammalian cell expression system previously reported, suggesting the recombinant HCV E2 protein derived from our Bacu system can be utilized for development of a subunit vaccine and diagnostics. Interestingly, HCV E2 protein was not degraded at all even at 43 h post-heat shock in the heat shock-induced necrotic cells, probably due to its integration into the microsomal membrane, indicating that heat shock can be employed to purify HCV E2 protein.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["8"]}

This theory is completely geometric, independent of parametrization and generalizes to any order. Two sets of dimensionless, characteristic numbers describing the local geometry of a curve up tonth order are defined. These characteristic numbers can be used to describe conditions for higher order contacts in an algebraic fashion. The same characteristic numbers can also be used to interpret contact conditions of up tonth order in terms of the geometry of higher evolutes and binormal indicatrices. The resulting geometric contact conditions are used to design piecewise parametric curves for Computer Aided Geometric Design (CAGD) applications.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["8"]}

Phlomis umbrosa Turcz, one of the natural products of plants has been known to improve bone health. However, the precise effects and treatment mechanisms of Phlomis umbrosa Turcz about bone diseases has been unknown. So, we examined the effects of Phlomis umbrosa Turcz on expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u256c\u2551B ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) and bone resorption. Also, we investigated the treatment mechanisms of Phlomis umbrosa Turcz relating to osteoclast differentiation.

Furthermore, Phlomis umbrosa Turcz suppressed the activation of NF-\u256c\u2551B in bone marrow macrophage treated RANKL and M-CSF. The mRNA expression of c-Fos, nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) c1, osteoclast-associated receptor (OSCAR), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) in BMMs was inhibited by Phlomis umbrosa Turcz.

The impedance of this LC/SP lamina was decreased by UV irradiation which constituted the underlying mechanism to modulate the voltage externally applied to the piezoelectric actuating layer. Illuminating a specific pattern onto the LC/SP lamina provided us with a way to spatially modulate the piezoelectric vibration signal. We showed that if an UV illuminated pattern matches the strain distribution of a specific mode, a piezoelectric modal sensor can be created. Since UV illumination can be changed in situ in real-time, our results confirm for the first time since the inception of smart sensors, that an optically tailored modal sensor can be created. Some potential applications of this type of sensor include energy harvesting devices, bio-chips, vibration sensing and actuating devices. View Full-Text", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["8"]}

The external field dependence of the peaks and comparison of the peaks with those in other spinels also confirm the existence of the cation oxidation states suggested by XAS. Analysis of these results, combined with the magnitude of saturated magnetization, indicates an average chemical formula of (Mn 2+ x Co 1\u0393\u00ea\u00c6 x 2+) A [Co x\u0393\u00ea\u00c6 0.4 3+ Mn 3+ 1.5\u0393\u00ea\u00c6 x Fe 3+ 0.9] B O 4 with x~ 0.9.

Accurate quality models can be built to predict the quality of object-oriented systems by using a subset of the existing object-oriented design metrics and data mining techniques.

However, most of these organisations still rely heavily on existing relational database management systems (RDBMS) to store and manage their structured data for daily critical business transactions. In fact, major database vendors, which also happen to be the giant software companies like Microsoft, IBM and Oracle, have ventured and taken great initiatives in researching and providing for a single solution to integrate these semi-structured XML data with structured data in relational databases. Most importantly, it is estimated that during the next few years to come, more than 75% of e-business applications will implement XML technologies in their applications. Consequently, as more software applications are rapidly beginning to implement XML, there should be a growing need for XML middleware to efficiently integrating XML data at the front-end with a RDBMS at the back-end. Hence, this research is aimed at providing a generic XML-based framework, which is known as JXDB, that allows a user to use XML for dealing with semi-structured data for creating, accessing or updating to existing heterogeneous relational databases that store structured data and vice versa.

{"title": "Fabrication and reliability assessment of embedded passives in organic substrate\n", "abstract": " In a typical printed circuit board assembly, over 70 percent of the electronic components are passives such as resistors, inductors, and capacitors, and these passives could take up to 50 percent of the entire printed circuit board area.  By embedding the passive components within the substrate instead of being mounted on the surface, the embedded passives could reduce the system real estate, eliminate the need for surface-mounted discrete components, eliminate lead based interconnects, enhance electrical performance and reliability, and potentially reduce the overall cost.  Even with these advantages, embedded passive technology, especially for organic substrates, is at an early stage of development, and thus a comprehensive experimental and theoretical modeling study is needed to understand the fabrication and reliability of embedded passives before they can be widely used. This thesis aims to fabricate embedded passives in a multilayered organic substrate, perform extensive electrical and mechanical reliability tests, and develop physics-based models to predict the thermo-mechanical reliability of embedded capacitors.

There are several treatment techniques for LSS as decompression (laminicetomy, foraminectomy) and posterior-lateral fusion using pedicle screws and rods. However, surgical fusion is often too rigid that may change biomechanical behaviors (load bearing and motion) at the adjacent discs that could induce disc degenerations [2, 3]. Recently, a new surgical technique of inserting a spacer made of PMMA between interspinous processes has been introduced. This spacer, called interspinous spinal spacer (ISP), has been designed to keep the spine in a slightly-flexed posture to reduce narrowing of the spinal canal and intervertebral foramen. However, there are few studies that attempted to evaluate the biomechanical efficacies or effectiveness of this ISP technique. In this study using calf lumbar spine, effectiveness of the PMMA ISP was assessed by conducting in vitro biomechanical test smeasuring the intervertebral disc pressures at the level of surgery as well as at the adjacent levels.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["8"]}

The interface formation depended critically on the way it was prepared. For the case of Yb deposited on Alq3, the XPS results revealed staged interface reactions. Upon oxygen exposure, the effect of Yb/Alq3 interaction can be eliminated. By proper oxidation, the interface of Yb/Alq3 can form an ohmic contact, leading to good electron injection. On the other hand, when Alq3 was deposited on Yb, it was considered that the large ratio of Yb to Alq3 resulted in substantial charge transfer to the Alq3 molecules to form even the trivalent Alq3\u0393\u00ea\u00c63 radical anions.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["8"]}

{"title": "Tuberculous peritonitis in uremic patients.\n", "abstract": " AIMS: To identify clinical features and treatment response of tuberculous peritonitis (TBP) in a uremic population, a retrospective case-control study was performed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen uremic patients with TBP (Group I: 62.7+/-6.8 years, male 54%) collected between January 1986 and January 2002 were compared with another two age-and sex-matched controls: 19 non-azotemic patients with TBP (Group II: 62.9+/-7.3 years, male 47%) and 30 uremic patients without TBP (Group III: 61.1+/-8.7 years, male 47%). Clinical information and data of ascites and blood examinations were evaluated. RESULTS: Significant differences between Groups I and II were found in comorbidity, hypertension, anorexia, percentages of neutrophil and lymphocyte from blood and ascites, and serum calcium (sCa), phosphorus and albumin-adjusted calcium (sAACa). However, no significant differences in duration of symptoms, coexistent pulmonary tuberculosis (p= 0.061), duration or complications of therapy and mortality (p= 0.13) were detected. Significant differences between Groups I and III were found in peripheral white cell counts and percentages of neutrophil and lymphocyte as well as in serum creatinine (sCr), albumin, sCa, sAACa and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH). CONCLUSIONS: Non-specific symptoms make the diagnosis of TBP in a uremic population difficult. However, neutrophil predominance in blood and ascites, hypoalbuminemia, relatively lower sCr and hypercalcemia with suppressed serum iPTH were found to be characteristic. In TBP uremic patients, therapy complications were not common and there was a tendency for\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["8"]}

Four had denervation oedema in one masticator space caused by a  skull-base tumour invading the ipsilateral foramen ovale. Another case had denervation oedema confined to the half of the tongue ipsilateral to oral reconstruction surgery which involved mandibulectomy, free flap repair and wide excision of a buccal mucosal carcinoma. Inversion-recovery and/or T2-weighted spin-echo images showed increased signal in the affected areas. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images revealed enhancement of the muscles. There was no evidence of tumour or infection in the masticator space or tongue.

The purpose of the simulated GCP generation is to assess the accuracy of different high-resolution space-borne camera modeling algorithms objectively by eliminating human biases which can be caused by the measurements of image coordinates and ground coordinates of GCPs. The model and process for simulated GCP generation was derived as close to a fully-physical satellite imaging mechanism as possible. The resulting GCPs were applied to two different camera models which were derived with some level of abstraction. The accuracies of the two camera modeling algorithms were all within a pixel. This may lead to the fact that a pixel-level accuracy of any camera model depends not on the camera model itself but largely on the measurement accuracy of GCPs.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["8"]}

The instrumental setup in this work is modified from that developed by Schmidt-Ott (1988).The experimental setup in this study is shown on Figure 1.  Silver particles were generated from homogeneous nucleation of silver vapor in a tube-furnace.  Fractal agglomerates were produced subsequently after going through agglomeration of the monomers.  Due to the instability of the agglomeration structure against heat (Koch and Friedlander, 1990), the agglomerates would collapse somewhat to result in the change of the corresponding fractal dimensions.  By varying the temperatures in the furnace-1 from 1100 to 1225 \u252c\u2591K, agglomerates with different degrees of compactness and D     f     can be produced.  An electrostatic classifier (TSI Model 3071A, MN) was used to selected agglomerates with a certain electrical mobility and the hydrodynamic radius (R     m     ) can be determined.

Ocean current and sea ice statistics for Davis Strait. Can. Tech. Rep. Hydrogr. Ocean Sci. 284: vi+ 47p.Rising global temperature is expected to reduce sea ice cover making it easier to exploit oil and gas reservoirs in high latitude offshore waters. However, sea ice will continue to be a potential hazard, so reliable information on sea ice and currents for platform design and offshore operations remains an important requirement. Based on statistical analysis of multi-year records from instrumented moorings, ocean current and sea ice properties across Davis Strait are presented in this report. Currents exceeding 1.5 ms-1 are mainly limited to the coastal waters of Baffin Island and West Greenland. The analyses show that the extreme currents near the Baffin Island coast are as high as 1.9-2.6 ms-1 with a return period of 10 years. On the West Greenland Shelf, the extreme current speeds are 1.5-1.9 ms-1 for a return period of 10 years. The maximum currents across the Strait mostly occur in fall when the ocean is free of sea ice. Sea ice draft has two components: level ice from thermodynamic processes such as freezing; and, deformed ice due to dynamic processes such as rafting. Sea ice is generally dominated by first year ice in the Davis Strait area. The ice free time varies from 60 days on Baffin Island Shelf to 200 days on West Greenland Shelf. Sea ice near the Baffin Island coast is generally thicker than that farther offshore and is thicker in winter and spring and thinner or not present in summer and fall.

As a result, a large variety of electronic devices have become portable and can now be carried around. However, along with the obvious benefits of miniaturization and portability, there are hazards due to the likelihood of dropping these devices. According to 1998 research conducted by the IDC (International Data Corporation), 64% of notebook damage is caused by drops, 38% is due to spillages, and 28% to crushing, with liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and hard disk drives (HDDs) reported to be the two components most often cited as suffering damage. Portable devices are often expensive and may contain impactsensitive electronic components, such as the flat-panel displays and packages with tiny and vulnerable solder joints. Uncontrolled shocks can result in unacceptable cost and time losses for repairing or replacement of the equipment, loss of operation downtime, and possibility of losing valuable data or even business opportunities.

However, for the Belle II experiment, we will have 50\u0393\u00c7\u00f460 times more data. This metadata service may have problems with performance, scalability, and durability when employed at Belle II. These issues are compounded when metadata searches are extended to the event-level. Accordingly, we have designed a new metadata scheme for Belle II which significantly reduces disk space and propose a new metadata service which provides good performance and scalability based on AMGA (Arda Metadata catalog for Grid Application). We find that the use of event-level metadata provides an efficient scheme for processing events with many tracks.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["8"]}

It is necessary to select a proper gravity reduction method in order to calculate the topographic effect precisely, especially in mountainous area. The selection of the gravity reduction method in context of precise geoid determination depends on the magnitude of its indirect effect, the smoothness and magnitude of the reduced gravity anomalies, and their related geophysical interpretation. In this paper, we studied gravimetric geoid solutions using various gravity reduction methods such as Helmert\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s second method of condensation, RTM method and Airy topographic-isostatic method and evaluated the usefulness of each method.

Compared with the results by qualitative and quantitative analyses, monthly variations in female gonad indice by qualitative histological analysis showed a pattern similar to that of the female gametogenic cycle calculated by quantitative statistical analysis. The number of spawning seasons occurred once per year, from June to October. In quantitative statistical analysis using an image analyzer system, monthly changes in the portions (%) of the ovary area to total tissue areas in females increased in March and reached a maximum in May, and then showed a rapid decrease from June to October when spawning occurred. And also monthly changes in portions (%) of follicle areas to the ovary area and in portions of oocyte areas to ovarian tissue areas in females began to increase in March and reached a maximum in May, and then. rapidly dropped from June to October when spawnig occurred. From these data, it is apparent that the number of spawning seasons occurred once per year, from June to October. Monthly changes in the number of the oocyte per  and in mean diameter of the oocyte in captured image which were calculated for each female slide showed a maximum in May and reached the minimum from December to February.

Circumvallate and foliate papillae of Sprague-Dawley rats (45~ 60 days old) were used to search for the mRNAs of subunits of non-NMDA GluRs using RT-PCR with specific primers for GluR1-7, KA1 and KA2. We also performed RT-PCR for GluR5, KA1, PLC\u256c\u25932, and NCAM/SNAP 25 in isolated single cells from taste buds. Taste epithelium, including circumvallate or foliate papilla, express mRNAs of GluR5 and KA1. However, non-taste tongue epithelium expresses no subunits of non-NMDA GluRs.

{"title": "Distribution of taste receptors in submandibular and von Ebner salivary glands\n", "abstract": " Taste is a critically important sense for the survival of an organism. However, structure and distribution of taste receptors were only recently investigated. Although expression of the ion channels responsible for the sense of salty taste and acidity was observed in the non-taste cells, receptors for sweet and bitter taste were only identified in taste cells. Salivary glands are involved in the sensing of taste and plays important roles in the transduction of taste. The purpose of this study is to examine whether taste receptors are present in the salivary glands and to provide clues for the investigation of the taste-salivary glands interaction. Using microarray and RT-PCR analyses, the presence of taste receptor mRNAs in the rat von Ebner gland and submandibular gland was confirmed. Type I taste receptors were preferentially expressed in von Ebner gland, whereas type II taste receptors were expressed in both von Ebner gland and submandibular gland. The tastespecific signal tranducing proteins,  and phospholipase C , were also detected in both salivary glands by immunohistochemistry. Finally, the activation of the calcium signal in response to bitter taste in the acinar cells was also observed.

Food commodities reflecting in model diet were selected from the KHIDI report and were analysed in cooked or uncooked edible forms using HPLC-Fluorscence Detector. The PAHs dietary intake comparison between home-cooking and dining-out was based on one meal intake suggested in model diet and PAHs dietary intake was estimated by using food consumption rate and body weight of the Korean adult group. The daily PAHs dietary intake was calculated by permutation and combination method with assumption that a person consumed 2 meals from home-cooking menu and 1 meal from dining-out menu. The total PAHs levels in 36 food commodities with 200 samples were ranged from 2.00 ug/kg to 141.28 ug/kg and a food showing the highest PAHs level was the stir-fried anchovy. The  levels of PAHs were calculated using benzo (a) pyrene equivalents individual congener level and corresponding TEF value and the  level were ranged from  to  and a food showing the highest  level was the hamburger.

Thus, we compared the sensitivity of the iFOBT according to differentiations and locations of colorectal cancers and sizes, histological types, degrees of dysplasia, numbers and locations of adenomas.METHODSSixty patients with histologically confirmed colorectal cancer and 174 patients with colorectal adenoma who underwent colonoscopy, were included in this study. They underwent iFOBTs for their two consecutive specimens before clonoscopy examinations.RESULTSThere was no significant difference in the sensitivity of the iFOBT according to the differentiation and the location of colorectal cancers (p= 0.061 and p= 0.399, respectively). The univariate analysis of colorectal adenomas showed that the positive rates of the iFOBT were increased as the size of adenoma was bigger, the degree of dysplasia was severer and the number of adenoma was larger (p= 0.000, p= 0.009 and p= 0.015, respectively). However, in the multivariate analysis, only the size of adenoma was significant (p= 0.000).CONCLUSIONSThe iFOBT is a useful screening method which is not influenced by the location and the differentiation of colorectal cancer, but its usefulness is limited in colorectal adenoma less than 1cm.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["8"]}

Complete power transfer can be attained in a nonlinear coupler when their characteristic parameters, linear mismatch and the input power satisfy an equation. For a mismatch asymmetrical nonlinear coupler, only one input power can lead to the complete power transfer. It leads to some new applications of the nonlinear coupler. The conditions for the stable and unstable equilibrium of the coupler are presented, they depend on the nonlinear asymmetry and linear mismatch.

The treatment modalities of myasthenia gravis include cholinesterase inhibitors, surgical thymectomy, immunosuppressive treatment, and short-term immunotherapies, including plasmapheresis and intravenous immune globulin. Double filtration plasmapheresis (DFP) is a new technique of plasmapheresis. The aim of our study is to evaluate the effectiveness and complications of DFP in the treatment of MG. METHODS: From December, 1993 to August, 1998, a total of 33 patients with MG received 68 courses (total of 299 sessions) of DFP in our hospital. Plasmapheresis volume, drainage volume, treatment duration, heparin dose, and complications were recorded. In addition, clinical responses after DFP were also evaluated. RESULTS: Only 4 courses (5.88%) of treatment were ineffective. Sixty-four courses (94.12%) of treatment lessened disease activity.

Thus the adaptive estimation scheme is not effective to the induction motor which requires short sampling time. In this paper, a new linearized equation of induction motor system is proposed and a sensorless speed estimation algorithm based on observation techniques is developed. First, the nonlinear induction motor equation is linearized at an equilibrium point. Second, a proportional integral (PI) observer is applied to estimate the speed state in the induction motor system. Finally, simulation results will assure the effectiveness of the new linearized equation and\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["8"]}

But the extent of surgery is one of the major issues in FESS. To solve this problem, the shaver has been used from 1992. It dramatically reduced inadvertent trauma to nasal mucosa and improved visualization and tissue healing after surgery. This study is aimed at evaluating the clinical value of the shaver with degree of postoperative pain and the time required for surgery.MATERIALS AND METHODSWe studied bilateral chronic paranasal sinusitis patients of whom, 28 were operated with the shaver, and 15 cases were operated with the conventional instrument. This study evaluated the postoperative pain using Visual Analogue Scores (VAS) at 2, 6, 24 and 48 hours after operation and the time required for surgery. The results were then compared with the preoperative computed tomographic radiological staging and surgery scores.RESULTSFor the shaver group, the time requirement for FESS and the postoperative pain scores were much lower than the conventional instrument group.CONCLUSIONThe shaver is a very useful instrument for sinus surgery and it can reduce surgical time and the discomfortness for the patient.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["8"]}

With x\u0393\u00eb\u00ea0, there is an energy gap with weak spectral features at 1.5 eV and 2.1 eV, in addition to the well-known 1.75 eV and 2.6 eV bands.

Thus, the measurement of the surface profile is an important part of the quality control procedure when constructing antennas of this type. An efficient method for surface profile measurement has been proposed by Parini et al. 111. In this method, the reflector surface is calculated from the measured near-field phase data using the theory of geometric optics.For a surface profile calculation of this kind, it is necessary to know the margin of error built into the method of calculation. This will enable a specification of the tolerance to which the surface profile can be determined. When calculating the surface profile from near-field phase data, there are two main sources of error. The first source of error is the measurement error in near-field phase data. The second source of error arises from the edge diffracted fields that reflected fields in the measured near-field examine the error in the calculated surface d if fracted f telds.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["8"]}

In this study, several methods of forming emulsions using soybean oil and their extraction properties were investigated. The stable and homogeneous oil emulsions were formed more effectively by ultrasonication (U1) than by homogenization (H1). Moreover, homogenization before ultrasonication (HU1) established more stable emulsions than U1 alone.

{"title": "Probabilistic Approach on Railway Infrastructure Stability and Settlement Analysis\n", "abstract": " Railway construction needs vast soil investigation for its infrastructure foundation designs along the planned railway path to identify the design parameters for stability and serviceability checks. The soil investigation data are usually classified and grouped to decide design input parameters per each construction section and budget estimates. Deterministic design method which most civil engineer and practitioner are familiar with has a clear limitation in construction/maintenance budget control, and occasionally produced overdesigned or unsafe design problems. Instead of using a batch type analysis with predetermined input parameters, data population collected from site soil investigation and design load condition can be statistically estimated for the mean and variance to present the feature of data distribution and optimized with a best fitting probability function. Probabilistic approach using entire feature of design input data enables to predict the worst, best and most probable cases based on identified ranges of soil and load data, which will help railway designer select construction method to save the time and cost.

{"title": "An approach to integrate change and knowledge management in construction workflows\n", "abstract": " The Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) project delivery process is complex and knowledgeintensive with numerous changes during the lifecycle process. Managing changes and knowledge is critical to enable effective and innovative delivery of high-quality products and services. Unfortunately, current processes do not provide enough support for concurrent management of changes and knowledge in an integrated fashion. Typically isolated, change and knowledge management (CKM) processes can work in silos but without integration, they may not function effectively as part of the holistic construction workflows. Ultimately, the disjunction results in major weakness in the ability and agility of project teams and building managers to manage knowledge effectively and respond appropriately to changes. Consequently, this can lead to implementing changes with adverse impacts, and inadequate capture and management of lessons learned. Therefore, there is a vital need to embed CKM processes within the overarching construction workflows. The paper aims to present a novel approach to fuse CKM processes within the entire construction workflows, and highlight the associated benefits. Initially, the paper conducted an integrative and detailed review of related work to digest the theoretical underpinnings and research efforts in this area. This was followed by a preliminary investigation of industry problems and requirements for CKM on an energy efficient retrofit project.

{"title": "The feedback control system of electromagnetic suspension using Kalman filter\n", "abstract": " The basic element of the EMS suspension is the electromagnet system, which suspends the vehicle without contact by attracting forces to the rails at the guideway. The suspension of a vehicle by attractive magnetic forces is inherently unstable and consequently it is continuously adjusted by the strength of the suspending electromagnet from rail irregularity and bending of the guideway. In order to improve reliable tracking, it needs to get feedback signals without measurement delay time. In this paper the concept of feedback control system with Kalman Filter in EMS is proposed. The input signals in the feedback control system are an air-gap and an acceleration signal. The air-gap signal with noise from the gap sensor is transformed to the filtered air-gap signal y without measurement delay time by using Kalman Filter. The filtered air-gap signal is transformed to a relative velocity and a relative acceleration signal. Then it multiplies these values by gain matrix in order to get the actuator\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s reference voltage value.

By varying the interlayer distance via electrostatic means, the conductance of the BGNR can be changed in order to achieve ON-states and OFF-states, thereby mimicking the function of a switch. Two actuator designs based on the modified capacitive parallel plate (CPP) model and the electrostatic repulsive force (ERF) model are discussed for different applications. Although the CPP design provides a simple electrostatic approach to changing the interlayer distance of the BGNR, their switching gate bias VTH strongly depends on the gate area, which poses a limitation on the size of the device. In addition, there exists a risk of device failure due to static fraction between the mobile and fixed electrodes.

In such populations, shared haplotypes allow imputation of variants in unsequenced samples without resorting to statistical methods, as in studies of outbred cohorts. We focus on an isolated population cohort from the Pacific Island of Kosrae, Micronesia, where we previously collected SNP array and rich phenotype data for the majority of the population. We report identification of long regions with haplotypes co-inherited between pairs of individuals and methodology to leverage such shared genetic content for imputation. Our estimates show that sequencing as few as 40 personal genomes allows for imputation in up to 60% of the 3,000-person cohort at the average locus. We ascertained a pilot data-set of whole-genome sequences from seven Kosraean individuals, with average 5X coverage. This dataset identified 5,735,306 unique sites of which 1,212,831 were previously unknown. Additionally, these Kosraen variants are unusually enriched for alleles that are rare in other populations when compared to geographic neighbors. We were able to use the presence of shared haplotypes between the seven individuals to estimate imputation accuracy of known and novel variants and achieved levels of 99.6% and 97.3%, respectively.

Radioactive sources for brachytherapy are now available with many radionuclides and in various shapes and sizes, and there is no such thing as an'ideal'brachytherapy source. Different sources have different applications depending on their emission type and radiation energy and how they are constructed. However, it is possible to state some basic requirements:1. The radionuclide must have a half-life of a few days or more for permanent implants and preferably at least a few weeks for temporary implants. Large corrections for radioactive decay during a temporary implant should be minimized. A long half-life for stock sources will give them a useful working life.

The main advantage of tuned mass damper is that it can increase the damping ratio of system and reduce the vibration amplitude. Meanwhile, the natural frequency of system will be divided by two peaks, and the peak speeds are closely related to the mass and the stiffness of auxiliary mass system added. In addition, the damping ratio will also affect the peak frequency of the dynamic response. In the present research, the nonlinear mechanical characteristics of rubber is investigated and put into use, since it is usually manufactured as the spring element of tuned mass damper. By the sense of the nonlinear stiffness as well as the damping ratio which can be changed by preload applied on, the shape memory alloy is proposed to control the auxiliary mass system by self-optimizing.

In object-oriented systems, cohesion is an important factor of objectoriented design quality. A few researchers refer cohesion to the degree of the relatedness of the members in a class. In an object-oriented system, classes and components are key early artifacts that lay the foundation of an object-oriented system. A few cohesion metrics have been proposed to quantify the cohesiveness of classes in an object-oriented system. In this paper, we attempt to quantify the amount of cohesion in classes and components via a suite of object-oriented design metrics. This paper proposes four object-oriented design metrics to evaluate cohesion at the class and component level. The metrics are augmented based on different definitions of LCOM. The metrics are normalized to produce values in the range [0.. 1], thus yielding more meaningful values than other cohesion metrics such as LCOM1 and LCOM4. The proposed metrics attempt to evaluate whether an artifact (ie class or component) represents one abstraction (good) or multiple abstractions (bad). If the artifact represents multiple abstractions, it should be split up into multiple artifacts (ie classes and components).", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["8"]}

In this paper, we propose a set of improvedobject-oriented design metrics to measure the design quality of object-orientedsystems at the inheritance level specializing on incremental and subtyp-inginheritance. The metrics serve as early quality indicators of object-orienteddesign faults such as faulty classes and components in object-oriented systems.We augmented the metrics from two existing metrics, namely Attribute InheritanceFactor and Method Inheritance Factor. The metrics specialize on measuring theoverall inheritance density of classes and components based on several qualityattributes such as maintainability and testability.

{"title": "Expression of kainate glutamate receptors in type II cells in taste buds of rats\n", "abstract": " Glutamate-induced cobalt uptake reveals non-NMDA glutamate receptors (GluRs) in rat taste bud cells. Previous studies suggest that glutamate-induced cobalt uptake in taste cells occurs mainly via kainate type GluRs. Cobaltstained cells were immunoreactive against GluR6 and KA1 subunits of GluRs. However, the functions of those type of receptors are not known yet. It is important question which types of taste cells are cobalt-stained when stimulated by glutamate and whether they express these kinds of GluRs. Circumvallate and foliate papilla of Sprague-Dawley rats (45-60 days old) were used. A cobalt-staining technique combined with immunohistochemistry against specific markers for taste bud cell types, such as blood group H antigen (BGH), -gustducin (Gus), or neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) was employed. We also performed double labeling of GluR6 or KA1 subunits of GluR with each specific marker for taste bud cell types. Lots of cobaltstained taste bud cells expressed Gus-like immunoreactivity, and subsets of the cobalt stained cells appeared NCAM-or BGH-like immunoreactivity. Stimulation with 1 mM glutamate significantly increased the number of cobaltstained cells in Gus-like immunoreactive cells, but not in NCAM-or BGH-like immunoreactive cells. In the double labeling experiments, GluR6 and KA1 subunits of GluRs were mainly expressed with Gus. These results suggest that kainate glutamate receptors preferentially expressed in type II taste bud cells in rat.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["8"]}

The detailed nature of apoptosis in colorectal cancer is unclear, especially in regard to the MSI status and the clinicopathologic factors. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the apoptosis assessed by M30 immunoreactivity in colorectal cancer and its relationship with the MSI status and the various clinicopathologic factors of colorectal cancers. Methods: 101 colorectal cancers were classified according to levels of MSI as 12 MSI-H, 4 MSI-L and 85 MSS. Apoptosis was quantified by immunohistochemistry with using M30 CytoDEATH antibody. Results: The apoptotic index assessed by M30 was significantly increased in the MSIH and MSI-L colorectal cancer compared to that in the MSS colorectal cancer. Right sided colon cancer showed a significant higher apoptotic index than did the left sided colon cancer. There was also a tendency for decreased apoptosis in metastatic colorectal cancers (Duke\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s stage D). There was somewhat of an increase of apoptosis in colorectal cancers with mucinous carcinoma and medullary carcinoma, and also in the colorectal cancers with an increased TIL count, but this was not statistically significant.

However, if such devices are to be realized, the fabrication of a pn junction is required as a key technology. In the pn junction, Si as an n-type dopant has been utilized successfully in the growth process of GaN. Magnesium, practically the only acceptor impurity, is used for the growth of p-type GaN. However, p-GaN has many problems to be solved even today, such as high resistivity, low hole concentration, and high contact resistance. Such problems result in high-power-consumption and low-efficiency light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Several research results have been reported for lowering the operating voltage by using surface treatment methods and by adopting a supper lattice on the p-GaN side [1\u0393\u00c7\u00f45], but little work has been done on the breakdown voltage. A high breakdown voltage is important for high reliability in commercial applications of GaN-based LEDs.

Today, many business applications are developed using some kind of object-oriented programming language and objects in these applications are manipulated through SQL statements that are embedded in the application software. When these applications are small and have very little changes, embedding SQL statements in these applications is fine; but for applications which are dynamic and large, such applications are very hard to maintain and manage. Hence, a robust and extendable persistence framework layer that contains classes for mapping objects to a relational DBMS and/or a multidimensional DBMS allows a developer to concentrate on the development of the actual application. The design of the framework uses a set of good object-oriented design patterns that allow developers to extend functionalities and features easily. This allows saving, updating and querying of objects in the persistence store. In short, this paper focuses on the design, development and mapping of objects to the R/MDBMS persistence framework.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["8"]}

The activation energy, pre-exponential factor, and reaction order of HDPE pyrolysis reaction, respectively, were 251.92 kJ/mol, , and 0.581, demonstrating good agreement with those estimated by DTG curve fitting method [1]. The PPM simulates experimental DTG curve excellently and it was proved that the three peak properties of DTG curve would be enough to represent a unique thermal reaction. The pyrolysis kinetic parameters would be estimated easily but accurately by the PPM. However, the PPM is only applicable for a reaction which is represented by a conversion function of power law equation.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["8"]}

But legacy database management systems such as relational database systems (RDS) and multidimensional database systems (MDS) [5,6,7] are different in many aspects from an Object-oriented Data Model. Among these aspects are semantic management, data structures and data types supported in these models. As a result, it is crucial to understand these data models in order to design and implement an efficient piece of middleware.

{"title": "An estimation of tidal currents from satellite-tracked drifters and its application to the Yellow Sea\n", "abstract": " A simple but effective method has been developed for estimating diurnal and semi-diurnal tidal currents from trajectories of satellite-tracked drifters. The estimation method consists of separation of tidal current signals contained in the drifter trajectories, computation of undulations by diurnal and semi-diurnal currents, and correction of dominant diurnal and semi-diurnal tidal constituents. M  tidal currents estimated from drifter trajectories in the Yellow Sea are well consistent with those observed by moored current meters and this supports the validity of this method. We have constructed M  tidal current chart in the Yellow Sea by applying this method to available drifter trajectories collected during 1994-1998. According to this chart, M  current in the Yellow Sea rotates in the clockwise direction south of 3530'N but in the counterclockwise one to the north. Also it is found that the M  current is strong in the bank area northeast of the Changjiang River mouth and in the Korean coastal area, while it is weak in the deep central trough.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["8"]}

{"title": "An analytical model of co-oscillating tide under frictional effect in the Yellow Sea\n", "abstract": " The response of the tidal waves to friction effect is investigated in terms of deformation of Kelvin and Poincare modes, The 1st Poincare mode does not exist over the low frequency region less than the critical frequency of omega , with /f= 0.0, but the mode comes to exist in the presence of friction. When friction exists and its magnitude increases, the wave number increases, indicating that the wave length of the Poincare mode becomes increasingly short with increasing friction. The damping coefficient gradually increases with increasing friction over the high frequency region, but the trend is reversed over the low frequency region. In case of Kelvin wave the present study substantiates the characters of Kelvin wave examined by Mofjeld (1980) and Lee (1988). Based on the examination of frictional effects on the tidal wave propagation, the co-oscillating tides in the Yellow Sea are examined by considering both the head opening and bottom friction effects. As friction is introduced and increased in addition to partial opening at bay head, the location of the amphidromic point near the Shantung Peninsula moves more southwestward. This southwestward movement of the amphidromic point is increasingly compatible with the observed location of Ogura's or Nishida's tidal chart of the M  tide.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["8"]}

Sonicated small unilamellar liposomes composed of dioleoylphosphatidylethanol amine (DOPE), dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and bis (6-hemisuccinyloxyhexyl) fumarate (BHF) in a 3: 1: 1 molar ratio are stable at neutral pH, but destabilized at weakly acidic pH with 50% leakage of entrapped materials at about pH 5.5. The liposomes are relatively stable in plasma such that only a few percent entrapped calcein was released in 50% plasma within 1.5 h incubation at 37\u0393\u00e4\u00e2, while about 10% entrapped calcein was released from sonicated liposomes composed of DOPE, DOPC, and oleic acid (OA) in a 3: 1: 1 molar ratio under the identical conditions. The aqueous contents mixing and lipid components mixing experiments suggest that the protonation of BHF may induce fusion between the liposomes, followed by the release of the entrapped materials.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["8"]}
{"title": "Expression of Transforming Growth Factor-beta and Morphologic Changes of Glomerulosclerosis in FGS/NgaKist Mouse\n", "abstract": " Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is presented as not only one of the primary glomerular diseases but also as a secondary phenomenon for chronic irreversible renal diseases. The main pathological feature of FSGS is the accumulation of extracellular matrix in the glomeruli, for which overexpression of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) may be responsible for the accumulation of pathological matrix. A new animal model (FGS/NgaKist mouse) of renal failure by spontaneously generating glomerulosclerosis was developed. To elucidate the role of TGF-beta for FSGS, authors observed glomeruli of FGS/NgaKist mouse periodically. FGS/NgaKist mouse strain showed progression of proteinuria and focal glomerular sclerosis with the aging. The glomeruli showed anti IgG, IgA, IgM and complement complex deposits and extracellular matrix accumulation in the mesangium. TGF-beta mRNA and beta2antibody expressions were increased with the advance of glomerular sclerosis. The results suggest the following; FSGS of FGS/NgaKist strain is immune mediated disease and this stimuli on mesangial or endothelial cells may activate TGF-beta gene in their nuclei. This activation, in turn, can cause sclerosis by increasing TGF-beta mRNA transcription followed by secretion of TGF-beta and its action as cytokine for making collagen fibrils.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["8"]}
{"title": "Heat Transfer Characteristics on Impingement Surface with Control of Axisymmetric Jet (I)\n", "abstract": " The present experiment is conducted to investigate heat transfer characteristics on the impinging surface with secondary flows around circular nozzle jets. The changed vortex pattern around jet affects significantly the flow characteristics and heat transfer coefficients on the impinging surface. The effects of the jet vortex control are also considered with jet nozzle-to-plate distances and main jet velocities. The vortex pattern around a jet is changed from a convective instability to an absolute instability with a velocity suction ratio of the main jet and the secondary counterflow. With the absolute instability condition, the jet potential core length increases and the heat transfer on the impinging surface is increased by small scale eddies. The region of high heat transfer coefficients is enlarged with the high Reynolds number due to increasing secondary peak values. The effect of suction flows is influenced largely with collars attached the exit of the jet nozzle because the attached collar guides well the counterflow around the main jet.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["8"]}

We started our automated double filtration plasmapheresis since December 1993. There were 13 patients who received one hundred treatments totally during one year period. And they are myasthenia gravis (8 patients); acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (1 patient), multiple myeloma (1 patient); acquired factor VIII inhibitor (1 patient); autoimmune hemolytic anemia (1 patient); systemic lupus erythematous (1 patient). Technically double filtration plasmapheresis is easy to perform and time-saving. It also makes necessity of replacement fluid less frequent. Incidence of complication is rare, and this includes hypotension 2%, palpitation 1%, headache 1%, hemolysis 4%, air emboli 1%, high secondary pressure 2%, and no motality during our treatment. Clinical response is documented in cases of myasthenia gravis; acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and acquired factor VIII inhibitor in our study. In conclusion, double filtration plasmapheresis is a time-saving, convenient, and safe therapeutic modality with rare complication. Because its effectiveness on limited kinds of diseases and costs relatively high price, thus plasmapheresis should be used in selected cases and treat aggressively if indicated.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["8"]}

The substituent effects on the hydrolysis of dihydro-1, 4-oxathiin derivatives were studied and the rate of hydrolysis was shown to be accelerated by electron accepting groups. Final product of the hydrolysis was 2-(2-hydroxyethylthio) acetoacet-anilide enol form. On the basis of rate equations derived and judging from hydrolysis products obtained and from general base effect and substituent effects, plausible mechanism of the hydrolysis in various pH range have been proposed. Below pH 3.5, the hydrolysis was initiated by the protonation and followed by the addition of water to 2-carbon. Above pH 10.0, the hydrolysis was proceeded by the addition of hydroxide to 2-carbon.

In genetic advance values, combinations of days to flowering+ number of capsule per plant, days to flowering+ length of stem with capsule+ number of capsule per plant and days to flowering+ number of nodes with capsule were higher than those of other combinations. The highest genetic advance was the combination of all characters, but unreasonable problems such as the expence, time and labor involved in calculating the selection index are remained. For these reasons, it was realized that the selection index for selection should calculated on the basis of the data of 2-3 useful characters, ie, days to flowering, length of stem with capsule and number of capsule per plant.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["8"]}

{"title": "Bilirubin Metabolism and Bilirubin Encephalopathy\n", "abstract": " During the last 30 years, there has been much advances in the understanding of pathogenisis of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, but the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy are still remained for the high risk neonates. The mechanisms of bilirubin encephalopathy are not thouroughly understood. Various theories may explain bilirubin transport acoss the blood-brain barrier. Free bilirubin, not bound to albumin, can enter the brain. The permeability of the blood brain barrier to bilirubin or albuimin and bilirubin binding may play an important role in the bilirubin encephalopathy. Bilirubin binding ability of Korean infants, similar to American infants, is shown to be less than that of adults. Factors influencing bilirubin-albumin binding, such as acidosis, hypoxia, sepsis, hypothermia, hypoglycemia and immaturity should be considered for neonates at high risk of bilirubin encephalopathy. Free bilirubin is found to be significantly increased in preterm infants with low albumin level. Sulfisoxazole inhibits the bilirubin-albumin binding that resulted in increased free bilirubin concentrations even at low total bilirubin levels. Phenobarbital has no effects on bilirubin binding capacity of albumin. Phototherapy for 48 hours has no influence on bilirubin-albumin binding capacitiy and affinity. Auditory evoked repsonse (ABR) changes in the form of I, III, and IV wave reduction are associated with brainstem and cerebellum bilirubin deposition. Since early detection of bilirubin neurotoxicity is promising for improving outcome for high risk neonates, ABR and other electrophysiological measure will be useful.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["8"]}

DCPP prevents falling of fruits during their growth periods. However, the overdose of DCPP caused the unwanted maturing time and reduce the safe storage period. If we take fruits with exceeding maximum residue limits, it could be harmful. Therefore, this study presented the analytical method of DCPP in agricultural commodities for the nation-wide pesticide residues monitoring program of the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. METHODS AND RESULTS: We adopted the analytical method for DCPP in agricultural commodities by gas chromatograph in cooperated with Electron Capture Detector (ECD). Sample extraction and purification by ion-associated partition method were applied, then quantitation was done by GC/ECD with DB-17, a moderate polarity column under the temperature-rising condition with nitrogen as a carrier gas and split-less mode. Standard calibration curve presented linearity with the correlation coefficient ()> 0.9998, analysed from 0.1 to 2.0 mg/L concentration.

{"title": "Sequential Waveform Generation by Picosecond Optoelectronic Switching\n", "abstract": " The direct conversion of dc energy to RF pulses with high efficiency has many potential applications. They include:(1) the use of high-power electrical pulses for pulsed power devices and plasma-physics experiments;(2) various applications in high resolution radar and time domain metrology; and (3) the generation of megawatt level microwave and millimeter-wave pulses. All of these experiments require the development of an appropriate switch or an array of switches which can switch high power with extremely fast risetime and zero jitter. For sequential waveform generation several methods have been tried [1, 2]. In reference [1], a series of step recovery diodes was used; however only low voltage switching has been demonstrated. The prospects of extending this technique to a high power switch are poor because the step recovery diodes encounter breakdown problems at high voltage. In reference [2], a frozen wave generator was used for sequential waveform generation. A frozen Wave generator consists of many segments of transmission line charged alternately with positive and negative voltage (Fig. 1). Two adjacent segments are joined by a silicon switch which can be closed with a laser pulse. To maintain a high conversion efficiency and a good waveform, it is essential that all the switches be closed simultaneously and rapidly. Jitter in the Switching process produces random frequency modulation which removes energy from the fundamental frequency. Picosecond laser activated semiconductor Switches seem ideal for this application.

Methods: Thirty three subjects (mean age:  years, male: female= 15: 18) who were diagnosed with primary insomnia were selected for the study. Nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG) was carried out on each subject and correlation was analyzed between high frequency/low frequency ratio (LF/HF ratio), one of HRV indices and the variables related with sleep structure which were calculated from NPSG. Results: When age and sex were controlled, LF/HF ratio showed negative correlations with slow wave sleep and stage 2 sleep, respectively (=-0.43, p= 0.01; =-0.37, p= 0.04). On the other hands LF/HF ratio showed a positive correlation with arousal index (= 0.65, p< 0.001). The activity of autonomic nervous system responded differentially depending on the change of sleep structure in primary insomnia.

High pressurized cell system (100 bar and ) was designed to create supercritical  in the cell and the surface change and the dissolution of plagioclase and orthoclase were observed when the mineral surface reacted with supercritical  and water (or without water) for 30 days. The polished slab surface of feldspar was contacted with supercritical  and an artificial brine water (pH 8) in the experiments. The experiments for the reaction of feldspar with only supercritical (without brine water) were also conducted. Results from the first experiment showed that the average roughness value of the plagioclase surface was 0.118 nm before the reaction, but it considerably increased to 2.493 nm after 30 days. For the orthoclase, the average roughness increased from 0.246 nm to 1.916 nm, suggesting that the dissolution of feldspar occurs in active when the feldspars contact with supercritical  and brine water at  sequestration site. The dissolution of  and  from the plagioclase occurred and a certain part of them precipitated inside of the high pressurized cell as the form of amorphous silicate mineral. For the orthoclase, , , and  were dissolved in order and the kaolinite was precipitated. In the experiments without water, the change of the average roughness value and the dissolution of feldspar scarcely occurred, suggesting that the geochemical reaction of feldspars contacted with supercritical  at the environment without the brine water is not active.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["8"]}

For the long-term ecological research (LTER), we conducted preliminary field monitoring during 2008~ 2009 and analyzed biological parameters such as phytoplankton, zooplankton, and freshwater fish along with chemical water quality and empirical model analysis. According to phytoplankton surveys, major taxa have varied largely depending on seasons and sites sampled. Overall phytoplankton data showed that cyanophyta dominated in the summer period and diatoms dominated in the winter. In zooplankton analysis, 25 species including 20 rotifers, 3 cladocerans and 2 copepods were collected during the survey. The relative abundance of rotifers (86.5%) was always greater than that of cladocerans (6.3%) or copepods (5.1%). There were distinct spatial and inter-annual changes in the abundance of zooplankton in the reservoir, displaying similar patterns in three sites with the exception of S3 during the study. According to fish surveys, 8 families and 39 species were observed during 2008~ 2009. The most dominant fish was an exotic species of Lepomis macrochirus (23%), indicating an severe influence of exotic species to the ecosystem.

Unexpectedly, a thin but relatively impermeable layer called filter cake can be formed on the excavation surface, which significantly influences the result of slug test analysis in the cutoff wall if not considered. This study is to examine the effect of filter cake on evaluating hydraulic conductivity of the vertical cutoff wall through slug test analysis with the aid of the verified numerical program Slug_3D. The no-flux boundary conditions were adopted in Slug_3D to simulate the filter cake on the interface between the wall and the natural soil. A new set of type curves were built for applying the type curve method. New modification factors were obtained for using the modified line-fitting method. With consideration of filter cake, the type curve method and the modified line-fitting method were adopted to reanalyze the case study taken from EMCON (1995). The previous results achieved by Choi and Daniel (2006) without consideration of filter cake were compared with the present results obtained in this paper.

As the Al mole fraction increases, a single GaN peak splits into three peaks in both the XRD and the PL spectra, and the GaN PL peak due to the donor-bound exciton moves to higher energy in parallel with a pair of extrinsic peaks. The splittings of the peak and the blue shifts may possibly be associated with different crystalline domains in the GaN matrix layer, those domain being separated by the strong tensile stress in the AlGaN overlayer. This implies that the crystallinity of the GaN matrix near the AlGaN/GaN heterointerface can be influenced by strained the AlGaN overlayer.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["8"]}

The research identified several useful factors that could be used to develop statistical models to estimate delays on reinforced concrete pipes. First, rain related productivity delays could be estimated by differentiating clay content in soil. Second, utilities conflicts could be estimated by differentiating the types of utilities that were involved.

{"title": "The axilla\n", "abstract": " Until recently, imaging of lymph nodes has not played a significant role in staging breast cancer due to the inability to detect micrometastatic involvement. In the past, the gold standard for detecting metastatic involvement of axillary lymph nodes was axillary lymph node dissection, which was often associated with significant morbidity. Despite the ability of axillary dissection to help in locoregional control, it has not been shown to have any impact on the overall survival of the patient. 7Increasingly, sentinel lymph node biopsy has become an alternative procedure to evaluate involvement of lymph nodes. Sentinel lymph node imaging uses radionuclide particles and/or a visual tracer to detect the first lymph node draining the tumor site. 8 If histopathologic analysis shows tumor involvement, then a full axillary dissection can be performed. This information is also valuable in determining the need for hormonal therapy or\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["8"]}

The physicochemical properties and degradation kinetics of BCA were investigated to support the drug-development effort. The aqueous solubility of BCA was low, and it was not considered to be hygroscopic. The degradation of BCA followed the first-order kinetics, and the pH-rate profile revealed that the degradation of BCA was governed by general acid- and specific base-catalysis as well as spontaneous hydrolysis. BCA was very unstable in basic conditions, in particular pH above 9, and found to be more stable in acidic conditions such as pH between 2 and 4. The degradation of BCA was accelerated in elevated temperature and high-ionic strength. Therefore, it was suggested that BCA should be stored in slightly acidic conditions with lowered\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["8"]}

Knowledge of learning styles is important and may be useful in the development and conduct of e-learning in higher learning institutions and schools. The purpose of this study was to establish baseline information regarding the distribution of learning styles among lower secondary students at selected smart schools in Malaysia. A secondary purpose was to establish for these same individuals their stated preferred learning mode for learning online. A purposive sample (judgment sampling) was developed with permission from Ministry of Education and Education Departments in Malaysia. The learning style for each respondent was determined using the multiple intelligences inventory. The results of the study showed that, web-based instruction in its present form was more preferred by students whose intelligences were visual/spatial and interpersonal. Verbal/linguistic and logical/mathematical students reported less benefit from e-learning, perhaps because these students were more oriented towards traditional classroom learning.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["8"]}

Also prolonged QTc predicts the mortality in diabetic persons. However the relationship between insulin resistance and QTc is not well known in healthy people without diabetes. This study was performed to observe the association between QTc and insulin resistance in Korean non-diabetic subjects.METHODSTotal 874 subjects (520 men, 354 women, mean age 45.9+/-11.0 years) who underwent medical check-up at health promotion center in Kangbuk Samsung Hospital from January 2002 to May 2002 were included in this study. Age, sex, height, body weight, blood pressure, blood cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL cholesterol, fasting insulin, and fasting glucose levels were measured. QT intervals were corrected with Bazett's formula (QTc= QT/RR). HOMA (Homeostasis model assessment) were calculated in order to assess the correlations between insulin resistance indices and QTc interval.RESULTSThe means of QTc intervals were significantly longer in females (417.0+/-24.0 msec) compared to males (402.4+/-22.7 msec)(p< 0.001). Significant positive correlation were found between QTc and age, glucose, blood pressure in male subjects.

In the present study we elucidated the immunomodulating activity of PJ-4 on the BALB/C mousse splenic Iymphocytes using flow cytometrical techniques. As a result, PJ-4 was found to stimulate the lymphocytes not only to form Iymphoblasts but also to express CD25 (IL-2 receptor u chain) molecule, which is well known as a T cell activation marker. More Interestingly, its T cell stimulatory activity was more strongly exerted on CD8+ T cells than on CD4+ T cells. All these data suggest that PJ-4 exerts its antitumor activity at least partly through stimulation of T cells which play major roles in the cell-mediated immune system.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["8"]}

Apart from quite different surface morphologies, both the quality and growth rate of diamond films deposited on the ion beam nitrided steel substrates were higher than those on the unnitrided steel substrates. Similar diamond/steel interface structure were observed on both the nitrided and unnitrided steel.

A total of 257 cycles of altimeter measurements between Oct. 1992 and Sep. 1999 (for nearly 2570 days) were analyzed to visualize the distribution of sea ice. We then calculated the surface area of ice coverage using SUTM20 map projection to quantify the periodic variations. Each year, the maximum and minimum coverages of sea ice were found in early October and March in the study area, respectively.

The selection of tuples are from 0% to 100%. The found set of relations will determine the different query processing strategies being implemented. To implement effective query processing strategies relies on the cost model of query processing. Traditionally, query processing does not handle personalization of user requirements. In the e-commerce environment, in order to achieve a fast response time of a query it requires personalization in the relation. We introduce the concept of personalization at the query processing level.

To address this problem, fluorine-doped silicon dioxide (SiOF) has been introduced in advanced IMD applications. Many deposition methods have been studied, including PECVD and HDP CVD. HDP CVD was finally applied to most deep sub-micron processes because it can meet the gap-filling requirement. However, the fluorine-doped silicon dioxide film is an unstable film. It suffers from high water absorption and a fluorine instability problem. This problem will cause a device reliability issue and even defects to appear at the final alloy step. In this paper, the fluorine-doped silicon dioxide deposition temperature and post-thermal processes, including N2 alloy and vacuum-bake have been studied, find a way to overcome these problems.

Based on a frontier orbital theory, the sticking of boron ions on the substrate was found to be superior to that of nitrogen ions and their neutral atoms. Potential energy surfaces calculated for a boron atom and a nitrogen atom on the substrate surfaces show that the nitrogen adsorption favors the formation of more ordered bonding than the boron adsorption. This study reveals that a surface nitride of substrate as the first step in the boron nitride growth would facilitate ordered interfacial bonding so that a good adhesion of the grown film with the substrate would be achieved.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["8"]}

The prognosis of EGC is excellent but a small portion of patients experience recurrence after curative resection. We aimed to study recurrence rate of EGC, recurrence pattern of EGC and to find predicting factors for recurrence. We analyzed treatment results after recurrence in EGC.MATERIALS AND METHODSOne thousand four hundred fifty eight patients with EGC at Department of Surgery, Seoul National University Hospital (1986~ 1995) were reviewed for recurrence retrospectively.RESULTSTwenty-six patients had recurrence after curative resection (1.79%). Thirteen cases (50%) recurred within 24 months (early recurrence) and late recurrence after 60 months occured in 4 cases (15%). The common modes of recurrence were locoregional (9, 34.6%) and distant metastasis (9, 34.6%). Submucosal invasion was in 19 cases and lymph node metastasis was positive in 14 cases. Median survival after recurrence was 5.6 months. Median survival after recurrence was 3.1 months after conservative management, 5.8 months after chemotherapy, and 46.8 months after resection. Recurrence rate was significantly higher in submucosal invasion group than mucosal invasion group (2.6% vs. 1.0%, p< 0.05) and lymph node metastasis positive group than negative group (7.4% vs. 1.0%, p< 0.001) by univariate analysis.

In both cases the key ions in the materials (Cu for HTS and Mn for CMR) exhibit vibration amplitudes larger than that of ions in simple Debye solids and clearly show discontinuities in the vibration amplitudes as a function of temperature close to the phase transition temperatures. These point to the unequivocal participation of phonons in the transport processes and possibly in the onset of the phase\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["8"]}

{"title": "Nitric oxide synthesis in murine skin cancers\n", "abstract": " Nitric oxide (NO) is a major cytotoxic effector molecule of activated macrophages. Although the antitumor activity of NO produced by activated macrophages was demonstrated in in vitro experiments, the in vivo role of tumor infiltrating macropheges in tumor growth is currently uncertain. It is also unknown that tumor infiltrating macrophages produce NO, and thereby contribute either a host antitumor immune defense mechanism or a promoting mechanism of in vivo tumor growth by suppressing immune function. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate whether the NO synthesizing pathway is activated in in vivo growing tumor tissue, and thereby the produced NO inhibits tumor growth using various murine skin tumor models. Further experiments were designed to test whether tumor infiltrating macrophages are the major source of NO produced by the in vivo growing tumor tissue. Freshly diesociated murine skin tumors were found to have much higher levels of nitric axide secretion into culture medi-um than long-term cultured tumor. Immunomagnetic depletion of macrophages from freshly dissociated tumor cells using anti-Mac-1 antibody decreased NO production (17.5+-1.5 vs 5.0+-1.1 uM nitrite). Addition of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N-monomethyl-L-arginine (MLA) resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in nitric oxide synthesis in freshly dissociated tumor. There was a reciprocal relationship of NO synthesis with tritiated thymidine incorporation in these cultures. Strong iron-dithiol-dinitrosyl and heme-nitrosyl electron paramagnetic resonance signals were observed in freshly dissociated, but not long-term cultured tumor cells\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["8"]}

Worker behavior is not only determined by individual's inherent characteristics, but also largely shaped by contexts which include the social interactions within a project. As a result, construction workers' behavior on a job site is under the influence of the social norms and work culture of their workgroup. However, our current understanding of the social aspect of worker behavior is limited. To expand our understanding of workers' social behavior and its impact on project performance, researchers have begun using an agent-based modeling approach because it allows researchers to observe the complex group-level behavior emerging from individuals' interactions.

Major simulation works include: steady-state power flow, fault current computation, transient stability analysis and the impact analysis on critical fault clearing time. Three connection methods, ie, single-point, separatepoint and multi-point connection, are proposed, in which the single-point connection is divided into two voltage levels (161kV and 345kV). During the steady-state operation, simulation results indicate that the 345 kV single-point connection method demonstrates the best performance. In addition, the fault current from a wind farm is partially determined by its connection location. In terms of transient stability, when grid faults take place, the 161kV singlepoint connection method appears to report the smallest voltage drop as compared to other connection scenarios. Its amplitude of frequency disturbance, however, is the greatest of all connection scenarios. As for the analysis on critical fault clearing time, simulation results indicate that the critical fault clearing time in all connection cases is approximately two times greater than that required by the Taipower standard.

By adding a buffer layer underneath the epitaxial film, the quality of this epitaxial thin film can be improved remarkably. It is of great interest to characterize the buffer layer in order to understand the mechanism of how it plays an important role in the industrial breakthrough in fabricating the blue light emitting diode and blue laser. To understand the importance of the GaN buffer layer, detailed thin film structures of the buffer layers were studied in terms of buffer thickness, buffer growth temperatures and the temperature ramping times. At present, it was known that the best CVD temperature to grow the buffer layer is around 525\u0393\u00f9\u00aa C; the best thickness is around 10-20 nm [1\u0393\u00c7\u00f43]; and the best ramping time is 25\u0393\u00f9\u00aa C/min.(from 525\u0393\u00f9\u00aa C to the 1025\u0393\u00f9\u00aa C)[4]. The best interpretation for the buffer layer grown at low temperature is that the low temperature buffer layer consists of a largely amorphous layer to accommodate the large misfit between substrate and overlayer, so that the density of threading dislocation can be significantly reduced [5, 6]. In addition, HS Yi et al.[7] determined the ratio of cubic to hexagonal component as functions of temperatures and speculated that the surface morphology is an important factor in obtaining desired optical properties. However, it is still lack of detailed measurements on the buffer layer to show how these growth conditions play the role in growing a good working epitaxial film.

{"title": "Characterization of Seawater Electrolysis of Insoluble Catalytic Electrodes Fabricated by RF Magnetron Sputtering\n", "abstract": " Insoluble catalytic electrodes were fabricated by RF magnetron sputtering of Pt on Ti substrates and the performance of seawater electrolysis was compared in these electrodes to that is DSA electrodes. The Pt-sputtered insoluble catalytic electrodes were nearly 150 nm-thick with a roughness of , which is 1/660 and 1/12 of these values for the DSA (dimensionally stable anodes) electrodes. The seawater electrolysis performance levels were determined through measurements of the NaOCl concentration, which was the main reaction product after electrolysis using artificial seawater. The NaOCl concentration after 2 h of electrolysis with artificial seawater, which has 3.5% NaCl normally, at current densities of 50, 80 and 140 mA/ were 0.76%, 1.06%, and 2.03%, respectively. A higher current density applied through the electrodes led to higher electrolysis efficiency. The efficiency reached nearly 58% in the Pt-sputtered samples after 2 h of electrolysis. The reaction efficiency of DSA showed higher values than that of the Pt-sputtered insoluble catalytic electrodes. One plausible reason for this is the higher specific surface area of the DSA electrodes; the surface cracks of the DSAs resulted in a higher specific surface area and higher reaction sites. Upon the electrolysis process, some Mg-and Ca-hydroxides, which were minor components in the artificial seawater, were deposited onto the surface of the electrodes, resulting in an increase in the electrical resistances of the electrodes. However, the extent of the increase ranged from 4% to 7% within an electrolysis time of 720 h.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["8"]}

{"title": "A multithreaded scheduling model for solving the Tower of Hanoi game in a multicore environment\n", "abstract": " Modern computer systems greatly depend on multithreaded scheduling to balance the workload among their working units. One of the multithreaded scheduling techniques, the work-stealing technique has proven effective in balancing the distribution of threads by stealing threads from the working cores and reallocating them to the non-working cores. In this study, we propose a new strategy that extends the work-stealing technique by enabling it to select the richest core prior to any redistribution process. In order to obtain practical results, we applied this new strategy of balancing threads to one of the divide-and-conquer problems, the Tower of Hanoi game. A multithreaded scheduling model which is a hierarchical model was designed to work under the control of this new strategy. A modelling tool was used to simulate and verify the designed model. The proposed model was shown by the simulation process to exhibit consistency and stability in reaching the desired result. Scalability, concurrency, simplicity and fair load distribution among the modelled cores are the main beneficial characteristics of this model.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["8"]}

And still ad hoc network needs a separate scheme to be connected to the Internet. Here, we propose a hybrid routing scheme with centralized node which provides Internet connectivity and robustness of ad hoc network by maintaining geographical-based routing information of all ad hoc nodes.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["8"]}

The uniform extension of the Reissner-Nordstrom metric to the extra dimension is shown to be one of such solutions. The Maxwell fields associating this metric turn out to contain magnetic as well as electric monopole fields as seen in the 1+3 dimensions. The magnetic charge per unit length of the source string is the same as that of the electric charge per unit length in this case. We try to find solutions generalizing the above solution to the arbitrary electric and magnetic charge case.

In order to accomplish this, the shaft for the roller is often made with a composite material. As composite material shafts are expensive and require a long time to manufacture, a simulation to check the deflection of the shaft should be conducted during the design step. However, simulations of extremely long composite materials are seldom reported. Thus, an accurate simulation technique should be studied. Therefore, this report presents the static and dynamic simulations of a very long composite material shaft. The simulation was in good agreement with the test data; hence, the simulation technique can help model other composite material shafts.\\eywordsG Dynamic Behavior, Rubbing Roller, LCD, Thin Long Rotor, CFRP, Deflection, FEM 1 Introduction", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["8"]}

These characteristics have the potential to be utilized in the application of spot synthesis and array-type cell-based assays. To date, there have been a few reports on the formation of amine patterns defined by hydrophobic silane layers fbr the spatial organization of cells. 3 However, several problems, such as the use of the limited types of organosilane fbr the cell-adhesive patterns, complicated deep UV irradiation fbr the patterning, and possible contamination of patterns from organosilane coupling still remain to be over come. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new patterning technique that extends the versatile surface chemistry and eliminates the contamination problem. Here, we present a novel and simple surface modification method for preparing amine-spacer patterns defined by perfluoroalkyl silane layers and their feasibility fbr the directed attachment of human retinal pigment epithelial cell line4 (ARPE-19) and functional polystyrene microbeads.

Photostimulated luminescence (PSL) and electron spin resonance (ESR) were applied as the detection methods. Using PSL analysis, the irradiated PD, PK and PKC could be easily distinguished from the non-irradiated ones, while irradiation of the PC at 5 kGy or higher was detectable. The ESR spectra of the irradiated PD, PK and PKC exhibited symmetrical multiplet lines, which might be induced from the crystalline sugar, whereas, the PC showed a single signal at the paramagnetic centers. The signal intensity increased with incremental increases of irradiation doses distinguishing the irradiated samples from the control. In addition, the peak height also revealed that irradiation induced an increment in the intensity of single and/or multiplet lines of the ESR signals, resulting in clear confirmation of irradiation.

Meanwhile basic research has been performed to develop BNCT medical technology using above Hanaro facilities when they are ready. The Hanaro BNCT facility gives almost pure thermal neutron beam, it can be applied to all level of BNCT research from the cell culture and animal study to clinical trials by focussed irradiation, and its use does not cause any interference with other utilization. It can also be used for other purposes such as standard thermal neutron field and a dynamic neutron radiography with excellent features. The PGNAA equipment will be used not only for the boron concentration measurement but also for the general multi-element simultaneous analyses. The medical research for BNCT covers basic research on dose evaluation, boron compound behaviour and new compound development. Technologies for neutron and gamma transport calculation and their measurement, and micro dosimetry are developed. While import of a dose planning program has been pushed, domestic development of the program has been tried. Imaging technologies for boron distribution using SPECT or PET are developed by labeling I-123 or F-18 to BPA. Data for the BPA accumulation into the brain tumor are produced by clinical trials of the technology.

However, conventional isolated RESURF structures cannot be used in a multi power BCD process because of the breakdown voltage dependence on epi thickness. Accordingly, we had to use non RESURF LDMOS transistor that has higher on state resistance than RESURF LDMOS transistor in a multi power BCD process. In this paper, we suggested a new isolated RESURF LDMOS structure whose breakdown voltage is independent of epi thickness, and applied this structure to the multi power BCD process that provides 5V CMOS, 20V vertical NPN transistor and 40V/60V LDMOS transistors. Consequently, we could lower 34~ 49% on state resistance of the LDMOS transistors.

{"title": "Numerical modeling on microsegregation considering tip-undercooling in binary alloy welds\n", "abstract": " Generally, it is difficult to get a perfect equilibrium situation during solidification of alloys, because the segregation by non-equilibrium solidification always occurs except for a few cases. Thus the quantitative prediction is indeed needed. In the past, experimental methods and/or analytic methods have been used to predict the degree of microsegregation. But it is very difficult to observe and determine the solute segregation that appears in the small dendrite region. Moreover, analytic models have so many assumptions that they cannot describe actual phenomenon exactly. If it is possible to estimate the degree of microsegregation by means of computer simulation, it will be able to predict the mechanical and physical properties of metal products. It will thus lead to the reduction of ineffective trial-and-error methods which have been used so far. Most of the previous microsegregation models [1\u0393\u00c7\u00f47] are one-dimensional\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["8"]}
{"title": "Dynamic Link Striping: Breaking the WAN Bandwidth Barrier in Piconets\n", "abstract": " Multiple communication interfaces in personal portable wireless devices are becoming more prevalent. We anticipate that these devices will often have two types of communication interfaces: a local area, short range, high bandwidth wireless network interface such as WaveLAN, Bluetooth, etc., and a wide area, long range but low bandwidth network interface such as cellular phone, richochet modem, etc. Our research investigates forming dynamic, ad hoc communities of such devices communicating with each other using their LAN interfaces. The MANET working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is conducting related research, focusing on the routing in mobile ad hoc networks [1, 2]. We call such ad hoc communities piconets. Each piconet member normally accesses the Internet using its WAN interface. Thus, the rate of transferring data to/from Internet is limited by the low bandwidth of the WAN interface.We propose to break the WAN bandwidth barrier in piconets by\" striping\" data over each of the WAN links of several piconet devices. There are a vast number of applications of striping (ie sending a fraction of data over each of the several independent communication links) in disk storage systems and LAN/WAN systems. The former are generally implemented to realize higher throughput to slow disk drives [3, 4], while the latter are used to minimize costs of relatively more expensive WAN connections [5, 6, 7]. Unlike these traditional striping applications operating in a relatively static environment, we consider highly dynamic piconets where device membership changes rapidly.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["8"]}

The proximal convoluted tubule (S1)-and the inner medullary collecting tubule (IMCT)-originated cell lines were used. Cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]~) was measured employing Fura-2 fluorescence and cell injury was evaluated by a vital dye exclusion procedure. Silica increased [Ca2+]~ in a concentration-dependent manner in S~(60 pglml-600 pglml) and IMCT (6, ug/ml-600 jugs' ml). Silica caused a biphasic increase in [Ca2+] 1 which was composed of an initial rapid rise and following sustained phase. Ca2+ removal from the medium resulted in abolishment of initial and sustained phase of silica (600, uglml)-induced [Ca2+]~ in both cell lines. Silica-induced cell injury was increased in a dose-dependent manner. This silica-induced cell injury was attenuated by the pretreatment with EGTA (100 pM) and nifedipine (1 jiM). Cellular ATP content ([ATP]) by silica also decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. The relationship between [Ca2+]~ and [ATP] showed that [ATP] depletion caused [Ca2\u252c\u2592], to rise. This study suggests that 1) the elevation of [Ca2+]~ caused by silica is due mainly to influx through plasma membrane Ca2+ channel and non specific membrane damage (at high concentration) and 2) nephrotoxicity of silica shows site-specificity within the kidney.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["8"]}

ATP-induced  increased in a dose-dependent manner . ATP-induced  increases were slightly slowed in extracellular calcium-free conditions especially in sustained phase. ATP-induced  increment was also inhibited by the pretreatment of U73122, a phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor, in a time-dependent manner. Suramin, a putative  receptor antagonist, dose-dependently weakened ATP-induced  mobilization. Significant increases in cell proliferation were observed at 2, 3, and 4 days after ATP was added. Stimulated cell proliferation was also observed with adenosine at days 2 and 3. This cell proliferation was significantly inhibited by the treatment with suramin. Ionomycin also stimulated cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. In conclusion, we suggest that extracellular ATP stimulates C6 glioma cell proliferation via intracellular free calcium mobilization mediated by purinoceptor.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["8"]}

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results indicate that P4VP is miscible with VAc-VAL copolymers containing more than 30 mole% VAL. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis of the miscible blends of P4VP with VAc-VAL copolymers reveal the existence of intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions between hydroxyl groups and vinyl pyridines.

The incoming disturbances are due to variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) which may be articulated through -5 deg to +70 deg. The resonances occur in the running range at 15 engine orders in blade modes 9, 10, 11, and 12. The VIGV wakes were measured using laser anemometry as well as being predicted using a 3D viscous CFD method. The wakes are found to be mainly vortical in nature, and increase strongly above 30-deg closure angles; the CFD method does a good job of predicting the wakes up to about 40 deg, above which the strong separations that occur are underpredicted. Both CFD and laser measured wakes are then circumferentially decomposed into Fourier harmonics to produce forcing functions.

{"title": "Expression and function of a putative KATP channel subtype in human corpus cavernosum smooth muscle\n", "abstract": " K channels are important modulators of human corporal smooth muscle tone. The goals of this study were 3-fold: 1. to study the expression of the K ATP channel in corporal tissue and cultured cells; 2. to determine if K channels are involved in the relaxation responses elicited by putative K channel modulators, & 3. to determine if K channel modulators alter intracellular calcium mobilization. Western blots and immunocytochemistry revealed abundant K ATP channel expression in both frozen tissues and cultured cells. Cumulative concentration response curves (CRCs) were constructed for relaxation of PE-precontracted corporal tissue strips by Pinacidil (PIN), P1075, and U99751; which elicited relaxation responses with\u0393\u00eb\u00ea EC 50 values of of 3 nM, 60 nM, and 30 nM, respectively. Preincubation with glibenclamide (GLIB, 1 \u256c\u255dM: 30 mins) partially inhibited the relaxation responses elicited by all of these putative K channel openers. Relaxation responses to P1075 were completely and immediately reversed by addition of KCl (60 mM), and more slowly, but completely by TEA (100 mM) or GLIB (1 \u256c\u255dM). Calcium imaging experiments on fura-2 loaded cultured smooth muscle cells revealed that preincubation with (PIN)(1 \u256c\u255dM) elicited a significant and completely GLIB-sensitive (10 \u256c\u255dM) diminution in the peak amplitude of the ET-1 (endothelin-1)-induced intracellular calcium transient; which was equivalent to that observed in the presence of verapamil (1 \u256c\u255dM), a L-type calcium channel blocker, or in the absence of extracellular calcium.

The SHG has been excited with a Nd:YAG laser operating at 1064 nm. The local SH field distribution has been probed with an uncoated adiabatically tapered fiber tip. To determine the contribution of near-field processes to the SHG, we have studied the dependence of the SH signal from a rough silver surface on the tip-sample distance for S- and P-polarized excitation light. This dependence for S-polarized light is shown. A rather strong increase in the signal occurs within about 500 nm from the surface. We believe that this behavior results from the relaxation of phase-matching conditions and polarization selection rules in the near-field region of the surface.

In this study, the expression patterns of Usp were investigated by immunohistochemistrv in individual tissues from diHernt developmental stases of Drosophila. Usp is localized in the nucleus with ubiquitous distribution throughout development. Usp expression is detected throughout embrvogenesis. Usp is expressed in imaginal and lanral tissues from late third instar 18nra. The expression pattern of Usp is overlapped by those of EcR. Also Usp is expressed in differentiating adult reproductive organs. This result suggests that Usp is not a transcriptional regulatory factor modulating hormonal response during development, but also play some roles in female and male reproduction of Drosophila.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["8"]}

The unique feature common in all the approaches considered is the jitter-free nature of the picosecond photoconductive switch.

However, in a bulk medium, the spatial intensity distribution of the laser pulse results in nonuniform chirping across the spatial profile of the beam, causing the spatial chirping effect. That is, different parts of the beam have different magnitudes of frequency chirping. In the single-pass situation, the SPM temporal chirping and the spatial chirping have the same magnitudes.

Any time jittering between the two signals can cause error in waveform sampling. The synchronization can be established by using a sophisticated frequency synthesizer as the microwave source and synchronizing it with the rf driver of the laser modelocker (another frequency synthesizer). 1 However, this type of system is very complex and expensive, especially when applied to the millimeter wave frequency range. Moreover, use of this technique is limited and cannot be applied to measurement of the oscillator waveform on a MMIC.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["8"]}

{"title": "Performance of laser activated semiconductor opening switches\n", "abstract": " Form only given, as follows. The authors report on the high-voltage operation of GaAs switches. The switches used were intrinsic GaAs and Cr:GaAs of bulk devices of millimeter sizes. The range of bias voltage applied was 500 V to 2 kV. The light source was a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser with 10-ns pulse duration. The closing and opening speeds of the Cr:GaAs switches were limited by the risetime and falltime of the laser pulse. Typical off-resistances when the laser light illumination was turned off were higher than 20 M Omega , whereas the on-resistances with laser illumination can be as low as 1 Omega . Such a large ratio of off-resistance to on-resistance allowed a switching efficiency of better than 99%. In the most practical inductive storage systems, the peak power transferred to the load is restricted by the switch opening time.

TEM micrographs show that the interface smoothed by the RTN (1000\u252c\u2591C,60s) of SiO2 is roughened by the subsequent heavy RTO (1100\u252c\u2591C,60s). The fixed charge and interface state densities of the produced films are strongly dependent on the degree of reoxidation of Si at the interface. MOS capacitor results indicate that, as compared to pure oxide films, the RTO/RTN oxide samples exhibit reduced bulk trap and interface state generation rates under high electrical field stress. Optimized RTN and RTO processes can produce thin dielectrics with enhanced charge to breakdown (QBD strength and flat band voltage (VFB) stability.

{"title": "Rapid Thermal Nitridation of Thin Oxides\n", "abstract": " In this paper the kinetics of initial nitridation of thermal oxides is studied by using rapid thermal nitridation of thin oxides.

Results show that RTN at 1100\u252c\u2591 for 120s incorporates about 85% and 12% of the maximum nitrogen concentration value at oxide surface and bulk, respectively. The nitrogen pile up peak at interface can be seen after RTN at 1100\u252c\u2591C with the time as short as 5 s.

In the first experiment we have succeeded in using natural diamond as a photoconductor excited by picosecond laser pulses to switch high voltage with 80% efficiency.

In the second experiment a Blumlein pulse generator with an ultrafast opto-electronic switch is reported. The Blumlein pulse generator possesses the potentiality of yielding a pulse amplitude which can be equal to the charging voltage in an ideal case. The opto-electronic switch was fabricated from high resistivity silicon with annular aluminum electrodes. With a pulsed bias voltage of 1100 volts, the switched-out amplitude is about 900 volts, greater than the maximum voltage attainable from a standard charge line pulser generator.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["8"]}
{"title": "Optoelectronic Devices For Millimeter-Waves\n", "abstract": " We discuss the dynamic behavior of the propagation parameters of millimeter-waves in semiconductor waveguides when they are controlled by a laser induced electron-hole plasma. Depending upon the laser source and the semiconducting material utilized, high speed millimeter-wave phase shifters, modulators, switches, and gating devices may be constructed. Gated millimeter-wave pulses of 1 ns duration have been observed in a Si waveguide. Modulated millimeter-wave signals with pulse durations of ~ 400 ps and a modulation bandwidth approaching 1 GHz are readily available using a Cr:GaAs waveguide controlled by a mode-locked Nd:YAG laser. Control of the propagation properties of a Si waveguide has also been demonstrated using a GaAs diode laser. Simultaneous measurements of phase shift and attenuation in the waveguide as a function of time have been performed and a theoretical model has\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["8"]}

{"title": "Multiphoton conductivity in semiconductors and its application to ultra-short pule measurement\n", "abstract": " Two-photon conductivity in GaAs and CdSo. rSo. z and three-photon conductivity in CdS were investigated with modelocked Nd: glass laser pulse excitation, with a view to determine their suitability for picosecond pulsewidth measurement. The two-photon conductivity in Cr-doped compensated GaAs was found to exhibit a square-law dependence on the excitation intensity over a limited region of laser intensities, approximately 2-15 MW/cm2. This limited region of square-law dependence was found consistent with the measured two-photon absorption coefficient (5 cm/MW) and the thickness of the sample (0.034 cm). The two-photon conductivity in CdSo. sSeo. o was found to exhibit a square-law dependence over a wider range of laser intensities. This rather extended region of square law was attributed to the smaller two-photon absorption coefficient (0.07 cm/MW) and smaller thickness of the crystal (0.023 cm\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["8"]}

{"title": "Reclassification and documentation in talog cards and a computer stored record.\n", "abstract": " A project to recatalog and reclassify the book collection of the Bowman Gray School of Medicine Library utilizing the Magnetic Tape/Selectric Typwriter system for simultaneous catalog card production and computer stored data acquisition marks the beginning of eventual computerization of all library operations. A keyboard optical display system will be added by late 1970. Major input operations requiring the creation of \u0393\u00c7\u00a3hard copy\u0393\u00c7\u00a5 will continue via the MTST system. Updating, editing and retrieval operations as well as input without hard copy production will be done through the \u0393\u00c7\u00a3on-line\u0393\u00c7\u00a5 keyboard optical display system. Once the library's first data bank, the book catalog, has been established the computer may be consulted directly for library holdings from any optical display terminal throughout the medical center. Three basic information retrieval operations may be carried out through \u0393\u00c7\u00a3on-line\u0393\u00c7\u00a5 optical display terminals. Output options include the reproduction of part or all of a given document, or the generation of statistical data, which are derived from two Acquisition Code lines. The creation of a central bibliographic record of Bowman Gray Faculty publications patterned after the cataloging program is presently under way. The cataloging and computer storage of serial holdings records will begin after completion of the reclassification project. All acquisitions added to the collection since October 1967 are computer-stored and fully retrievable. Reclassification of older titles will be completed in early 1971.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["8"]}

{"title": "Group velocity of uniaxial plasma\n", "abstract": " One of the most fundamental intrinsic characteristics of a dispersive medium is its group velocity. Particularly in the study of ionosphere [l], the group velocity of the plasma plays an important role in the commonly used pulse techniques. Nevertheless, the expression for the group velocity in a magnetoionic plasma is very complicated and must be computed by numerical methods which usually give little analytical information. In this communication, a simplified case will be considered, namely, the group velocity in a uniaxially anisotropic plasma. It is well known that the uniaxial model is a reasonable approximation in describing the low-frequency or resonance phenomenon for a magnetoplasma. It is hoped that by analytically studying this imple medium, some information about a more general case could be recovered.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["8"]}

{"title": "THE VIRTUAL CONSTRUCTION SIMULATOR: EVALUATING AN EDUCATIONAL SIMULATION APPLICATION FOR TEACHING CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS\n", "abstract": " Educating and training students in the architecture, engineering and construction disciplines is challenging. Building and infrastructure projects are becoming ever more complex, necessitating more efficient construction processes to meet increasingly strict cost, time, quality and sustainability requirements. Engineering education that teaches students the dynamic processes inherent in building construction focuses mainly on lectures and case studies supplemented with field trips to construction sites that, while valuable, are often challenged by logistics, safety, and sufficient time for students to witness various construction stages and complexities. An evolving area of research explores the use of educational computer simulations to enhance construction engineering education and facilitate the development of student problem solving and decision making skills. One current education development initiative at our university, the Virtual Construction Simulator (VCS), explores the value of simulation games in teaching construction concepts such as scheduling, resource management and resource allocation. The VCS is an interactive simulation game developed and implemented in Spring 2010 that engages students in an experiential simulation environment where they plan and develop a construction schedule for a virtual building, make decisions regarding construction methods, resources, and activity sequences, and simulate the construction schedule. We have found that by moving through this virtual stepping process, students assume a more active role in learning the differences between as-planned and as-built construction schedules that\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["8"]}
