{"title": "Hot swapping and hot scaling containers\n", "abstract": " Techniques for hot swapping and hot scaling containers between cloud services are disclosed. In one example, a method includes storing, with a cloud exchange, data indicating an association of a first container of a first private network with a second container of a second private network, wherein the first private network and the second private network are coupled to the cloud exchange to send and receive data packets via the cloud exchange. The method further includes sending, with the cloud exchange based on the association, state of the first container to the second container.", "num_citations": "54\n", "authors": ["1958"]}
{"title": "Automated delivery system\n", "abstract": " Methods and systems for automated delivery are described. A user submits an order for an item that is to be picked up. The order is processed, the item is placed in a container, and a notification is sent to the user with delivery details, such as a container identifier, pick up location, and pick up time. The user provides information associated with the order or his or her identity, such as a credit card, to gain access to the item in the container.", "num_citations": "33\n", "authors": ["1958"]}
{"title": "Container-based cloud exchange disaster recovery\n", "abstract": " In general, this disclosure describes techniques for coordinating, with a cloud exchange, automated cloud-based disaster recovery across containers from a failed cloud service to a backup cloud service. In some examples, an orchestration engine for a cloud exchange is configured to: detect an indication of a disruption in a first cloud service provided by a first cloud service provider network coupled to the cloud exchange to send and receive data packets via the cloud exchange; provision, in response to detecting the indication of the disruption in the first cloud service, disaster recovery infrastructure layers in containers of a second cloud service provided by a second cloud service provider network coupled to the cloud exchange; obtain code and state from containers of the first cloud service; and communicate the code and state to the disaster recovery infrastructure layers in the containers of the second cloud service.", "num_citations": "28\n", "authors": ["1958"]}
{"title": "Architecture for data center infrastructure monitoring\n", "abstract": " A central infrastructure monitoring system includes an asset configurator; and a plurality of data center infrastructure monitoring systems each associated with a respective data center of a plurality of geographically distributed data centers that include one or more physical infrastructure assets of a plurality of physical infrastructure assets for enabling system operation within the respective data center. The data center infrastructure monitoring systems are coupled to the central infrastructure monitoring system. The asset configurator is configured to define templates of standard attributes for the plurality of infrastructure assets based on information about the plurality of infrastructure assets of the plurality of data centers, generate infrastructure asset data that logically represents the plurality of physical infrastructure assets based on the defined templates, and associate, via the infrastructure asset data, the physical\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1958"]}
