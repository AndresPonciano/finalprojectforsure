In this paper, the effect of such techniques on cell yield and antibody production of two NS0 cell lines is presented. On the one hand, the effect of fed-batch cultivation using dialysis is compared to cultivation without dialysis. Maximum cell density could be increased by a factor of ~5\u20137 by dialysis fed-batch cultivation. On the other hand, suppression of apoptosis in the NS0 cell line 6A1 bcl-2 resulted in a prolonged growth phase and a higher viability and maximum cell density in fed-batch cultivation in contrast to the control cell line 6A1 (100)3. These factors resulted in more product formation (by a factor ~2). Finally, the adaptive model-based OLFO controller, developed as a general tool for cell culture fed-batch processes, was able\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "71\n", "authors": ["1898"]}
{"title": "Determination of dissolved CO2 concentration and CO2 production rate of mammalian cell suspension culture based on off-gas measurement\n", "abstract": " The determination of dissolved CO2 and HCO3\u2212 concentrations as well as the carbon dioxide production rate in mammalian cell suspension culture is attracting more and more attention since the effects on major cell properties, such as cell growth rate, product quality/production rate, intracellular pH and apoptosis, have been revealed. But the determination of these parameters by gas analysis is complicated by the solution/dissolution of carbon dioxide in the culture medium. This means that the carbon dioxide transfer rate (CTR; which can easily be calculated from off-gas measurement) is not necessarily equal to carbon dioxide production rate (CPR). In this paper, a mathematical method to utilize off-gas measurement and culture pH for cell suspension culture is presented. The method takes pH changes, buffer and medium characteristics that effect CO2 mass transfer into account. These calculations, based on a\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "64\n", "authors": ["1898"]}

{"title": "Disposable algae cultivation for high-value products using all around LED-illumination directly on the bags\n", "abstract": " This paper investigated if a reusable LED-illumination directly on all sides of disposable bags is possible. Besides the traditional cultivation of algae in sunlight illuminated vessels, the interest in cultivation using indoor-bioreactors grows. This development can be explained by the potential of producing high-value substances such as food additives, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals via algae. However, the requirements for the corresponding production are more complex with regard to sterility, process control and reproducibility. These requirements can be fulfilled in illuminated indoor photobioreactors. There are non-disposable commercial indoor photobioreactor systems available made of steel or glass to cultivate phototrophic organisms. For high-value products out of (mammalian) cell culture, disposable systems are more and more applied. This trend is also interesting for photobiotechnology. The illumination for disposable bags consists of reusable flexible LED-lines placed directly on all surfaces of the bag. This placement reduces light losses and illuminates the bag from all sides. Moreover, it is simple, space-saving and flexible. Cultivations of the organisms Chlorella vulgaris, applied as a well-known alga, and Euglena gracilis for the production of the substance paramylon demonstrated the suitability of such an illumination applied to a disposable Wave-system.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1898"]}

{"title": "Dynamic parameter estimation and prediction over consecutive scales, based on moving horizon estimation: applied to an industrial cell culture seed train\n", "abstract": " Bioprocess modeling has become a useful tool for prediction of the process future with the aim to deduce operating decisions (eg transfer or feeds). Due to variabilities, which often occur between and within batches, updating (re-estimation) of model parameters is required at certain time intervals (dynamic parameter estimation) to obtain reliable predictions. This can be challenging in the presence of low sampling frequencies (eg every 24 h), different consecutive scales and large measurement errors, as in the case of cell culture seed trains. This contribution presents an iterative learning workflow which generates and incorporates knowledge concerning cell growth during the process by using a moving horizon estimation (MHE) approach for updating of model parameters. This estimation technique is compared to a classical weighted least squares estimation (WLSE) approach in the context of model updating over\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1898"]}
{"title": "Digital Seed Train Twins and Statistical Methods.\n", "abstract": " Model-based concepts and simulation techniques in combination with digital tools emerge as a key to explore the full potential of biopharmaceutical production processes, which contain several challenging development and process steps. One of these steps is the time-and cost-intensive cell proliferation process (also called seed train) to increase cell number from cell thawing up to production scale. Challenges like complex cell metabolism, batch-to-batch variation, variabilities in cell behavior, and influences of changes in cultivation conditions necessitate adequate digital solutions to provide information about the current and near future process state to derive correct process decisions. For this purpose digital seed train twins have proved to be efficient, which digitally display the time-dependent behavior of important process variables based on mathematical models, strategies, and adaption procedures. This chapter will outline the needs for digitalization of seed trains, the construction of a digital seed train twin, the role of parameter estimation, and different statistical methods within this context, which are applicable to several problems in the field of bioprocessing. The results of a case study are presented to illustrate a Bayesian approach for parameter estimation and prediction of an industrial cell culture seed train for seed train digitalization. This chapter outlines the needs for digitalization of cell proliferation processes (seed trains), the construction of a digital seed train twin as well as the role of parameter estimation and different statistical methods within this context, which are applicable to several problems in the field of bioprocessing.

{"title": "Improving Cell Culture Bioreactor Performance for Sensitive Cell Lines by Dynamic Membrane Aeration (DMA)\n", "abstract": " Although the importance of animal cell culture for the industrial (large scale) production of pharmaceutical products is continuously increasing, the sensibility of the cells towards their cultivation environment is still a challenging issue. In comparison to microbial cultures, cell cultures which are not protected by a cell wall are much more sensitive to shear stress and foam formation. Reactor design as well as the selection of \u201crobust\u201d cell lines is particularly important for these circumstances. Nevertheless, even \u201csensitive\u201d cell lines are selected for certain pharmaceutical processes due to various reasons. These sensitive cell lines have even higher requirements regarding their cultivation environment. Important characteristics for the corresponding reactor design are a high (volumetric) gas mass transfer coefficient, low volumetric power input, low shear stress, low susceptibility to bio-fouling, the ability to cultivate\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1898"]}
