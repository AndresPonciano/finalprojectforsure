{"title": "Learning scrum by doing real-life projects\n", "abstract": " Being Scrum the agile software development framework most commonly used in the software industry, its applicability is attracting great attention to the academia. That is why this topic is quite often included in computer science and related university programs. In this article, we present a course design of a Software Engineering course where an educational framework and an open-source agile project management tool were used to develop real-life projects by undergraduate students. During the course, continuous guidance was given by the teaching staff to facilitate the students' learning of Scrum. Results indicate that students find it easy to use the open-source tool and helpful to apply Scrum to a real-life project. However, the unavailability of the client and conflicts among the team members have negative impact on the realization of projects. The guidance given to students along the course helped identify five\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["2006"]}
{"title": "Reserved, on demand or serverless: Model-based simulations for cloud budget planning\n", "abstract": " Cloud computing providers offer a variety of pricing models, complicating the client decision, as no single model is the cheapest in all scenarios. In addition, small to medium-sized organizations frequently lack personnel that can navigate the intricacies of each pricing model, and as a result, end up opting for a sub-optimal strategy, leading to overpaying for computing resources or not being able to meet performance goals. In this paper, we: (1) present the results of a study that shows that, in Ecuador, a considerable percentage of companies choose conservative pricing strategies, (2) present a case study that shows that the conservative pricing strategy is suboptimal under certain workloads, and (3) propose a set of models, a tool and a process that can be used by tenants to properly plan and budget their cloud computing costs. Our tool is based on M (t)/M/* queuing theory models and is easy to configure and use\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["2006"]}

Microblogging platforms, such as Twitter, let citizens to engage in the political debate generating well-defined profiles in the platform. Using publicly available tweets it is possible to build a linguistic profile to compare leaders and average citizens. We describe the linguistic analysis of 330,000 tweets collected from 221 Ecuadorian tweeters classified into three different profiles: political leaders, leaders' followers, and average local users. We build a feature vector for each user's tweets using 12 psychological dimensions included in the LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry Word Count) text analysis software and compare users with different profiles using those vectors. Our findings show that the leaders group exhibits a different linguistic profile from the others two groups: around 30% of leader\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["2006"]}

This research work aims at creating the basis for the enhancement of software measurement education in universities, specifically in software engineering programs at the undergraduate level. The ultimate goal of this work is to facilitate the adoption of software measurement programs in software related organizations.  This research project tackles this issue by identifying the software measurement topics that should be prioritized for undergraduate students and developing an educational Framework on the basis of the constructivist approach and the Bloom`s taxonomy to provide guidelines to university teachers. By doing so, university teachers will be provided with tools and approaches to pursue the achievement of learning outcomes by students being introduced to software measurement tasks.  This research project required a number of investigations: a comprehensive literature review and a web survey to identify current practices in the teaching of software measurement; a Delphi study to identify priorities in software measurement education for undergraduate students; and an evaluation of the proposed educational framework by university teachers to determine the extent to which it can be adopted.  The key results are: \u2022 Experts in the field agreed in identifying five essential software measurement topics (priorities) that should be taught to undergraduate students: basic concepts of software measurement; the measurement process; software measurement techniques; software management\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["2006"]}
