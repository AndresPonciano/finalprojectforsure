{"title": "Selective iron-catalyzed deaminative hydrogenation of amides\n", "abstract": " The five-coordinate iron(II) hydride complex (iPrPNP)Fe(H)CO (iPrPNP = N[CH2CH2(PiPr2)]2) was found to selectively catalyze deaminative hydrogenation of amides to the corresponding amines and primary alcohols. It is one of the most active amide hydrogenation catalysts reported to date, with turnover numbers (TONs) in excess of 1000 observed for multiple substrates and TONs greater than 4000 obtained for activated formanilides. The amide C\u2013N cleavage reactions occur with a preference for electron-withdrawing substituents and with greater activity for formamides compared with acetamides and benzamides. Stoichiometric reactions between (iPrPNP)Fe(H)CO and formanilide afforded the new iron(II) complex (iPrPNHP)Fe(H)CO(N(Ph)HCO) resulting from N\u2013H addition across the Fe\u2013N bond. Complexes of this type were identified as the resting state during catalytic hydrogenation reactions containing\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "73\n", "authors": ["551"]}

{"title": "Search based optimization of requirements interaction management\n", "abstract": " There has been much recent interest in Search Based Optimization for Requirements Selection from the SBSE community, demonstrating how multi-objective techniques can effectively balance the competing cost and value objectives inherent in requirements selection. This problem is known as release planning (aka the `next release problem). However, little previous work has considered the problem of Requirement Interaction Management (RIM) in the solution space. Because of RIM, there are many subtle relationships between requirements, which make the problem more complex than an unconstrained feature subset selection problem. This paper introduces and evaluates archive-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, based on NSGA-II, which is capable of maintaining solution quality and diversity, while respecting the constraints imposed by RIM.", "num_citations": "50\n", "authors": ["551"]}

{"title": "Application of surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy for analyses of restricted sulfa drugs\n", "abstract": " The presence of sulfonamide residues in muscle foods is an important concern for consumers and regulatory agencies since these residues may pose potential health risks and result in an increase of drug-resistant bacteria. Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) was applied to analyze three sulfa drugs including sulfamerazine, sulfamethazine and sulfamethoxazole with concentrations ranging from 10\u00a0ng\u00a0mL\u22121 to 5\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0mL\u22121. Partial least squares regression (PLS) and principal component analysis (PCA) were used for the spectral data analyses. The three sulfa drugs could be detected at concentration levels as low as 10\u00a0ng\u00a0mL\u22121. For the quantitative analyses, the R                         2 values of actual sulfa drug concentrations versus their concentrations predicted by the PLS models ranged from 0.8149 to 0.9009.

{"title": "Synthesis and Characterization of Pincer-Molybdenum Precatalysts for CO2 Hydrogenation\n", "abstract": " A family of low-valent molybdenum complexes supported by the pincer ligand PNMeP (PNMeP = MeN(CH2CH2PPh2)2) was prepared and characterized, including (PNMeP)Mo(C2H4)2, which contains an agostic interaction between the metal and the N-methyl substituent. This \u03b2-agostic C\u2013H bond was cleaved by molybdenum and produced a cyclometalated molybdenum formate complex, (\u03ba4-PNMeP)Mo(C2H4)(\u03ba2-O2CH), upon exposure to CO2. This species serves as a promotor of CO2 hydrogenation to formate under basic conditions, a rare transformation for group VI metals. The performance of the precatalyst was enhanced with the addition of Lewis acid salts.", "num_citations": "32\n", "authors": ["551"]}
{"title": "An empirical study of cohesion and coupling: Balancing optimization and disruption\n", "abstract": " Search-based software engineering has been extensively applied to the problem of finding improved modular structures that maximize cohesion and minimize coupling. However, there has, hitherto, been no longitudinal study of developers' implementations, over a series of sequential releases. Moreover, results validating whether developers respect the fitness functions are scarce, and the potentially disruptive effect of search-based remodularization is usually overlooked. We present an empirical study of 233 sequential releases of ten different systems; the largest empirical study reported in the literature so far, and the first longitudinal study. Our results provide evidence that developers do, indeed, respect the fitness functions used to optimize cohesion/coupling (they are statistically significantly better than arbitrary choices with p \u226a 0.01), yet they also leave considerable room for further improvement (cohesion\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "30\n", "authors": ["551"]}
{"title": "Multi-objective search-based requirements selection and optimisation\n", "abstract": " Most software product developments are iterative and incremental processes that are seldom completed in a single release. It is critical but challenging to select the requirements from a large number of candidates for the achievement of overall business goal and the goals of multiple stakeholders, each of whom may have competing and often conflicting priorities.This thesis argues that search-based techniques can be applied to the optimisation problem during the requirements selection and analysis phase for release planning problem. Search-based techniques offer significant advantages; they can be used to seek robust, scalable solutions, to investigate trade-offs, to yield insight and to provide feedback explaining choices to the decision maker.", "num_citations": "30\n", "authors": ["551"]}
{"title": "App Store Mining and Analysis (Keynote)\n", "abstract": " App stores are not merely disrupting traditional software deployment practice, but also offer considerable potential benefit to scientific research. Software engineering researchers have never had available, a more rich, wide and varied source of information about software products. There is some source code availability, supporting scientific investigation as it does with more traditional open source systems. However, what is important and different about app stores, is the other data available. Researchers can access user perceptions, expressed in rating and review data. Information is also available on app popularity (typically expressed as the number or rank of downloads). For more traditional applications, this data would simply be too commercially sensitive for public release.

{"title": "Repository of publications on search-based software engineering\n", "abstract": " The test case generation is intrinsically a multi-objective problem, since the goal is covering multiple test targets (eg, branches). Existing search-based approaches either consider one target at a time or aggregate all targets into a single fitness function (whole-suite approach). Multi and many-objective optimisation algorithms (MOAs) have never been applied to this problem, because existing algorithms do not scale to the number of coverage objectives that are typically found in real-world software. In addition, the final goal for MOAs is to find alternative trade-off solutions in the objective space, while in test generation the interesting solutions are only those test cases covering one or more uncovered targets. In this paper, we present DynaMOSA (Dynamic Many-Objective Sorting Algorithm), a novel many-objective solver specifically designed to address the test case generation problem in the context of coverage testing. DynaMOSA extends our previous many-objective technique MOSA (Many-Objective Sorting Algorithm) with dynamic selection of the coverage targets based on the control dependency hierarchy. Such extension makes the approach more effective and efficient in case of limited search budget. We carried out an empirical study on 346 Java classes using three coverage criteria (ie, statement, branch, and strong mutation coverage) to assess the performance of DynaMOSA with respect to the whole-suite approach (WS), its archive-based variant (WSA) and MOSA. The results show that DynaMOSA outperforms WSA in 28% of the classes for branch coverage (+ 8% more coverage on average) and in 27% of the classes for mutation\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["551"]}
