This paper reviews the literature in order to better understand this phenomenon. As specialists in IS, strategy and organizational studies, we analyze the discourse on OT found in the strategy, organizational theory and IS literature, and identify four structuring themes: organizational inertia, process, agency and performance. We apply the coding derived from these themes to a set of 62 empirical papers and discuss the results. Ten research avenues are then identified to show that IS-enabled OT is still a new frontier for strategic information systems research.", "num_citations": "420\n", "authors": ["1927"]}

Recent research has proposed the development of a shared understanding about the role of information systems (IS) in the organization as a key endeavor in bridging the \"gap in understanding\" between CIOs and TMT members. The authors propose a variety of knowledge exchange mechanisms, as well as relational similarity as key mechanisms for the development of this shared understanding.

Causal reasoning is central to IS theorizing. This paper focuses on the concept of causal structure, defined by Markus and Robey (1988) as a theorist's assumptions about causal influences in IS phenomena, and proposes a framework of causal structure, warranted by philosophy and social theory, specialized for the needs of Information Systems scholars. The three dimensions of the framework concern the theorist's views about the reality and meaning of causation (causal ontology), about that which is changed in causation (causal trajectory), and about the role of humans and/or technology in bringing about the change (causal autonomy). On each dimension, mutually exclusive alternative positions are described, backed by authoritative warrants, and illustrated with IS\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "87\n", "authors": ["1927"]}

Furthermore, the French government and its COVID-19 council excluded relevant scientific experts in favour of quantitative modelling based on abstract partial knowledge.

Based on an econometric analysis of a survey sample of 9,721 French firms, the study finds that higher degrees of system integration entail higher degrees of cybersecurity usage. Whereas previously it was thought that systems integration reduces the number of vulnerabilities and thus the need for cybersecurity countermeasures, we find that the more the system is integrated, the greater the use of self-protective cybersecurity countermeasures. We theorize that this finding comes from the elimination of many uncontrollable vulnerabilities and the presence of fewer, but controllable, vulnerability points.

{"title": "From ideal data synchronization to hybrid forms of interconnections: architectures, processes, and data\n", "abstract": " With the emergence of new technologies, companies can organize their electronic data exchanges by implementing hybrid interorganizational information systems (IOS). This paper presents a new analytical framework by considering IOS as the product of interconnections between the parts of IS developed by connected firms to support a given interorganizational process. We focus on updating internal databases through data synchronization between a set of suppliers and a set of clients. From the literature, we built types of sending and receiving systems based on three variables; namely, shared data, structural linkages, and message interdependency. Analytically, we derived possibilities of interconnections between these sending and receiving systems with asymmetric characteristics. In a field study, we empirically investigated IOS built to support product information flows from suppliers\u2019 to retailers\u2019 internal, databases by considering how suppliers built their sending systems, how retailers built their receiving systems, and how their interconnections led to different forms of IOS. Interconnections occurring between systems with asymmetric characteristics show the existence of several hybrid forms of IOS, both in design and use. We finally explain that, even if companies can benefit from their use, hybrid forms are less efficient than are extreme forms, those that are the result of interconnections between systems with symmetric characteristics.", "num_citations": "26\n", "authors": ["1927"]}

In 2003, the analysis of 45 observations and qualitative interviews showed that the advisor maintains his free appreciation of risk. However, even if conformity does not exist, the results on the modification range show that the DSS does exert an influence on user behaviour. In addition, the interpretation and acceptance of DSS recommendation are different according to the type of portfolio managed and how the work is organised. The less the financial advisor knows the client, the greater the influence of the DSS. Recent decisions regarding the division of labour for the management of lower segments heighten the risk that DSS used without knowing the client leads to more conformity, or at least to what we conceptualise as\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "25\n", "authors": ["1927"]}

Given the particularities of our international IS discipline, different viewpoints seem to be required to develop a picture of the merits and limits of testing and replication. Hence, the authors of this paper approach the topic from different perspectives. Following the ongoing discourse in neighbouring disciplines, we start by highlighting the significance of testing, replication and negation for scientific discourse as well as for the sponsors of research initiatives. Next, we discuss types of replication research and the challenges associated with each. In the third section, challenging questions are raised in the light of the ability of IS research for self-correction. Then, we address publication issues related to types of replications that require shifting editorial behaviors. The fifth section reflects on the possible use and interpretation of replication results in the light of contingency. As a key takeaway, the paper suggests ways to identify studies worth replicating in our field and reflects on possible roles of replication and testing for future IS research.", "num_citations": "23\n", "authors": ["1927"]}

Challenging conventional wisdom for SMEs and large French firms\n", "abstract": " This paper defines cross-functionality as the awareness that organizational actors have of the coupled and integrated nature of processes across various business units, which allows employees to deliver products and services to customers. That the implementation of enterprise systems (ES) provides a more complete crossfunctional view of the firm has been taken for granted by managers and researchers alike. The cross-functional potential of enterprise resource planning (ERP) is a widely-held assumption and is one approaching conventional wisdom:\u201cBecause ERPs tear down walls within organizations, they help everyone to understand their impact on an entire operation. Ultimately, companies find their staff adopting an increasingly broad enterprise perspective rather than a departmental one\u201d(McKeen and Smith 2003, p. 143).

Based on an examination of the emerging character of a strategy, our paper suggests that a competitive advantage can only be achieved during periods when there is uncertainty concerning technology and when organizational innovation is being introduced.

This paper investigates the latter. When the environment becomes uncertain or when organizations engage in an organizational transformation, inertia or the propensity of an organization to continue its run on the same path is dangerous. Based on a survey with 108 senior managers, this paper investigates the relationships between three dynamic capabilities and Socio-Technical (ST) inertia. Results supports the general idea that the greater the capability to sense weak signals, to routinize experience of past transformations, and to reconfigure strategic resources, the lower the ST inertia. Moreover, the effect of reconfiguring is amplified with the uncertainty of the environment. Identification and understanding of particular contingencies such as firm size and industry can shed additional light on this phenomenon.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["1927"]}

Therefore, to gain more cognitive legitimacy, a clearer understanding of what we mean by \u201can information system\u201d and of the central issues driving its creation and use is needed if it is at the core of that which we study.

In this context, the research aims at distinguishing factors influencing the decision for a company to adopt electronic data exchanges with its partners, and factors influencing the decision to adopt technologies supporting these electronic data exchanges.

Our conceptual framework integrates knowledge sharing, circles of trust and knowledge maturation. We explore knowledge maturation patterns through six in-depth case studies of NPD projects using Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) technology. Our results show that knowledge maturation patterns are contextual and complex. Knowledge is shared in circles of trust, where one circle feeds into another during the maturation process. Psychological safety plays a role in the choice of circles of trust for knowledge maturation.

{"title": "Understanding the undesirable effects of using interorganizational systems and integrated information systems: Case studies among supply chain partners\n", "abstract": " Researchers and practitioners present entreprise integration to a Supply Chain as a lever for organizational performance. Yet if integration is generating performance, this cannot be done without the acceptance of new constraints due to integrated information systems implementation. We discuss the evaluation of the information systems that support the integration in order to uncover some negative consequences associated with their use. We mobilize the concept of undesirable effects and thus pose our research question: How can we identify and assess undesirable effects for users of integrated information systems or interorganizational systems? We analyze the perceptions of users on the effects of regular use of technology for their logistics activity. We adopt a qualitative methodology and select two case studies of just-in-time supply chain in the food and automotive industry. Data collection is carried out through interviews and analyzed by thematic coding. The results lead to identify twelve undesirable effects, four of which are specific to the use of interorganizational information systems. These results may extend the typology of misfits of Strong and Volkoff (2010) by entering the notion of undesirable effects to assess the negative consequences for users of the use of integrated information system.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1927"]}

Green Supply Chain Management is about integrating environmental concern into the interorganizational partnerships. Today, companies are seeking ways to meet environmental benefits through CO2 reduction when they operate their supply chain. Information sharing is key for supply chain performance but the literature on the impact of IQ in Supply Chain Management is scarce. A case study in the retail industry in France is designed in order to determine the dimensions of IQ that are critical to ensure a supply chain transformation to develop green just-in-time delivery. An in-depth qualitative analysis of interviews is conducted including the main supply chain actors (one retailer, two manufacturers, and one logistics service provider).

A second aim of this paper is to explicate and discuss the use of the crisp set version of Qualitative Comparative Analysis to explain the three components of knowledge integration. It does so in an international inter-organizational context of a moderately turbulent industry. In addition to the PLM sub-systems, this configurational analysis focuses on the level of supplier relationships as characterized by two conditions: the boundary spanner participation and supplier integration. Results show that different types of sub-systems impact various types of knowledge integration, and that the level of supplier relationship conditions is important to ensure knowledge translation and transformation.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1927"]}

A case study was conducted to identify the supply chain evolution of a major French retailer that initiated consolidation centres for shared deliveries between several small suppliers to its warehouses. This initiative aims at developing just-in-time delivery for economic benefits and the retailer explains that this evolution meets environmental benefits through CO2 reduction. However, the promised benefits for suppliers depend upon the development of information sharing and information quality and they have the choice to adopt the? green supply chain? or to continue delivering directly without using the consolidation centers. Therefore this paper presents the simulation of the research that is currently being performed in order to identify the necessary conditions for the benefits realization.

Recent publications in strategic management and accounting have offered a few non-quantitative solutions, such as better writing and reviewing norms, better theory selection, and use of descriptive quantitative and qualitative methods.

We explore knowledge maturation patterns through six in-depth case studies of NPD projects using Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) technology. Our results show that knowledge maturation patterns are contextual and complex. Knowledge is shared in circles of trust, where one circle feeds into another during the maturation process. Psychological safety plays a role in the choice of circles of trust for knowledge maturation.

This paper advances a networking perspective by probing enablers, competencies and barriers for relevant knowledge across IS and practitioner communities. We introduce five main types of knowledge that can flow in knowledge networks and apply the concept of absorptive capacity to analyze the outcomes and processes of knowledge exchanges of each knowledge type within such networks. We also review how different types of knowledge are potentially sought and absorbed by one community from another through leveraging specific constellations of knowledge networks. Given meager empirical research concerning a) how IT managers and senior IT professionals (consultants etc) source and exchange different types of knowledge in their practices, and b) the properties of this knowledge such as its volatility, accuracy, validity demands, forms of sourcing, genre or presentation, we conduct an exploratory field study on knowing and knowledge dissemination practices among high level IT professionals.

{"title": "IS career anchors, professional growth and mobility intentions: A DevOps jobs learning effect?\n", "abstract": " With the digital revolution and rapid socio-technical changes, such as the advent of DevOps teams with both development (Dev) and operations (Ops) personnel from the project start, information systems (IS) staff may have difficulties adapting, but also see new opportunities for professional mobility. Through Career Anchors theory, this embedded case study presents deep insights on professional growth expectations and mobility intentions of agile and DevOps team members. With a DevOps maturity model, we found that the more team members operate beyond agile in a DevOps mode, the more they have the ability to project themselves professionally in new jobs, with more numerous and more diverse career anchors. We interpret these findings as a DevOps jobs learning effect which may also contribute to IS function evolution. Firms may leverage this effect for their transformation, but they also have to manage it because DevOps resources and teams are respectively rare and fragile.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1927"]}

Yet, the research community is faced with the allegation that science lost its ability for self-correcting as, for instance, Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman recently warned in an open letter \u201cI see a train wreck looming\u201d. This panel intends to start that process right on our very doorstep and argues for more testing, replication and publication of failed experiments in our discipline. Picking up on recent developments in other academic disciplines, the panel drafts the implications for IS research. Based on the value of replication for scientific discourse and sponsors, the panel wants to discuss the status quo of incentives for academic research. As a key take away, the panel wants to show feasible ways for identifying replication studies in our field.

Thus having a clear conception of those concepts lying at the core of our field and which establish the legitimacy of Information Systems (IS) as an independent discipline is more important than ever before. This manuscript seeks to contribute a clearer understanding of what we mean by the central issues driving the field. But this manuscript takes a new twist by approaching this question from the point of view of a set of French IS scholars and social theorists. It advances the discourse by examining how French scholars, many of whom are not well known outside of French academic circles, may impact our reading of those issues considered to be most persistent and frequent in the IS literature.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1927"]}

Indeed they are sequentially and in extreme case simultaneously related but independent since electronic data exchanges decision rarely imposes a technological choice. In this context, the research aims at distinguishing factors influencing the decision for a company to adopt electronic data exchanges with its partners and factors influencing the decision to adopt technologies supporting these electronic data exchanges. We investigate product information exchanges in the French consumer goods and retail industry through external catalogue, internal catalogue and Extranets. Analysis of 25 case studies allows us to conclude that it is relevant to distinguish these two decisions and the factors influencing each one.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1927"]}

More precisely, this paper aims at understanding how Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) technology contributes to NPD knowledge integration in this environment. It is based on a longitudinal case study of a French industrial Group with design teams located in Europe, which had greatly increased development work with China at the time of the study. The first author participated in PLM implementations in Asia over the course of four years. Data analyses indicate a reduction of communication problems, from which we infer a positive contribution of PLM to knowledge transfer and knowledge translation. PLM reinforces the role of outsourced Chinese engineers who act as a boundary spanner with Chinese suppliers.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1927"]}

In 2003, the analysis of 45 observations and qualitative interviews, show that the advisor keeps his free appreciation of risk. However, even if there is not conformity, the results on the modification range shows that the DSS does have an influence, especially for lesser risk factors, the correlation between the risk factor and analysis time being perceptible. Moreover, the interpretation and validation of risk are different according to the type of portfolio managed and work organization. The less the financial advisor knows the client and the greater the influence of the DSS despite the apparent lack of conformity. Recent decisions regarding the division of labour for the management of lower segments reinforce the risk that DSS used without\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1927"]}

{"title": "Market dynamics and technological segmentation\n", "abstract": " The rapid development of communication systems is often linked to the expansion of the tertiary sector and to the emergence of an information based service society. However, large industrial companies have not remained untouched by the profound changes taking place due to advances in telecommunications. As large network consumers, they are progressively being drawn into playing a significant role in the structuring of the telecommunications market. Our paper is aimed at identifying and understanding the behaviour of industrial companies with regards to telecommunica-tions. Initially we will describe the structure of the industrial sector demand for telecommunications equipment and services, comparing it to those of the banking and service sectors. We will then propose a typology of companies based on an extensive set of variables to explain their communication behaviour. In fact, can we easily imagine a subsidiary of a foreign bank to be closer in terms of telecommunications networks to an automobile outlet than to a national bank? A company in the leisure industry closer to an equipment supplier than to an advertising firm? It is difficult to imagine that. Nevertheless this is what we learn from a more detailed analysis of the telecom equipment, use and spending of large firms. This typology is used to stress, at the level of the firm, the key-nature of telecommunication in a more classical sector-size approach. Finally, starting from an evaluation of companies' expectations of their needs for telecommunications services and facilities, we will deduce the potentially crucial influence of the large industrial firms for the dynamics of network supply.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1927"]}
