{"title": "Handling concept drift in a text data stream constrained by high labelling cost\n", "abstract": " In many real-world classification problems the concept being modelled is not static but rather changes over time-a situation known as concept drift. Most techniques for handling concept drift rely on the true classifications of test instances being available shortly after classification so that classifiers can be retrained to handle the drift. However, in applications where labelling instances with their true class has a high cost this is not reasonable. In this paper we present an approach for keeping a classifier up-to-date in a concept drift domain which is constrained by a high cost of labelling. We use an active learning type approach to select those examples for labelling that are most useful in handling changes in concept. We show how this approach can adequately handle concept drift in a text filtering scenario requiring just 15% of the documents to be manually categorised and labelled.", "num_citations": "62\n", "authors": ["1096"]}
{"title": "Drift detection using uncertainty distribution divergence\n", "abstract": " Data generated from naturally occurring processes tends to be non-stationary. For example, seasonal and gradual changes in climate data and sudden changes in financial data. In machine learning the degradation in classifier performance due to such changes in the data is known as concept drift and there are many approaches to detecting and handling it. Most approaches to detecting concept drift, however, make the assumption that true classes for test examples will be available at no cost shortly after classification and base the detection of concept drift on measures relying on these labels. The high labelling cost in many domains provides a strong motivation to reduce the number of labelled instances required to detect and handle concept drift. Triggered detection approaches that do not require labelled instances to detect concept drift show great promise for achieving this.

{"title": "Autopilot: simulating changing concepts in real data\n", "abstract": " An increasingly important area in supervised incremental learning is learning in the presence of changing concepts. Research into concept drift is hampered by the lack of availability of controllable \u2018real life\u2019datasets. In this paper we propose an approach for generating real life data over which we have control of the concept and can generate data exhibiting different types of concept drift. The approach uses a 3-D driving game to produce a data stream of instances describing how to drive around a track. The classification problem is learning the driving technique of the driver, which can be affected by changes in the driving environment causing changes to the concept. The paper gives illustrations of different types of concept drift and how standard concept drift handling techniques can adapt to the concept drift.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1096"]}
{"title": "Using the source engine for serious games\n", "abstract": " In the paper we describe our work in using the Source engine from the game Half Life 2 to develop a serious game-Serious Gordon. Serious Gordon is used to teach principals of food safety and food hygiene in a restaurant kitchen environment. The target users of Serious Gordon are students of catering in the DIT Faculty of Tourism and Food. The paper describes the formation of the Serious Gordon team and the development of a story for the game. It continues with a description of the features from Half Life 2 that we retained and those that we removed for the game. We then describe the process we undertook to implement the game including a description of the tools we used. We conclude with a brief evaluation of the project and present future work.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1096"]}
{"title": "Exploring the frontier of uncertainty space\n", "abstract": " We aim to investigate methods balancing exploitation with exploration in active learning to improve the performance of uncertainty sampling. Two exploration guided sampling methods are compared to uncertainty sampling on various real-life datasets from the 2010 Active Learning Challenge. Our initial experiments seems to indicate that combining exploration with uncertainty sampling improves performance on certain datasets but not all.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1096"]}
{"title": "Handling Concept Drift in the Context of Expensive Labels\n", "abstract": " Machine learning has been successfully applied to a wide range of prediction problems, yet its application to data streams can be complicated by concept drift. Existing approaches to handling concept drift are overwhelmingly reliant on the assumption that it is possible to obtain the true label of an instance shortly after classification at a negligible cost. The aim of this thesis is to examine, and attempt to address, some of the problems related to handling concept drift when the cost of obtaining labels is high. This thesis presents Decision Value Sampling (DVS), a novel concept drift handling approach which periodically chooses a small number of the most useful instances to label. The newly labelled instances are then used to re-train the classifier, an SVM with a linear kernel, to handle any change in concept that might occur. In this way, only the instances that are required to keep the classifier up-to-date are labelled. The evaluation of the system indicates that a classifier can be kept up-to-date with changes in concept while only requiring 15% of the data stream to be labelled. In a data stream with a high throughput this represents a significant reduction in the number of labels required.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1096"]}
