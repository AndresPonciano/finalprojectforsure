{"title": "MSNoise, a Python Package for Monitoring Seismic Velocity Changes Using Ambient Seismic Noise\n", "abstract": " The usage of seismic ambient noise has recently proved its efficiency in different contexts, from imaging to monitoring. The impulse response (or Green\u2019s function [GF]) between two sensors can be reconstructed from the correlation of seismic noise recorded (Campillo and Paul, 2003). This method has provided excellent results in imaging the Earth\u2019s interior, from global to regional or local scales. More recently, the method was extended to study time-dependent variations in those GF. A change in the delay times might originate from a change in the medium velocity or from a dramatic change in the position of the source or of one/many scatterers. Several studies using seismic ambient noise have shown that small perturbations within a volcanic edifice can be detected as changes in seismic-wave properties (Sens-Sch\u00f6nfelder and Wegler, 2006; Brenguier, Shapiro, et al., 2008; Duputel et al., 2009; Mordret et al\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "138\n", "authors": ["922"]}

By carefully processing broadband seismic signals, we reveal seismic signatures and characteristics of these eruptions. At both volcanoes, the phreatic eruptions are initiated by a very-long-period (VLP) seismic event located at shallow depths between 700 and 900\u00a0m below the crater region, and may be triggered by excitation of gas trapped behind a ductile magma carapace. The shallow hydrothermal systems respond in different ways. At Kawah Ijen, the stress change induced by VLPs directly triggers an eigenoscillation of the hyperacidic lake. This so-called seiche is characterized by long-lasting, long-period oscillations with frequencies governed by the dimensions of the crater lake.

Studying this problem is crucial to understand, and potentially anticipate, the generation of the sudden and dangerous explosive eruptions that frequently accompany dome extrusions. Since its awakening in 1994, Popocat\u00e9petl volcano has produced more than fifty lava domes and has been consistently among the strongest permanent emitters of volcanic gases. In this work, we have characterized the passive and explosive degassing between 2013 and 2016 at a high time resolution using an SO2 camera, to achieve a better understanding of the conduit processes. Our 4-year average SO2 flux is 45 kg/s, in line with the long-term average of the whole current eruptive period. We show that Popocat\u00e9petl volcano is essentially an open system and that passive degassing, i.e. degassing with no associated emission of lava or ash, dominates >95% of the time. This passive degassing is continuous and sustained, whether the crater contains a lava dome or not. It shows most of the time a strong periodic component, with a pseudo-period of ~5 minutes, and amplitudes of 30 to 60% of the average value. We could distinguish two types of explosions based on their SO2 flux patterns. The first type (E1) occurs in the middle of the normal passive degassing and is followed by a rapid return of the SO2 flux down to its pre-explosive level.

Grid cell intensity maps are less subjective and illustrate a more homogeneous intensity distribution than communal ZIP code intensity maps. Using grid cells for ground motion analysis offers an advanced method for exchanging transfrontier equal-area intensity data without sharing any personal information.

Only forty odd years have passed, and nothwithstanding that there is a huge quantity of existing data, it was still disturbing to find that much of the original data are missing and probably lost forever. Efforts have, therefore, been made to find additional and still unknown primary data. For the majority of the collected national data sets, a reevaluation was, then, possible. This study presents the comprehensive macroseismic data set for 14 European countries. It is, to our knowledge, one of the largest European data sets, consisting of 3423 intensity data points. The earthquake was felt from Rome to the Baltic Sea, and from Belgium to Warsaw. The maximum intensity 10 EMS-98 was reached in eight localities in Friuli (Italy). Compared to previous studies, the Imax values have changed from country to country, in some cases being lowered due to methodological differences, but in the case of three among the most hit countries, Imax is now higher than in the previous studies, mainly due to the new data.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["922"]}
{"title": "Temporal changes of seismic velocity caused by volcanic activity at Mt. Etna revealed by the autocorrelation of ambient seismic noise\n", "abstract": " On active volcanoes, ambient noise-based seismic interferometry, able to detect very slight variations in seismic velocity associated with magma transport towards the surface, can be a very useful monitoring tool. In this work, we performed the autocorrelation of ambient seismic noise recorded at Mt. Etna volcano, by three stations located close to the active summit craters, during April 2013 - October 2014. Such an interval was chosen because of the number and variety of eruptions. The method implemented to perform autocorrelation was the phase cross-correlation, which does not require normalization of the signals. The detected seismic velocity variations were very consistent for all three stations throughout the study period, mainly ranging between 0.3 and -0.2%, and were time-related to both sequences of paroxysmal eruptions and more effusive activities. In particular, we observed seismic velocity decreases accompanying paroxysmal eruptions, suggesting an intense pressurization within the plumbing system, which created an area of extensional strain with crack openings. It is worth noting that classical cross-station approach failed to detect seismic velocity changes related to volcano activity. In addition, seismic velocity variations over time were integrated with ground deformation data recorded by GPS stations and volcanic tremor centroid locations. Finally, we showed that, although the investigated frequency band (1-2 Hz) contains most of the volcanic tremor energy, our results did not indicate a particular contamination of seismic velocity variation measurements by variations of tremor sources.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["922"]}

The seismic sensors \u2013 some positioned at the surface and others in boreholes \u2013 are generally noisier during the day than during nighttime. For most stations, weekdays are noisier than weekends, proving human activity contributes to recordings of seismic noise, even on seismographs as deep as 384\u2009m below the surface and as far as 15\u2009km from Auckland's Central Business District. Lockdown measures in New Zealand to battle the spread of COVID-19 allow us to separate sources of seismic energy and evaluate both the quality of the monitoring network and the level of local seismicity.

{"title": "Wind-induced seismic noise at the Princess Elisabeth Antarctica Station\n", "abstract": " Icequakes are the result of processes occurring within the ice mass or between the ice and its environment. Studying icequakes provides a unique view on ice dynamics, specifically on the basal conditions. Changes in conditions due to environmental or climate changes are reflected in icequakes. Counting and characterizing icequakes is thus essential to monitor them. Most of the icequakes recorded by the seismic station at the Belgian Princess Elisabeth Antarctica Station (PE) have small amplitudes corresponding to maximal displacements of a few nanometres. Their detection threshold is highly variable because of the rapid and strong changes in the local seismic noise level. Therefore, we evaluated the influence of katabatic winds on the noise measured by the well-protected PE surface seismometer. Our purpose is to identify whether the lack of icequake detection during some periods could be associated with variations in the processes generating them or simply with a stronger seismic noise linked to stronger wind conditions. We observed that the wind mainly influences seismic noise at frequencies greater than 1\u2009Hz. The seismic noise power exhibits a bilinear correlation with the wind velocity, with two different slopes at a wind velocity lower and greater than 6\u2009m\u2009s\u22121 and with, for example at a period of 0.26\u2009s, a respective variation of 0.4\u2009dB\u2009(m\u2009\u22121\u2009s) and 1.4\u2009dB\u2009(m\u2009\u22121\u2009s).

In contrast, the presence of intact speleothems permits estimating an upper limit of the level of horizontal ground motions of past seismicity in the area. The natural frequencies of speleothems are fundamental parameters for their response to earthquakes. This study proposes a new method of in situ characterization of these natural frequencies. Tested in the Han-sur-Lesse cave (Belgian Ardennes), the method is based on recording the ambient seismic noise using three-component sensors on a stalagmite and a 3D laser scan of its shape. The ambient seismic noise records allow a precise determination of the eigenfrequencies of the stalagmite. In addition, numerical models based on the 3D scan show good consistency between measured and modeled data. The joint analysis of these two techniques concludes that the shape of the stalagmite (elliptical cross-section and shape irregularities) influence the eigenfrequencies and polarization of the modes while also causing a near-orthogonal split of natural frequencies. The motions recorded on the stalagmite show significant amplification compared to those recorded at the free surface outside the cave, which has a strong impact on seismic hazard assessment based on speleothems.

In this work, we use seismic data recorded from a dense sensor array at the Groningen gas field in northern Holland and show how direct P-waves can be extracted from the ambient noise cross correlations and then used to monitor seismic velocity variations over time. This approach has advantages over the use of coda wave interferometry due to the ability to localise such changes in the subsurface.

{"title": "How well does known seismicity between the Lower Rhine Graben and southern North Sea reflect future earthquake activity?\n", "abstract": " Since the 14th century, moderate seismic activity with 14 earthquakes of magnitude MW\u22655.0 occurred in Western Europe in a region extending from the Lower Rhine Graben (LRG) to the southern North Sea. In this paper, we investigate how well this seismic activity could reflect that of the future. The observed earthquake activity in the LRG is continuous and concentrates on the Quaternary normal faults delimiting the LRG, which are also the source of large surface rupturing Holocene and Late Pleistocene earthquakes. The estimated magnitudes of these past earthquakes range from 6.3\u00b10.3 to 7.0\u00b10.3 while their average recurrence on individual faults varies from ten thousand to a few ten thousand years, which makes foreseeing future activity over the long-term possible. Three of the largest historical earthquakes with MW\u22655.5 occurred outside the LRG. Late Quaternary activity along the fault zones suspected to be the source of two of these earthquakes, i.e. the 1580 Strait of Dover and 1692 northern Belgian Ardennes earthquakes, is very elusive if it exists. Hence, similar earthquakes would be very infrequent at these locations suggesting that the seismicity outside of the LRG would be episodic and clustered on some faults during periods of a few hundreds of years interrupted by long periods of inactivity typically lasting for some tens to hundreds of thousand years. Seismic moment release estimation and its comparison between recent geological and historical seismicity periods lead us to suggest that the high seismicity level observed between AD 1350 and AD 1700 west of the LRG would be uncommon.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["922"]}
