{"title": "Spectral analysis and optimization of the condition number problem\n", "abstract": " Spectral analysis systems using gamma radiation to determine the percentage fraction of several compounds in a sample need several stages. The conditioning number of covariance matrices associated with the least-squares system needs to be very close to one so that the determined values are as close as possible to the actual values. Scientific evidence gives us reason to believe that these matrices make it possible to obtain fractions of compounds in the sample close to the true values. This work focuses on the use of the metaheuristic Greedy Randomized Adaptation Search Procedure (GRASP) to estimate percent counts of constituents of a compound represented by prompt gamma ray spectra, based on the minimization of the condition number of the covariance matrix derived from the underlying linear system. For this purpose, steps of GRASP were modified: Algorithms are used for building a solution and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1084"]}
