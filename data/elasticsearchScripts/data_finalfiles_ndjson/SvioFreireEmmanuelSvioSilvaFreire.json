{"title": "MAS-ML 2.0: Supporting the modelling of multi-agent systems with different agent architectures\n", "abstract": " Multi-agent systems (MAS) involve a wide variety of agents that interact with each other to achieve their goals. Usually each agent has a particular internal architecture defining its main structure that gives support to the interaction among the entities of MAS. Many modelling languages have been proposed in recent years to represent the internal architectures of such agents, for instance the UML profiles. In particular, we highlight MAS-ML, an MAS modelling language that performs a conservative extension of UML while incorporating agent-related concepts to represent proactive agents. However, such languages fail to support the modelling of the heterogeneous architectures that can be used to develop the agents of an MAS. Even worse, little has been done to provide tools to help the systematic design of agents. This paper, therefore, aims to extend the MAS-ML metamodel and evolve its tool to support the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "36\n", "authors": ["1334"]}
{"title": "NorMAS-ML: Supporting the Modeling of Normative Multi-agent Systems\n", "abstract": " Context: A normative multi-agent system (NMAS) is composed of agents that their behavior is regulated by norms. The modeling of those elements (agents and norms) together at design time can be a good way for a complete understanding of their structure and behavior. Multi-agent system modeling language (MAS-ML) supports the representation of NMAS entities, but the support for concepts related to norms is somewhat limited. MAS-ML is founded in taming agents and objects (TAO) framework and has a support tool called the MAS-ML tool. Goal: The present work aims to present a UML-based modeling language called normative multi-agent system (NorMAS-ML) able to model the MAS main entities along with the static normative elements. Method: We extend the TAO adding normative concepts and spread out those concepts in two syntaxes of MAS-ML. Either abstract, adding or updating metaclasses and stereotypes or concrete, defining new graphic elements for representing the elements defined in the abstract syntax. Besides, we evolve the MAS-ML tool, considering the extension of MAS-ML by the model-driven approach. Results: NorMAS-ML, the new version of MAS-ML, allows a complete view of NMAS entities and has a support tool called NorMAS-ML tool. Beyond the definition of NorMAS-ML and its tool, we generate a new static diagram called \u201cnorm diagram\u201d supported by the NorMAS-ML tool. In order to illustrate the syntax of NorMAS-ML, the entities of a conference management system and its norms are modeled jointly. Conclusion: NorMAS-ML can help software designers (i) to understand the properties and behavior of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["1334"]}

When these guidelines are mapping in a CASE tool, they can support the creation of models following the UML syntax. Thus, this article aimed to verify the guidelines addressed by the open-source CASE tools that allow the creation of the five most used UML diagrams by software engineers. Therefore, thirteen tools were analyzed: ArgoUML, StarUML, UMLet, DiaUML, BOUML, Violet, UML Designer, Modelio, NClass, Plantuml, Umbrello, Open ModelSphere, and Papyrus. As results, it was found that StarUML and UML Designer attended the highest number of good practices.

However, these studies have included only practitioners with a sound understanding of TD, which might incur biases in their findings. One way to reduce this bias is to consider Q&A platforms, such as Stack Overflow (SO), because of containing practitioners with different roles and levels of TD knowledge. Therefore, the discussions on SO can broaden the perception of the state of practice on TD in the industry. Goal: To investigate how TD concepts have been discussed by SO's practitioners. Method: First, we employed data mining techniques to identify TD-related discussions on SO. Next, based on significance and popularity metrics, we considered 195 discussions to be further investigated.
