{"title": "Software reuse: architecture, process and organization for business success\n", "abstract": " Object technology is believed to be crucial in achieving the long sought-after goal of widespread reuse. This goal is the most frequently stated reason for adopting OT. Unfortunately, many people naively equate reuse with objects, expecting it to \u201cautomatically\u201d ensure reuse, but often do not get much reuse. Based on my experience with reuse at HP, Objectory and Rational, and with many customers, I know that without extensive changes to support component-based development and systematic reuse, OT as used today will not succeed in giving users reuse. Without an explicit reuse agenda, and a systematic approach to the design and use of reusable components and frameworks, 00 reuse will not succeed. In almost all cases of successful reuse, architecture, a dedicated component development and support group, management support, and a stable domain were the keys to success. These largely non-technical issues seem to be more important to successful reuse than the specific language or design chosen.In this tutorial I address this architecture/process/organization question systematically. I describe an exciting and coherent approach, which applies Object-Oriented Business Engineering concepts of BPR to restructure a software development organization to offer reuse at a large scale. This is outlined as a generic and customizable \u201cReuse Business\u201d framework. Since the transition to a Reuse Business is a complex and risky endeavor, it is important to do it systematically. The approach therefore combines the techniques of BPR, change management and incremental reuse adoption.", "num_citations": "1933\n", "authors": ["2182"]}

These new classes of applications demand flexible, intelligent solutions. Distributed software agents offer great promise, building on increasingly pervasive message-based middleware and component technology, Java, the Extensible Markup Language (XML), and the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Agents are specialized kinds of components, offering greater flexibility than traditional components. As will be explained, agents use dynamically adaptable rich message-based interaction, and flexible knowledge-based techniques to make it much easier to build and evolve systems as requirement and technologies change. At HP Laboratories, our E-commerce research focuses on simulation, agent communication, mobile appliances and personal agents, and multi-agent systems (Griss, 2000b; Chen, 1999). We are interested in how agents are defined and constructed, how they communicate, and how collaborations between groups of agents can be established and controlled. We combine agents and workflow to provide significant benefits beyond those traditionally associated with components and scripting. There are many kinds of software agents, with differing characteristics such as mobility, autonomy, collaboration, persistence and intelligence. This chapter surveys some of these agent capabilities.

Without carefully architecting the systems, components, organizations and processes for reuse, object reuse will not succeed. Experience with software reuse practice and adoption experience at HP and Ericsson led us to a systematic approach to component based software engineering, based on object-oriented business and system modeling. This article explains how higher-level UML constructs support architected reuse, and describes a systematic process, leading from the business processes of an enterprise, through the system architecture for a family of applications that support these business processes, to the design and use of highly reusable component systems.", "num_citations": "30\n", "authors": ["2182"]}
{"title": "An Agent-Mediated E-Commerce Environment for the Mobile Shopper\n", "abstract": " Agents and mobile appliances offer the promise to change the way people purchase products by connecting the physical presence of stores with their Internet representation and delegating consumer tasks to intelligent pieces of autonomous software. The archetypical example is the shopping mall of the future; shoppers use personal digital assistants (PDA) to interact with store services while in the mall, on the way to the store, or in the store itself. Mall-wide services, such as directories and locators are also available through the PDA. Intelligent agents represent both shoppers and the store to negotiate for desired products based on shopper preferences. A lightweight version of this scenario was implemented with a multi-agent system framework (Zeus), Jornadas, CoolTown infrared beacons, and additional support software. Experience suggests that while the scenario is compelling, current agent building tools are insufficient for rapidly prototyping multi-agent societies and a more sophisticated means of staying connected to the virtual world is needed.", "num_citations": "29\n", "authors": ["2182"]}

This motivated a substantial extension to the JADE agent behavior model, which we call\" HP SmartAgent.\" Previous experience with the ZEUS and JADE agent toolkits highlighted the need for more flexibility and precision in programming agent behavior and managing conversations. For example, the JADE infrastructure routes ACL messages in round-robin fashion to interested behavior \u201cthreads,\u201d making it hard to control ordering; reuse of behavior subclasses is difficult; and, support for default and exceptional behavior is inadequate. SmartAgent extends JADE behaviors with uniform message and system events, a multi-level tree of dispatchers that match and route events, and a hierarchical state machine that is based on the UML statechart model. Adherence to the UML helps bridge object-oriented to agent-oriented programming using an industry familiar modeling language and tools. Combining events, dispatcher tree and hierarchical state machines simplifies programming of default and context dependent behavior. This hypothesis was confirmed in a meeting scheduler prototype where code previously written using pure JADE was refactored using SmartAgent.", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["2182"]}

Different technologies provide a varying mix of resolution, accuracy, stability and challenges. In this paper we report on our experience using an existing Wi-Fi infrastructure without specialized hardware added to support location tracking. There are several approaches to track the location of Wi-Fi enabled devices within a building such as signal propagation models and signature matching. We found signature matching most effective in our environment. Signature matching is accomplished by storing Wi-Fi signatures (signal strengths observed for several detectable access points) for each room and comparing the current signature on the device to stored signatures to find the closest match. In this paper we explain experiments we conducted to explore and optimize Wi-Fi location tracking in one building. While we had hoped for more accurate positioning, we found that only room-level granularity was consistently and reliably achieved. The accuracy of Wi-Fi location tracking is improved as more signature points are stored, but is significantly reduced by the presence of people moving in the area. It also appears that strategically placed access points within a building can contribute to optimum room-level disambiguation of location. Use of a histogram of signal strengths for signatures at a single location may offer a good compromise between a single average and storing a large number of signatures needed for improved accuracy.", "num_citations": "23\n", "authors": ["2182"]}

There are three important benefits that e-services bring to enterprises more automation, more federation, and more dynamism. By allowing applications to seamlessly interact with other applications within and outside enterprise boundaries, e-services reduce the amount of human interaction needed to exchange or transfer information, thus enabling an extra degree of automation. For example, intelligent software agents wrapped as e-services can be used to automate the negotiation of services between businesses or in triggering the use of other e-services [2]. Secondly, as service providers focus on creating and offering value-added services, they are more inclined to outsource non-strategic parts of their businesses to external service providers [3]. Enabling the development of new services by composing existing services is at the heart of e-services. This allows complex business services to be federated into smaller sub-services across several enterprises. Finally, the extra automation and federation make eservices more dynamic. Instead of statically binding a set of services to each other, one can dynamically discover new e-services with the right set of features (through broker agents, for example) and bind to them at run-time [4].There are two key players in the e-services market-the service providers, who create and offer new eservices, and the service consumers, who utilize and consume existing e-services (possibly to create other new ones).

In this project, we want to leverage existing Wi-Fi access points (AP) and seek efficient approaches to gain usefully high room-level accuracy of the indoor location prediction of a mobile user. The Redpin algorithm, in particular, matches the Wi-Fi signal received with the signals in the training data and uses the position of the closest training data as the user's current location. However, in a congested Wi-Fi environment where many APs exist, the standard Redpin algorithm can become confused because of the unstable radio signals received from too many APs. In this paper, we propose several enhanced indoor-locationing algorithms for the congested Wi-Fi environment. Different statistical learning algorithms are compared and empirical results show that: using more neighbors gives better results than using the 1-best neighbor; weighting APs with the correlation between the AP visibility and the location is better than the equally weighted AP combination, and automatic filtering noisy APs increases the overall detection accuracy.

These benefits are an integration of message handling, timeouts, exceptions and the use of hierarchy and common action factoring to reduce the complexity of behaviour construction, while ultimately improving system scalability. In that work we engineered a consistent, largely self-contained component, with several key properties, but relatively incomplete integration with other JADE behaviour mechanisms.Since then, we have developed a new Hierarchical State Machine (HSM) model that shares many of the same goals of reducing the complexity of developing protocols and behaviours, but is a vastly improved companion to JADE. It leverages the newer JADE Composite Behaviour and offers substantial improvements over the JADE FSM. Furthermore, we describe a new Java based graphical tool that facilitates designing, visualizing, and reverse engineering of HSMs. Finally, we describe one of several systems that have been built using HSM.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["2182"]}

By optimally ordering the equations (optimal pivoting algorithms), and decomposing the intermediate expressions, so as to share common sub-expressions (\u201chash coded CONS\u201d), a considerable saving in storage is achieved. By suitably renaming frequently used common sub-expressions, using the table built up above, and outputting these first, followed by the more complex expressions, a simplification in the output occurs.

{"title": "Latent Topic Analysis for Predicting Group Purchasing Behavior on the Social Web.\n", "abstract": " Group-deal websites, where customers purchase products or services in groups, are an interesting phenomenon on the Web. Each purchase is kicked off by a group initiator, and other customers can join in. Customers form communities with people with similar interests and preferences (as in a social network), and this drives bulk purchasing (similar to online stores, but in larger quantities per order, thus customers get a better deal). In this work, we aim to better understand what factors influence customers\u2019 purchasing behavior for such social group-deal websites. We propose two probabilistic graphical models, ie, a product-centric inference model (PCIM) and a group-initiator-centric inference model (GICIM), based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Instead of merely using customers\u2019 own purchase history to predict purchasing decisions, these two models include other social factors. Using a lift curve analysis, we show that by including social factors in the inference models, PCIM achieves 35% of the target customers within 5% of the total number of customers while GICIM is able to reach 85% of the target customers. Both PCIM and GICIM outperform random guessing and models that do not take social factors into account.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["2182"]}

They provide a mechanism to enforce rules that govern the decisions and actions made based on high-level requirements and goals (eg, service level agreements/objectives) and the current conditions of the systems and its environment (the context). There are several types of policies within a management system, including discovery policies, deployment policies, monitoring policies, security policies, and control policies. In this paper, we present a generic policy representation and execution mechanism that accommodates different types of management policies. We have developed a generic policy execution environment as part of an ongoing effort to provide an integrated management solution for application and service management. Our management solution is model-based, policy-driven, and agent-oriented, where a collection of autonomous management agents (AMC) are deployed to managed nodes and their role is determined by a set of policies that govern their behavior. In such environments, a policy specification and deployment framework is essential to author and deploy the required policies and to execute these policies at the designated managed node. A precise notation and representation are needed along with an interpreter to allow the specification, deployment and execution of policies. The main objective of this work is to define a uniform model and semantics for policies, and to design and implement a policy manager, which evaluates and executes policies of different types. The idea is to be able to construct several types of policies using a set of basic constructs\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["2182"]}

A new generation of web-based 3-tier applications has transpired to provide a mechanism for creating new services and transforming old ones to be delivered over the Internet. Service management is the discipline of monitoring the health of the service and controlling its behavior to optimize its usage and maintaining it in a desired state. It also has to deal with all the issues of network [1][2], system [3], and application management [4][5], while raising the level of abstraction to focus on handling the distributed service components and their interplay. Traditionally, management solutions have been either retrofitted or tightly coupled with the managed systems.

Agents with predefined functions but without the ability to modify behavior dynamically may be too limited for mediating E-Commerce applications properly, since they cannot switch roles or adjust their behavior to participate in dynamically formed partnerships. We have developed a Java based dynamic agent infrastructure for E-Commerce automation, which supports dynamic behavior modification of agents, a significant difference from other agent platforms. Supported by dynamic agents, mechanisms have been developed for plugging in workflow and multi-agent cooperation, and for supporting dynamic workflow service provisioning that allows workflow services to be constructed on the fly. XML is chosen as our agent communication message format. Since different problem domains have different ontology, we allow agents to communicate with domain specific performatives and act using corresponding interpreters. Dynamic agents can carry, switch and exchange interpreters. Our approach enables document-driven agent cooperation and DTD based program generation, and further, allows agents to exchange and share ontology for multiple or even dynamic domains. In this way, the cooperation of dynamic agents supports plug-and-play commerce, mediating businesses that are built on one another's services. A prototype has been developed at HP Labs.

The advantages are numerous and compelling.Cell phones and PDAs are less expensive than PCs. Many students may already have one. The devices support load-and-go course material that students can access anytime and anywhere, including short breaks. With network connectivity, students can use them to collaborate in groups. As a target platform for applications, students can show their work to friends and family, and can use the applications they create in their daily lives. Finally, with so much of our software being developed in far-away places, cell phones present unique economic opportunities for local content and micro-market applications, especially in developing countries.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2182"]}
{"title": "Web-Based Object Inspection\n", "abstract": " To facilitate a natural web presence for selected objects we have combined a lightweight HTTP server, a generic reflection-based object inspector, and a suite of extensible presentation adapters. For many Java objects, under application control, there exists the need to view and possibly change their attributes at run time. An object\u2019s attributes are traditionally made available via a collection of public get and set methods. Using Java\u2019s reflection technology it is a simple process to discover these getters and setters. Combining this with a very lightweight HTTP server, we have demonstrated the ability to view and control virtually any run-time object using a standard browser, without the need to add any specialized code to the object. Given the results of an object\u2019s inspection, a customized HTML document is prepared for presentation by a presentation object, thereby affording extreme flexibility and customization in what is shown in the browser window. There exists a presentation adapter class designed to both provide the default presentation as well as enable simple variants to extend it. This facilitates powerful presentation control and information filtering with very small amounts of code. This technology lays the foundation for better monitoring, configuration, or control tools. It also provides an easy way to experiment with web-based user interfaces to objects, applications, agents, personal assistants and databases of all kinds early in development.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2182"]}

There is of course much more we can do, but still, far too few software developing organizations see reuse or CBSE as the solution to the problems they have, nor do they practice component reuse systematically. Far too few schools teach much about reuse and components. A CBSE handbook, summarizing industry best practice and state-of-the-art, could be an extremely useful vehicle for moving us forward.However, experience with such handbooks in the past suggests that we should think very carefully about who the audience (s) for the handbook are, how this handbook should be used, and how it should consequently be structured.
