{"title": "Foundational issues in artificial intelligence and cognitive science: Impasse and solution\n", "abstract": " The book focuses on a conceptual flaw in contemporary artificial intelligence and cognitive science. Many people have discovered diverse manifestations and facets of this flaw, but the central conceptual impasse is at best only partially perceived. Its consequences, nevertheless, visit themselves as distortions and failures of multiple research projects-and make impossible the ultimate aspirations of the fields. The impasse concerns a presupposition concerning the nature of representation-that all representation has the nature of encodings: encodingism. Encodings certainly exist, but encodingism is at root logically incoherent; any programmatic research predicted on it is doomed too distortion and ultimate failure. The impasse and its consequences-and steps away from that impasse-are explored in a large number of projects and approaches. These include SOAR, CYC, PDP, situated cognition, subsumption architecture robotics, and the frame problems-a general survey of the current research in AI and Cognitive Science emerges. Interactivism, an alternative model of representation, is proposed and examined.", "num_citations": "658\n", "authors": ["1176"]}

This growth has been achieved without any centralized organization or governing body (King, 1997). The ubiquity of Usenet, and the fact that it supports conversations between hundreds or even thousands of participants, provides the opportunity to study what we term mass interaction. However, we currently lack basic data about Usenet interactions.

Emoji also render differently on different viewing platforms (eg, Apple\u2019s iPhone vs. Google\u2019s Nexus phone), potentially leading to communication errors. We explore whether emoji renderings or differences across platforms give rise to diverse interpretations of emoji. Through an online survey, we solicit people\u2019s interpretations of a sample of the most popular emoji characters, each rendered for multiple platforms. Both in terms of sentiment and semantics, we analyze the variance in interpretation of the emoji, quantifying which emoji are most (and least) likely to be misinterpreted. In cases in which participants rated the same emoji rendering, they disagreed on whether the sentiment was positive, neutral, or negative 25% of the time. When considering renderings across platforms, these disagreements only increase. Overall, we find significant potential for miscommunication, both for individual emoji renderings and for different emoji renderings across platforms.", "num_citations": "382\n", "authors": ["1176"]}

We report here on an experiment that investigated the types of descriptions people naturally produce for places, the extent to which they tailor descriptions for different audiences, and the factors they consider in deciding how to tailor their descriptions. We identified a number of common types of place descriptions and a few common factors (purpose, knows me, knows area, privacy) that influenced what description a person chose. These results show that social applications should make the audience for place descriptions clear, and that systems should allow multiple descriptions for the same place, including making it possible for users to describe their location in different ways to different people.", "num_citations": "26\n", "authors": ["1176"]}

Although several Web-based interventions have been developed to address sexual risk taking among young people, no evaluated interventions have attempted to foster behavior change through moderated interaction among a virtual network of adolescents (who remain anonymous to one another) and health professionals.Objective: The objective was to conduct a summative process evaluation of TeensTalkHealth, an interactive sexual health website designed to promote condom use and other healthy decision making in the context of romantic and sexual relationships.Methods: Evaluation data were obtained from 147 adolescents who participated in a feasibility and acceptability study. Video vignettes, teen-friendly articles, and other content served as conversation catalysts between adolescents and health educators on message boards.Results: Adolescents\u2019 perceptions that the website encouraged condom use across a variety of relationship situations were very high. Almost 60%(54/92, 59%) of intervention participants completed two-thirds or more of requested tasks across the 4-month intervention.

{"title": "Measuring the impact of personalization and recommendation on user behaviour\n", "abstract": " In recent years, several methods for generating and presenting personalized information have been developed. They are aimed at taming the information overload caused by the vast range of continuously growing content available on the World Wide Web. Examples include adaptive hypertext, which adapts the user interface to the users interests and needs (eg, in mobile portals), and recommender systems that try to predict what items, eg, news, movies or travels, are relevant for the user. Recommender systems use various AI and IR techniques to build their predictions, and they typically interact with the user for presenting and revising their recommendations. Many of these techniques and systems have made their way from research into commercial applications and are now widely used in major eCommerce portals. At the same time, new techniques are being proposed, for improving the recommendation effectiveness or for offering new ways for users to participate, as in social networks on Web 2.0 platforms. The assessment of the benefits, for the end users and the service providers, brought by the scientific and technological development of the personalization techniques is obviously an important issue. In fact, choosing the right evaluation method for personalized web applications, identifying the influential success factors behind different techniques or interpreting results coming from online experiments remain largely open research issues.

Such models use conceptual categories arranged in a taxonomy to classify unstructured user text data. In many contexts, useful taxonomies can be defined via the incorporation of qualitative findings, a mixed-methods approach that offers the ability to create qualitatively-informed user models. But operationalizing taxonomies from the themes described in qualitative work is non-trivial and has received little explicit focus. We propose a process and explore challenges bridging qualitative themes to user models, for both operationalization of themes to taxonomies and the use of these taxonomies in constructing classification models. For classification of new data, we compare common keyword-based approaches to machine learning models. We demonstrate our process through an example in the health domain, constructing two user models tracing cancer patient experience over time in an online health community.

We propose that this goal is best served not by the classical method where users begin by expressing preferences for individual items-this process is an inefficient way to convert a user's effort into improved personalization. Rather, we propose that new users can begin by expressing their preferences for groups of items. We test this idea by designing and evaluating an interactive process where users express preferences across groups of items that are automatically generated by clustering algorithms. We contribute a strategy for recommending items based on these preferences that is generalizable to any collaborative filtering-based system. We evaluate our process with both offline simulation methods and an online user experiment. We find that, as compared with a baseline rate-15-items interface,(a) users are able to complete the preference elicitation process in less than half the time, and (b) users are more satisfied with the resulting recommended items.

GUIs aren't ideal when a person's visual attention is elsewhere, e.g., scanning for landmarks, assessing safety, etc. And they don't work at all for blind people, who particularly need navigation assistance. Our work responds to this challenge. We investigate the use of two non-visual techniques for delivering navigation information, speech and sonification [[3], . We conducted an experiment to compare user performance with and preference for the two techniques, in both single task (navigate to a target) and dual task (navigate to a target and respond to an auditory stimulus) conditions. Users performed better with and preferred sonification in both conditions. We discuss the implications of these results for the design of navigation aids.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1176"]}

In response to this problem, and informed by our field studies, we created ContactMap, a system that makes people the primary unit of interaction. ContactMap provides a structured visual representation of the important people in the user\u2019s social network; this representation directly supports social reminding and social data mining. We conducted an empirical evaluation of ContactMap, comparing it with traditional email systems on tasks motivated by our fieldwork. Users performed better with ContactMap than their usual email system, and they strongly preferred ContactMap for these tasks. Analysis suggests that ContactMap\u2019s visual interface supports rapid scanning, allowing users to quickly identify relevant contacts and information.

{"title": "More efficient tagging systems with tag seeding\n", "abstract": " Tags are a useful mechanism for users to find, organize, and understand items on a web site. A tagging system evolves to reflect a user community\u2019s understanding of an information space. However, the evolution can be problematic: specifically, the ratio of tags to items can decrease over time, to the extent that tags no longer effectively discriminate among items. The primary reason is over application of existing popular tags to most of the items. This makes it difficult for a user to search and navigate using specific tags. We address this problem of disproportionate application of existing popular tags by eliciting applications of those tags that are under applied but highly relevant. In this paper, we introduce two metrics to identify such under applied relevant tags from the system. We then design a controlled study to elicit more applications of these tags, to show how the declining discriminating power of tags is counteracted by interventions in tag applications using these carefully chosen under applied tags, namely seeded tags. We found that users were able to apply these underutilized tags, with the result that about eleven months of lost navigational and search efficiency of the tagging system was attained back. We also monitored subsequent usage of these tags in the system and found that the seeded tags does attract more users in navigation (such as clicks and searches) than before our intervention, suggesting that tag seeding has a persistent effect over the system.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1176"]}
