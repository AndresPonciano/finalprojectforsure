Retrieval and extraction of the information is essential works and importance in semantic web areas. Many of these requirements will be depend on the storage efficiency and unstructured data analysis. Merrill Lynch recently estimated that more than 80% of all potentially useful business information is unstructured data. The large number and complexity of unstructured data opens up many new possibilities for the analyst. We analyze both structured and unstructured data individually and collectively. Text mining and natural language processing are two techniques with their methods for knowledge discovery form textual context in documents. In this study, text mining and natural language techniques will be illustrated.

{"title": "Comparison and evaluation of data mining techniques with algorithmic models in software cost estimation\n", "abstract": " Software Cost Estimation (SCE) is one of important topics in producing software in recent decades. Real estimation requires cost and effort factors in producing software by using of algorithmic or Artificial Intelligent (AI) techniques. Boehm developed the Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO) that is one of the algorithmic SCE models. Also, these models contain three increasingly basic, intermediate and detailed forms, i.e. basic COCOMO is suitable for quick, early, rough order of among the estimates of required effort in producing software, but its accuracy is limited due to its loss of factors to account for difference between cost drivers. Intermediate COCOMO assumes these project attributes into account. In addition detailed COCOMO accounts for individual project phases used. The COCOMO algorithmic techniques families have used since 1981. In recent years, some techniques emerged by using intelligent\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "83\n", "authors": ["422"]}

{"title": "A survey of data mining techniques in software cost estimation\n", "abstract": " Software Cost Estimation (SCE) is one of complex problems in software engineering area. So, a lot of attention has been allocated to solving this problem. Thus the correct estimate of the cost and effort required for software companies and company executives and companies is very significant. In required effort prediction, estimated size and cost of the project with high accuracy is still vast challenge for projects masters. In 1981, had been developed algorithmic models which called Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO) by Boehm. These models were used for required effort prediction. Since, COCOMO 81 is not suitable model for responding new requirements in recent years, so COCOMO II model in 2000 published. COCOMO II is most transparent model among algorithmic models (COCOMO family) for estimates the cost of software. Today\u2019s, there are very smart methods more efficient and effective algorithmic COCOMO methods, so many research and review the data mining techniques to estimate the true cost of software is done. This paper a survey of the literature of application of data mining techniques in SCE collected form software databases as well as international conferences and journals. Data mining techniques of expert systems were selected according to a set of criteria of work relevancy their internal architecture techniques were reviewed. The techniques are Fuzzy Decision Trees (FDTs), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Bayesian Networks (BN) classifiers and etc. Our work addresses the issue of software effort prediction via these methods using historical project data samples.

In required effort prediction, estimated time of delivery and cost of the project with high accuracy is still vast challenge for projects masters. For many years, algorithmic models like Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO) families were used for required effort prediction. Nowadays, intelligent methods have many applications in SCE. In this study, we firstly give introduction to software cost estimation (SCE) and requirements. Then, we proposed a new intelligent approach by means of additive regression model for classifying the training and testing instances on NASA projects. The results show that our proposed system is more effective. Performance is evaluated by comparing the COCOMO and additive regression based classifier results.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["422"]}

{"title": "New Approach with Hybrid of Artificial Neural Network and Ant Colony Optimization in Software Cost Estimation\n", "abstract": " Nowadays, software cost estimation (SCE) with machine learning techniques are more performance than other traditional techniques which were based on algorithmic techniques. In this paper, we present a new hybrid model of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network (ANN) and ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm for high accuracy in SCE called Multilayer Perceptron Ant Colony Optimization (MLPACO). Current research uses some of features for increasing accuracy of estimation among of the existing parameters has been considered for effort estimation in software projects, and then these selected features will be filtered by ACO algorithm in order to reach highest accuracy in estimation and optimization of MLP ANN method. The results show that this novel approach with high accuracy for more than 80% cases is better than algorithmic constructive cost model (COCOMO) in the majority cases. Also, the results of proposed algorithm show that mean magnitude of relative error (MMRE) in the proposed algorithm is lower than COCOMO model.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["422"]}
