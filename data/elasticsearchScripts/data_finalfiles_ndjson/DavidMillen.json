{"title": "Motivations for social networking at work\n", "abstract": " The introduction of a social networking site inside of a large enterprise enables a new method of communication between colleagues, encouraging both personal and professional sharing inside the protected walls of a company intranet. Our analysis of user behavior and interviews presents the case that professionals use internal social networking to build stronger bonds with their weak ties and to reach out to employees they do not know. Their motivations in doing this include connecting on a personal level with coworkers, advancing their career with the company, and campaigning for their projects.", "num_citations": "1007\n", "authors": ["1204"]}

Users' representation of the Internet typically contained few meaningful reference points excepting\" landmarks\" such as search sites and frequently visited sites. For many of the users, the representation was largely procedural, and therefore organized primarily by time. All novice users conceptualized search engines as literally searching the entire Internet when a query was issued. Web savvy librarians understood the limitations of search engines better, but did still expect search engines to follow familiar organizational schemes and to indicate their cataloguing system. Although all users initially approached the Internet with high expectations of information credibility, expert users learned early on that\" anyone can publish.\" In response to the lack of clear credibility conventions, librarians applied the same criteria they used with traditional sources. However, novice users retained high credibility expectations because their exposure was limited to the subscription-based services within their college library. And finally, during an assigned search task new users expected\" step by step\" instructions and self-evident cues to interaction. They were also overwhelmed and confused by the amount of information\" help\" displayed and became impatient when a context appropriate solution to their problem was not immediately offered.", "num_citations": "28\n", "authors": ["1204"]}

{"title": "Tag-based metonymic search in an activity-centric aggregation service\n", "abstract": " Knowledge workers often need to find, organize, and work with heterogeneous resources from diverse services, information stores, and repositories. This paper analyzes two problems that knowledge workers frequently encounter: difficulty in finding all relevant resources across diverse services, and difficulty in formulating and executing searches for resources related to their current activity-of-interest. The Malibu project explores solutions to these problems through a dynamic peripheral display that aggregates knowledge resources from multiple services to support activity-centric work. Of particular interest is the ability to select a knowledge resource and use it as a metonym (a proxy) for its social-tagging metadata in a tag-based search for related resources among heterogeneous services. We evaluated our solutions to these two problems through convergent analyses of quantitative (data log) and qualitative\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1204"]}

As a result, enterprises have turned to social media as a potential resource for acculturation, the process in which employees make sense of organizational culture. In this paper, we explore the emergence of a Twitter hashtag (# stuffibmerssay) to characterize user participation and content of the tagged tweets, and describe the motivation of active contributors. Our analysis reveals that participants tended to share often humorous observations of everyday work practices indicative of a highly technical global workforce and interviews with participants suggested that the resulting tweets help reinforce a shared sense of group identity with other members of the organization. We conclude by discussing the implications of emergent social media as expressions of organizational culture, particularly when it occurs outside of the intranet.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1204"]}

However, because a global enterprise is multilingual, not all employees can understand the shared information in these systems easily if the content is written in a user's non-native language. As a result, this research focuses on enhancing the readability of blogs in enterprise social software for this group of users. The pilot user study of Japanese and Chinese bloggers suggest there are two main challenges: finding an interesting blog post to read and encountering difficulties in reading blog posts as currently rendered.

But these are complex matters and their impacts are not always straightforward. Although much has been written about microcredit, more understandings of such practices are still needed. In this work, we investigate informal credit practices of merchants in the northeast of Brazil. We observe that the informal credit practices are based on a sense of community and personal relationships between merchants and their customers. In learning how community norms are used to support (and sanction) credit practices, we aim at better understanding how to design new financial products and services. We explore insights for this context gathered from fieldwork, discuss research challenges, and show a design concept of a service that aims to digitally enhance microcredit practices.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1204"]}

In particular, how the context is apparent in the vocabulary, language or classifications used in communication. At the individual or conceptual level, tags are seen as a means to avoid some of the issues associated within more formal frameworks, such as fossilized terms of meanings, but at the context, language or ontology level a concept must be expressed via a relatively impoverished vocabulary of jointly shared terms and ideas. One such misunderstanding, one that drives much of the debate on tagging, is the widespread definition of ontology as \u201ca hierarchical structure to describe conceptual structures that are closed, inflexible and restrictive\u201d.

{"title": "Understanding Patterns of Media Use in an Activity-Centric Collaborative Environment\n", "abstract": " 1. BackgroundWe began this research program to address a gap in existing collaborative environments. Ad hoc collaboration systems, such as email and chat, are lightweight and flexible. They provide good support for short-term, dynamic communication needs. However, collaborative activities which extend over longer periods of time, or over larger numbers of participants, are notoriously difficult to conduct over email or chat. Discussion databases and structured workspaces are more appropriate to the larger-scale collaborations, but they are difficult to set up. It is particularly difficult to begin with an informal collaboration (eg, in a chat), and then extend that collaboration to a somewhat larger membership (perhaps in email), and then to extend that collaboration again into a more formal, large-scale environment (a discussion database or a workspace).A second problem is that most collaborative environments support one or at most two types of documents as \u201cfirst class objects.\u201d For example, most instant messaging environments support text (first class object) and a few graphic indicators, and perhaps URLs (second class object); email supports text (first class) plus attachments or URLs (second class); discussion databases support text (first class) plus attachments or URLs; and so on. Logically, a complex activity may contain diverse resources, such as simple text, formatted text, spreadsheets, graphics, and executable modules, but these diverse documents are either (a) spread across a number of specialized repositories, or (b) attached to a smaller number of first class objects such as texts (email messages, discussion database entries).", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1204"]}
{"title": "The Corner Office: An Exploration of an Informal Teleconferencing Service\n", "abstract": " The increasing number of geographically dispersed work teams present ever-increasing opportunities for new collaboration tools and services. Earlier this year, a geographically dispersed research team decided to prototype and informally evaluate an audio-only mediaspace, which was code-named The Corner Office. This prototype was built using an audio teleconferencing bridge augmented with web-based visual awareness information. A web browser was used to present a panel display that contained a small image of the desk and the doorway of each user. This allowed team members to determine when a colleague was at his or her desk, on the phone, alone, or with others. In addition, the desktop images were visually highlighted whenever someone was currently present in the shared audio space. The objectives of the field trial were twofold. First, to investigate the usability and usefulness of a lightweight audio-only media space. And second, to explore the benefits of augmenting an audio space with several types of social awareness information. The feedback from the trial users indicated that the social presence information was generally useful as a way to determine the conversation accessibility of another user. Conversely, communication inaccessibility was also clearly signaled through the Corner Office portals. During the field trial, the natural tension between social awareness and individual privacy surfaced. As a result, the trial members agreed to intentionally degrade the quality of the web camera images, which resulted in slightly blurred images with limited color.
