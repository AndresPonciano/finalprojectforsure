{"title": "Online communities and open innovation\n", "abstract": " How can firms make use of online communities as part of an innovation strategy aimed at leveraging resources and ideas outside the four walls of the enterprise? Online communities are today a widespread phenomenon that takes a variety of forms. Free and open source software is probably the most well-known case, where geographically dispersed individuals collectively develop new software and produce innovation. In 1991 Linus Torvalds founded the Linux kernel, the heart of an operating system with the ability to have a real impact on Microsoft\u2019s market share. Torvalds\u2019 initial ideas led to the building of a community that collectively developed the Linux kernel. From the original incorporation of some 10,000 lines of source code, by 2005 the community had developed more than 6,000,000 lines of code. But online communities are more than simply free and open source software. For instance, social\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "243\n", "authors": ["872"]}

Our analysis draws on a large sample of projects registered at Sourceforge.net, the world's largest incubator of open source software activity. We test the hypothesis that skill variety of participants is associated with project performance. We also explore whether the level of modularization of project activities is correlated with performance. Our econometric estimations show that skill heterogeneity is associated with project survival and performance. However, the relationship between skill diversity and performance is non-monotonic. Design modularity is also positively associated with the performance of the project. Finally, the interaction between skill heterogeneity and modularity is negatively associated with performance.", "num_citations": "98\n", "authors": ["872"]}

We describe how the propagation of such standards takes place through non-material artifacts such as code and virtual discussions.

We examine two kinds of problem/project\u2010behaviors: Individuals can set up projects around the formulation of new problems or join existing projects and define and/or work on subproblems within an existing problem. The choice between these two behaviors is influenced by the mode of communication. A communication mode with little a priori structure is the best mode for communicating about new problems (i.e., formulating a problem); empirically, it is associated with project launching behaviors. In contrast, more structured communication fits subproblems better and is related to project joining behaviors. Our hypotheses derive support from data from the FOSS community.

In so doing, we compare the indicators of diversity used by economists with those used by biologists and ecologists. Ecologists and biologists are concerned about biodiversity: the diversity of organisms that inhabit a given area. Concepts of species diversity such as alpha (diversity within community), beta (diversity across communities) and gamma (diversity due to differences among samples when they are combined into a single sample) have been developed (Whittaker, 1960). Biodiversity is more complex than just the species that are present, it includes species richness and species evenness. Those various aspects of diversity are measured by biodiversity indices such as Simpson's Diversity Indices, Species Richness Index, Shannon Weaver Diversity Indices, Patil and Taillie Index, Modified Hill's Ratio. In economics, diversity measures are multi-faceted ranging from inequality (Lorenz curve, Gini coefficient, quintile distribution), to polarisation (Esteban and Ray, 1994; Wolfon, 1994, D'Ambrosio (2001)) and heterogeneity (Alesina, Baqir and Hoxby, 2000).

Reviewing institutional features of today\u2019s crowdfunding, we clarify that there are often limits in the extent to which tangible rewards can be used to motivate contributions. Drawing on analogies with charitable donations, we theorize that intangible sources of motivation\u2014(i) direct psychological rewards,(ii) reciprocity and (iii) social interactions\u2014can play a role in entrepreneurial crowdfunding. In our detailed empirical analysis of a representative project we find abundant evidence consistent with this characterization and we proceed to discuss implications for platform design and entrepreneurial funding and unique and defining characteristics of crowdfunding.", "num_citations": "44\n", "authors": ["872"]}

How the Free/Libre/Open Source Software community enhances developers\u2019 contribution\n", "abstract": " The paper presents a dynamic perspective on the landscape of Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS) developers' motivations and tries to isolate mechanisms sustaining developers' contribution over time. The first part of the paper uses data gathered by the empirical studies relative to the FLOSS case to judge the relative importance of each group of incentives detected by the literature. In the second part of the paper, the same data are used to further characterize developers' motivations in dynamics terms. In particular, the study shows that the relative importance of different incentives do change over time. Drawing inspiration from the literature aimed at explaining these changes, the third part of the paper identifies a specific mechanism fostering developers' contribution to the community activities, namely that: Independently of developers' exogenous preferences, the more their exposure to the FLOSS community social environment, the more their contribution to the community activities. The key point of this hypothesis is that, if the exposure to the FLOSS community social environment is able to foster developers' contribution beyond the level granted by their predetermined preferences, this leads directly to the evidence that the FLOSS community is provided with a mechanism sustaining and enhancing developers' incentives to produce and diffuse code. In the last part of the paper, data relative to 14,497 developers working on SourceForge.net during two years (2001-2002) are employed to estimate a model testing the aforementioned hypothesis.

But this means reshaping also their own visions of the world, redefining their identities. Community aims, principles and ethos act directly on members' identities, making them internalize the communitarian structure of rules. The first contribution of this paper is then showing how the concept of reflexivity developed by Giddens can link Wenger's idea of community of practice to developers' incentives. The result is that it is possible to find a mechanism, the reflexive identify process, acting as an antidote to free-riding and thus sustaining the cooperative production of FLOSS. However, the same mechanism shows that the community can be defined as an unstable (i.e. subject to revolutions) and dissipative (i.e. burning much more resources than the ones actually producing the outcome) object. On the theoretical side, the same mechanism asks for a wider conceptualization of practices. Using Habermas concept of 'practical interest' and 'communicative action' it is shown that the interaction between developers distributes among the different layers constituting the community debate, and that each one of these layers, not only practices, has a crucial role in defining developers' identities and thus their motivations.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["872"]}

Our results reveal the complexity of this meso-level structure, where several dense sub-groups of developers are connected by sparse collaboration among different sub-groups. We discuss the theoretical implications of our findings with reference to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["872"]}
{"title": "Curious Exceptions?\n", "abstract": " The aim of this chapter is to explore the differences and commonalities between open source software and other cases of open technology. The concept of open technology is used here to indicate various models of innovation based on the participation of a wide range of different actors who freely share the innovations they have produced. The chapter begins with a review of the problems connected to the production of public goods and explains why open source software seems to be a \u201ccurious exception\u201d for traditional economic reasoning. Then it describes the successful operation of similar models of innovation (open technology) in other technological fields. The third section investigates the literature in relation to three fundamental issues in the current open source research agenda, namely, developers\u2019 motivations, performance, and sustainability of the model. Finally, the fourth section provides a final comparison between open source software and the other cases of open technology.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["872"]}
{"title": "Industry 4.0 technological trajectories and traditional manufacturing regions: The role of knowledge workers\n", "abstract": " The technological trajectory of a region depends on the local repository of competences and knowledge, and their evolution over time. Using the case of a region with Marshallian features, we explore the Industry 4.0 potential for regional transformation showing how the employment ratios of synthetic and analytical knowledge workers of local firms evolve in relation to the adoption of a set of digital technologies. Results show that technological change in this type of region exhibits strong path dependence and goes hand in hand mainly with an increase in the employment ratio of synthetic knowledge workers.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["872"]}

We theorize and show empirically \u2013 via a mixed-method approach applied to a representative and remarkably informative case \u2013 that the payoff structure for crowdfunders, akin to a public good contribution problem, leads to the tangible value of main project outputs exerting little influence on contributions to crowdfunding. This then raises the question of which funder motivations fund seekers may have to address to crowdfund their projects. We demonstrate the especially large role of non-pecuniary motivations and pinpoint three particular motivations that profit-seeking entrepreneurs may stimulate to be financed through crowdfunding.

{"title": "How context and attention shape behaviors in online communities: a modified garbage can model\n", "abstract": " Online communities have emerged as important organizational forms, but there are many gaps in our understanding. In particular, researchers have mainly focused on individual-level drivers of behaviors in communities, while downplaying (formal, informal) context at various levels. We theorize that different dimensions of context (i.e. omnibus and discrete context) influence decision-making in online communities through mechanisms involving community members\u2019 attention. Specifically, context influences which problems members perceive and which solutions they retrieve and apply, thereby shaping the process of matching solutions and problems. We derive four hypotheses about contribution behaviors in online communities and how such behaviors are influenced by context. The empirical setting for our study is the open-source software community. We find support for our hypotheses in a unique dataset that\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["872"]}
{"title": "The Digital Revolution and COVID-19\n", "abstract": " We develop a simple model of digital markets to analyze the impact of Covid-19 on the digital transformation of sectors. The lockdown due to Covid-19 is modeled as a shock that wipes out the physical market, temporarily leaving digital consumption as the only option. Under plausible assumptions on digital demand and supply, the model predicts that such temporary shock produces an irreversible rise of the digital markets. This happens for three distinct reasons. First, by temporarily eliminating the physical market, Covid-19 provides a strong incentive for firms to carry out the fixed investments necessary to venture into the digital market (supply channel). Secondly, by forcing even the most reluctant consumers into the digital market, Covid-19 pushes them to familiarize with digital platforms, and this confidence endures in the post-Covid era (demand channel). Finally, if consumers\u2019 taste for digitalization is affected by the size of the digital market, a market may be entrapped into a low-digital equilibrium indefinitely. In such context, the lockdown due to the pandemic is the shock that may unleash the forces of digitalization and tilt the entire sector towards a high-digital equilibrium (network externalities channel).", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["872"]}

We investigate specific organizational design initiatives that firms can take when collaborating with online communities to nurture their joint knowledge creation process and to realize a useful output. We contend that drafting a formal policy, leaving the coordination of the joint project to others and, in case of taking on the coordination duty, dedicating an employee's full time to realize the project administrator task can help increase the amount of useful output of such collaborations.

The decision to make a study on this subject sees its birth in difficulties R&D Units lead to in terms of performance analysis and data interpretation for managers. Evaluating an R&D Unit in pharmaceutical companies is extremely complex from the moment that the entire process required to develop a drug from its first phases (the molecular targeting) to the last ones (approval of the drug from the competent authority) lasts between fifteen and twenty years, requiring incredibly high amounts of investments without having any reassurance on the success of the project. The thesis is structured in three chapters.The first one describes the different performance measurement systems known and that might be adopted from the companies of any industry to make analysis and have a picture of their current situation by adapting these systems to their own necessities. It will then be explained what Key Performance Indicators are, their importance for the companies and the characteristics that these must have to be effective in a managerial analysis and from a generic explanation of the KPIs it will be depicted how they can be adapted and set to a Research and Development Unit of a pharmaceutical industry and the correct way to interpret them. Following, the second chapter goes more in detail with the pharmaceutical industry and its R&D Units. The objective of the chapter is to understand how the research and development process works and is structured, which are the main risks that a pharmaceutical\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["872"]}

{"title": "Coordinating distributed innovation processes: The case of the automative and open source software industries\n", "abstract": " This paper casts light on the question how coordination of distributed innovation processes is achieved by comparing the automotive and open source software industries. These industries represent very different settings of distributed innovation, one a traditional industries that has opened up innovation, the other the extreme case of network innovation. They have not so far been object of a comparative study. We present a comparative literature review, and then draw on empirical research in the automotive and open source software industries to compare how coordination is achieved in each. We apply qualitative methods to the auto industry, where we draw from a 10-year case study of a major European auto firm. We apply quantitative methods to the open source software industry, where we do an econometric analysis of 5810 projects registered on SourceForge. We find a surprising similarity regarding how coordination is provided in both cases: the use of templates at early stages of the project, which foster coordination of joint search processes by distributed actors through acting on their representations of search trajectories and eliminating some of the potential trajectories.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["872"]}
