{"title": "Enterprise Architecture Documentation: Current Practices and Future Directions\n", "abstract": " Over the past decade Enterprise Architecture (EA) management matured to a discipline commonly perceived as a strategic advantage. Among others, EA management helps to identify and realize cost saving potentials in organizations. EA initiatives commonly start by documenting the status-quo of the EA. The respective management discipline analyzes this so-called current state and derives intermediate planned states heading towards a desired target state of the architecture. Several EA frameworks describe this process in theory. However, during practical application, organizations struggle with documenting the EA and lack concrete guidance during the process. To underline our observations and confirm our hypotheses, we conducted a survey among 140 EA practitioners to analyze issues organizations face while documenting the EA and keeping the documentation up to date. In this paper we present results on current practices, challenges, and automation techniques for EA documentation in a descriptive manner.", "num_citations": "83\n", "authors": ["1955"]}

{"title": "Automation Processes for Enterprise Architecture Management\n", "abstract": " Creating and maintaining an enterprise architecture model that is both up-to-date and accurate is a difficult task due to the size and complexity of the models and the dispersed nature of EA information in organizations. In current EA maintenance processes, the models are maintained manually with only little automation, which is a time consuming task. Literature from research and practice has identified this challenge, but only few scientific publications actually address the issue of EA model maintenance and its automation. In our research effort on Living Models, we are working towards solutions for a closer connection between EA models and what they represent in the real world.

Hence, optimization of the business-IT alignment is a key objective of Enterprise Architecture Management (EAM). To achieve this objective, EAM creates, maintains and analyzes a model of the current state of the Enterprise Architecture. This model covers different concepts reflecting both the business and the IT perspective and has to be constantly maintained in response to ongoing transformations of the enterprise. In practice, EA models grow large and are difficult to maintain, since many stakeholders from various backgrounds have to contribute architecture-relevant information.

{"title": "Requirements for automated enterprise architecture model maintenance\n", "abstract": " Enterprise Architecture Management (EAM) is the practice of modeling the business and IT artifacts in an enterprise and relating them with each other. By documenting these interdependencies between business and the supporting IT, strategic decisions can be made towards a planned and consolidated enterprise architecture that matches the business needs. However, enterprise architecture models can grow very large, thus making the manual creation and maintenance of these models a difficult and time consuming task. From this, we derived the three research questions of this paper:(i) Which related work exists on the maintenance of EA models, and does it refer to automation techniques?(ii) Is EA maintenance automation demanded by practitioners? If yes,(iii) What are the requirements for such an automation method and tool? In this paper we tackle these questions by conducting a literature analysis on EA literature from research and practice. In addition, we present the results of a survey among EA practitioners we conducted to find out current maintenance practices. We then describe a collection of requirements for an automated EA maintenance method and tool, that we derived from the results of the survey, the findings in the literature review and our own experience as EA consultants.

These change events do not provide clearly mappable structured information, but can be used to trigger and guide manual EA model maintenance tasks when changes occur.
