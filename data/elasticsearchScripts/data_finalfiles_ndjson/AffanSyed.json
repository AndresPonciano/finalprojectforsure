Several time synchronization protocol that maximize accuracy and energy conservation have been developed, including FTSP, TPSN, and RBS. All of these assume nearly instantaneous wireless communication between sensor nodes; each of them work well in today\u2019s RF-based sensor networks. We are just beginning to explore underwater sensor networks where communication is primarily via acoustic telemetry. With acoustic communication, where the propagation speed is nearly five orders of magnitude slower than RF, assumptions about rapid communication are incorrect and new approaches to time synchronization are required. We present Time Synchronization for High Latency (TSHL), designed assuming such high latency propagation. We show through analysis and simulation that it achieves precise time synchronization with minimal energy cost. Although at very short distances existing protocols are adequate, TSHL shows twice the accuracy at 500m, demonstrating the need to model both clock skew and propagation latency.", "num_citations": "451\n", "authors": ["1928"]}

Communication is changed drastically by acoustic propagation speeds that are five orders of magnitude slower than radio.

Recent work has begun to explore how multi-hop communication over short distances (500m or less) can reduce many of the channel complexities and improve energy efficiency (for example, see [1]), but multi-hop communication requires channel coordination. Our current work is therefore focused on understanding the challenges and potential solutions in MAC design for such short-range acoustic underwater sensor networks.

Through analysis and simulations, we quantify the improvement in performance obtained with capture. We find that the capture effect benefits primarily low-contention links and non-bottle-neck sessions. As a result, although capture provides significant improvements in the total throughput (sum rate), it seems to provide little improvement in the objective function (sum of the logarithm of the rates).", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1928"]}
{"title": "Time synchronization for high latency acoustic networks-extended technical report\n", "abstract": " Distributed time synchronization is an important part of a sensor network where sensing and actuation must be coordinated across multiple nodes. Several time synchronization protocol that maximize accuracy and energy conservation have been developed, including FTSP, TPSN, and RBS. All of these assume nearly instantaneous wireless communication between sensor nodes; each of them work well in today\u2019s RF-based sensor networks. We are just beginning to explore underwater sensor networks where communication is primarily via acoustic telemetry. With acoustic communication, where the propagation speed is nearly five orders of magnitude slower than RF, assumptions about rapid communication are incorrect and new approaches to time synchronization are required. We present Time Synchronization for High Latency (TSHL), designed assuming such high latency propagation. We show through analysis and simulation that it achieves precise time synchronization with minimal energy cost. Although at very short distances existing protocols are adequate, TSHL shows twice the accuracy at 500m, demonstrating the need to model both clock skew and propagation latency.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1928"]}
{"title": "Traffic analyzer for differentiating bittorrent handshake failures from port-scans\n", "abstract": " This paper aims to improve the accuracy of port-scan detectors by analyzing traffic of BitTorrent hosts and differentiating their respective BitTorrent connection (attempts) from port-scans. It is shown that by looking at BitTorrent coordination traffic and modelling port-scanning behavior the number of BitTorrent-related false positives can be reduced by 80% without any loss of IDS accuracy.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1928"]}

{"title": "Oesophageal stents for the treatment of radiation and anastomotic oesophageal strictures\n", "abstract": " Benign oesophageal strictures can arise in the treatment of oesophageal cancer as a result of radiation therapy, or at anastomotic sites, post-oesophagectomy. Data on the benefit of stenting of these types of stricture is limited. We analyzed the effects of oesophageal stents on such benign esophageal strictures. In this retrospective study, data was obtained from consecutive patients, 18 years and above from January 2000 to May 2016. Inclusion criteria comprised of oesophageal stenting in post-radiation strictures and anastomotic strictures, without any malignant residual disease. 17 patients had 22 stents inserted. 11 of these were female. 17 stents were self-expanding metallic stents (SEMS) and five were biodegradable (BDS). 12 strictures occurred post-radiation, while five were anastomotic strictures. Technical and clinical success rates were 100% and 86.4% respectively. Overall longterm clinical success was 45.5%(47% for BDS, 40% for SEMS). Minor, short-term complications, including pain and/or vomiting, were observed in 54.6%(n= 12). The overall mean dysphagia score pre-and post-stenting was 2.95 and 1.36 (p= 0.0001). Comparison of the dysphagia free survival for anastomotic and post-radiation strictures was statistically similar (p= 0.22), as was the dysphagia free survival comparison between BDS and SEMS (p= 0.055). BDS and SEMS are a safe and effective treatment modality for oesophageal strictures arising post-radiation or at the site of anastomoses. Retrospective study design and a low number of patients remain limiting factors of the study.(Acta Gastroenterol. belg., 2018, 81, 361-365).", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1928"]}
{"title": "Networking wireless energy in embedded networks\n", "abstract": " Wireless energy transfer has recently emerged as a promising alternative to realize the vision of perpetual embedded sensing. However, this technology transforms the notion of energy from merely a node\u2019s local commodity to, similarly to data, a deployment-wide shareable resource. The challenges of managing a shareable energy resource are much more complicated and radically different from the research of the past decade: Besides energy-efficient operation of individual devices, we also need to optimize networkwide energy distribution. To counteract these challenges, we propose an energy stack, a layered software model for energy management in future transiently powered embedded networks. An initial specification of the energy stack, which is based on the historically successful layered approach for data networking, consists of three layers: (i) the transfer layer, which deals with the physical transfer of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1928"]}
{"title": "New trends in higher education and challenges and emerging opportunities in business education\n", "abstract": " This research investigates the new trends in Higher education and challenging and emerging opportunities in Business education. A complementary survey was conducted from 50 organizations in Sindh province by using simple random technique, and 200 sample size were selected from student data set. The results showed that higher education trends are dramatically changed in few decades. It was revealed that Business education is the first priority of the 90% of the students in Pakistan. It was further revealed that business education also emerging with new disciplines according to the market demand ie Knowledge management, MIS and Stress management these are the key areas where students and organizations are interested. There are numerous job opportunities in the business related degrees. It was further revealed that new trends in business education open the window of multinational organizations\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1928"]}
