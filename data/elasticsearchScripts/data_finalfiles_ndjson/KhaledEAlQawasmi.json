{"title": "Key Factors in Determining Students' Satisfaction in Online Learning Based on'Web Programming'course within Zarqa University\n", "abstract": " The world of education has changed. The latest developments in the networking technology and the Internet are allowing students to be more flexible as to the time and place of learning in ways that was unimaginable before. The growth in use of networked technologies provides educators with mechanisms to add value to learning experiences where learners and instructors are geographically separated. The aim of this study is to evaluate the student's perception and satisfaction of online learning course based on a course\" Web Programming\" course within Zarqa University. A questionnaire of 20 questions is delivered to 22 undergraduate students from the Internet Technology Department in Zarqa University. Three group interviews are undertaken with them to identify further issues. The results drawn from this study may help in better understanding of students' needs in an online course.", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["1279"]}
{"title": "Building an ethical framework for e-learning management system at a university level\n", "abstract": " The use of the e-learning systems at a university level has increased and received wide acceptance all over the world. The academic community at higher educational organizations has recognized the potential advantages of using e-learning system to enhance the learning process. Despite this high academic interest in the subject there are some important issues that have not yet been tackled. At the top of these important issues comes the ethical debate. Embedding ethical standards in the e-learning process can help enhance the learning process, failing to address ethical issues in the e-learning environment may minimize the effectiveness of e-learning implementations and therefore decrease the value perception of these systems. The main aim of this paper is to propose an ethical framework to be used by both students and tutors in Learning Management Systems at a University level. The ethical framework\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1279"]}
{"title": "Improving Analysis Phase in Network Forensics By Using Attack Intention Analysis\n", "abstract": " The increasing amount of cyber crimes has motivated network forensics researchers to develop new techniques to analyze and investigate these crimes. Reconstructing useful evidence of a cybercrime is difficult due to the vagueness of the analysis phase processes. The analysis phase is challenging because it provides detailed information on the intention and strategy of the attack. This paper aims to show the importance of reconstructing attack intentions in order to improve the analysis phase in network forensics. Intentions are identified through an algorithm called Attack Intention Analysis, which predicts cyber crime intentions by combining mathematical evidence theory and a probabilistic technique. In this paper, the attack intention model will be improved to present the motivation behind cyber crimes. The results of the comparison of the attack intention analysis methods prove that the AIA algorithm is more accurate.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1279"]}
{"title": "Artificial neural network-based algorithm for ARMA model order estimation\n", "abstract": " This paper presents a new algorithm for the determination of the Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) model order based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The basic idea is to apply ANN to a special matrix constructed from the Minimum Eginevalue (MEV) criterion. The MEV criterion is based on a covariance matrix derived from the observed output data only. The input signal is unobservable. The proposed algorithm is based on training the MEV covariance matrix dataset using the back-propagation technique. Our goal is to develop a system based on ANN; hence, the model order can be selected automatically without the need of prior knowledge about the model or any human intervention. Examples are given to illustrate the significant improvement results.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1279"]}
{"title": "A Robust ARX and ARMA Model Order Estimation via Pivot-Neighbors Comparisons\n", "abstract": " Model order selection of an Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) process is an important problem. This paper presents a new algorithm for the estimation of an ARMA and autoregressive with exogenous input (ARX) model orders based on a rounding approach which uses the floor and the ceiling functions. The rounding approach is implemented to deal with the precision of binary words. The proposed algorithm is based on selecting a sequence of pivot cells from an MEV matrix which is based on the minimum eigenvalue of a covariance matrix computed from the observed data. It searches for the corner that contains the estimates of the true orders using the floor and the ceiling functions of the pivot cell values and the values of its neighbors. The proposed algorithm is an expansion of the algorithm proposed by Liang et al. (IEEE Transaction on Signal Processing, 1993; 41(10): 3003-3009).

{"title": "Using Encryption Square Keywith One-dimensional Matrix for Enhancing RGB Color Image Encryption-Decryption\n", "abstract": " Recently, the security of digital images becomes an important issue with the rapid growth of digital communication and multimedia application. Recent cryptography algorithms are providing essential techniques to protect information and multimedia data. However, those algorithms are usually suffering from the problem of time-consuming. Encryption algorithms have been growth quickly and many image encryption methods have been used to protect information and multimedia data from unauthorized access. This research presents effective technique for image encryption which employs Red, Green and Blue (RGB) components of the RGB color image. The proposed technique utilizes matrix multiplication and inverse matrices for encryption-decryption purpose. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed encryption-decryption techniques lay on minimizing the encryptiondecryption time and the square error between the original and the decrypted image. The evaluations of the proposed technique were done using many images with different sizes, while the ex perimental results show that the improved encryption technique time are greatly reduced compared with \u201cRGB Color Image Encryption-Decryption Using Gray Image\u201d method. The proposed technique has a high confidentiality level through using confusion diffusion sequentially with a square matrix key and two vectors keys. However, those keys are generated randomly and make the process of hacking the image very difficult.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1279"]}
