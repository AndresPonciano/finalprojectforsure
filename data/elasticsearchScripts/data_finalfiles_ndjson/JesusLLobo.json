The resulting lack of stationarity in the distribution of the produced data calls for efficient and scalable algorithms for online analysis capable of adapting to such changes (concept drift). The online learning field has lately turned its focus on this challenging scenario, by designing incremental learning algorithms that avoid becoming obsolete after a concept drift occurs. Despite the noted activity in the literature, a need for new efficient and scalable algorithms that adapt to the drift still prevails as a research topic deserving further effort.

{"title": "Adaptive long-term traffic state estimation with evolving spiking neural networks\n", "abstract": " Due to the nature of traffic itself, most traffic forecasting models reported in literature aim at producing short-term predictions, yet their performance degrades when the prediction horizon is increased. The scarce long-term estimation strategies currently found in the literature are commonly based on the detection and assignment to patterns, but their performance decays when unexpected events provoke non predictable changes, or if the allocation to a traffic pattern is inaccurate. This work introduces a method to obtain long-term pattern forecasts and adapt them to real-time circumstances. To this end, a long-term estimation scheme based on the automated discovery of patterns is proposed and integrated with an on-line change detection and adaptation mechanism. The framework takes advantage of the architecture of evolving Spiking Neural Networks (eSNN) to perform adaptations without retraining the model\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "43\n", "authors": ["1094"]}

Such data streams are usually affected by non-stationary events that eventually change their distribution (concept drift), causing that predictive models trained over these data become obsolete and do not adapt suitably to the new distribution. Specially in online learning scenarios, there is a pressing need for new algorithms that adapt to this change as fast as possible, while maintaining good performance scores. Recent studies have revealed that a good strategy is to construct highly diverse ensembles towards utilizing them shortly after the drift (independently from the type of drift) to obtain good performance scores.

When evaluating the quality of a clustering arrangement unsupervised metrics can be utilized (e.g. modularity), which all rely on structural and topological characteristics of the cluster space rather than on an observed ground of truth that should be achieved. One of such metrics is the recently published Surprise, which evaluates how statistically unlikely a given clustering arrangement is with respect to a random network featuring the same distribution of nodes per cluster. To maximize this metric, a number of algorithms have been proposed in the literature, but their comparative performance varies significantly between networks of different shape and size.

However, in many cases, it is not easy to collect enough training data with labeled anomalies for supervised learning of an anomaly detector in order to deploy it later for identification of real anomalies in streaming data.

Our idea is to adapt the Online evolving Spiking Neural Network (OeSNN) classifier to the anomaly detection task. As a result, we offer an Online evolving Spiking Neural Network for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection algorithm (OeSNN-UAD), which, unlike OeSNN, works in an unsupervised way and does not separate output neurons into disjoint decision classes.

When a time series is generated by non-stationary phenomena, the pattern relating the series with the class to be predicted may evolve over time (concept drift). Consequently, predictive models aimed to learn this pattern may become eventually obsolete, hence failing to sustain performance levels of practical use. To overcome this model degradation, online learning methods incrementally learn from new data samples arriving over time, and accommodate eventual changes along the data stream by implementing assorted concept drift strategies. In this manuscript we elaborate on the suitability of online learning methods to predict the road congestion level based on traffic speed time series data.

This power production can vary depending on environmental variables, such as temperature, pressure, and humidity. Thus, the business problem is how to predict the power production as a function of these environmental conditions, in order to maximize the profit. The research community has solved this problem by applying Machine Learning techniques, and has managed to reduce the computational and time costs in comparison with the traditional thermodynamical analysis. Until now, this challenge has been tackled from a batch learning perspective, in which data is assumed to be at rest, and where models do not continuously integrate new information into already constructed models. We present an approach closer to the Big Data and Internet of Things paradigms, in which data are continuously arriving and where models learn incrementally, achieving significant enhancements in terms of data processing (time, memory and computational costs), and obtaining competitive performances. This work compares and examines the hourly electrical power prediction of several streaming regressors, and discusses about the best technique in terms of time processing and predictive performance to be applied on this streaming scenario.

Moreover, we give bounds on the minimum number of samples required to output the ground truth with high probability. Besides, we show how the optimal parameters are set.
