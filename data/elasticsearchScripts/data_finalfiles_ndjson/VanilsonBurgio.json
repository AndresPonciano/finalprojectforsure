{"title": "Social machines: a unified paradigm to describe social web-oriented systems\n", "abstract": " Blending computational and social elements into software has gained significant attention in key conferences and journals. In this context,\" Social Machines\" appears as a promising model for unifying both computational and social processes. However, it is a fresh topic, with concepts and definitions coming from different research fields, making a unified understanding of the concept a somewhat challenging endeavor. This paper aims to investigate efforts related to this topic and build a preliminary classification scheme to structure the science of Social Machines. We provide a preliminary overview of this research area through the identification of the main visions, concepts, and approaches; we additionally examine the result of the convergence of existing contributions. With the field still in its early stage, we believe that this work can collaborate to the process of providing a more common and coherent conceptual\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "54\n", "authors": ["2202"]}
{"title": "An architecture and guiding framework for the social enterprise\n", "abstract": " With the widespread adoption of social (aka Web 2.0) technologies like social networks, blogs, and wikis, there is a growing interest in looking into how enterprises should capitalize on these technologies. The social enterprise is the one that on top of having an online presence on the Internet, strives to open up new communication channels with stakeholders using social technologies. Building upon previous works on social business processes and on practical experiences on adopting such technologies in different Brazilian companies, this paper suggests an architecture and guiding framework for the social enterprise in terms of how to bridge the gap between the business world and social world and how to integrate social technologies into the enterprise's day-to-day operations.", "num_citations": "44\n", "authors": ["2202"]}

As a result, a novel breed of applications is emerging, and consequently new mental models are needed to deal with them. In this paper, we weave \"social\" relationships into software, leading to the notion of \"relationship-aware\" software. Relationship-aware software uses the metaphor of human social relationships and, at the simplest level, is software whose behavior takes into account other software it interacts with. Here, we revisit the concept of relationship and extend the notion of Social Machines to establish a unifying abstraction model that is used for specifying relationship-aware applications and services. To engineer relationship-aware applications, this paper presents a guideline that address some\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "23\n", "authors": ["2202"]}
{"title": "Towards a seamless coordination of cloud and fog: illustration through the internet-of-things\n", "abstract": " With the increasing popularity of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), organizations are revisiting their practices as well as adopting new ones so they can deal with an ever-growing amount of sensed and actuated data that IoT-compliant things generate. Some of these practices are about the use of cloud and/or fog computing. The former promotes\" anything-as-a-service\" and the latter promotes\" process data next to where it is located\". Generally presented as competing models, this paper discusses how cloud and fog could work hand-in-hand through a seamless coordination of their respective\" duties\". This coordination stresses out the importance of defining where the data of things should be sent (either cloud, fog, or cloud&fog concurrently) and in what order (either cloud then fog, fog then cloud, or fog&cloud concurrently).

{"title": "Web 2.0 applications in the workplace: How to ensure their proper use?\n", "abstract": " There is an ongoing debate about the role of Web 2.0 applications (e.g., Facebook\u2122 and Instagram\u2122) in the workplace. Indeed, misuse cases of these applications are on the rise and many enterprises still have concerns with their real benefits and values and thus, have been reluctant to adopting them. This paper addresses these concerns by developing restrictions over the social actions that Web 2.0 applications allow users to perform. These restrictions permit to limit for instance, the number of times a social action is performed, the content of a social action, and the recipient of a social action. The restrictions are specified in UML Object Constraint Language and enforced through a run-time monitoring that permits to detect violations. This paper, also, presents an implementation of restrictions over Hangouts\u2122 as an illustrative Web 2.0 application.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["2202"]}

Considering the particularities of each, the approach embraces two concepts known as social machines and data artifacts. On the one hand, social machines act as wrappers over applications (e.g.,\u00a0social media) that allow citizens and things to have an active role in their cities by reporting events of common interest to the population, for example. On the other hand, data artifacts abstract citizens\u2019 and things\u2019 contributions in terms of who has done what, when, where, and why. For successful smart cities, the approach relies on the willingness and engagement of both citizens and things. Smart cities\u2019 initiatives are embraced and not imposed.

Business artifacts populate the business world (associated with business process management platforms) and allow to facilitate the communication between IT and non-IT practitioners over application requirements to satisfy, for example. And social artifacts populate the social world (associated with Web~2.0 applications) and abstract the online activities that are executed over Web~2.0 applications such as tagging photos. Both worlds are connected to each other through social machines that allow business artifacts to act upon Web~2.0 applications such as creating new social artifacts and checking on the statuses of existing social artifacts.

The Web now is an ubiquitous platform that connects different entities like people, software, machines, knowledge resources, smart objects, to cite just some. From a practical perspective, this Web of everything is still \u201ccrawling\u201d for different reasons such as limited communication channels between various stakeholders and lack of standardized intermediaries, resulting with a serious lack of mutual understanding between these stakeholders. The avalanche of data produced at the speed of thoughts, known as \u201cBigData phenomenon\u201d is also undermining the adoption of the Web of everything due to the large volume of data that is unstructured and meaningless unless put in a proper context. Several initiatives have been launched to bring the Web to its full potential.
