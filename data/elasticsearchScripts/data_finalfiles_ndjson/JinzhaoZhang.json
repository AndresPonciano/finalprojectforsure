{"title": "Towards a systematic approach to input uncertainty quantification methodology\n", "abstract": " Taking into account uncertainties is a key step in nuclear applications to ensure that a system cannot move towards unsafe conditions. This topic has already been addressed by several OECD/NEA projects such as UMS or BEMUSE. It appeared that uncertainty analysis methods were mature enough for industrial practices but also that an important effort should be done on input uncertainty quantification. Following this recommendation, the PREMIUM project was a first attempt to tackle this problem by benchmarking several available methods. However, the dispersion of the results prevented from reaching a consensus between participants on estimated input uncertainties. This work is therefore devoted to some recent developments related to the construction of a systematic approach for input uncertainty quantification and validation. It provides an original insight which is not based on a benchmarking of methods and codes but integrates a shared analysis of the different generic steps that should be followed to reduce (or at least understand) the discrepancy in method and process. After recalling the main conclusions from the PREMIUM project that motivated the proposed work, we will introduce the five key elements of the systematic approach.

The use of the best estimate codes and methods is necessary to meet the increasing technical, licensing and regulatory requirements for major plant changes (e.g. steam generator replacement), power uprate, core design optimization (cycle extension), as well as Periodic Safety Review. Since 1992, Tractebel Engineering (TE) has developed and applied a deterministic bounding approach to FASR accident analysis using the best estimate system thermal hydraulic code RELAP5/MOD2.5 and the subchannel thermal hydraulic code COBRA-3C. This approach has been accepted by the Belgian Safety Authorities, and turned out to be cost effective for most of the non-LOCA transient analyses. Since this approach adapts a decoupled modeling of the core responses, the analysis results often involved too large un-quantified conservatisms, due to either simplistic approximations for asymmetric accidents with strong 3D core neutronics - plant thermal hydraulics interactions, or additional penalties introduced from 'incoherent' initial/boundary conditions for separate plant and core analyses. Therefore, an external dynamic coupling between the RELAP5/MOD2.5 code and the 3-D neutronic code PANTHER was implemented since 1997 via the transient analysis code linkage program TALINK.

After running these 200 cases, the relevant output parameters were collected, the lower and upper bounds were determined by using the order statistics. The objective is to verify if the uncertainties on the predicted key uncertainty parameters (cladding temperature, plenum gas pressure, cladding radius and elongation) well bound the measured data during the test.
