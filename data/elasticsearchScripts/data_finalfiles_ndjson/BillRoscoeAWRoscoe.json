{"title": "Modelling and Analysis of Security Protocols: the CSP approach\n", "abstract": " Security protocols are one of the most critical elements in enabling the secure communication and processing of information, ensuring its confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and availability. These protocols are vulnerable to a host of subtle attacks, so designing protocols to be impervious to such attacks has proved to be extremely challenging and error prone. This book provides a thorough and detailed understanding of one of the most effective approaches to the design and evaluation of security critical systems, describing the role of security protocols in distributed secure systems and the vulnerabilities to which they are prey. The authors introduce security protocols, the role they play and the cryptographic mechanisms they employ, and detail their role in security architectures, e-commerce, e-cash etc. Precise characterizations of key concepts in information security, such as confidentiality, authentication and integrity are introduced and a range of tools and techniques are described which will ensure that a protocol guarantees certain security services under appropriate assumptions. Modeling and Analysis of Security Protocols provides: An in-depth discussion of the nature and role of security protocols and their vulnerabilities. A rigorous framework in which security protocols and properties can be defined in detail. An understanding of the tools and techniques used to design and evaluate security protocols.", "num_citations": "782\n", "authors": ["1868"]}
{"title": "Model\u2212 checking CSP\n", "abstract": " It is both inspiring and frustrating to work as closely with Tony Hoare as I have had the privilege to do over the past fteen years. The source of the inspiration is obvious to all. The frustration comes from his ability to get things so right at the outset that the academic's usual meat and drink {re ning and changing an idea, and exploring varieties of theories, until a consensus emerges {is often missing.I believe this is true of the invention of his that I have spent longest working on, namely CSP 1]. The elegance and expressive power of the notation, and the simplicity of the standard semantic models, have the consequence that exploring other possibilities for these has been far less popular {and fruitful {than with other process algebras. Instead, theoretical work on CSP has concentrated on clear extensions, such as the inclusion of unbounded nondeterminism 2, 3], real time 4], probability 5] and similar. The basic ideas and notation have proved remarkably robust in these contexts.", "num_citations": "449\n", "authors": ["1868"]}
{"title": "Understanding concurrent systems\n", "abstract": " CSP notation has been used extensively for teaching and applying concurrency theory, ever since the publication of the text Communicating Sequential Processes by CAR Hoare in 1985. Both a programming language and a specification language, the theory of CSP helps users to understand concurrent systems, and to decide whether a program meets its specification. As a member of the family of process algebras, the concepts of communication and interaction are presented in an algebraic style. An invaluable reference on the state of the art in CSP, Understanding Concurrent Systems also serves as a comprehensive introduction to the field, in addition to providing material for a number of more advanced courses. A first point of reference for anyone wanting to use CSP or learn about its theory, the book also introduces other views of concurrency, using CSP to model and explain these. The text is fully integrated with CSP-based tools such as FDR, and describes how to create new tools based on FDR. Most of the book relies on no theoretical background other than a basic knowledge of sets and sequences. Sophisticated mathematical arguments are avoided whenever possible. Topics and features: presents a comprehensive introduction to CSP; discusses the latest advances in CSP, covering topics of operational semantics, denotational models, finite observation models and infinite-behaviour models, and algebraic semantics; explores the practical application of CSP, including timed modelling, discrete modelling, parameterised verifications and the state explosion problem, and advanced topics in the use of FDR; examines the ability of CSP\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "443\n", "authors": ["1868"]}
{"title": "A timed model for communicating sequential processes\n", "abstract": " The parallel language CSP [9], an earlier version of which was described in [7], has become a major tool for the analysis of structuring methods and proof systems involving parallelism. The significance of CSP is in the elegance by which a few simply stated constructs (eg, sequential and parallel composition, nondeterministic choice, concealment, and recursion) lead to a language capable of expressing the full complexity of distributed computing. The difficulty in achieving satisfactory semantic models containing these constructs has been in providing an adequate treatment of nondeterminism, deadlock, and divergence. Fortunately, as a result of an evolutionay development in [S],[lo],[15],[l],[14],[2], and [4] we now have several such models.The purpose of this paper is to report the development of the first real-time models of CSP to be compatible with the properties and proof systems of the abovementioned untimed models. Our objective in this development is the construction of a timed CSP model which satisfies the following:(1) Continuous with respect to time. The time domain should consist of all nonnegative real numbers, and there should be no lower bound on the time difference between consecutive observable events from two processes operating asynchronously in parallel.", "num_citations": "409\n", "authors": ["1868"]}

{"title": "Modelling and verifying key-exchange protocols using CSP and FDR\n", "abstract": " We discuss the issues involved in modelling and verifying key-exchange protocols within the framework of CSP and its model-checking tool FDR. Expressing such protocols within a process algebra forces careful consideration of exception handling, and makes it natural to consider the closely connected issues of commitment and no-loss-of service. We argue that it is often better to specify key exchange mechanisms in the context of an enclosing system rather than in isolation.", "num_citations": "306\n", "authors": ["1868"]}
{"title": "Using CSP to detect errors in the TMN protocol\n", "abstract": " We use FDR (Failures Divergence Refinement), a model checker for CSP, to detect errors in the TMN protocol (M. Tatebayashi et al., 1990). We model the protocol and a very general intruder as CSP processes, and use the model checker to test whether the intruder can successfully attack the protocol. We consider three variants on the protocol, and discover a total of 10 different attacks leading to breaches of security.", "num_citations": "291\n", "authors": ["1868"]}
{"title": "CSP and determinism in security modelling\n", "abstract": " We show how a variety of confidentiality properties can be expressed in terms of the abstraction mechanisms that CSP provides. We argue that determinism of the abstracted low-security viewpoint provides the best type of property. By changing the form of abstraction mechanism we are able to model different assumptions about how systems behave, including handling the distinction between input and output actions. A detailed analysis of the nature of nondeterminism shows why certain security properties have had the paradoxical property of not being preserved by refinement-a disadvantage not shared by the determinism-based conditions. Finally we give an efficient algorithm for testing the determinism properties on a model-checker.< >", "num_citations": "281\n", "authors": ["1868"]}
{"title": "FDR3\u2014A Modern Refinement Checker for CSP\n", "abstract": " FDR3 is a complete rewrite of the CSP refinement checker FDR2, incorporating a significant number of enhancements. In this paper we describe the operation of FDR3 at a high level and then give a detailed description of several of its more important innovations. This includes the new multi-core refinement-checking algorithm that is able to achieve a near linear speed up as the number of cores increase. Further, we describe the new algorithm that FDR3 uses to construct its internal representation of CSP processes\u2014this algorithm is more efficient than FDR2\u2019s, and is able to compile a large class of CSP processes to more efficient internal representations. We also present experimental results that compare FDR3 to related tools, which show it is unique (as far as we know) in being able to scale beyond the bounds of main memory.", "num_citations": "271\n", "authors": ["1868"]}

{"title": "Security and usability: Analysis and evaluation\n", "abstract": " The differences between the fields of Human-Computer Interaction and Security (HCISec) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) have not been investigated very closely. Many HCI methods and procedures have been adopted by HCISec researchers, however the extent to which these apply to the field of HCISec is arguable given the fine balance between improving the ease of use of a secure system and potentially weakening its security. That is to say that the techniques prevalent in HCI are aimed at improving users' effectiveness, efficiency or satisfaction, but they do not take into account the potential threats and vulnerabilities that they can introduce. To address this problem, we propose a security and usability threat model detailing the different factors that are pertinent to the security and usability of secure systems, together with a process for assessing these.", "num_citations": "181\n", "authors": ["1868"]}
