{"title": "YEASTRACT: an upgraded database for the analysis of transcription regulatory networks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae\n", "abstract": " The YEAst Search for Transcriptional Regulators And Consensus Tracking (YEASTRACT\u2014www.yeastract.com) information system has been, for 11 years, a key tool for the analysis and prediction of transcription regulatory associations at the gene and genomic levels in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Since its last update in June 2017, YEASTRACT includes approximately 163000 regulatory associations between transcription factors (TF) and target genes in S. cerevisiae, based on more than 1600 bibliographic references; it also includes 247 specific DNA binding consensus recognized by 113 TFs. This release of the YEASTRACT database provides new visualization tools to visualize each regulatory network in an interactive fashion, enabling the user to select and observe subsets of the network such as: (i) considering only DNA binding evidence or both DNA binding and expression evidence; (ii) considering\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "131\n", "authors": ["2119"]}
{"title": "Room usage optimization in timetabling: A case study at Universidade de Lisboa\n", "abstract": " This paper discusses the problem of room usage optimization for university timetables: given a timetable, we want to optimize the room occupation by determining the events allocated to each room, while ensuring that the rooms have enough capacity to \u201cseat\u201d all people participating in those events. This paper contributes with two approaches to the problem of optimizing the timetable scheduled for each room. The first approach consists of a two-stage Integer Linear Programming\u00a0(ILP) which applies a lexicographic optimization wherein the goal of the first stage is to maximize the number of students seated and that of the second stage is to optimize the room occupation. This is provably optimal, in both optimization criteria. However, it is computationally demanding, requiring significant computation time for large problems. To address this issue, we propose a second approach, consisting of a greedy algorithm. The\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["2119"]}
{"title": "Disruptions in timetables: a case study at Universidade de Lisboa\n", "abstract": " Solving university course timetabling problems is a large and complex task. Moreover, every new academic term, a new timetable is likely to be scheduled due to disruptions (e.g., changes in teacher-lecture allocation). Nevertheless, the university infrastructure, the overall curricular plans, and the number of students/teachers is still very similar in consecutive terms. For this reason, a timetable does not need to be always scheduled from scratch since it can produce a completely different solution from the previous one, thus creating undesirable changes for many actors. This paper addresses the Minimal Perturbation Problem (MPP) in university course timetabling. Given a set of disruptions that make a timetable no longer feasible, a solution to the MPP is the closest new feasible timetable with respect to the original timetable. We propose and analyze two different integer programming models to encode the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["2119"]}
{"title": "Minimal perturbation in university timetabling with maximum satisfiability\n", "abstract": " Every new academic year, scheduling new timetables due to disruptions is a major problem for universities. However, computing a new timetable from scratch may be unnecessarily expensive. Furthermore, this process may produce a significantly different timetable which in many cases is undesirable for all parties involved. For this reason, we aim to find a new feasible timetable while minimizing the number of perturbations relative to the original disrupted timetable. The contribution of this paper is a maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT) encoding to solve large and complex university timetabling problem instances which can be subject to disruptions. To validate the MaxSAT encoding, we evaluate university timetabling real-world instances from the International Timetabling Competition\u00a0(ITC) 2019. We consider the originally found solutions as a starting point, to evaluate the capacity of the proposed MaxSAT encoding\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["2119"]}
{"title": "Repairing Boolean logical models from time-series data using Answer Set Programming\n", "abstract": " Boolean models of biological signalling-regulatory networks are increasingly used to formally describe and understand complex biological processes. These models may become inconsistent as new data become available and need to be repaired. In the past, the focus has been shed on the inference of (classes of) models given an interaction network and time-series data sets. However, repair of existing models against new data is still in its infancy, where the process is still manually performed and therefore slow and prone to errors. In this work, we propose a method with an associated tool to suggest repairs over inconsistent Boolean models, based on a set of atomic repair operations. Answer Set Programming is used to encode the minimal repair problem as a combinatorial optimization problem. In particular, given an inconsistent model, the tool provides the minimal repairs that render the model capable of generating dynamics coherent with a (set of) time-series data set(s), considering either a synchronous or an asynchronous updating scheme. The method was validated using known biological models from different species, as well as synthetic models obtained from randomly generated networks. We discuss the method\u2019s limitations regarding each of the updating schemes and the considered minimization algorithm.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["2119"]}

The proposed approach comprehends pre-processing, the use of a Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) solver, and a local search procedure.UniCorT is assessed with the benchmark instances from ITC 2019. The impact of a handful of techniques in the quality of the solution and the execution time is evaluated. We take into account different pre-processing techniques and Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) encoding, as well as the combination with a local search procedure.
