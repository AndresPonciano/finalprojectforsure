{"title": "O2BC: A technique for the design of component-based applications\n", "abstract": " Component-based development (CBD) has become a much talked-about subject. While the technology of CBD-as exemplified by environments such as EJB and COM-has become increasingly mature, this has not been complemented by corresponding maturity on the methodology front. Of the few published methodologies available for the design of components, most address the process of building systems from a set of pre-built components. However, an important scenario not addressed is that of the design of custom applications. In such contexts, the CBD design question involves the creation of business components from a set of software requirements. Currently there is no published prescription that addresses this need. At best, practitioners rely on published collections of software patterns or heuristic guidelines such as those advocating correct component granularity. We propose a comprehensive design\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "50\n", "authors": ["717"]}

{"title": "Workload modeling for web-based systems\n", "abstract": " Web-based systems mostly have arrivals other than Poisson; this renders the standard analytical methods of workload modeling inapplicable. In this paper we examine real-life sites that had self-similar or fractal arrival. We adopted a shop-usable, three-stage approach to model the workload. A tool, based on the approach tries to capture the underlying parameters of the arrival patterns in the sample workloads. On failure, the tool outputs an empirical probability density table for various expected loads through simple interpolation. The parameters obtained or the table can be used along with performance related SLAs and constraints such as cost to take informed decisions for capacity sizing.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["717"]}

{"title": "Optimized path planning mechanism for localization in wireless sensor networks\n", "abstract": " Localization is the fundamental research issue in wireless sensor networks because many sensor network applications such as search & rescue operations, target tracking require the accurate position information where the event has acquired for further processing & communication activities. The localization can be done using beacon node with a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver which is mobile. The main challenge is the trajectory followed by mobile beacon node. The beacon node follows the `z' trajectory in the existing approach. The beacon node moves in `z' path rather than moving in random movement in order to avoid collinear problem and reduce the energy consumption of the beacon node. But it has some drawbacks such as high path length, high localization time and transmission range of beacon node.

Digital watermarking appears as an efficient means of securing multimedia contents such as copyright protection and authentication. The key aspects of watermarking techniques are robustness and tampering proofing. In this paper robustness is improved through combination of Discrete Wavelet Transform and Singular Value Decomposition method. DWT is used for decomposition of images into sub bands which gives linear flexibility of images in terms of scalability, resolution and distortion. By adding SVD along with DWT, Peak Signal to Noise Ratio can be improved. The result is analysed using MATLAB.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["717"]}

The necessity of such optimization lies in the ever-increasing difficulty of inputting Tamil text into mobile devices. In contrast to past research that allowed mapping of any letters to any keys, we hypothesize that maintaining alphabetical ordering across the keys of optimized keypad designs will result in higher novice usability and ease of learning, while still providing a more immediate benefit in terms of improved performance. Results from usability testing we conducted are encouraging and support our hypothesis.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["717"]}
{"title": "Identifying silent failures of saas services using finite state machine based invariant analysis\n", "abstract": " Field failure analysis is usually driven by a characterization of the different time related properties of failure. This characterization does not help the production support team in understanding the root cause. In order to pinpoint the root cause of failure, one of the most effective techniques used is checking for violations of the system invariants which are the consistent, time invariant correlations that exist in the system. Understanding when and where these violations happen helps in detecting the root cause of the failure. Silent failures, on the other hand are characterized by no evidence of failures either in the console or in the field failure logs. They are unearthed at moments of crisis, either with a customer complaint or other cascading failures. These failures often result in data loss or data corruption, creating many latent errors. Accumulation of these errors over time results in degraded system performance. This\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["717"]}
