{"title": "Analytical solutions of nonlinear and variable-parameter transport equations for verification of numerical solvers\n", "abstract": " All numerical codes developed to solve the advection\u2013diffusion-reaction (ADR) equation need to be verified before they are moved to the operational phase. In this paper, we initially provide four new one-dimensional analytical solutions designed to help code verification; these solutions are able to handle the challenges of the scalar transport equation including nonlinearity and spatiotemporal variability of the velocity and dispersion coefficient, and of the source term. Then, we present a solution of Burgers\u2019 equation in a novel setup. Proposed solutions satisfy the continuity of mass for the ambient flow, which is a crucial factor for coupled hydrodynamics-transport solvers. By the end of the paper, we solve hypothetical test problems for each of the solutions numerically, and we use the derived analytical solutions for code verification. Finally, we provide assessments of results accuracy based on well-known\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "29\n", "authors": ["1418"]}
{"title": "Phase exposure-dependent exchange\n", "abstract": " Solutes and suspended material often experience delays during exchange between phases one of which may be moving. Consequently transport often exhibits combined effects of advection/dispersion, and delays associated with exchange between phases. Such processes are ubiquitous and include transport in porous/fractured media, watersheds, rivers, forest canopies, urban infrastructure systems, and networks. Upscaling approaches often treat the transport and delay mechanisms together, yielding macroscopic \u201canomalous transport\u201d models. When interaction with the immobile phase is responsible for the delays, it is not the transport that is anomalous, but the lack of it, due to delays. We model such exchanges with a simple generalization of first\u2010order kinetics completely independent of transport. Specifically, we introduce a remobilization rate coefficient that depends on the time in immobile phase. Memory\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["1418"]}

Correctness or accuracy can be estimated (and improved) using verification. Verification is one of the main procedures to build trust in the numerical modeling of any phenomena. A full verification process comprises (a) solution verification (calculation verification) and (b) code verification. Presented in this paper are verification procedures for constitutive, elastic\u2013plastic integration algorithms, as used in computational nonlinear solid mechanics. Both explicit and implicit integration algorithms for elastic\u2013plastic constitutive equations are verified using existing and new developed verification technique. Verification techniques used include prescribed solution forcing and Richardson extrapolation. In\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1418"]}

The framework is crafted according to principles from both the software testing (sometimes known as Software Quality Engineering) and numerical testing fields. Herein, we describe the components and implementation of the test suite, which includes unit tests, regression tests and algorithm tests of convergence and accuracy. Our tests are applied to a transport model including advection, dispersion and reaction (source) components. We make use of analytical solutions obtained from the literature and from the Method of Manufactured Solutions. We discuss the incremental complexity of our algorithm tests, and the similarities and tension between the silent, automatic perspective of software testing and the verbose, graphical output required for public reporting of numerical verification and validation results.

In this paper, code verification in computational geomechanics based on the method of manufactured solutions (MMS) is discussed. The application of this technique, which is the most rigorous method among all code verification techniques, is presented through verification of an in-house geomechanics code based on the Edge-based Smoothed Point Interpolation Method (ESPIM) for spatial, and three-point scheme for temporal discretisation of the governing equations. The MMS, as a generic approach to construct all-inclusive and complex test solutions for code verification, is explained. Two manufactured solutions along with an order of accuracy study are employed in several different setups to obtain the numerical and formal order of accuracies of the code.

{"title": "Comparison of Current Methods for the Evaluation of Einstein\u2019s Integrals\n", "abstract": " Einstein\u2019s integrals constitute one of the salient developments in theoretical sediment mechanics. An analysis of the accuracy and computational efficiency of proposed methods for the calculation of the Einstein\u2019s integrals is presented. First, the accuracy of those techniques is determined using comparisons against highly accurate numerical results. For an infinite series solution, a study of accuracy versus number of terms in the partial sum is performed. Then, the central processing unit (CPU) times of the procedures are determined and compared over a full set of Rouse numbers and relative bedload-layer thicknesses. Finally, parallel versions of the methods are presented, and their parallel efficiency is assessed. Based on the criteria of accuracy, CPU time, and parallelization efficiency, it is concluded that the method by Guo and Julien, with modifications by Srivastava, is overall more efficient for implementation in\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1418"]}

The natural temperature fluctuation in the Colorado River in the Northern Arizona altered after construction of Glen Canyon Dam due to hypolimnetic withdrawal from the Dam's reservoir, Lake Powell. Several managerial remedies were considered to modify the tail-water temperature to preserve native fish habitat. In this review, I discuss the basics governing equations of heat transport in water. Then I provide the characteristics of the pre/post dam, time-series of temperature downstream of Lake Powell. Finally I discuss a simplified model which was suggested to predict water temperature in the Colorado River, downstream of the Glen Canyon Dam.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1418"]}
{"title": "Estimating soil thermal properties from land surface temperature measurements using ant colony optimization approach\n", "abstract": " Soil thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity are crucial parameters in land surface hydrology and hydro-climatology. There are several techniques (eg, heat-source probe, borehole relaxation, and heat-dissipation sensors) for in situ measurement of soil thermal properties. These methods are generally expensive and labor-intensive. In a departure with these in situ approaches, regression-based techniques have been developed to estimate soil thermal properties. They require several input variables such as soil texture, water content, organic content, etc, which are typically unavailable. To overcome the aforementioned drawbacks of these methods, a new approach is developed to estimate soil thermal properties from the sequences of land surface temperature (LST) measurements.

EFM emerged several decades ago as a response to the need of tools to study problems of flow and transport in rivers, estuaries, lakes, and the atmosphere; it is a topic of increasing concern for decision makers, engineers, and researchers alike. Several books have been published recently on EFM, but to the best of our knowledge none has dealt with the approach followed by this book.This book, which has been contributed by distinguished researchers in the field, discusses the processes of mass, momentum, and heat exchange at various environmental interfaces (this is where the novelty lies). The audience of the book is vast, but it is constituted mainly by researchers. Some chapters of the book could be used as supplemental material for lecture notes in the first years of graduate school in civil and environmental engineering, environmental science, atmospheric science, meteorology, limnology, oceanography, and geophysics. The book is organized in three parts with a total of ten chapters. Part one, which is composed of four chapters, covers the processes occurring at the interfaces of the atmosphere with deserts and seas. Part two deals in two chapters with the fluid mechanics of the interface between the atmosphere and water at smaller scales. Finally, part three discusses in four chapters the processes at the interfaces between fluids and biotic systems.
