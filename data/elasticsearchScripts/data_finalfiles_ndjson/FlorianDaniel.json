{"title": "Web service composition: a survey of techniques and tools\n", "abstract": " Web services are a consolidated reality of the modern Web with tremendous, increasing impact on everyday computing tasks. They turned the Web into the largest, most accepted, and most vivid distributed computing platform ever. Yet, the use and integration of Web services into composite services or applications, which is a highly sensible and conceptually non-trivial task, is still not unleashing its full magnitude of power. A consolidated analysis framework that advances the fundamental understanding of Web service composition building blocks in terms of concepts, models, languages, productivity support techniques, and tools is required. This framework is necessary to enable effective exploration, understanding, assessing, comparing, and selecting service composition models, languages, techniques, platforms, and tools.

In this paper, we show how generic process definitions based on XPDL can be seamlessly enriched with standard-conform exception handling constructs, starting from a high-level event-condition-action language. We further introduce a suitable rule compiler, enabling to yield portable process and exception definitions in a fully automated way.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["2103"]}
{"title": "Ngs: a framework for multi-domain query answering\n", "abstract": " If we consider a query involving multiple domains, such as \"find all database conferences held within six months in locations whose seasonal average temperature is 28degC and for which a cheap travel solution exists\", we note that (i) general- purpose search engines fail to answer multi-domain queries and (ii) specific search services may cover one of such domains, but no general integration framework is readily available. Currently, the only way to treat such cases is to separately query dedicated services and feed the result of one search as input to another, or to pairwise compare them by hand. This paper presents NGS, a framework providing fully automated support for cross-domain queries. In particular, NGS (a) integrates different kinds of services (search engines, web services, and wrapped web pages) into a global ontology, i.e., a unified view of the concepts supported by the available services, (b) covers\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["2103"]}
{"title": "Conversational data exploration\n", "abstract": " This paper presents a framework for the design of chatbots for data exploration. With respect to conversational virtual assistants (such as Amazon Alexa or Apple Siri), this class of chatbots exploits structured input to retrieve data from known data sources. The approach is based on a conceptual representation of the available data sources, and on a set of modeling abstractions that allow designers to characterize the role that key data elements play in the user requests to be handled. Starting from the resulting specifications, the framework then generates a conversation for exploring the content exposed by the considered data sources.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["2103"]}
{"title": "Supporting reuse of smart contracts through service orientation and assisted development\n", "abstract": " This paper focuses on two of the key challenges a developer encounters when reusing smart contracts: finding actionable information about existing smart contracts (descriptors) and writing the necessary integration logic to invoke selected contracts and implement missing functions. As for the former issue, the paper proposes a smart contract description format that allows the developer to search for publicly available contracts, understand which features a contract exposes and how to invoke them, according to a service-oriented approach. For the latter, the paper implements a simple, model-driven development environment consisting in a visual programming editor that provides a set of modeling constructs encoding specific, reuse-oriented code patterns. The approach is implemented and demonstrated in the context of the blockchain platform Ethereum and its programming language Solidity.
