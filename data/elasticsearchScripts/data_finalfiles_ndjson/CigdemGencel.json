This study brings suggestions on how to use COSMIC functional size as an input for effort estimation models and explores whether the productivity values for developing different functionality types deviate significantly from a total average productivity value computed from total functional size and effort figures.

The major difficulties arise due to: 1) diversity of definitions and terminology used for usability and UX aspects and attributes, which lead to inconsistencies, and 2) lack of a taxonomy for these attributes with links to well-defined measures in the literature. In this paper, we present a framework to support mobile industry to overcome these challenges. We first unified the terminology and definitions for usability and UX attributes in the literature. Then, we created taxonomy of attributes and sub-attributes. By using the well-known Goal Question Metric (GQM) approach, we identified a comprehensive set of questions and measures for each attribute that could be used as a basis for developing measurement instruments.

{"title": "On the relationship between different size measures in the software life cycle\n", "abstract": " Various measures and methods have been developed to measure the sizes of different software entities produced throughout the software life cycle. Understanding the nature of the relationship between the sizes of these products has become significant due to various reasons. One major reason is the ability to predict the size of the later phase products by using the sizes of early life cycle products. For example, we need to predict the Source Lines of Code (SLOC) from Function Points (FP) since SLOC is being used as the main input for most of the estimation models when this measure is not available yet. SLOC/FP ratios have been used by the industry for such purposes even though the assumed linear relationship has not been validated yet. Similarly, FP has recently started to be used to predict the Bytes of code for estimating the amount of spare memory needed in systems.

{"title": "A model for selecting an optimum set of measures in software organizations\n", "abstract": " Most of the software organizations face difficulties in choosing the measures to collect since there is no universal set of measures for all types of organizations and projects. Experience shows that measurement can be more successful if the measures are collected based on the goals of the organization or the project which it will serve. However, one of the major constraints for the organizations is the associated cost for the resources needed when collecting the measures. Therefore, based on their goals, the software organizations require collecting not only as few measures from a large number of possible measures as possible but an optimum set of measures as well. In this paper, we propose a model, called \u2018Optimum Measures Set Decision (OMSD) Model\u2019, which is an extension of the well-known Goal Question Metric (GQM) paradigm using a heuristics approach.

Product managers face the challenge of identifying the high value features in an application and weeding out the ones of low value from the next releases. What creates this challenge is the fact that customer perceived value is an attribute, dimensions of which are not well-known yet. Currently, software companies try to assess the value of features through interviewing a number of key stakeholders. However, the literature suggests that, this kind of evaluation could be misleading due to stakeholders having different understanding of what value refers to. In this paper, through an exploratory case study, we investigate how usage of features relate to their perceived value and shed light into the factors affecting this relationship.

Some of the features lose their value in time, others are less valuable than intended from the very beginning.

Therefore, the challenge is to monitor the customer's perceived value of the features in order to define strategies how to improve the product.

A survey was conducted with 78 second-year Software Engineering and Computer Science MSc students at the Blekinge Institute of Technology in Sweden. The students were randomly assigned candidate supervisors. They were asked to fill in a questionnaire, which included two measurement instruments: 1) Generalized Immediacy Scale (GI) to measure the perceived non-verbal immediacy level and 2) Individualized Trust Scale (ITS) to measure trustworthiness of the assigned supervisor. Our analysis showed a strong positive association between the non-verbal immediacy level and the perceived trustworthiness of supervisors by students. We further observed that there was low variance between the students in how they perceived each individual supervisor in terms of non-verbal immediacy and trustworthiness. Thus, we conclude that if supervisors make conscious decisions to improve their non-verbal immediacy skills, this most likely would affect increasing their perceived trustworthiness by overall students and hence could attract good students for their supervision.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1995"]}
{"title": "From performance measurement to project estimating using COSMIC functional sizing\n", "abstract": " This paper introduces the role and importance of the measurement of software sizes when measuring the performance of software activities and in estimating effort, etc, for new software projects. We then describe three standard software sizing methods (the Albrecht/IFPUG, MkII FPA and COSMIC methods) that have claimed to be functional size measurement methods and examine the true nature of their size scales. We find that sizes produced by the Albrecht/IFPUG and MkII FPA methods are actually on a scale of \u2018standard (development) effort\u2019. Only the COSMIC method gives a true measure of functional size and is thus best-suited for performance comparisons across projects using different technologies. We conclude that in principle, different types of scales, one measuring functional size and the other standard effort, may be desirable for the different purposes of performance measurement and for estimating, respectively. It then follows that for estimating purposes it might be attractive to define a COSMIC-enabled estimating process in which weights are assigned to the components of a COSMIC functional size dependent on the technology to be used by the project being estimated and maybe on other factors. The resulting COSMIC \u2018standard effort\u2019scale for the given technology, etc., might be expected to yield more accurate project effort estimates than using the standard COSMIC functional size scale.
