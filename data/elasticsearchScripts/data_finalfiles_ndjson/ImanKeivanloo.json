{"title": "SE-EQUAM\u2013An Evolvable Quality Metamodel\n", "abstract": " Quality has become a key assessment factor for organizations to determine if their software ecosystems are capable to meet constantly changing environmental factors and requirements. Many quality models exist to assess the evolvability or maintainability of software systems. Common to these models is that they, contrary to the software ecosystems they are assessing, are not evolvable or reusable. In this research, we introduce SE-EQUAM a novel ontology-based quality assessment metamodel that was designed from ground up to support model reuse and evolvability. SE-EQUAM takes advantage of Semantic Web technologies such as support for the open world assumption, incremental knowledge population, and knowledge inference. We present a case study that illustrates the reusability and evolvability of our SE-EQUAM approach.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["2057"]}
{"title": "Online Sharing and Integration of Results from Mining Software Repositories\n", "abstract": " The mining of software repository involves the extraction of both basic and value-added information from existing software repositories. Depending on stakeholders (e.g., researchers, management), these repositories are mined several times for different application purposes. To avoid unnecessary pre-processing steps and improve productivity, sharing, and integration of extracted facts and results are needed. The motivation of this research is to introduce a novel collaborative sharing platform for software datasets that supports on-the-fly inter-datasets integration. We want to facilitate and promote a paradigm shift in the source code analysis domain, similar to the one by Wikipedia in the knowledge-sharing domain. In this paper, we present the SeCold project, which is the first online, publicly available software ecosystem Linked Data dataset. As part of this research, not only theoretical background on how to publish\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["2057"]}
{"title": "Source code similarity and clone search\n", "abstract": " Historically, clone detection as a research discipline has focused on devising source code similarity measurement and search solutions to cancel out effects of code reuse in software maintenance. However, it has also been observed that identifying duplications and similar programming patterns can be exploited for pragmatic reuse. Identifying such patterns requires a source code similarity model for detection of Type-1, 2, and 3 clones. Due to the lack of such a model, ad-hoc pattern detection models have been devised as part of state of the art solutions that support pragmatic reuse via code search.  In this dissertation, we propose a clone search model which is based on the clone detection principles and satisfies the fundamental requirements for supporting pragmatic reuse. Our research presents a clone search model that not only supports scalability, short response times, and Type-1, 2 and 3 detection, but also emphasizes the need for supporting ranking as a key functionality. Our model takes advantage of a multi-level (non-positional) indexing approach to achieve a scalable and fast retrieval with high recall. Result sets are ranked using two ranking approaches: Jaccard similarity coefficient and the cosine similarity (vector space model) which exploits the code patterns\u2019 local and global frequencies. We also extend the model by adapting a form of semantic search to cover bytecode code. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed clone search model can be applied for spotting working code examples in the context of pragmatic reuse. Further evidence of the applicability of the clone search model is provided through performance evaluation.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["2057"]}
{"title": "An Architecture for Context-Aware Semantic Web Services\n", "abstract": " Context awareness in Web services is gaining momentum. Since it is not a trivial task, it suffers from lack of a general solution. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for context-aware semantic Web services which is applicable for any environment. It is established based on composition of context provider Web services and other context-aware semantic Web services. In addition, an extended version of the semantic Web service ontology language for semantic Web services is introduced, in order to make it possible to find appropriate context-aware semantic Web services based on available context information. So as to make it applicable for any environment, the solution does not hold any assumption about the user's context source. Rather, the property of context level is defined.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["2057"]}
{"title": "Leveraging Clone Detection for Internet-Scale Source Code Search\n", "abstract": " Different approaches to search for source code on the Internet exist. In this paper, we propose techniques that support a special type of Internet-scale code search using two novel syntactical and semantic clone search and detection methods. The syntactical search focuses on providing a scalable real-time engine, while the semantic clone detection is being used to enrich our knowledge base during the offline processing step.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["2057"]}

{"title": "Semi-automatic Context-Aware Composition of Semantic Web Services\n", "abstract": " In many cases, atomic semantic Web services are not able to provide requested functionalities. Therefore, in order to satisfy users' requests, the composition task is required on available atomic services. In addition, context awareness in Web services is gaining momentum as the opportunity to benefit the interactions between human, applications and the environment. So it seems reasonable to use available context information in composition procedure to provide a composite semantic Web service which is adapted to the context of participant Web services and the requester. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for semi-automatic context-aware graph-based composition of semantic Web services. It also enhances the composition approach by exploiting available textual service descriptions to help the developer find better compositions among available ones.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["2057"]}
{"title": "A joint packet coding and attaching scheme for wireless networks\n", "abstract": " Network coding is realized to have great potential for improving throughput limitation of current multi-hop wireless networks. Existing network coding schemes (e.g. COPE) find coding opportunities and use them in forwarding multiple packets, which are coded together, in a single transmission, and consequently, they achieve several fold increase in the throughput of wireless networks. In this paper, we propose CAPO, a new protocol for multi-hop wireless networks, which do attaching packets in addition to coding them. CAPO has an attaching module which attaches non-encoded packets together opportunistically. We show in this paper that CAPO can convey more packets in a single transmission than COPE using this module. In addition, it has a lazy decoding process which tries to decode stored coded packets, whenever it is needed, to increase the decoding probability leading to reduction in the number of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2057"]}
