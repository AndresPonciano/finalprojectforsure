One of the most important decisions in fleet management is the optimization of vehicle scheduling during an accident, such as a vehicle breakdown and mechanical failure during delivery. The schedule planner has to assign another vehicle to take over the task; thus, accident handling needs the reassignment or re-scheduling of vehicles. The large number of available vehicles for reassignment and numerous trips in a day make rescheduling complicated and difficult to resolve. In this paper, we propose a CFMS integrated with global positioning system (GPS) for real-time vehicle positioning and eSeal enabled by the RFID technology, to help human planners with rescheduling.

{"title": "A research agenda on managerial intention to green it adoption: from norm activation perspective\n", "abstract": " Green IT adoption is a plausible attempt for organizations to tackle the current environmental problem, and can also improve the economic performance of an organization. Therefore, organizational adoption of Green IT is beneficial to the society. Investigating how the decision maker in an organization would come to adopt Green IT is necessary to establish strategies in promoting organizational adoption of Green IT adoption because decision makers make decisions, rather than organizations. However, to our knowledge, studies in Green IT literature seldom investigate this area. In Green IT literature, emphasis has been given on the effects of institutional pressures and organizational resources on organizational adoption of Green IT. The current study adapts a Norm Activation Model in organizational context to investigate on how an intention to Green IT adoption is formed. The decision makers' personal norm on environmental interpretation is argued to be activated when environmental preservation is interpreted as an opportunity, which may lead to intention to Green IT adoption. Perceived competitive advantage of Green IT will affect how environmental preservation is interpreted, as well as affect intention to Green IT adoption. Moreover, discretionary slack will also affect how environmental preservation is interpreted. All of these should be tested empirically to see if the results support our proposed hypotheses. Empirical data for this study will be collected via a survey.", "num_citations": "38\n", "authors": ["1170"]}

{"title": "Update on positron emission tomography for hepatocellular carcinoma\n", "abstract": " Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is conventionally evaluated with ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Positron emission tomography (PET) using the commonest radiotracer fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F] FDG) has only a moderate sensitivity in detecting the primary tumour. This leads to the use of other radiotracers with better sensitivity for HCC, including carbon-11 acetate, carbon-11 choline, and fluorine-18 fluorocholine. PET using dual tracers (FDG complemented with a non-FDG tracer) can optimise the diagnostic performance. Although [18F] FDG PET has a limited role in detecting the primary tumour, it is more accurate in diagnosing extrahepatic metastases, which may affect treatment planning. Pre-treatment [18F] FDG PET also has a potential role in predicting prognosis and treatment outcomes, and supplementing established criteria to select patients for liver transplantation. Post-treatment PET may evaluate therapeutic response or detect tumour recurrence but supporting data remain relatively limited. There has been rapid advancement in the usage of PET for HCC; this warrants further prospective studies to confirm the role of PET in clinical management.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1170"]}

Its applications have been strong in the financial services, insurance, retailing and healthcare sectors, while in manufacturing, companies such as Rolls Royce and Ford have been reported to derive success from big data in predicting engine failures before they occur and in managing supplier risk (Goodwin 2013).For Operations Management, big data has the potential to enable more sophisticated data-driven decision making and new ways to organise, learn and innovate (Yiu 2012; Kiron 2013). Its impact may be manifest in strengthening customer relationships, managing operations risk, improving operational efficiency or by improving product or service delivery or whatever the key business drivers may be (Kiron\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1170"]}
{"title": "Modelling the impact of perceived connectivity on the intention to use social media: discovering mediating effects and unobserved heterogeneity\n", "abstract": " Early research examined the direct effect of perceived connectivity (PC) on intention to adopt information systems. In this study, we extend that research stream by examining the mediating effects of perceived enjoyment (PE) and perceived playfulness (PP) on the relationship between PC and the intention to use social media within the workplace. To test our proposed model, we collected data from 2,556 social media users from Australia, Canada, India, the UK, and the US. We applied the REBUS-PLS algorithm, a response-based method for detecting unit segments in PLS path modelling and assessing the unobserved heterogeneity in the data sample. Based on the strength of effects, the algorithm automatically detected two groups of users sharing the same intentions to use social media. A post hoc analysis of each group was done using contextual and demographic variables including geographic location, country, age, education and gender. Implications for practice and research are discussed.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1170"]}
{"title": "Methods, apparatus and systems for green shipping practice assessment\n", "abstract": " This invention discloses methods, apparatus and systems for assessing an extent of green shipping activities practised by a shipping company. The invention is based on enquiring the shipping company with questions in the dimensions of Company Policy and Procedure, of Shipping Documentation, of Shipping Equipment, of Shipping Cooperation, of Shipping Materials, and of Shipping Design Compliance. These six dimensions constitute six dimensions empirically validated to be essential for assessing the extent of green shipping activities. After the shipping company gives the answers, the answers to questions of each dimension are processed to yield an intermediate result. The resultant six intermediate results are then processed to evaluate the extent of green shipping activities, in order that all the six dimensions are considered in assessing the extent of green shipping activities.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1170"]}
{"title": "ATheoretical FRAMEWORK OF THE INFLUENCE OF MOBILITY IN CONTINUED USAGE INTENTION OF SMART MOBILE DEVICE\n", "abstract": " In the face of fierce competition in the mobile device market, the only way for smart mobile device producers to maintain and expand their market share is to design and develop products that meet users\u2019 expectations. With the increasing importance of smart mobile devices in people\u2019s lives, mobility is likely to be a key feature that addresses the needs of mobile phone users. Therefore, this survey investigates mobility in four essential aspects: spatiality, temporality, contextuality, and social fluidity with the purpose of finding mobile device functions that users value highly. Special attention is paid to how these constructs affect continued usage intention (CUI) through two intermediates: user confirmation and user satisfaction.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1170"]}

The actual benefits of RFID adoption remain   controversial among academics and practitioners. The present study   provides empirical evidence of the impact of RFID adoption on   operating performance. Preliminary findings on 180 manufacturing firms   that adopted RFID in the United States reveal positive effects on the   firms\u00a1\u00a6 long-term operating performance. Over five years of adopting   RFID, inventory days, labor productivity, and sales growth   significantly improved by 9.38 days, US$ 3,280 per employee, and   3.42%, respectively.  Overall, this study provides one of the first   objective evidences of the direction and magnitude of the effects of   RFID adoption on firm operating performance.

{"title": "Governance mechnisms in IS outsourcing projects in transition econmies\n", "abstract": " Pevious IS outsourcing research studies failed to provide evidences on how IT client-vendor relationships should be governed to ensure project success and relational continuity. More importantly, it is even challenging for companies to achieve outsourcing success in transition economies facing an environment characterized by institutional instability. This article draws from theories of institutions and organizations to develop a model examining outsourcing relationship governance mechanisms which would affect outsourcing success in state-owned and non-state-owned Chinese companies. Results of 72 state-owned and 54 non-state-owned outsourcing projects show that the positive relationship between contractual governance and outsourcing success is stronger in state-owned firms than in non-state-owned firms. On the other hand, non-state-owned firms have stronger effects on the relationships between relational governance and outsourcing success, and between outsourcing success and relational continuity.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1170"]}
{"title": "Virtual Distribution Systems: an integrated model with research initiatives\n", "abstract": " In this article, we attempt to give a comprehensive review of how classical supply chain models have evolved with advances in information technology and its related branches of knowledge. To illustrate a possible solution to meet the challenges of the present day, we propose a model of a Virtual Distribution System for a supplier (or a group of suppliers) to use in planning and operating the distribution of goods and merchandise to customers over the entire region. These customers often demand that the products they have ordered be delivered to their preferred destinations in a highly efficient way. The modular structure of this system enables it to be more flexible and responsive to dynamic changes in the market. Illustrative example of the solution obtained by the main distribution model is given in the paper.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1170"]}
{"title": "Research issues of the IT productivity paradox: approaches, limitations, and a proposed conceptual framework\n", "abstract": " Although corporations in the western world, especially those in the United States, have spent generously on information technology (IT) and information systems (IS) in recent decades, many empirical studies have found limited evidence for the payoffs of surging IT expenditures. In some cases, measures of IT spending were found to be either uncorrelated, or negatively associated, with the productivity or financial performance of the sample firms. To the dismay of the researchers and business executives, the phenomenon of the IT productivity paradox lingers on to this day. A review of the literature on this subject has pointed out several possible reasons underlying such inconsistencies, which include data and methodological problems and limitations of research models. Moreover, many of these studies have been criticized as weak in theoretical underpinning when they simply fed data into statistical models for the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1170"]}

{"title": "Special issue editorial: business-to-business (B2B) e-Commerce for competitive supply-chain management\n", "abstract": " B2B e-Commerce is projected to exceed $1 trillion in annual revenues by 2004. Supply-chain management (SCM) has been considered as one of the most popular operations strategies in the twenty-first century for improving organizational effectiveness. The effectiveness of SCM depends upon the level of integration between suppliers, partners and customers that are dispersed all over the world. This outlines the significance of communication, and hence the information technologies such as electronic data interchange (EDI), the internet and world-wide web (WWW) together with enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. A review of the literature and reported case experiences reveal that there is a need for further research on the application of B2B e-Commerce in the development and operation of an integrated and effective supply chain.

{"title": "Electronic Commerce and Education\n", "abstract": " The business environment of the new millennium is dynamic, competitive, and constantly changing. This change was largely powered by developments in infor-mation and communication technologies, such as the Internet and e-commerce (EC). EC has become an important topic and buzzword in our daily life. Although much was written about EC technologies and about the business side ofEC, there is a lack ofstudies on EC and education. Educational institutions attempted to respond swiftly by changing their curriculum and teaching and learning with a view to accommodating the changes in instructional technologies, such as the Internet and e-learning systems, and to offering new programs related to the subject of the Internet and EC. This special issue presents eight papers mainly arising from the International Workshop on EC and Education in July 2003 in Hong Kong, the People's Republic of China.
