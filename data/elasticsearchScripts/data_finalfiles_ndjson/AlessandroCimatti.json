{"title": "Planning via model checking: A decision procedure for AR\n", "abstract": " In this paper we propose a new approach to planning based on a \u201chigh level action language\u201d, called AR, and \u201cmodel checking\u201d. AR is an expressive formalism which is able to handle, among other things, ramifications and non-deterministic effects. We define a decision procedure for planning in AR which is based on \u201csymbolic model checking\u201d, a technique which has been successfully applied in hardware and software verification. The decision procedure always terminates with an optimal solution or with failure if no solution exists. We have constructed a planner, called MBP, which implements the decision procedure.", "num_citations": "199\n", "authors": ["1613"]}
