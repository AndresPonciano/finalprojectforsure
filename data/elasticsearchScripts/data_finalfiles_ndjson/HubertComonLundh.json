{"title": "Solving inequations in terms algebras\n", "abstract": " Let T be the theory of term algebra over the relational symbols = or >or=, where >or= is interpreted as a lexicographic path ordering. The decidability of the purely existential fragment of T is shown. The proof is carried out in three steps. The first step consists of the transformation of any quantifier-free formula phi (i.e. all variables are free) into a solved form that has the same set of solutions as phi . Then the author shows how to decide the satisfiability of some particular problems called simple systems. A simple system is a formula which defines a total ordering on the terms occurring in it and which is closed under deduction. This last property means that if psi is a solved form of a simple system phi then psi must be a subformula of phi . The proof is completed by showing how to reduce the satisfiability of an arbitrary solved form to the satisfiability of finitely many simple systems.< >", "num_citations": "52\n", "authors": ["1885"]}

On the other hand, cryptographic models propose a tighter modeling but proofs are more difficult to write and to check. An approach developed during the last decade consists in bridging the two approaches, showing that symbolic models are \\emph{sound} w.r.t. symbolic ones, yielding strong security guarantees using automatic tools. These results have been developed for several cryptographic primitives (e.g. symmetric and asymmetric encryption, signatures, hash) and security properties.

{"title": "Constraint solving, exclusive or and the decision of confidentiality for security protocols assuming a bounded number of sessions\n", "abstract": " We present decidability results for the verification of cryptographic protocols in the presence of equational theories corresponding to xor and Abelian groups. Since the perfect cryptography assumption is unrealistic for cryptographic primitives with visible algebraic properties such as xor, we extend the conventional Dolev-Yao model by permitting the intruder to exploit these properties. We show that the reachability problem is NP-complete for the extended intruder theories in the cases of xor and Abelian groups. This result follows from a normal proof theorem. Then, we show how to lift this result in the xor case: we consider a symbolic constraint system expressing the reachability (eg, secrecy) problem for a finite number of sessions. We prove that such constraint system is decidable, relying in particular on an extension of combination algorithms for unification procedures. As a corollary, this enables automatic symbolic verification of cryptographic protocols employing xor for a fixed number of sessions.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1885"]}
{"title": "Negation elimination in equational formulae\n", "abstract": " An equational formula is a first order formula over an alphabet F of function symbols and the equality predicate symbol.

(without equations in disjunctions) if its solved forms do not contain any subformula s = t V u \u2260 v. A unification problem is any equational problem which does not contain any negation (in particular, it should not contain any disequation). We give a terminating set of transformation rules such that a w.e.d. formula \u03c6 is (semantically) equivalent to a unification problem iff its irreducible forn is a unification problem. This result can be formulated in another way: our set of transformation rules computes a finite complete set of \u201cmost general unifiers\u201d for a w.e.d. formula each time such a finite set exists.

{"title": "Verification of security protocols with a bounded number of sessions based on resolution for rigid variables\n", "abstract": " First-order logic resolution is a standard way to automate the verification of security protocols. However, it sometimes fails to produce security proofs for secure protocols because of the detection of false attacks. For the verification of a bounded number of sessions, false attacks can be avoided by introducing rigid variables. Unfortunately, this yields complicated resolution procedures. We show here that there is a simple translation of the security problem for a bounded number of sessions into first-order logic, that does not introduce false attacks. This is shown by translating clauses involving rigid variables into classical first-order clauses, while preserving satisfiability. We illustrate this approach by giving a complete and terminating strategy for a first-order logic fragment resulting from the above translation, that yields a decision procedure for a bounded number of sessions.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1885"]}

Solving a deducibility constraint amounts to finding all possible ways of filling the gaps in a proof. For finite local inference systems, there is an algorithm that reduces any deducibility constraint to a finite set of solved forms. This allows one to decide any trace security property of cryptographic protocols.We investigate here the case of infinite local inference systems, through the case study of blind signatures. We show that, in this case again, any deducibility constraint can be reduced to finitely many solved forms (hence we can decide trace security properties).

In our framework, the guards are conjunctions of atomic constraints yi# yj+ ci; j where yi is either x0 i or xi, the values of the counter i respectively after and before the transition, and# is any relational symbol in f=;;;>;< g. We show that the binary relation between the registers values, which is de ned by a counter automaton whose control is at (no nested loops), is de nable in the additive theory of N (or Z or Q or R depending on the type of the counters). In particular, we show that adding a xed point to the above guards, we stay within Presburger arithmetic (resp. additive theory of Z, Q, R). We actually prove a slightly more general result: the number of transition steps can be a free variable of the formula. We also show that whether a given loop can be in nitely iterated or not is decidable. As a consequence of these results, reachability and emptiness are decidable for at counter automata.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1885"]}

{"title": "How to characterize the language of ground normal forms\n", "abstract": " Term rewriting systems provide the computer scientists with a language to express functional definitions on complex domains. In such an area, we face the problem to characterize the ground normal forms (without any variables) as they are the results of computations. Doing that allows one to check the completeness of a functional definition (then the ground normal forms are built only with constructors) or to check the equivalence of two different functional definitions (it is possible to establish a one-to-one correspondence between the ground normal forms). We present here a characterization of the ground normal forms in terms of grammar, and an algorithm to derive it from the form of the left-hand sides of the rewrite rules. When the left-hand sides are linear, the form of the grammar is especially simple as it is context-free when we consider the terms as words, written for instance in prefix form. Therefore we get a decision procedure for the finiteness of the set of ground normal forms and we are also able to compute the normal forms which are the instances of a given linear term. The ideas behind the algorithms we present are very simple and we illustrate them by several examples.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1885"]}
{"title": "Formal Proofs of Security Protocols using Oblivious Transfers\n", "abstract": " 1 BackgroundOur group is working on formal security proofs of cryptographic protocols. Such protocols are distributed programs that rely on cryptographic primitives such as encryption, hash function, signatures, etc. They are used in many applications: secure transactions on Internet, mobile phones, smartcards, RFID chips, electronic voting, etc. Caroline Fontaine, who joined our group recently, has proposed a protocol for privacypreserving fingerprinted image distribution that aims at achieving several goals, including traitor tracing, buyer-and item-unlinkability [6]. The formal proof of such a protocol is challenging for several reasons, some of which are the starting point of the proposed research. We describe below some of the problems that we wish to consider. Depending on the level of the internship (Bachelor, M1, M2), one or more questions could be addressed. They are listed in increasing order of required knowledge. The internship will take place at LSV, Cachan. There are three advisors as we are all interested in the problem; we expect frequent interactions.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1885"]}
{"title": "Formal Security Proofs.\n", "abstract": " The goal of the lecture is to present some aspects of formal security proofs of protocols. This is a wide area, and there is another lecture (by B. Banchet) on related topics. The idea is therefore to explain in depth one particular technique, that relies on deducibility constraints. We rely mainly on two introductory documents [8, 14]. Actually, the current notes are the beginning of [8]. Here is a roadmap:1. We introduce the problem with examples and touch a little the question of the validity of the security models (section 1). We describe then a small process algebra, that will serve as a model for the protocols, as well as a few security properties (section 2). 2. The core of the lecture is here: we introduce the attacker model, as a deduction system, and show how to represent any execution in the hostile environment as deducibility constraints. In short, a deducibility constraint is a sequence of proofs, in which some parts are unknown (and formalized with variables) and possibly re-used in other constraints. An instance of such a constraints yields an attacker\u2019s strategy.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1885"]}

{"title": "Computational soundness of observational equivalence\n", "abstract": " Many security properties are naturally expressed as indistinguishability between two versions of a protocol. In this paper, we show that computational proofs of indistinguishability can be considerably simplified, for a class of processes that covers most existing protocols. More precisely, we show a soundness theorem, following the line of research launched by Abadi and Rogaway in 2000: computational indistinguishability in presence of an active attacker is implied by the observational equivalence of the corresponding symbolic processes. Up to our knowledge, the only result of this kind is Adao and Fournet [7], in which, however, cryptographic primitives are not part of the syntax. Otherwise, previous works either considered a passive attacker, or, in case of active attackers, proved a soundness result for properties that can be defined on execution traces of the protocol. Anonymity for instance does not fall in the latter category.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1885"]}
{"title": "A formal verification of telephone supplementary service interactions\n", "abstract": " This paper describes a case study in service interactions which has been carried jointly by Alcatel and the public research laboratory LSV. The purpose of the case study is to formally check the expected properties of a service against a specification of its implementation, in presence of additional services. More generally, we want to derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which the expected property of a service is not modified when some other services interact. Up to our knowledge, this is the first formal exhaustive study of some supplementary services interactions. There are a number of formal studies of interactions (for instance [KL98], and, for a more exhaustive list,[KK98]). However, all these studies may succeed in detecting some undesirable interactions (called interferences, following the terminology of [KK98]), but do not prove that the list is exhaustive. In principle, it is possible to detect interferences by some well chosen simulations, while proving that there are no (other) interferences (than those already 1", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1885"]}

It was a success of term rewriting in the area of inductive proofs: completion techniques were able to prove fully automatically some inductive theorems which seemed at that time impossible to prove without any user interaction (lemmas). The most famous example, given in [8], concerns the equation rev (rev (x))= x which usually requires a lemma stating that append is associative. There are several works explaining or extending this approach; let us cite for instance [12, 11, 2].
