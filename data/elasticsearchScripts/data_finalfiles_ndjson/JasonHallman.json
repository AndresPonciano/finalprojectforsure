{"title": "Evaluating an intervention to improve belt fit for adult occupants\n", "abstract": " IntroductionPrevious laboratory studies have demonstrated that some drivers position their seat belts suboptimally. Specifically, the lap portion of the belt may be higher and farther forward relative to the pelvis than best practice, and the shoulder portion of the belt may be outboard or inboard of mid-shoulder. This study evaluated the performance of a video-based intervention for improving the belt fit obtained by drivers.MethodTwenty-nine adult drivers participated in this study. Belt fit was measured before and after the intervention in participants\u2019 vehicles and in a laboratory mockup.ResultsData from both the in-vehicle and laboratory belt measures found that 95% of participants sampled improved some aspect of lap belt fit. For the in-vehicle test conditions, participants who lowered the lap belt location (Z) after the intervention showed an improvement of 26 mm on average.

{"title": "Effects of Occupant and Vehicle Factors on Three\u2010Point Belt Fit in Rear Seats\n", "abstract": " Seat belt fit relative to the occupant\u2019s anatomy affects kinematics and may affect injury risk in crashes. Recent studies have shown that belt routing for drivers is significantly associated with occupant characteristics, particularly body mass index (BMI), as well as belt upper anchorage location. The current research study examined belt positioning and fit in rear seating conditions with fixed seat back angles and a range of lower extremity postures. Lap\u2010belt and shoulder\u2010belt fit were measured in a rear seat mockup for 89 men and women with a wide range of body size and age. On average, the participants wore the lap belt fully above the anterior superior iliac spine landmark on the pelvis. High BMI was associated with occupants wearing the belt in higher and more\u2010forward lap\u2010belt positions. An increase in thigh angle relative to horizontal, which may occur with lower seat heights and constrained foot positions, was associated with occupants using higher lap belt positions. Age also had significant effects on how the lap and shoulder belt was worn, as did belt anchorage locations. These results suggest that continued research is needed to determine effective interventions to improve belt wearing and fit for rear\u2010seat occupants.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["2272"]}
{"title": "Gender and aging: considerations for orthopaedics\n", "abstract": " Biomechanics, as a science, refers to the study of the mechanics of biological systems. As such, the biomechanical response of the human body is dependent on several factors including geometry, material properties, boundary conditions, and loading. Whereas boundary conditions and loading describe the external environment, geometry and material properties are inherent characteristics of the biological system. The biological system can be composed of a single tissue (eg, ligament) or a composite of multiple tissues acting in concert to achieve a specific response. For example, on a segmental level, opposing vertebrae of the spine are interconnected by the intervertebral discs, facet joints, ligaments, and muscles. These tissues act together to provide stability to the body and limit motions within the physiologic realm. Likewise, the response of the human knee joint is governed by opposing long bones, ligaments\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["2272"]}

Although experiments may reveal complex two-dimensional (2D) deformation response to boundary conditions, biomechanical studies have heretofore employed only uniaxial chestband contour quantifying measurements. The present study described and evaluated an algorithm by which source subject-specific contour data may be systematically mapped to a target generalized anthropometry for computational studies of biomechanical response or anthropomorphic test dummy development. Algorithm performance was evaluated using chestband contour datasets from two rigid lateral impact boundary conditions: Flat wall and anterior-oblique wall. Comparing source and target anthropometry contours, peak deflections and deformation-time traces deviated by less than 4%. These\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["2272"]}

{"title": "Detrimental thoracoabdominal interaction with lateral airbag restraints\n", "abstract": " Side impact motor vehicle crashes pose unique challenges for occupant protection, particularly with regard to torso injury mitigation. The minimal crush distance between the vehicle exterior and the occupant torso has necessitated advanced passive safety technologies in response to tightened regulatory requirements and increased public awareness of safety issues. In particular, lateral airbag restraints (side airbags) have undergone a rapid and unregulated introduction in recent years, with US availability increasing to over 90% of new vehicles in 2010. As with frontal airbag restraints, the propensity for injury to occupants in close proximity to side airbag deployment remains a concern. Test protocols have been proposed to evaluate occupant injury risk from airbag deployment with mechanical occupant surrogates. Yet few studies have attempted to characterize thoracoabdominal responses to close-proximity\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["2272"]}

However, stationary conditions may not always represent real world OOP scenarios. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of OOP torso side airbag deployment, comparing a stationary test protocol with dynamic conditions. A combination of parametric computational modeling and PMHS tests were utilized to examine the effects of impact velocity on C and VC injury metrics. Dynamic OOP scenarios induced metrics greater than the stationary condition as well as impact in absence of airbag. The sensitivity of VC and implications for visceral trauma are also discussed.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["2272"]}

In some vehicles, small backsets are also associated with complaints of head restraint interference with drivers\u2019 preferred head positions. The objective of this study is to examine head/head restraint distances using data from a lab study of driving posture to provide guidance for safe and comfortable head restraint design.Methods: Head positions were measured for 88\u2009U.S. drivers in a laboratory mockup using a seat from a mid-size sedan.

The assemblies may include inflatable devices such as an airbag mounted within a removable seat with conduit connecting the inflatable device to a seat connection. The seat connection may be adapted to connect to an inflator connection that is connected to an inflator assembly within the vehicle. Such assemblies allow the inflatable device to be in fluid communication with the inflator assembly when in an installed position, and to allow the inflator assembly to remain attached within the vehicle when the seat is in a removed position.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2272"]}
{"title": "A Statistical analysis of driver knee locations relative to vehicle, occupant and belt fit variables\n", "abstract": " Recent analyses of driver belt fit have shown a strong influence of body mass index (BMI), defined by body mass in kilograms divided by stature in meters squared. In a laboratory study, the average location of the lap belt relative to the anterior\u2010superior iliac spine (ASIS) landmarks of the pelvis was 51 mm further forward for individuals with BMI of 35 kg/m\u00b2 than for those with BMI of 25 kg/m\u00b2. Individuals with BMI of 25 kg/m experienced belt locations about twice as far from the pelvic bone as was observed with the Hybrid\u2010III mid-size-male ATD. These findings suggest that load sharing between the lap belt and knee bolster in a frontal impact may be different for drivers and ATDs. A key consideration is the initial position of the driver\u2019s knees relative to the bolster. Although several studies of knee location have been published, no statistical model describing the distribution of driver knee locations across vehicle package layouts is available. Moreover, the relationship between lap belt fit and driver knee location relative to the vehicle is unknown.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2272"]}
