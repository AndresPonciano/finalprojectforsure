While research on the topic is emerging, it has this far been predominantly focused to technical and legal issues. To broaden our understanding of blockchain technology based services and platforms, we build on earlier literature on payments and payment platforms and propose a research agenda divided into three focal areas of 1) organizational issues; 2) issues related to the competitive environment; and 3) technology design issues. We discuss several salient themes within each of these areas, and derive a set of research question for each theme, highlighting the need to address both risks and opportunities for users, as well as different types of stakeholder organizations. With this research agenda, we contribute to the discussion on future avenues for Information Systems research on blockchain technology based platforms and services.", "num_citations": "218\n", "authors": ["877"]}

Based on a systematic literature review and a research engagement over a three-year period of data gathering, my dissertation describes how organizations leverage OSS practices to produce software. Leveraging OSS can be divided into two processes: 1) inbounding (moving public assets inside a company) and 2) outbounding(publishing) OSS. I outline the structural consequences these changes in software production entail and provoke. My research question is: What is the relation between local renegotiation of the term OSS and the organizational change provoked by OSS technology?  I chose a qualitative approach to examine the case companies, informed by OSS research and institutional theory. The bulk of the data emerges from the industrial ITEA-COSI project, which focused on software commodification. I aim to provide a narrative of how the term OSS travels from the writings of enthusiasts to the daily work practices of software producing organizations. The findings underline the importance of local renegotiation of the term OSS. This renegotiation provokes structural changes in 1) the organizations that adopt OSS technology, but more widely also in 2) the industries these companies operate in.  The main contribution of this research thesis, reported in four essays, is directed at two audiences: first, at academics, to promote the idea that OSS in organizations should be researched in a sensitivized manner.

It came into existence at a time when investors were looking for an alternative system for the traditional financial institutions. They wanted a system, which offers high transparency, low transaction fee, and high returns on their investment. Bitcoin is a decentralized system, which reveals all the transactions to the investors, providing a high degree of transparency. It operates without a centralized authority, so the transaction fee will be lower than the traditional financial institutions. The value of the Bitcoin can increase over a period and investors can expect high returns on their investment. As the market for the Bitcoin expanded, Bitcoin exchanges were formed, where investors can trade the fiat currencies for Bitcoins and vice versa. They became targets for the cyber criminals and lost bitcoins worth of millions of dollars in cyber-attacks, diminishing the value of Bitcoin. There is a lack of transparency in disclosing the details of the cyber-attacks to their customers by the exchanges. Bitcoin is failing to provide a solution for these issues and is operating like a traditional financial institution. In this paper, we will discuss how Bitcoin is a social movement using framing theory, examine various kinds of cyber-attacks that occurred on Bitcoin exchanges, their impact on Bitcoin, and make suggestions for the Bitcoin community to continue as a social movement in the financial industry.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["877"]}

Contrary to the prior depiction that the subtract ability of common pool resources is deleterious, we argue that subtraction is essential to attracting private investment. Specifically, making open data more subtract able, will not only attract further private and public use but also induce eventual releases of private and commercial data to form a marketplace of data complements.

Several reports from industry offer useful practical design considerations for APIs, including advice on collecting usage data, monetization strategies, and at what point to open an API to external parties. Although this advice can be useful, the focus is still often on the API, only without considering the role the API plays in the wider organization or how it fits into an organizational strategy. Our industrial experiences show that more information is needed about the challenges and best practices of API design and management in an organizational context. Furthermore, it has become apparent that APIs are able to play a key role as part of a strategic business plan for software-intensive companies. In this report, we present the results of our work with companies to build a framework that synthesizes and summarizes API strategies from several perspectives, including: strategic API lifecycle, lifecycle stage characteristics, lifecycle use cases and transition points, API layered architecture, BAPO, value modeling, ecosystem mapping with goal models, API metrics, goal models with metrics, and API governance guidance. Our research was carried out with an industry-academic collaboration. The framework was developed iteratively through workshops and discussions with company partners. We show how conceptual frameworks can be used to drive API\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["877"]}
{"title": "Introduction to the minitrack on novel uses, opportunities and challenges of blockchain for digital services\n", "abstract": " The first Open Data Services Mini-track was organized in HICSS-46, followed by a workshop discussing Open Data service research agenda in HICSS-47, a minitrack focusing on different aspects of open data services in HICSS-48, on digital service innovations based on\" open\" phenomena and practices in HICSS-49 and on Open digital services and platforms in HICSS-50. In HICSS-51, we continued the discussion about different digital services and platforms. In HICSS-52 we now turn to a specific novel set of technologies: blockchain. New platforms and platform technologies, such as blockchain, offer new opportunities, especially for developing radically new transactional digital services. According to HBR,\u201cblockchain could dramatically reduce the cost of transactions\u201d 1 by replacing private trust services with an open mode. There are examples of use of blockchain for identity management, maintenance of shipping records in cross-border shipping, and even for tracking copies digital art to name a few. At the same time, the volatility of blockchain implementations of currencies (especially cryptocurrencies), most notably Bitcoin, has made the same settlement mechanisms complicated. For example, returns and cancellations can become problematic if the value of the underlying cryptocurrency changes dramatically between the original transaction and the cancellation. Until recently, blockchain service implementations and platforms have been the domain of computer science, and the main focus of research has been on technical aspects. Now, however, we are moving into an era of utilizing blockchain platforms that create novel opportunities as\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["877"]}
{"title": "FLOSS-induced changes in the software business: insights from the pioneers\n", "abstract": " Companies that build their offerings with Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) communities have evoked fundamental changes in the operating environment of software firms. However, prior literature has not paid sufficient attention to how the managers of software firms perceive these changes and the impact of FLOSS activity on their business. This study investigates the perceptions of the entrepreneurs and senior managers in Finnish software firms regarding these issues. Based on narratives obtained from discussions with the managers, we group the findings into four categories that provide insight into the ongoing changes in the software industry.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["877"]}

Government agencies have a role to play in how successful distribution and implementation of IoT technologies are. We conducted an explorative, qualitative study based on 16 interviews with key respondents from government agencies in Sweden to discover the public sector agencies\u2019 current maturity. We focused on society as a whole and drilled down into individual sectors: energy, food, transportation, health care, financial services, information and communication, and security.

{"title": "Procedural Knowledge Requirements in the Design of Genome Data Services\n", "abstract": " Genome data holds tremendous value potential for humanity. Downstream services are needed to increase the use of currently dispersed data. There is a research gap related to how companies should design these: They struggle to balance (1) dynamic (exploration) knowledge requirements that are of interest to genome researchers and (2) stable (exploitation) knowledge requirements that are of interest to clinical users. In this paper, we investigate how one specific company takes into account the various audiences in the designing of their services by asking: How do procedural knowledge requirements impact the design of information systems that produce genome data services? We show how different types of knowledge requirements lead to different services and discuss how it could link to IS platform and infrastructure literature. In practice, understanding and explaining these mechanisms increases downstream data value for genome research and clinical use, increasing the advance of science and care for patients.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["877"]}

Firms tend to empower the platform\u2019s ecosystem through expanding developer contribution via introducing boundary resources such as application programming interfaces (APIs). This study addresses the challenge of platform owners managing their internal assets as platform boundary resources. We seek to answer how platform owners can identify and visualize values of potential boundary resources by conducting a single case study at a large international company active in embeded software development area. This study suggests e3 value modelling as a tool to assist platform owners in understanding the platform ecosystem actors, the values of assets for the ecosystem and how these values can be interchanged among the actors.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["877"]}

{"title": "OSS as a way to sell organizational transformation\n", "abstract": " Open Source Software (OSS) has gained industrial and organizational credibility both as a development style and as an organizational form based on voluntarism, distributed and global ideals practices. It has attracted hype both among software development professionals and the general public. In the first phase of OSS commercialisation companies were interested about ways to directly benefit from OSS generated revenue stream. Now in the second phase commercial actors are reviewing ways to leverage OSS products and practices in hierarchical organisations. The aim of this research paper is to explore two OSS inspired implementations in Europe-based multinational companies. Based on these experiences we conclude that implementations are thorough organizational changes, which can be beneficially viewed as introducing a market inside a company and followed by all the accompanying challenges\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["877"]}

The purpose of this case study is to examine this relationship. We review extant literature on the OSS development, characteristics of the OSS communities and OSS development, moving on to the business rationales of a companies engaging in OSS development. We construct a framework for analyzing a company-community relationship and test our framework with data from semi-structured interviews of corporate representatives who have worked closely with open source software development. As a result, we propose a framework for analyzing company-community relationship in the OSS development context.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["877"]}
