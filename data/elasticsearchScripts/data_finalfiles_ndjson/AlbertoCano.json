{"title": "Adaptive Ensemble Active Learning for Drifting Data Stream Mining\n", "abstract": " Learning from data streams is among the most vital contemporary fields in machine learning and data mining. Streams pose new challenges to learning systems, due to their volume and velocity, as well as ever-changing nature caused by concept drift. Vast majority of works for data streams assume a fully supervised learning scenario, having an unrestricted access to class labels. This assumption does not hold in real-world applications, where obtaining ground truth is costly and time-consuming. Therefore, we need to carefully select which instances should be labeled, as usually we are working under a strict label budget. In this paper, we propose a novel active learning approach based on ensemble algorithms that is capable of using multiple base classifiers during the label query process. It is a plug-in solution, capable of working with most of existing streaming ensemble classifiers. We realize this process as a Multi-Armed Bandit problem, obtaining an efficient and adaptive ensemble active learning procedure by selecting the most competent classifier from the pool for each query. In order to better adapt to concept drifts, we guide our instance selection by measuring the generalization capabilities of our classifiers. This adaptive solution leads not only to better instance selection under sparse access to class labels, but also to improved adaptation to various types of concept drift and increasing the diversity of the underlying ensemble classifier.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1076"]}

We developed a first-of-its-kind PSIONplus m method that performs sequential multi-label prediction of ion channels and their subtypes for both voltage-gated and ligand-gated channels. PSIONplus m sequentially combines the outputs produced by three support vector machine-based models from the PSIONplus predictor and is available as a webserver.

This includes the existing single-label methods that are available to the users, a na\u00efve multi-label predictor that combines results produced by multiple single-label methods, and methods that make predictions based on sequence alignment and domain annotations.

{"title": "An Evolutionary Self-Adaptive Algorithm for Mining Association Rules\n", "abstract": " This paper presents a novel self-adaptive grammar-guided genetic programming proposal for mining association rules. It generates individuals through a context-free grammar, which allows of defining rules in an expressive and flexible way over different domains. Each rule is represented as a derivation tree that shows a solution (described using the language) denoted by the grammar. Unlike existing evolutionary algorithms for mining association rules, the proposed algorithm only requires a small number of parameters, providing the possibility of discovering association rules in an easy way for non-expert users. More specifically, this algorithm does not require any threshold, and uses a novel parent selector based on a niche-crowding model to group rules. This approach keeps the", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1076"]}
{"title": "Modelo gravitacional para clasificaci\u00f3n\n", "abstract": " La gravedad es una interacci\u00f3n fundamental, cuyo concepto y efectos han sido aplicados a la clasificaci\u00f3n de datos. El principio de la clasificaci\u00f3n gravitatoria es clasificar los ejemplos mediante la comparaci\u00f3n de la atracci\u00f3n gravitatoria a las distintas clases. Este art\u0131culo presenta un algoritmo de clasificaci\u00f3n gravitatoria que mejora los modelos gravitatorios existentes y soluciona algunos de sus problemas. El algoritmo propuesto, denominado IGCA (Improved Gravitation Classification Algorithm), es capaz de trabajar con atributos num\u00e9ricos y nominales, filtrar atributos ruidosos o irrelevantes, y alcanzar buenos resultados sobre conjuntos de datos no balanceados. La propuesta emplea una matriz de pesos para describir la importancia de cada atributo en la clasificaci\u00f3n de cada clase y mejora la exactitud en la clasificaci\u00f3n al considerar tanto la informaci\u00f3n global como local de los datos, especialmente en los ejemplos cercanos a la frontera entre clases. La propuesta se eval\u00faa y compara con otros 6 algoritmos de clasificaci\u00f3n, incluyendo un modelo gravitatorio previo, sobre 30 conjuntos de datos. Los resultados obtenidos de la experimentaci\u00f3n muestran los buenos resultados de nuestro modelo gravitatorio y se validan mediante tests estad\u0131sticos no param\u00e9tricos.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1076"]}
