An Information Security Management System (ISMS) is a systematic approach for establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining and improving an organization's information security. Key elements of the operation of an ISMS are ISMS processes. However, and in spite of its importance, an ISMS process framework with a description of ISMS processes and their interaction as well as the interaction with other management processes is not available in the literature. Cost benefit analysis of information security investments regarding single measures protecting information and ISMS processes are not in the focus of current research, mostly focused on economics. This article aims to fill this research gap by proposing such an ISMS process framework as the main contribution. It is based on a set of agreed upon ISMS processes in existing standards like ISO 27000 series, COBIT and ITIL. Within the framework, identified processes are described and their interaction and interfaces are specified. This framework helps to focus on the operation of the ISMS, instead of focusing on measures and controls.

An evaluation method in the form of a comparative analysis based on traditional information retrieval (IR) metrics and a reference ranking-based evaluation metric (correctly ranked places) is presented towards the end of this article to reliably assess the efficacy and effectiveness of our recommendation\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["1351"]}

However, current information retrieval mechanisms for semantic knowledge bases are intended to be only used by expert users. In this work, we propose a natural language interface that allows non-expert users the access to this kind of information through formulating queries in natural language. The present approach uses a domain-independent ontology model to represent the question\u2019s structure and context. Also, this model allows determination of the answer type expected by the user based on a proposed question classification.

Supporting the adoption of semantic Web technologies, there exist tools oriented to creation, publication, and management of data, and a big subset for Linked Data. However, an important weakness in this area is that it has not completely established a formal reference that integrates the necessary infrastructure in terms of components.

{"title": "Improving transparency and efficiency in IT security management resourcing\n", "abstract": " ISMS budgets are often stressed and additional funding is often requested to implement necessary controls. However, in many cases controls are regularly not realized due to budget problems. Often it is assumed that controls are paid from the budget of the ISMS. This results in a non-transparent and irrational allocation of costs. Costs should be divided among the individual cost centers according to the information security requirements instead. As a prerequisite for this, an adequate differentiation between costs for specific controls on the one hand and costs for running and maintaining the ISMS processes on the other hand is necessary. Such a differentiation allows the ISMS to assign costs for controls to the asset owners whose assets determine information security requirements.To address this open research question, in this article we propose a resource management process for information security\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1351"]}

In the case of multimedia content, the problem of accessible information is not seen to be chronic or unsolvable. In the new social web scenario, an increasing number of multimedia resources are available on the internet. Unfortunately, most of them are not accessible. Given that the conversion process of such resources is human capital intensive, and not always viable from an economic point of view, new and effective solutions must be made to address this accessibility gaps. In this scenario, methods stemming from Computer-Assisted Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Social Web can be an effective way to achieve audiovisual accessibility in an affordable and effective way. The current work proposes the definition of a reference architecture which uses CSCW techniques based on social web, with the objective of converting multimedia resources into accessible resources in a quicker and more effective and efficient way.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1351"]}

This paper extends previous studies on the use of Internet technologies and knowledge management by analyzing factors affecting knowledge exchange through Internet technologies within small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). More specifically, drawing upon the technology-organization-environment framework, a model to examine how distinct contextual factors influence knowledge exchange through Internet technologies is developed. A data set of 535 SMEs from Spain is used to test the conceptual model and hypotheses. Results suggest that IT expertise and commitment-based human resources practices positively affect knowledge exchange through Internet technologies in SMEs, with the latter being the strongest factor in our proposed model.

{"title": "Towards Supporting International Standard-Based Software Engineering Approaches Using Semantic Web Technologies: A Systematic Literature Review\n", "abstract": " Motivated by the assumption that Semantic Web technologies are not sufficiently leveraged in the Software Engineering discipline (SE) to provide support regarding the standardization of software development processes by means of international software standards, we investigate the existence of systematic literature reviews in this regard. We concluded that none of the available reviews is specifically focused on analysing international standard-based SE approaches, but on investigating SE approaches in a general way. In this paper, we present the details about all the stages in the conducting of a systematic literature review on the Semantic Web technologies-based support for the standardization of the SE discipline regarding software development processes; one of the major findings of the presented review is that nowadays there is a shortage of approaches providing support for the standardization of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1351"]}
