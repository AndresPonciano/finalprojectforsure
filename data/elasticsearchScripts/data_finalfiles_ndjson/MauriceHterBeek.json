However, no single tool has emerged as the dominant solution for system design. Each tool differs from the others in terms of the modeling language used, its verification capabilities and other complementary features, and each development context has peculiar needs that require different tools. This is particularly problematic for the railway industry, in which formal methods are highly recommended by the norms, but no actual guidance is provided for the selection of tools. To guide companies in the selection of the most appropriate formal tools to adopt in their contexts, a clear assessment of the features of the currently available tools is required. To address this goal, this paper considers a set of 13 formal tools that have been used for railway system design, and it presents a systematic evaluation of such tools and a preliminary usability analysis of a subset of 7 tools, involving railway practitioners. The results are discussed considering the most desired aspects by industry and earlier related studies. While the focus is on the railway domain, the overall methodology can be applied to similar contexts. Our study thus contributes with a systematic evaluation of formal tools and it shows that despite the poor graphical interfaces, usability and maturity of the tools are not major problems, as claimed by contributions from the literature.

Their main feature is a flexible technique for specifying coordination patterns among systems, thus extending I/O automata. Furthermore, for some patterns the language recognized by a team automaton can be specified via those languages recognized by its components.We introduce a process calculus tailored over team automata. Each automaton is described by a process, such that its associated (fragment of a) labeled transition system is bisimilar to the original automaton. The mapping is moreover denotational, since the operators defined on processes are in a bijective correspondence with a chosen family of coordination patterns and that correspondence is preserved by the mapping.We thus extend to team automata a few classical results on I/O automata and their representation by process calculi\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1519"]}
{"title": "A Team Automaton Scenario for the Analysis of Security Properties of Communication Protocols.\n", "abstract": " Formal methods are a popular means to specify and verify security properties of a variety of communication protocols. In this article we take a step towards the use of team automata for the analysis of security aspects in such protocols. To this aim, we define an insecure communication scenario for team automata that is general enough to encompass various communication protocols. We then reformulate the Generalized Non-Deducibility on Compositions schema\u2014originally introduced in the context of process algebrae\u2014in terms of team automata. Based on the resulting team automata framework, we subsequently develop two analysis strategies that can be used to verify security properties of communication protocols. Indeed, the paper concludes with two case studies in which we show how our framework can be used to prove integrity and secrecy in two different settings: We show how integrity is guaranteed in a team automaton model of a particular instance of the Efficient Multi-chained Stream Signature protocol, a communication protocol for signing digital streams that provides some robustness against packet loss, and we show how secrecy is preserved when a member of a multicast group leaves the group in a particular run of the complementary variable approach to the N-Root/Leaf pairwise keys protocol.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1519"]}

Here, the generative power of teams in grammar systems consisting of regular, linear and metalinear sets of productions is investigated.             For these sub-context-free cases the forming of teams strictly increases the generative power of the underlying grammar systems in many cases.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1519"]}

{"title": "Associativity of infinite synchronized shuffles and team automata\n", "abstract": " Motivated by different ways to obtain team automata from synchronizing component automata, we consider various definitions of synchronized shuffles of words. A shuffle of two words is an interleaving of their symbol occurrenceswhich preserves the original order of these occurrences within each of the two words. In a synchronized shuffle, however, also two occurrences of one symbol, each from a different word, may be identified as a single occurrence. In case at least one of the words involved is infinite, a (synchronized) shuffle can also be unfair in the sense that an infinite word may prevail fromsome point onwards even when the other word still has occurrences to contribute to the shuffle. We prove that for the synchronized shuffle operations under consideration, every (fair or unfair) synchronized shuffle can be obtained as a limit of synchronized shuffles of the finite prefixes of the words involved.

Systems are modelled as (extended) team automata, in which, in principle, any number of component automata can participate in the execution of a communicating action, either as a sender or as a receiver. We extend team automata with synchronisation type specifications, which determine specific synchronisation policies fine-tuned for particular application domains. On the other hand, synchronisation type specifications generate communication requirements for receptiveness and responsiveness. We propose a new, liberal version of requirement satisfaction which allows teams to execute arbitrary intermediate actions before being ready for the required communication, which is important in practice.

{"title": "Automated specification and verification of Web-based applications.\n", "abstract": " This special section of the Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming is the result of an open call for papers devoted to the themes of the workshop series on the Automated Specification and Verification of Web Systems (WWV), whose 11th edition was organised by us on 23 June 2015 in Oslo, Norway, as a workshop affiliated with the 20th International Symposium on Formal Methods (FM 2015). The WWV workshop series provides an interdisciplinary forum to facilitate the cross-fertilisation and the advancement of hybrid methods that exploit concepts and tools drawn from declarative, rulebased programming, formal methods, software engineering, and Web-oriented research.Companies, organisations, and institutions nowadays offer most of their electronic services as sophisticated Web-based applications. Prominent examples include e-business, e-learning, e-government, and e-health services. The explosive growth of such applications and their increased complexity has made their design and implementation a challenging task, not in the least because at the same time quality, accessibility, security, and privacy issues need to be considered. Systematic, formal approaches to the specification and verification of Web-based applications are needed to address such issues by means of automated and effective techniques and tools. Initially, four articles were submitted to this special issue. After several extensive cycles of reviewing, during which each article was reviewed by three experts, we eventually decided to accept the following two articles that deal with the specification and verification of two different Web-based\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1519"]}

In this scenario, reconfiguration is triggered as soon as the communication buffers reach specific predefined thresholds of congestion. These constraints are implemented inside the Reo model by associating suitable predicates to channels, thus extending previous results on the use of graph transformation for the reconfiguration of Reo's graphical structures.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1519"]}

{"title": "Featured Team Automata\n", "abstract": " We propose featured team automata to support variability in the development and analysis of teams, which are systems of reactive components that communicate according to specified synchronisation types. A featured team automaton concisely describes a family of concrete product models for specific configurations determined by feature selection. We focus on the analysis of communication-safety properties, but doing so product-wise quickly becomes impractical. Therefore, we investigate how to lift notions of receptiveness (no message loss) to the level of family models. We show that featured (weak) receptiveness of featured team automata characterises (weak) receptiveness for all product instantiations.

{"title": "Quantitative Security Risk Modeling and Analysis with RisQFLan\n", "abstract": " Domain-specific quantitative modeling and analysis approaches are fundamental in scenarios in which qualitative approaches are inappropriate or unfeasible. In this paper, we present a tool-supported approach to quantitative graph-based security risk modeling and analysis based on attack-defense trees. Our approach is based on QFLan, a successful domain-specific approach to support quantitative modeling and analysis of highly configurable systems, whose domain-specific components have been decoupled to facilitate the instantiation of the QFLan approach in the domain of graph-based security risk modeling and analysis. Our approach incorporates distinctive features from three popular kinds of attack trees, namely enhanced attack trees, capabilities-based attack trees and attack countermeasure trees, into the domain-specific modeling language. The result is a new framework, called RisQFLan, to support quantitative security risk modeling and analysis based on attack-defense diagrams. By offering either exact or statistical verification of probabilistic attack scenarios, RisQFLan constitutes a significant novel contribution to the existing toolsets in that domain. We validate our approach by highlighting the additional features offered by RisQFLan in three illustrative case studies from seminal approaches to graph-based security risk modeling analysis based on attack trees.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1519"]}

These systems are modelled in the framework of team automata in which any number of components can participate\u2014as a sender or as a receiver\u2014in the execution of a communication action. Moreover, there is no fixed synchronisation policy as these policies in general depend on the application. In this short paper, we reconsider the concept of safe communication in terms of reception and responsiveness requirements, originally defined for synchronisation policies determined by a synchronisation type. Illustrated by a motivating example, we propose three extensions. First, compliance, i.e. satisfaction of communication requirements, does not have to be immediate.
