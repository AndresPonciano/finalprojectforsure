The main advantage of using biometrics for recognition is that it is unique for every individual and cannot be misplaced or forgotten. However, biometric systems that use a single biometric trait have to contend with noisy data, restricted degrees of freedom, failure to-enroll problems, spoof attacks, and unacceptable error rates. Various researchers have suggested that no single biometric modality can provide the protection required for high security applications [1] - [4]. To alleviate this problem and enhance the performance of a biometric system, information from different biometric sources are combined and such systems are known as multimodal biometric systems [2].", "num_citations": "33\n", "authors": ["464"]}

The second level of granularity divides face image into horizontal and vertical face granules of varying size and information content.

Among these challenges, recognition of faces with disguise is a major challenge and has only been recently addressed by few researchers (Alexander & Smith, 2003),(Ramanathan et al, 2004),(Silva & Rosa, 2003),(Singh et al., 2008).

In literature, autoencoders have shown to perform well on a variety of tasks spread across multiple domains, thereby establishing widespread applicability. Typically, an autoencoder is trained to generate a model that minimizes the reconstruction error between the input and the reconstructed output, computed in terms of the Euclidean distance. While this can be useful for applications related to unsupervised reconstruction, it may not be optimal for classification. In this paper, we propose a novel Supervised COSMOS Autoencoder which utilizes a multi-objective loss function to learn representations that simultaneously encode the (i) \"similarity\" between the input and reconstructed vectors in terms of their direction, (ii) \"distribution\" of pixel values of the reconstruction with respect to the input sample, while also incorporating (iii) \"discriminability\" in the feature learning pipeline. The proposed autoencoder model incorporates a Cosine similarity and Mahalanobis distance based loss function, along with supervision via Mutual Information based loss. Detailed analysis of each component of the proposed model motivates its applicability for feature learning in different classification tasks.

{"title": "Reliable detection of CMOS stuck-open faults due to variable internal delays\n", "abstract": " Testable designs for detecting single stuck-open faults in CMOS circuits have been proposed so that the tests remain valid even in the presence of unequal delays in the circuit. Existing approaches require the CMOS gate to be internally modified and are thus suitable for future chip designs. This paper proposes two versatile designs that can be adapted for both existing chips and new chip designs. A 3-sequence test set and a 2-sequence test set are derived for the proposed designs to reliably detect stuck-open faults.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["464"]}
{"title": "Single chip decoder design for large numeric displays\n", "abstract": " The author describes an integrated decoder design for displaying large English numeric digits using four clusters of standard seven-segment displays. The viewing area for each digit in the proposed design is four times the size of a standard display. It is also shown that the net power consumed by displaying any numeric digit using the proposed four-cluster display layout is less than that consumed by a single seven-segment display.< >", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["464"]}

{"title": "MEMORY DESIGNS FOR ENHANCING TESTABILITY AND RELIABILITY.\n", "abstract": " Degree: Ph. D.DegreeYear: 1987Institute: West Virginia UniversityThe problems encountered in testing VLSI memories are analyzed and potential solutions to minimize or eliminate these problems are presented. The test generation process includes computer-aided-design of functional subsystems using NMOS technology. Circuit level fault simulation was performed on various models developed. This made it possible to increase the fault coverage. Apart from conventional stuck-at faults, a wide range of faults associated with (1) MOSFETs intermediate switching characteristics,(2) variations in substrate doping, ion implantation dose and gate oxidation thickness, and (3) processing deficiencies that cause changes in the channel length or channel width were simulated and the outputs were observed. The diagnostic resolution of the test was greatly improved when the output responses are quantized at discrete\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["464"]}
{"title": "Encyclopedia of Biometrics Springer Science+ Business Media, LLC 2009\n", "abstract": " Logical access control is the means and procedures to protect access to information on PCs, networks, and mobile phones. A variety of credential types may be used, such as passwords, tokens, or biometrics, to authenticate the user. These credentials may represent something the user knows (password), something the user has (token), or a physical trait of the user (biometrics). A logical access control system will implement a method to enroll and associate credentials with the user, and then to request that one or more of the user\u2019s credentials be authenticated for access to the resource (application, network, device, or operating system). The logical access control system may also log all access attempts for use in auditing who and when someone accessed a specific resource.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["464"]}
