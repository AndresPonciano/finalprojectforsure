For instance, integrating fleet management solutions into intelligent transportation systems (ITS) can efficiently resolve transportation problems relying on each vehicle information. Usually, the position estimate is ensured by the integration of the Global Positioning System (GPS) and Inertial Navigation Systems (INS). For multisensor data fusion, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is generally applied using the sensor\u2019s measures and the GPS position as a helper.

We present recommendations for building an AQM depending on the goal and the available datasets, pointing out their limitations and potentials.

However, The performances of GNSS-based positioning systems can be affected in constrained environments (urban and indoor environments), due to masking of satellites by buildings and multipath effects.

As a result, Kalman filter estimation shows the best error performance in good environments (all satellites are in direct sight).

First, the detector\u2019s output signals are processed as mixtures of several unknown sources, through nonnegative matrix factorization algorithms. Second, the continuous wavelet transform is performed to characterize the recovered original sources.

The modeling process is usually restricted to the software and therefore only partially supports the wireless sensor network's design. Among the UML profiles family, there is a language that supports the modeling of many aspects of a system (including software and hardware) : SysML (Systems Modeling Language). In this paper, we propose a SysML profile for wireless sensor networks that will support the modelling of such networks. This profile provides support for structure, behavior, requirements and energy consumption information modeling.

{"title": "Neutron-gamma discrimination method based on blind source separation and machine learning\n", "abstract": " The discrimination of neutrons from gamma rays in a mixed radiation field is crucial in neutron detection tasks. Several approaches have been proposed to enhance the performance and accuracy of neutron-gamma discrimination. However, their performances are often associated with certain factors, such as experimental requirements and resulting mixed signals. The main purpose of this study is to achieve fast and accurate neutron-gamma discrimination without a priori information on the signal to be analyzed, as well as the experimental setup. Here, a novel method is proposed based on two concepts. The first method exploits the power of nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) as a blind source separation method to extract the original components from the mixture signals recorded at the output of the stilbene scintillator detector.
