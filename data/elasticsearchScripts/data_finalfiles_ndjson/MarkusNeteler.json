In Europe, LB is caused by infection with one or more pathogenic European genospecies of the spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, mainly transmitted by the tick Ixodes ricinus. Recent surveys show that the overall prevalence of LB may be stabilising, but its geographical distribution is increasing. In addition, much remains to be discovered about the factors affecting genospecific prevalence, transmission and virulence, although avoidance of tick bite still appears to be the most efficient preventive measure.

{"title": "Estimating daily land surface temperatures in mountainous environments by reconstructed MODIS LST data\n", "abstract": " Continuous monitoring of extreme environments, such as the European Alps, is hampered by the sparse and/or irregular distribution of meteorological stations, the difficulties in performing ground surveys and the complexity of interpolating existing station data. Remotely sensed Land Surface Temperature (LST) is therefore of major interest for a variety of environmental and ecological applications. But while MODIS LST data from the Terra and Aqua satellites are aimed at closing the gap between data demand and availability, clouds and other atmospheric disturbances often obscure parts or even the entirety of these satellite images. A novel algorithm is presented in this paper, which is able to reconstruct incomplete MODIS LST maps. All nine years of the available daily LST data (2000\u20132008) have been processed, allowing the original LST map resolution of 1,000 m to be improved to 200 m, which means the resulting LST maps can be applied at a regional level.

{"title": "Forest structure and roe deer abundance predict tick-borne encephalitis risk in Italy\n", "abstract": " Background The Western Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus often causes devastating or lethal disease. In Europe, the number of human TBE cases has increased dramatically over the last decade, risk areas are expanding and new foci are being discovered every year. The early localisation of new TBE foci and the identification of the main risk factors associated with disease emergence represent a priority for the public health community. Although a number of socio-economic parameters have been suggested to explain TBE upsurges in eastern Europe, the principal driving factors in relatively stable western European countries have not been identified.  Methodology/Principal Findings In this paper, we analyse the correlation between the upsurge of TBE in 17 alpine provinces in northern Italy from 1992 to 2006 with climatic variables, forest structure (as a proxy for small mammal reservoir host abundance), and abundance of the principal large vertebrate tick host (roe deer), using datasets available for the last 40 years. No significant differences between the pattern of changes in climatic variables in provinces where TBE has emerged compared to provinces were no clinical TBE cases have been observed to date. Instead, the best model for explaining the increase in TBE incidence in humans in this area include changes in forest structure, in particular the ratio of coppice to high stand forest, and the density of roe deer.

Changes in the pattern of distribution of the tiger mosquito may affect the potential spread of infectious diseases transmitted by this species in Europe. Therefore, predicting suitable areas of future establishment and spread is essential for planning early prevention and control strategies.  Methodology/Principal Findings To identify the areas currently most suitable for the occurrence of the tiger mosquito in the Province of Trento, we combined field entomological observations with analyses of satellite temperature data (MODIS Land Surface Temperature: LST) and human population data. We determine threshold conditions for the survival of overwintering eggs and for adult survival using both January mean temperatures and annual mean temperatures. We show that the 0\u00b0C LST threshold for January mean temperatures and the 11\u00b0C threshold for annual mean temperatures provide the best predictors for identifying the areas that could potentially support populations of this mosquito. In fact, human population density and distance to human settlements appear to be less important variables affecting mosquito distribution in this area. Finally, we evaluated the future establishment and spread of this species in relation to predicted climate warming by considering the A2 scenario for 2050 statistically downscaled at regional level in which winter and annual temperatures increase by 1.5 and 1\u00b0C, respectively.

{"title": "Uncertainty in ecosystem mapping by remote sensing\n", "abstract": " The classification of remotely sensed images such as aerial photographs or satellite sensor images for deriving ecosystem-related maps (e.g., land cover, land use, vegetation, soil) is generally based on clustering of spatial entities within a spectral space. In most cases, Boolean logic is applied in order to map landscape patterns. One major concern is that this implies an ability to divide the gradual variability of the Earth's surface into a finite number of discrete non-overlapping classes, which are considered to be exhaustively defined and mutually exclusive. This type of approach is often inappropriate given the continuous nature of many ecosystem properties. Moreover, the standard data processing and image classification methods used will involve the loss of information as the continuous quantitative spectral information is degraded into a set of discrete classes.

High spatial and temporal resolutions are crucial for detailed analyses in various fields of research. A disadvantage of temperature data obtained by satellites is the occurrence of gaps that must be reconstructed. Here, we present a new method to reconstruct high-resolution land surface temperature (LST) time series at the continental scale gaining 250-m spatial resolution and four daily values per pixel. Our method constitutes a unique new combination of weighted temporal averaging with statistical modeling and spatial interpolation. This newly developed reconstruction method has been applied to greater Europe, resulting in complete daily coverage for eleven years. To our knowledge, this new reconstructed LST time series exceeds the level of detail of comparable reconstructed LST datasets by several orders of magnitude. Studies on emerging diseases, parasite risk assessment and temperature anomalies can now be performed on the continental scale, maintaining high spatial and temporal detail.

While several studies have been carried out in order to predict the potential limits of the species expansions based on eco-climatic parameters, few studies have so far focused on the specific effects of these variables in shaping its micro-geographic abundance and dynamics. The present study investigated eco-climatic factors affecting Ae. albopictus abundance and dynamics in metropolitan and sub-urban/rural sites in Rome (Italy), which was colonized in 1997 and is nowadays one of the most infested metropolitan areas in Southern Europe. To this aim, longitudinal adult monitoring was carried out along a 70 km-transect across and beyond the most urbanized and densely populated metropolitan area. Two fine scale spatiotemporal datasets (one with reference to a 20m circular buffer around sticky traps used to collect mosquitoes and the second to a 300m circular buffer within each sampling site) were exploited to analyze the effect of climatic and socio-environmental variables on Ae. albopictus abundance and dynamics along the transect.

The new MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) collection 6 provides numerous improvements compared to collection 5. However, being remotely sensed data in the thermal range, LST shows gaps in cloud-covered areas. We present a novel method to fully reconstruct MODIS daily LST products for central Europe at 1 km resolution and globally, at 3 arc-min. We combined temporal and spatial interpolation, using emissivity and elevation as covariates for the spatial interpolation. The reconstructed MODIS LST for central Europe was calibrated to air temperature data through linear models that yielded R 2 values around 0.8 and RMSE of 0.5 K. This new method proves to scale well for both local and global reconstruction. We show examples for the identification of extreme events to demonstrate the ability of these new LST products to capture and represent spatial and temporal details.

This tick acts both as vector and reservoir for a series of wildlife zoonotic pathogens, especially the agents of Lyme diseases, Tick borne encephalitis and Human Granulocytic Ehrlichiosis, which are emerging in most of Europe. To assess the spatial distribution of these pathogens and the infection risk for humans and animals within the territory of the Province of Trento, we carried out a long term study using a combination of eco-epidemiological surveys and mathematical modelling. An extensive tick collection with a GIS based habitat suitability analysis allowed us to identify the areas where tick occurs at various density. To identify the areas with higher infection risk, we estimated the values of R0 for Borrelia burgdorferi sl, TBE virus and Anaplasma phagocytophila under different ecological conditions. We assessed the infection prevalence in the vector and in the wildlife reservoir species that play a central role in the persistence of these infections, ie the small mammals A. flavicollis and C. glareolus. We also considered the double effect of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) which act as reservoir for A. phagocytophila but is an incompetent host for B. burgdorferi and TBE virus, thus reducing the infection prevalence in ticks of these last two pathogens.

Active surveillance and responses that readily suppress newly established colonies are effective actions to mitigate the noxious consequences of biological invasions. However, when an exotic species establishes a viable population in a new area, predicting its potential spread is the most effective way to implement adequate control actions. Emerging invasive species, despite monitoring efforts, are poorly known in terms of behaviour and capacity to adapt to the new invaded range. Therefore, tools that provide information on their spread by maximising the available data, are critical. We apply three different approaches to model the potential distribution of an emerging invasive mosquito, Aedes koreicus, in Northeast Italy: 1) an automatic statistical approach based on information theory, 2) a statistical approach integrated with prior knowledge, and 3) a GIS physiology-based approach. Each approach possessed benefits and limitations, and the required ecological information increases on a scale from 1 to 3. We validated the model outputs using the only other known invaded area in Europe. Finally, we applied a road network analysis to the suitability surface with the highest prediction power to highlight those areas with the highest likelihood of invasion. The GIS physiological-based model had the highest prediction power. It showed that localities currently occupied by Aedes koreicus represent only a small fraction of the potentially suitable area.

The European distribution comprises the Mediterranean basin with a first appearance in Switzerland in 2003. Early identification of the most suitable areas in Switzerland allowing progressive invasion by this species is considered crucial to suggest adequate surveillance and control plans.  Methodology/Principal Findings We identified the most suitable areas for invasion and establishment of Ae. albopictus in Switzerland. The potential distribution areas linked to the current climatic suitability were assessed using remotely sensed land surface temperature data recorded by the MODIS satellite sensors. Suitable areas for adult survival and overwintering of diapausing eggs were also identified for future climatic conditions, considering two different climate change scenarios (A1B, A2) for the periods 2020\u20132049 and 2045\u20132074. At present, the areas around Lake Geneva in western Switzerland provide suitable climatic conditions for Ae. albopictus. In northern Switzerland, parts of the Rhine valley, around Lake Constance, as well as the surroundings of Lake Neuch\u00e2tel, appear to be suitable for the survival at least of adult Ae. albopictus. However, these areas are characterized by winters currently being too cold for survival and development of diapausing eggs. In southern Switzerland, Ae. albopictus is already well-established, especially in the Canton of Ticino. For the years 2020\u20132049, the predicted possible spread of the tiger mosquito does not differ significantly from its potential current distribution.

However, how to analyze the complex tripartite ecological, economic, and social effects of climate change on these systems has been vexing and largely unexplored. Here we review how a bioeconomic approach using physiologically-based demographic models in the context of geographic information systems may be an important step in examining the complexity of these factors on grape. We show that with relatively modest data and funding, regional bioeconomic analysis of grape production under present weather and climate change is possible, and that management-relevant complexity can be included in a mechanistic way.

Through an explicit individual-based landscape genetics approach, we addressed the following questions: (1) are levels of genetic variation reduced in these marginal populations compared with central populations?; (2) despite the narrow geographical scale, do individual-based analyses have some power to detect genetic differentiation?; (3) do environmental and/or climatic factors exert a role in shaping patterns of genetic variation and differentiation? Through a Bayesian method, we identified three clusters whose genetic variability can be considered to be of the same order as that recorded in\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["837"]}
{"title": "Use of multi-annual MODIS Land Surface Temperature data for the characterization of the heat requirements for grapevine varieties\n", "abstract": " Heat requirements for grapevine varieties have been widely used to characterize potential growing regions for viticulture. One of the most important indices is the Winkler Index (WI) defined as the total summation of daily average air temperature above 10\u00b0C from 1 st  of April to 31 th  of October in the Northern hemisphere. Mapping of the WI is commonly based on temperature data from meteorological stations. However, in complex terrain such as the European Alps, these are usually irregularly and sparsely distributed or unavailable. This renders traditional geospatial interpolation approaches difficult to become reliable. As an alternative, thermal remote sensing data, which are intrinsically spatialised, can be used. The aim of this work was to provide time series of Winkler Index maps from 2003 to 2010, by means of the MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) data and to validate the maps using ground truth data\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["837"]}

Hence, measuring ecological complexity over space becomes crucial in macroecology and geography. Many geospatial tools have been advocated in spatial ecology to estimate ecosystem complexity and its changes over space and time. Among these tools, free and open source options especially offer opportunities to guarantee the robustness of algorithms and reproducibility. In this paper we will summarize the most straightforward measures of spatial complexity available in the Free and Open Source Software GRASS GIS, relating them to key ecological patterns and processes.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["837"]}

{"title": "New automated method to develop geometrically corrected time series of brightness temperatures from historical AVHRR LAC data\n", "abstract": " Analyzing temporal series of satellite data for regional scale studies demand high accuracy in calibration and precise geo-rectification at higher spatial resolution. The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor aboard the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) series of satellites provide daily observations for the last 30 years at a nominal resolution of 1.1 km at nadir. However, complexities due to on-board malfunctions and orbital drifts with the earlier missions hinder the usage of these images at their original resolution. In this study, we developed a new method using multiple open source tools which can read level 1B radiances, apply solar and thermal calibration to the channels, remove bow-tie effects on wider zenith angles, correct for clock drifts on earlier images and perform precise geo-rectification by automated generation and filtering of ground control points using a feature matching technique. The entire workflow is reproducible and extendable to any other geographical location. We developed a time series of brightness temperature maps from AVHRR local area coverage images covering the sub alpine lakes of Northern Italy at 1 km resolution (1986\u20132014; 28 years). For the validation of derived brightness temperatures, we extracted Lake Surface Water Temperature (LSWT) for Lake Garda in Northern Italy and performed inter-platform (NOAA-x vs. NOAA-y) and cross-platform (NOAA-x vs. MODIS/ATSR/AATSR) comparisons. The MAE calculated over available same day observations between the pairs\u2014NOAA-12/14, NOAA-17/18 and NOAA-18/19 are 1.18 K, 0.67 K, 0.35 K, respectively.

{"title": "Demographic history, population structure, and local adaptation in alpine populations of Cardamine impatiens and Cardamine resedifolia\n", "abstract": " Species evolution depends on numerous and distinct forces, including demography and natural selection. For example, local adaptation and population structure affect the evolutionary history of species living along environmental clines. This is particularly relevant in plants, which are often characterized by limited dispersal ability and the need to respond to abiotic and biotic stress factors specific to the local environment. Here we study the demographic history and the possible existence of local adaptation in two related species of Brassicaceae, Cardamine impatiens and Cardamine resedifolia, which occupy separate habitats along the elevation gradient. Previous genome-wide analyses revealed the occurrence of distinct selective pressures in the two species, with genes involved in cold response evolving particularly fast in C. resedifolia. In this study we surveyed patterns of molecular evolution and genetic variability in a set of 19 genes, including neutral and candidate genes involved in cold response, across 10 populations each of C. resedifolia and C. impatiens from the Italian Alps (Trentino). We inferred the population structure and demographic history of the two species, and tested the occurrence of signatures of local adaptation in these genes. The results indicate that, despite a slightly higher population differentiation in C. resedifolia than in C. impatiens, both species are only weakly structured and that populations sampled at high altitude experience less gene flow than low-altitude ones. None of the genes showed signatures of positive selection, suggesting that they do not seem to play relevant roles in the current evolutionary\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["837"]}
{"title": "Snow cover patterns and evolution at basin scale: GEOtop model simulations and remote sensing observations\n", "abstract": " Remote sensing data can provide images of snow covered areas and, therefore, it is possible to follow the time evolution of snow melting spatial patterns with increasing spatial and temporal resolution. Snow cover patterns are dominated by the complex interplay of topography, radiation forcings and atmospheric turbulent transfer processes. The snow cover evolution in an alpine basin in Trentino (Italy) is here studied, comparing the simulations of the distributed hydrological model GEOtop with remotely sensed data. GEOtop describes the soil-snow-atmosphere energy and mass exchanges, taking into account the snow physics and the topographic effects of elevation, slope and aspect on solar radiation and air temperature. the Snow cover extent has been provided by MODIS 8-day composite maps with a resolution of 500 metres. The model reproduces the physical features of snow melting reasonably and shows a fair agreement with the data. The relative importance of precipitation, solar radiation, and temperature to control the snow accumulation and melting processes is also investigated.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["837"]}

{"title": "Applying low budget equipment and open source software for high resolution documentation of archaeological stratigraphy and features\n", "abstract": " Available technology and measurement methods currently exceed the requirements of archaeological documentation at excavation in terms of precision, accuracy and resolution. Hence, archaeologists face the challenge of deciding not only what and how to document in archaeological terms, but also what degree of precision, accuracy and resolution are necessary and which tools are the most suitable for their purposes. This paper discusses controversial opinions and methods to face this challenge. On one hand, if we are not concerned with price, there is a wide variety of software and hardware technology to meet requirements far beyond archaeological limits. On the other hand, a growing community supports low cost developments in this field, and advances have now reached a point where Open Source (OS) results can compete with those from proprietary devices. As stated above, results and purposes are strongly related to aims and means. Documenting archaeological stratigraphy requires different levels of precision and resolution than documenting architecture, objects or finds. The challenge here is to consider purpose, possibilities, costs and managing accruing amounts of data. This paper aims to act as a kind of guide for archaeologists and historians to find the most suitable documentation equipment out of a wide range of possibilities.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["837"]}
{"title": "Species distribution modelling and open source GIS: why are they still so loosely connected?\n", "abstract": " Species Distribution Models (SDMs) are correlative models that use environmental and/or geographical information to explain patterns of species occurrences. Those models are being used in various fields including climate change, invasive species research, evolutionary biology and epidemiology. Thanks to the availability of increasing computational resources, new methods continue to be developed. However, software packages that include the SDM algorithms usually focus on one or few methods, and have different degrees of integration with other geographical and statistical software. Specifically, SDM implementations are often standalone programs developed by university laboratories, either as extensions to statistical software. In few cases they are written as extensions for the most common proprietary Geographic Information System (GIS) products, despite the strong geographical component present in the data. On the other hand, open source GIS software has loose connection with SDM implementations, and usually requires more effort to build a complete and well connected software stack. This paper investigate on the possible causes of the present separation of open source GIS and Species Distribution Modelling and on the benefits of a closer integration, and lists a selection of candidates for future joint development. A further step would be the adoption of open source principles in the implementation process of SDM. This will enable a peer-review mechanism on the computational code, that will strongly reduce the risk of attaining biased results due to inaccurate implementations.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["837"]}

It is therefore natural that geospatial tools are being developed also within the Open Source and Free Software community [60].

While being often used as an analytical tool, it also represents a collaborative scientific platform to develop new algorithms. Thus, it is critical that GIS software as well as the algorithms are open and accessible to anybody [18]. We present how GRASS GIS, a free and open source GIS, is used by many scientists to implement and perform geoprocessing tasks. We will show how integrating scientific algorithms into GRASS GIS helps to preserve reproducibility of scientific results over time [15]. Moreover, subsequent improvements are tracked in the source code version control system and are immediately available to the public. GRASS GIS therefore acts as a repository of scientific peer-reviewed code, algorithm library, and knowledge hub for future generation of scientists.In the field of hydrology, with the various types of actual evapotranspiration (ET) models being developed in the last 20 years, it becomes necessary to inter-compare methods. Most of already published ETa models comparisons address few number of models, and small to medium areas [3, 6, 7, 22, 23]. With the large amount of remote sensing data covering the Earth, and the daily information available for the past ten years (ie Aqua/Terra-MODIS) for each pixel location, it becomes paramount to have a more complete comparison, in space and time.

Overview of the GRASS6 capabilities relevant for environmental applications are provided, including the updated and new tools for 2D and 3D raster data, the vector modules based on the redesigned topological 2D/3D vector engine, and SQL-based attribute management. Approaches to linking with other open source geospatial tools and environmental models are discussed. Case studies from North Carolina and Panama are used to illustrate the GRASS6 capabilities for environmental applications. The examples include watershed analysis, modeling impacts of terrain modifications on water flow and assessment of effectiveness of various approaches to runoff and sediment control. Tools for processing and analysis of multi-temporal lidar-based elevation models and their environmental applications are also presented.

Thematic maps and remote sensing data are powerful tools to be used in landscape planning and forest management; nevertheless, most of the European and Mediterranean forest monitoring and conservation programs do not take into account the continuity of the variation of habitats within the landscape but they only rely on boolean classification methods. The utilisation of a classification method that applies a continuity criterion is fundamental because it is expected to better represent the ecological gradients within a landscape. The aim of this paper is to assess the amount of classification uncertainty related to crisp (boolean) classes, particularly focusing on forest identification uncertainty. Forest fuzzy membership of the Tuscany region (Italy) derived from a Landsat ETM+ image scene was compared with the widely used crisp datasets in European forests management and conservation practices, ie the European JRC Forest/Non-Forest map, the CORINE Land Cover 2000 (levels 1 and 2), as well as the Global Land Cover 2000, in order to qualitatively and quantitatively assess the separability of crisp classes with respect to forest fuzzy membership. A statistically significant (p< 0.001) forest fuzzy membership separability among the considered crisp classes was found. Despite the crisp dataset and hierarchical level taken into account, both forest and non-forest crisp classes showed a high degree of forest fuzzy membership variability.

Major obstacles are the complexity of the raw data, as well as missing tools for their simple integration into existing industrial applications. The goal of the research project FAIR is to simplify the information exchange between the DWD and economical players. In order to reach this goal a requirement analysis with end-users of weather data from three different sectors was conducted. A central requirement regarding the site assessment of wind plants is quick and easy access to historical wind-series at specific sites. Preferably downloadable in formats like CSV or via an API. Event planning partners are interested in a quick access to health relevant weather information at their event location, and the E-mobility sector in temperature data along planned routes.

The availability of temporally and spatially continuous temperature time series is crucial in different research and application fields, such as epidemiology and control of zoonotic diseases. In 2010, several West Nile virus (WNV) outbreaks in humans were observed in Europe, with the largest number of cases recorded in Greece. Human cases continued to occur for four more years. The occurrence of the 2010\u2019s outbreak in Greece has been related to positive anomalies in temperature. Currently available remote sensing time series might provide the temporal and spatial coverage needed to assess this kind of hypothesis. However, the main problem with remotely sensed temperature are the gaps caused by cloud cover. With the objective of testing the former hypothesis, we reconstructed daily MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) data and derived several indices that are known or hypothesized to be related to mosquito populations, WNV transmission or risk of disease since they might constitute proxies for favoring or limiting conditions. We present the first results of the comparisons of time series of LST-derived indices among locations with WNV human cases and municipalities with and without reported WNV infection in Greece between 2010 and 2014.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["837"]}

{"title": "Inter-sensor comparison of lake surface temperatures derived from MODIS, AVHRR and AATSR thermal bands\n", "abstract": " Surface temperature of land and water bodies is an ecologically important parameter and can be measured using remote sensing using data acquired in the thermal infrared region. The most commonly used method for deriving water temperature (for both inland and ocean water bodies) is the split window technique. It considers the spectral bands at 10.2\u201311.5 \u00b5m (tb1) and 11.5\u201312.5 \u00b5m (tb2). The increasing number of sensors which provide these spectral bands at moderate spatial resolution (~ 1km) at a temporal coverage of 1-3 days globally, attracts many researchers to rely on these data sets in alternative to often scarce field data. The open data policy adopted by different space agencies helped to maximize the usage of remotely sensing data in climate and ecological research. In this study, we compare the usability and sensitivity of three most commonly used sensors\u2013MODIS, AVHRR and AATSR on-board polar orbiting instruments in deriving Lake Surface Water Temperature (LSWT) of big sub-Alpine lakes of Northern Italy. The processing of the thermal bands (tb1 and tb2) differs across these three sensors due to different carrier instruments, multiple level-1B data source formats adopted by the respective agencies, differences in radiometric calibration coefficients, errors originating from instrument decaying, accuracy in geolocation sampling, acquisition times and the various external factors like cloud coverage and the atmospheric profiles at the time of acquisition. This demands different sensor based approaches in processing these datasets. We developed sensor specific workflows using open source geo-spatial tools to read and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["837"]}

The total body of FOSS is already enormous and includes a substantial collection of geospatial software. FOSS is maintained and developed further by a community, which can be freely joined and which appreciates contributions.

{"title": "Spatial algorithms applied to landscape diversity estimate from remote sensing data\n", "abstract": " The causal relationship between species diversity and environmental (landscape) heterogeneity has been a long-lasting interest among ecologists. In fact, environmental heterogeneity is considered to be one of the main factors associated with biodiversity given that areas with higher environmental heterogeneity can host more species due to their higher number of available niches. In particular, entropy (also referred to as \u201cheterogeneity\u201d) measured by the spatial variation of remotely sensed spectral signals has been proposed as a proxy for species diversity. The aim of this book chapter is to review the main spatial algorithms for measuring landscape heterogeneity based on remote sensing.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["837"]}

{"title": "Masting, rodent dynamics and tick-borne encephalitis risk\n", "abstract": " A risk map shows the modelled distribution of a particular disease or vector over a region, and is usually created by applying an algorithm to a set of training data (of known disease presence, absence or abundance) associated with a set of predictor variables often derived from climatological databases, or from earth-orbiting satellites. Risk maps identify areas of possible disease risk across the entire area covered by the training set, and often also regions well beyond the training set limits. The EDEN LRRS HIT team has developed a set of nonlinear discriminant analytical algorithms for risk mapping and these have been applied to a number of datasets from EDEN\u2019s specialised disease Sub-Projects and using inter alia the LRRS team\u2019s temporal Fourier processed MODIS data as predictors. Currently there is no commercial or free soft-ware for non-linear discriminant analysis of this sort and so the LRRS team had to write its own (originally in MS QBasic). Various refinements to the basic modelling algorithm have been added during the life-time of EDEN, including bootstrap sampling of the training set data and the use of new selection criteria for, and new ways of, identifying important discriminatory predictors. The team has also developed approaches for using administrative level data of disease presence/absence to produce pixel level risk map predictions. In order to share more widely the expertise developed within EDEN, the LRRS modelling approach has now been encoded in MS VBasic Express (ie free PC software from Microsoft) to produce a user-friendly GUI suite that carries out in a single pass all of the operations that used to involve\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["837"]}
