In this case, if a thread fails to acquire a lock using trylock, since trylock is non-blocking, the thread can release acquired locks to avoid a deadlock after trylock returns. Although this approach avoids deadlocks, it may also introduce bugs such as livelock and deadlivelock. Moreover, when such bugs are identified in a program, revising the program manually is error-prone.", "num_citations": "41\n", "authors": ["512"]}
{"title": "Composing distributed fault-tolerance components\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we show how a distributed fault-tolerance component can be replaced dynamically. The need for such replacement arises due to the fact that there are often several fault-tolerance components that are suitable for adding faulttolerance to a fault, and the choice of the component depends upon the environment. Since a distributed fault-tolerance component has a fraction installed at every process, replacing such a component requires that the replacement be done consistently. More specifically, it requires that the dependency among the fractions of the component be handled so that a component fraction is not removed while other component fractions or the underlying application depends on it. We show how the dependency relation among component fractions is correctly handled while ensuring that the component replacement is transparent to the application. As an illustration of different types of dependency relations, we present a message communication example and show how dynamic composition is performed in it. Finally, in our approach, it is also possible to deal with faults that occur during dynamic composition.", "num_citations": "41\n", "authors": ["512"]}

Safe resets are possible in the presence of certain faults, such as process fail-stops and repairs, but are not always possible in the presence of more general faults, such as arbitrary transients. In this paper, we design a bounded-memory distributed reset program that possesses two tolerances:(i) in the presence of fail-stops and repairs, it always executes resets safely, and (ii) in the presence of a nite number of transient faults, it eventually executes resets safely. Designing this multitolerance in the reset program introduces the novel concern of designing a safety detector that is itself multitolerant.

Then, armed with a better understanding of the tradeoffs made by the TT-based approach, we discuss how to eliminate its shortcomings.We consider two main issues with Spanner\u2019s TT-based approach. First, it requires access to special hardware for maintaining tightly-synchronized clocks and minimizing uncertainty in TT. And second, transactions in Spanner are still delayed at commit time to compensate for the remaining TT uncertainty. To eliminate these shortcomings, we propose the use of AugmentedTime (AT), which combines the best of TT-based wallclock ordering with causality-based ordering in asynchronous distributed systems. We show that the size of AT can be kept small and AT can be added to Spanner in a backward-compatible fashion, and as such, AT can be used in lieu of (or in addition to) TT in Spanner for timestamping and querying data efficiently.", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["512"]}

There are several proposals in the literature for causally consistent data stores. Thanks to the use of single scalar physical clocks, GentleRain has a throughput higher than other proposals such as COPS or Orbe. However, both of its correctness and performance relay on monotonic synchronized physical clocks. Specifically, if physical clocks go backward its correctness is violated. In addition, GentleRain is sensitive on the clock synchronization, and clock skew may slow write operations in GenlteRain. In this paper, we want to solve this issue in GenlteRain by using Hybrid Logical Clock (HLC) instead of physical clocks. Using HLC, GentleRain protocl is not sensitive on the clock skew anymore. In addition, even if clocks go backward, the correctness of the system is not violated. Furthermore, by HLC, we timestamp versions with a clock very close to the physical clocks. Thus, we can take causally consistency snapshot of the system at any give physical time. We call GentleRain protocol with HLCs GentleRain+. We have implemented GentleRain+ protocol, and have evaluated it experimentally. GentleRain+ provides faster write operations compare to GentleRain that rely solely on physical clocks to achieve causal consistency.

Of these, the former closely resembles with model checking and, hence, techniques for efficient verification are directly applicable to it. Hence, we focus on expediting the latter with the use of multi-core technology. We present two approaches for parallelization by considering different design choices. The first approach is based on the computation of equivalence classes of program transitions (called group computation) that are needed due to the issue of distribution (i.e., inability of processes to atomically read and write all program variables). We show that in most cases the speedup of this approach is close to the ideal speedup and in some cases it is superlinear. The second approach uses traditional technique of partitioning deadlock states among multiple threads. However, our experiments show that the speedup for this approach is small. Consequently, our analysis demonstrates that a simple approach of parallelizing the group computation is likely to be the effective method for using multi-core computing in the context of deadlock resolution.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["512"]}

In this paper, we address the problem of synthesizing two types of 2-phase recovery: relaxed\u00a0 and graceful.

{"title": "Using weaker consistency models with monitoring and recovery for improving performance of key-value stores\n", "abstract": " Consistency properties provided by most key-value stores can be classified into sequential consistency and eventual consistency. The former is easier to program with but suffers from lower performance whereas the latter suffers from potential anomalies while providing higher performance. We focus on the problem of what a designer should do if he/she has an algorithm that works correctly with sequential consistency but is faced with an underlying key-value store that provides a weaker (e.g., eventual or causal) consistency. We propose a detect-rollback based approach: The designer identifies a correctness predicate, say P, and continues to run the protocol, as our system monitors P. If P is violated (because the underlying key-value store provides a weaker consistency), the system rolls back and resumes the computation at a state where P holds.We evaluate this approach with graph-based applications running on the Voldemort key-value store. Our experiments with deployment on Amazon AWS EC2 instances show that using eventual consistency with monitoring can provide a 50\u201380% increase in throughput when compared with sequential consistency. We also observe that the overhead of the monitoring itself was low (typically less than 4%) and the latency of detecting violations was small.

However, developing correct, efficient concurrent programs is notoriously difficult. Software Transactional Memory Systems (STMs) are a convenient programming interface for a programmer to access shared memory without worrying about concurrency issues.

Client programs use STMs by issuing transactions. STM ensures that transaction either commits or aborts. A transaction aborted due to conflicts is typically re-issued with the expectation that it will complete successfully in a subsequent incarnation. However, many existing STMs fail to provide starvation freedom, i.e., in these systems, it is possible that concurrency conflicts may prevent an incarnated transaction from committing. To overcome this limitation, we systematically derive a novel starvation free algorithm for multi-version STM. Our algorithm can be used either with the case where the number of versions is unbounded and garbage collection is used or where only the latest K versions are maintained, KSFTM.

The petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, methanol and aqueous extracts obtained by successive solvent extraction from Vitex agnus castus leaves were subjected to standard acute, subacute and chronic models of inflammation at 200 and 400 mg/kg. Further, in vitro cytokine release estimation (IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) using ELISA and the identification and quantification of major constituents with the RP-HPLC was done. All extracts (200 and 400 mg/kg) produced significant inhibition while methanol extract (400 mg/kg) caused a maximum inhibition of 43% in paw edema, 75% inhibition in subacute and 59.28% inhibition in the chronic inflammation model.

It is desired that the invariant be the weakest possible so as to provide maximal options to the algorithm for adding fault-tolerance.

Since the sensors are constrained by limited power and are mostly idle, it is important that the sensors conserve energy. We show how time division multiple access (TDMA) can be effectively used to provide energy-efficient convergecast. This solution allows the sensors to save energy when the network is idle and to switch to active mode when the network observes an event.

In the context of partitioned data stores, it has been shown that implicit dependency tracking using timestamps is more efficient than explicit dependency tracking. Existing time-based solutions depend on monotonic psychical clocks that are closely synchronized. These requirements make current protocols vulnerable to clock anomalies. In this paper, we propose a new time-based algorithm, CausalSpartanX, that instead of physical clocks, utilizes Hybrid Logical Clocks (HLCs). We show that using HLCs, without any overhead, we make the system robust on physical clock anomalies. This improvement is more significant in the context of query amplification, where a single query results in multiple GET/PUT operations. We also show that CausalSpartanX decreases the visibility latency for a given data item compared with existing time-based approaches. In turn, this reduces the completion time of collaborative applications where two clients accessing two different replicas edit same items of the data store. CausalSpartanX also provides causally consistent distributed read-only transactions. CausalSpartanX read-only transactions are non-blocking and require only one round of communication between the client and the servers. Also, the slowdowns of partitions that are unrelated to a transaction do not affect the performance of the transaction.

Also, the designer needs to solve several high-level problems such as routing, leader election, and di using computation that are already considered in distributed systems and traditional networking. Therefore, to simplify the design of sensor network protocols, in this paper, we propose ProSe, a programming tool for sensor networks that enables the following i specify programs in simple abstract models considered in distributed systems literature while hiding low-level details, ii reuse existing algorithms in the context of sensor networks, and iii automate code generation and deployment. Furthermore, ProSe helps in rapid prototyping and quick deployment of sensor networks. Finally, ProSe enables the transition where protocols are designed by domain experts rather than experts in sensor networks.Descriptors:", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["512"]}

To reduce storage space and upload bandwidth in cloud storage deduplication has been a well-known technique. For that purpose convergent encryption has been extensively adopt for secure deduplication, critical issue of making convergent encryption practical is to efficiently and reliably manage a huge number of convergent keys. The basic idea in this paper is that we can eliminate duplicate copies of storage data and limit the damage of stolen data if we decrease the value of that stolen information to the attacker. This paper makes the first attempt to formally address the problem of achieving efficient and reliable key management in secure deduplication. We first introduce a baseline approach in which each user holds an independent master key for encrypting the convergent keys and outsourcing them. However, such a baseline key management scheme generates an enormous number of keys with the increasing number of users and requires users to dedicatedly protect the master keys. To this end, we propose Dekey, User Behaviour Profiling and Decoys technology. Dekey new construction in which users do not need to manage any keys on their own but instead securely distribute the convergent key shares across multiple servers for insider attacker. As a proof of concept, we implement Dekey using the Ramp secret sharing scheme and demonstrate that Dekey incurs limited overhead in realistic environments.

Multitolerance is desirable when a program is subject to different classes of faults and for each class, a different level of fault-tolerance has to be guaranteed. With this verification, we formally prove the correctness of the synthesis algorithms, which in turn shows that that any program synthesized by them is indeed correct-by-construction. We effectively reuse formal proofs of our previous work on a fixpoint theory on finite sets and a fault-tolerance theory developed for the case where programs are subject to a single class of faults.

We propose a detect-rollback based approach: The designer identifies a correctness predicate, say , and continues to run the protocol, as our system monitors . If  is violated (because the underlying key-value store provides a weaker consistency), the system rolls back and resumes the computation at a state where  holds. We evaluate this approach with practical graph applications running on the Voldemort key-value store. Our experiments with deployment on Amazon AWS EC2 instances shows that using eventual consistency with monitoring can provide a  increase in throughput when compared with sequential consistency.

Existing key-value stores that provide causal consistency (or detection of causal violation) utilize a static approach in the trade-off between these requirements. Depending upon the choice, it assists some applications and penalizes some applications. We propose an alternative where the system provides a set of tracking groups and checking groups.

The motion of the arc ensures that no particular area of the contact surface is overheated thus minimizing the emission of metal vapor and temperature rise of the contact surface and hence enhancing the current interruption performance. The arc motion is the result of the interaction of the arc current and the magnetic field produced by the flow of the current through the contacts. The velocity of the arc motion would thus be governed by the magnitude of arc current and the design of the contact. Higher the velocity of motion of the arc, higher would be the probability of a successful interruption.

Given the essential regulatory role of protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor 6 (PTPN6) in virus-induced myositis, the expression of the PTPN6 and TNF-\u03b1 genes in a CHIKV-infected muscle cell line was examined by quantitative PCR, and the expression of PTPN6 and STAT 3 was examined by immunoblotting. In addition, the effect of PTPN6 siRNA treatment on TNF-\u03b1 gene expression was assessed. Increased higher expression of PTPN6 and TNF-\u03b1, and significant upregulation of TNF-\u03b1 upon PTPN6 siRNA treatment were observed, suggesting that CHIKV has the ability to induce host PTPN6 gene expression, which may lead to a decreased pro-inflammatory immune response in the host.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["512"]}

{"title": "Lazy repair for addition of fault-tolerance to distributed programs\n", "abstract": " We focus on the issue of realizability constraints in the context of model repair. Model repair focuses on revising a given program to satisfy new properties of interest while satisfying existing properties such as fault-tolerance. An important difficulty in using model repair is that the repaired model must be realizable in the constraints given by the underlying system. It is well-known that these realizability constraints cause an increase in the complexity of model repair (e.g., from P to NP-complete). Hence, existing approaches for adding fault-tolerance to distributed program focuses on cautious repair where in every step, the model being repaired satisfies the realizability constraints. They also utilize heuristics to reduce the complexity of repair. In this work, we focus on using lazy repair while adding fault-tolerance. Specifically, in this work, we utilize a two-step approach.

This is unacceptable since the actions they take in these situations can be different than those in the normal mode. Moreover, eventually, the auditable event needs to be cleared so that system resumes the normal operation. With this motivation, in this paper, we present a protocol for auditable restoration, where any process can potentially identify an auditable event.

Unbalance is a common feature of all rotational elements, results vibrations in the whole system. This study differs from the others due to the load carried by the bearing. In practice, the load applied is with some eccentricity and produces unbalanced force on bearing. This paper deals with the experimental investigation of the ball bearing health with and without unbalancing load. The vibration response from ball bearing due to the change in unbalancing mass, eccentricity for healthy and defective bearing with varying speed is found experimentally by using FFT analyser. The study investigated the variation of statistical parameters of vibration signals acquired from Ball bearings with respect to speed. The RMS value & peak value analysis validates that the ball bearing health can be fairly monitored using Time Domain Analysis.

Although the increase in concentration of T and B regulatory cells makes pregnancy a state of increased immunologic tolerance toward the semiallogeneic fetal antigens, a prevalent T helper (Th) 2 profile, that is reported to be associated with pregnancy, may cause exacerbation of pemphigus and AIBDs in general during this period. Active disease may lead to stillbirth, spontaneous abortion, preterm pregnancy, low birthweight, and neonatal pemphigus. PG is a rare AIBD usually starting during the third trimester of pregnancy and healing in the postpartum. It is due to the formation of autoantibodies directed against different epitopes of bullous pemphigoid (BP) 180 as a consequence of the aberrant expression of BP180 in the placental tissue of genetically predisposed women.

{"title": "Automation of fault-tolerant graceful degradation\n", "abstract": " Traditionally, (nonmasking and masking) fault-tolerance has focused on ensuring that after the occurrence of faults, the program recovers to states from where it continues to satisfy its original specification. However, a problem with this limited notion is that, in some cases, it may be impossible to recover to states from where the entire original specification is satisfied. For this reason, one can consider a fault-tolerant graceful-degradation program that ensures that upon the occurrence of faults, the program recovers to states from where a (given) subset of its specification is satisfied. Typically, the subset of specification satisfied thus would be the critical/important requirements. In this paper, we initially focus on automatically revising a given fault-intolerant program into a fault-tolerant gracefully degrading program. Specifically, we propose a two-step approach: In the first step, we transform the fault-intolerant\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["512"]}

As the voltage levels increases, so do the stresses. Hence, the high voltage withstand performance of the vacuum interrupter becomes extremely significant and demands greater attention. The withstand and breakdown voltage behaviour of a vacuum gap is a strong function of the electrode's shapes and surface conditions. The shape of electrodes and other metallic objects in the vacuum gap determines the geometric enhancement factor, \u03b2 g . Appropriate design of the electrode results in the lowering of \u03b2 g  and hence enhancement of withstand and breakdown voltages. The micro-protrusions present on the surface of the electrodes results in increase of the stress and this is accounted for by a factor called microscopic enhancement\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["512"]}

{"title": "Systematic study of Tamra (Copper) Bhasma prepared by traditional Ayurveda method\n", "abstract": " Bhasmas, the formulations, which can be prepared from metals, minerals or even some marine products, are being used in Ayurvedic system of medicine. Copper (Tamra) is one such metal, used to prepare a bhasma, called \u201cTamra Bhasma\u201d(TB) which is claimed to cure various diseased conditions. Though bhasmas are prepared since centuries, the exact mechanism of conversion of metal to its bhasma, especially by the use of modern scientific tools is not established. Here is an attempt to prepare TB as per the text \u201cAyurved Sar Sangraha\u201d and analyze the stepwise changes in terms of chemistry. TB was prepared from the copper wires. Steps involved in the preparation were shodhan, maran and post maran treatment. Raw materials, intermediates and finished product were analyzed as per Ayurvedic pharmacopeia. Modern scientific techniques such as XRD, XPS and SEM were employed to assess the changes taking place during the steps of preparation and thus characterization of the intermediates and finished drug was accomplished. Chronological study of TB preparation, showed that conversion of copper metal to its compounds starts right from shodhan process. Further changes occurring during maran and post maran treatment, gave fair idea about the complex mechanism of TB formation. Sixteen cycles of incineration (puta) were required to get the final product which fulfilled the Ayurveda tests. At the end of puta 16, XRD indicates Cu2O and CuO as major phases in TB, which subsequently transforms into CuO after puta 22.

Our notion of tamper-evident stabilization captures the intuition that the system will tolerate perturbation upto a limit. And, in the event that it is perturbed beyond that limit then it will exhibit permanent evidence of tampering, where it may provide reduced (possibly none) functionality.

In fact, we observe from several case studies that the cost of verification under weak fairness is more than 1000 times that of the cost without fairness. For the case where weak fairness is essential for self-stabilization, we demonstrate the feasibility of two approaches for improving scalability:(1) decomposition and (2) utilizing the weaker version of self-stabilization, namely weak stabilization.

Such techniques parallelize the state space of a given model over a network or cluster of workstations and run a distributed model checking algorithm over the parallelized state space. On the other hand, the space explosion problem is still unaddressed in the context of automated program synthesis. With this motivation, we concentrate on the problem of designing distributed algorithms for automated program synthesis.

The Lagrangian method is adopted to analyse vibrations generated due to circumferential motions of the ball as well as its contact with an inner and outer ring. The contact between the ball and bearing rings are assumed to be of nonlinear spring whose stiffness is computed using Hertz theory. The Runge Kutta method is implemented to solve nonlinear equations of motion. The effect of extended outer raceway defect size and speed on the vibration characteristics of the ball bearing is analysed. The frequency domain transformation indicates that vibration characteristic of ball bearing varies as a result of nonlinear load deflection relation during the interaction of ball and raceway defect. The analysis implied that defect size and speed of the ball bearing are influencing parameters affecting the dynamic response of the bearing.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["512"]}
{"title": "Uses of Magnetron Discharge to Assess the Vacuum Level of Vacuum Interrupter\n", "abstract": " The unique selling propositions for a vacuum interrupter (VI) are its compactness, negligible maintenance and a high degree of reliability. The on-site reliability of a VI primarily depends on its vacuum level in addition to the breaker and site conditions. The vacuum level i.e. the pressure inside the VI should be below a certain threshold during commissioning and also during its entire service life. As the VI is a sealed-off device, direct measurement of the pressure is not possible. Hence an inferential method called as inverted magnetron is employed for this purpose. This method measures the ion current through the interrupter on the application of a high voltage across the open gap and a magnetic field. This ion current in turn is correlated to the pressure inside the VI. While the magnitude of the ion current gives the pressure at the particular instant, the nature of the waveform throws light on kind of gases present\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["512"]}

The effect of different types of defects affect the bearing performance but the most common type is the surface defects on the races which may cause sudden failure of machine and hence rated life reduces. Surface defects include surface roughness, waviness & misaligned races. These are caused due to manufacturing error & operating conditions.

{"title": "Ensuring Average Recovery with Adversarial Scheduler\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we focus on revising a given program so that the average recovery time in the presence of an adversarial scheduler is bounded by a given threshold lambda. Specifically, we consider the scenario where the fault (or other unexpected action) perturbs the program to a state that is outside its set of legitimate states. Starting from this state, the program executes its actions/transitions to recover to legitimate states. However, the adversarial scheduler can force the program to reach one illegitimate state that requires a longer recovery time. To ensure that the average recovery time is less than lambda, we need to remove certain transitions/behaviors. We show that achieving this average response time while removing minimum transitions is NP-hard. In other words, there is a tradeoff between the time taken to synthesize the program and the transitions preserved to reduce the average convergence time. We present six different heuristics and evaluate this tradeoff with case studies. Finally, we note that the average convergence time considered here requires formalization of hyperproperties. Hence, this work also demonstrates feasibility of adding (certain) hyperproperties to an existing program.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["512"]}

The FecB mutation, which increases prolificacy, was introduced into the Deccani breed from the Garole breed of West Bengal by the Nimbkar Agricultural Research Institute (NARI), to increase lamb production and incomes of sheep owners. In 2002 NARI began to disseminate FecB-carrier rams and ewes into 26 local sheep owners\u2019 flocks to enable field testing of FecB-carrier progeny born in those flocks. In order to assess their opinions of the FecB rams and ewes and the resulting twin lambs, surveys were conducted with 23 of the participating sheep owners. They were asked to assess the perceived advantages, disadvantages and risks associated with twin lambs, to outline their management responses to twin lambs, and to describe their preferred ram phenotype. In general, the sheep owners\u2019 responses to twin lambs were positive. Twin lambs were viewed as more profitable than single lambs, with the main disadvantage cited as the need to undertake supplementary feeding and management to ensure adequate growth rates and survival of twin lambs. Recommendations made as a result of the survey include the need for further financial analysis of costeffective supplementary feeding and management of twin lamb flocks; the development of phenotypes for FecB-carrier rams that are more acceptable to local sheep owners; and the need for an education and extension program to support sheep owners in their adoption of the new technology.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["512"]}
{"title": "Feasibility of stepwise addition of multitolerance to high atomicity programs\n", "abstract": " We present sound and (deterministically) complete algorithms for stepwise design of two families of multitolerant programs in a high atomicity program model, where a program can read and write all its variables in an atomic step. We illustrate that if one needs to add failsafe (respectively, nonmasking) fault-tolerance to one class of faults and masking fault-tolerance to another class of faults, then such an addition can be done in separate polynomial-time (in the state space of the fault-intolerant program) steps regardless of the order of addition. This result has a significant methodological implication in that designers need not be concerned about unknown fault tolerance requirements that may arise due to unanticipated types of faults. Further, we illustrate that if one needs to add failsafe fault-tolerance to one class of faults and nonmasking fault-tolerance to a different class of faults, then the resulting problem is NP-complete in program state space. This is a counterintuitive result in that adding failsafe and nonmasking fault-tolerance to the same class of faults can be done in polynomial time. We also present sufficient conditions for polynomial-time addition of failsafe-nonmasking multitolerance to programs. Finally, we demonstrate the stepwise addition of multitolerance in the context of a token ring protocol and a repetitive agreement protocol that is subject to Byzantine and transient faults.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["512"]}
{"title": "Influence of uniformity of the axial magnetic field in a vacuum interrupter on the performance of the contacts\n", "abstract": " A vacuum interrupter utilises a magnetic field for effective arc extinction. Based on the type of field, the vacuum interrupters are classified as radial or axial magnetic type of vacuum interrupters. This paper focuses on the axial magnetic field type of vacuum interrupters. The magnitude and distribution of the axial magnetic field is a function of the design of the contact system. It also depends on the orientations of the movable and fixed contact systems with respect to each other. This paper investigates the dependence of arcing and erosion performance of the contact on the magnitude and distribution of this axially oriented magnetic field. The experimental observations are well supported by electromagnetic simulations.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["512"]}
{"title": "Terminating alternator\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we present an program that enables the transformation of a non-terminating alternator into a terminating alternator. Our solution is stabilization preserving and has the potential to preserve maximal concurrency (if available) provided by the non-terminating alternator. It can also be used to transform a program that is stabilizing in interleaving semantics into a program that is stabilizing in powerset semantics. We also discuss how the terminating alternator can be used to enable a process to gain an understanding of system stability.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["512"]}
{"title": "A Case Study of Mixed-Mode Adaptation1\n", "abstract": " An adaptation in a distributed system involves changes to multiple processes. Since the adaptation cannot happen atomically (instantaneously), the changes to multiple processes need to synchronized to ensure correctness of adaptation. The service interruption time and communication overhead during adaptation depends on the synchronization required when changing multiple processes. In this paper we consider mixed-mode adaptation that helps in reducing the synchronization requirements during adaptation, thereby improving the service interruption time and communication overhead. However, there are challenges in mixed-mode adaptation due to overlapping of behavior during adaptation. In this paper, we identify various challenges in mixed-mode adaptation and discuss how we address some of them using a case study.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["512"]}
{"title": "Present status of 10 MeV, 10 kW Industrial RF electron linac\n", "abstract": " A 10 MeV, 10 kW RF Electron linac for industrial applications has been installed at the Electron Beam Centre (EBC), Kharghar, Navi Mumbai and commissioned with 10 Me , {approx} 1 mA, 10 {mu}s pulse at 100 Hz PRF. 50 keV electron beam, produced by an LaB6 based electron gun injected into the on-axis coupled cavity linac, which accelerates the beam to an energy of 10 MeV. A 2856 MHz, 3.5 MW Klystron based RF Power source has been used to establish the required electric field of 18 MV/m inside the linac. The magnetic sweep scanner has been used to deflect the beam, which then passes through the scan horn and SS304 (100 {mu}m foil) window before it comes out in air. The complete linac assembly is maintained in vacuum of {approx} 10{sup -7} mbar using sputter-ion pumps. Energy of the output beam has been determined by the magnetic analyzer as well as beam dose on aluminium plates. This paper describes the present status of the subsystems of the linac.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["512"]}
