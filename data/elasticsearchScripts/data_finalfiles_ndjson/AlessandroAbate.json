Whilst the verifier uses the SMT solver Z3, thus ensuring the overall soundness of the procedure, we examine two alternatives for the learner: a numerical approach based on the optimisation tool Gurobi, and a sound approach based again on Z3.

{"title": "Data-driven and model-based verification: A bayesian identification approach\n", "abstract": " This work develops a measurement-driven and model-based formal verification approach, applicable to systems with partly unknown dynamics. We provide a principled method, grounded on reachability analysis and on Bayesian inference, to compute the confidence that a physical system driven by external inputs and accessed under noisy measurements verifies a temporal logic property. A case study is discussed, where we investigate the bounded- and unbounded-time safety of a partly unknown linear time invariant system.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["1810"]}
{"title": "Irreversible prey diapause as an optimal strategy of a physiologically extended Lotka\u2013Volterra model\n", "abstract": " We propose an optimal control framework to describe intra-seasonal predator\u2013prey interactions, which are characterized by a continuous-time dynamical model comprising predator and prey density, as well as the energy budget of the prey over the length of a season. The model includes a time-dependent decision variable for the prey, representing the portion of the prey population in time that is active, as opposed to diapausing (a state of physiological rest). The predator follows autonomous dynamics and accordingly it remains active during the season. The proposed model is a generalization of the classical Lotka\u2013Volterra predator\u2013prey model towards non-autonomous dynamics that furthermore includes the effect of an energy variable. The model has been inspired by a specific biological system of predatory mites (Acari: Phytoseiidae) and prey mites (so-called fruit-tree red spider mites) (Acari\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["1810"]}
{"title": "Probabilistic invariance of mixed deterministic-stochastic dynamical systems\n", "abstract": " This work is concerned with the computation of probabilistic invariance (or safety) over a finite horizon for mixed deterministic-stochastic, discrete-time processes over a continuous state space. The models of interest are made up of two sets of (possibly coupled) variables: the first set of variables has associated dynamics that are described by deterministic maps (vector fields), whereas the complement has dynamics that are characterized by a stochastic kernel. The contribution shows that the probabilistic invariance problem can be separated into two parts: a deterministic reachability analysis, and a probabilistic invariance problem that depends on the outcome of the first. This technique shows advantages over a fully probabilistic approach, and allows putting forward an approximation algorithm with explicit error bounds. The technique is tested on a case study modeling a chemical reaction network.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["1810"]}
{"title": "Approximate abstractions of discrete-time controlled stochastic hybrid systems\n", "abstract": " This work presents a procedure to construct a finite abstraction of a controlled discrete-time stochastic hybrid system. The state space and the control space of the original system are partitioned by finite lattices, according to some refinement parameters. The errors introduced by the abstraction procedure can be explicitly computed, over time, given some continuity assumptions on the original model. We show that the errors can be arbitrarily tuned by selecting the partition accuracy. The obtained abstraction can be interpreted as a controlled Markov set-Chain, and can be used both for verification and control design purposes. We test the proposed technique to analyze a model from systems biology.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["1810"]}
