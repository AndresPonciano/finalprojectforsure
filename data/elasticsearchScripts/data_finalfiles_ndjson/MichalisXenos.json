Students\u2019 marks in a few written assignments can constitute the training set for a supervised machine learning algorithm. Along with the explosive increase of data and information, incremental learning ability has become more and more important for machine learning approaches. The online algorithms try to forget irrelevant information instead of synthesizing all available information (as opposed to classic batch learning algorithms). Nowadays, combining classifiers is proposed as a new direction for the improvement of the classification accuracy. However, most ensemble algorithms operate in batch mode. Therefore a better proposal is an online ensemble of classifiers that combines an incremental version of Naive Bayes, the 1-NN and the WINNOW algorithms using\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "193\n", "authors": ["1139"]}

{"title": "Proving copyright ownership using hard instances of computationally intractable problems\n", "abstract": " In this work wepresent a method for proving copyrightownership based on Zero Knowledge Interactive Proof (ZKIP) protocols for computationally intractable problems. We use the 3-coloring problem, which consists in assigning one of three available colors to the vertices of a graph so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. Using the presumed computational intractability of this problem, we propose the construction of large signatures that represent adjacency matrices of random, 3-colorable graphs. Since it is easy to construct large graphs with a prescribed 3-coloring of their vertices whereas it is difficult to discover such a 3-coloring, the owner of a copyrighted digital piece of work (eg image, audio, video) may easily generate a random 3-colorable graph, embed it in the digital object and then use the knowledge of the 3-coloring in debates over the object's ownership. Due to the intractability of the 3-coloring problem, only the owner is able to produce it sufficiently fast in an ownership challenge so as to convince a third party that the graph was indeed embedded in the object by herself/himself. Since we need graphs with maximum possible resistance to well-known coloring algorithms, we exploit some relatively recent experimental and theoretical findings suggesting that hard 3-coloring instances are found among graphs having a vertices to edges ratio around a specific threshold value. The proposed scheme has the additional advantage that disclosing the signature is of no consequences since it is essentially the knowledge of a characteristic of the signature, ie the 3-coloring of the graph it represents, that enables one to use it as\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1139"]}

Our engineering approach makes us decompose abstract terms\u2013such as software quality\u2013until we reach quantifiable, measurable characteristics. It is this approach with regard to software quality that had lead to the development of commonly applied quality standards. But what about users of our software, particularly those who rarely take an engineering approach similar to ours simply because the deploy a different way of thinking? How do they perceive software quality? If we are to improve the quality of software that we produce, it is important to understand and address their way of thinking too. We argue that the way in which these software users perceive software quality compares to the way impressionist painters perceived visual reality in terms of transient effects of light and color. In order to prove this point we present data from software projects during the last ten years. Analysis of these data has guided us to conclude that the initial user impression of software quality is hard to change. In particular, the positive impressions may be revised in time, but not significantly, whilst the negative impressions are very hard to change over time.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1139"]}

Diagramatic is a complete environment offering to the professor a design application to create games and a management application. The management application is used for monitoring the games while students play, as well as to present the results to the students after the end of each game, or to evaluate these results after classroom time. The students may use the mobile application on their mobiles to practice by designing diagrams outside of the classroom, as well as to play a game during classroom time, but only after the professor starts this game. The environment handles the communication from students' mobiles to the professor's applications and vice versa, while the students submit their diagrams or receive the correct ones, so to proceed to follow up games.

The specific study was stimulated by the heavy flow of information carried through distance education fora, aiming to fill the gap that exists in this area, which is demonstrated by the relevant bibliographic review. For this purpose: a) a relevant observation was made in Hellenic Open University fora, b) the research problem and goal/finality were declared, both on the technological level and on the application level (pedagogical usability), c) a language was created which was specified using mathematical terms and represents the messages, d) a related system was designed and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1139"]}

{"title": "A usability evaluation approach in elearning environments: The Case of IBM Lotus QUICKR\n", "abstract": " Hellenic Open University, in the context of providing distance education through innovative methods and activities, uses a number of learning environments. The presented platform in this study is the IBM Lotus Quickr, which is an environment that provides information about courses, classes, students\u2019 projects of HOU and is based on the distribution and collaboration of learning content and activities. In this paper, the IBM Lotus Quickr educational platform, the usability evaluation experiment and its results are presented. IBM Lotus Quickr as every educational environment which is used for educational purposes should be ensured that supports learning efficiently, effectively and through a usable way. In order to ensure that, a usability evaluation was applied to the platform aiming to reveal any usability issue that affect users\u2019 interaction, using an extended version of the widely known heuristic evaluation. The extension includes the 10 heuristic rules proposed by Nielsen and Molich [3] enriched with 5 additional heuristics specialized for educational platforms, which were created by considering various studies based on heuristics.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1139"]}

{"title": "Secure information hiding based on computationally intractable problems\n", "abstract": " In this work, a method for proving copyright ownership is presented that is based on Zero Knowledge Interactive Proof (ZKIP) protocols for computationally intractable problems. The utilized problem is the 3-coloring problem, which consists in assigning one of three available colors to the vertices of a graph so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. Using the presumed computational intractability of this problem, the construction of large signatures is proposed so that they represent adjacency matrices of random, 3-colorable graphs. Since it is easy to construct large graphs with a prescribed 3-coloring of their vertices whereas it is difficult to discover such a 3-coloring, the owner of a copyrighted digital piece of work (e.g. image, audio, video) may easily generate a random 3-colorable graph, embed it in the digital object and then use the knowledge of the 3-coloring in debates over the object\u2019s\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1139"]}

The aim of this paper is to share with readers conclusions based on over ten years of experience in software projects management and research in the field of software quality assurance by presenting simple issues related to the design, implementation and delivery of a typical software project. The project presented in this paper serves as a model of a typical software project (case study), in an effort to offer specific practical examples for demonstrating the practical quality issues and problems arising in the majority of software projects. Both the initial design of the quality and the practical issues that arose during implementation affecting final product quality are discussed in this paper.

It presents the evolution of patient record and the new quality requirements that have occurred with its practical use. Section 2 presents the current status of the computer-based patient record. This status is evaluated in accordance with the quality requirements for such a record and in accordance with how it uses the state-of-the-art tools and techniques. Additionally, it presents the reasoning as to why the current patient record need to change, in order to satisfy current quality requirements. In section 3 a proposal for a universal computerbased patient record is presented.
