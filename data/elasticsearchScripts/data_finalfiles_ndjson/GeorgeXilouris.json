{"title": "Evaluation of Apache spot's machine learning capabilities in an SDN/NFV enabled environment\n", "abstract": " Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) are transforming modern networks towards a service-oriented architecture. At the same time, the cybersecurity industry is rapidly adopting Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to improve detection and mitigation of complex attacks. Traditional intrusion detection systems perform signature-based detection, based on well-known malicious traffic patterns that signify potential attacks. The main drawback of this method is that attack patterns need to be known in advance and signatures must be preconfigured. Hence, typical systems fail to detect a zero-day attack or an attack with unknown signature. This work considers the use of machine learning for advanced anomaly detection, and specifically deploys the Apache Spot ML framework on an SDN/NFV-enabled testbed running cybersecurity services as Virtual Network Functions (VNFs).

To avoid this negative effect, service and content providers are looking for architectures that give them greater control on traffic passing through their domains and other heterogeneous networks.

To support this, the content has to be identified, described, generated, delivered, managed and protected. Furthermore, content/services of different format will be distributed over heterogeneous networks and delivered on a variety of user terminals. The scarce resource of bandwidth needs to be dynamically managed and the QoS should remain within predefined limits, accepted by the end users. This will enable the provision of network and terminal resources on demand to form user communities, where the content can be created, protected and shared, always with the agreed/contracted quality, reliability and flexibility. It is therefore imperative to develop an integrated solution that is able to manage the functionality of various entities in the digital information distribution chain, from content/service generation to user terminals, using heterogeneous networks, comprised of wired (IP based core network) and wireless (DVB, WLAN, UMTS) segments, and based on the end-to-end QoS approach.

{"title": "A perceived quality-aware cross layer monitoring framework for real-time media content adaptation\n", "abstract": " The media content provision in a variety of quality and price levels, through the concept of the perceived quality of service (PQoS) is considered as the most dominant among the various future visions of multimedia networking. The concept of the PQoS-driven service provision, based on multimedia content adaptation across heterogeneous networks, will become in the near future a key-issue among service providers (SPs). This paper presents, describes and proposes a novel cross layer monitoring architecture, driven by a prototype mapping between network QoS (NQoS) and PQoS parameters, aiming at providing perceived performance verification with respect to the QoS guarantees specified in contractual agreements between providers and end-users. Towards this, the proposed framework takes sophisticated actions for real time media content adaption with aim the optimization of the finally delivered\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1938"]}
{"title": "A demonstration infrastructure for E2E QoS services provisioning\n", "abstract": " The content delivery chain encompasses content creation, delivery and consumption. To support this, the content has to be identified, described, generated, delivered, managed and protected. Furthermore, content/services of different format will be distributed over heterogeneous networks and delivered on a variety of user terminals. The scarce resource of bandwidth needs to be dynamically managed and the QoS should remain within predefined limits, accepted by the end users. This will enable the provision of network and terminal resources on demand to form user communities, where the content can be created, protected and shared, always with the agreed/contracted quality, reliability and flexibility. It is therefore imperative to develop an integrated solution that is able to manage the functionality of various entities in the digital information distribution chain, from content/service generation to user terminals\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1938"]}

{"title": "Mobility issues in a DVB-T environment.\n", "abstract": " Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) is the leading technology for permitting digital television access to a wide repartition of users. There exist many different types of DVB technologies: DVB-T for Terrestrial, DVB-S for Satellite, DVB-C for Cable, each one with its own specifications. This paper focuses on the DVB-T mechanism and the way it handles mobility; it describes all the mobility issues and challenges arising from this technology. Investigations on the integration of the Internet Protocol, IP, over the coming terrestrial digital television standard, DVB-T, are also included. It presents mobility scenarios in a special DVB-T environment, along with a complete broadcasting architecture, in which all leading mobile technologies coexist, and provides solutions and enhancements for a better technology deployment.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1938"]}
