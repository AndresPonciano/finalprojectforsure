Following an object identifier to access the referenced object is called navigation operation and is an essential operation in dealing with complex objects. Navigation operation is a difficult operation to implement efficiently since every navigation operation inherently causes one disk access operation. This paper proposes a scheme to notably accelerate the navigation operation among a sea of complex objects, by increasing the effective number of objects in one disk page. The main concept of the presented technique is threefold: The first is to store a cached value within a complex object that is referencing another complex object. The second is that when the referenced object is to be updated the update propagation is delayed until the time when the cached value is referenced. Lastly, the third idea is to utilize a hashed table on main memory to efficiently validate the consistency between the cached values and the original values.", "num_citations": "37\n", "authors": ["363"]}

The method enables transparent treatment of pointers in RPC by combining three key techniques: virtual memory manipulation, pointer swizzling, and coherency protocol.

{"title": "Kumoi: A high-level scripting environment for collective virtual machines\n", "abstract": " We have designed and implemented a scripting environment called \"Kumoi\" for managing collective VMs in a large-scale data center. Kumoi is unlike other scripting environments because it exploits strong typing with type inference and high-level description. Kumoi introduces several advancements, including treating virtual machines as first-class objects and decoupling the scripting model and its execution for hiding as many details as possible. We implemented Kumoi as an embedded domain-specific language based on Scala along with distributed agents running on each physical machine. Evaluation using example scripts showed that an administrator can more concisely write the instructions for performing complex VM lifecycle management tasks.

{"title": "Model checking of multi-process applications using SBUML and GDB\n", "abstract": " Model checking, aka systematic exploration of the state space, is widely used as a method of verification of concurrent programs that may involve nondeterminism in their execution order. Especially, direct verification of implementations has been focused on in recent years. The crucial issues for such a model checker include how to explore state space systematically and how to control nondeterminism. Although existing model checkers can do this by running the target programs under a scheduler specialized for verification, this approach is subject to restrictions in its use of OS resources such as file systems. In this work, we propose and implement a framework for the model checking of multi-process applications on an environment that is very close to the one for the actual execution. Our key idea is to combine ScrapBook for User-Mode Linux (SBUML) and the GNU Debugger (GDB) to implement systematic exploration and control of nondeterminism. SBUML provides not only a full-fledged execution environment but also the save-and-restore feature of the entire OS state including its file system. Nondeterminism of the target multi-process application is controlled via the breakpoint mechanism on GDB. Use of breakpoints also enables us to control the granularity of scheduling in a flexible way. We also give some verification examples using this framework.", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["363"]}

However, low cost, high efficiency and no waste water FGD technologies are expected. In order to develop a new type of semi-dry FGD equipment, powder-particle spouted bed (PPSB) was applied to a low temperature desulfurization process. Fine powder slurries of SO2 sorbent were continuously fed to the turbulent spouted bed, in which coarse fluidized medium particles were fluidized with simulated flue gas containing of 500-1500 PPM SO2.

Therefore, the use of MSCs to enhance engraftment and prevent GVHD after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation has been explored. Recent clinical trials have shown the feasibility and safety of intravenous cotransplantation of MSCs with cord blood cells in pediatric patients, but not in adult patients, who are at greater risk of graft failure.

Sixty-four hospitalized patients with gastro-intestinal disease who undertook curative gastro intestinal resection were studied prospectively and administered with TPN solutions. Three types of commercially available TPN products were assigned randomly to eligible patients. Serial studies of blood acid-base status, serum electrolytes, and urinary acid-base status were conducted in the three groups administered with different TPN solutions. Patients received appropriate electrolytic solutions on the operation day and TPN solution from 2 to 7 days after operation. There were no differences among any of the serum electrolytes in the three groups. In one group, urinary pH decreased slightly and urinary net acid excretion (NAE) increased significantly after administration. This TPN product contains about 40 mEq/L of non-metabolizable acid to avoid the Maillard reaction that produces a complex of glucose and amino acids. Urinary NAE did not change in the other two groups. These TPN products do not use non-metabolizable acid to adjust pH. The present results suggest that the non-metabolizable acid may be a risk factor of metabolic acidosis.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["363"]}

Diseases of the patients were leukemia (ten), neuroblastoma (one), bone marrow failure (four) and inborn errors of metabolism (three). A volume of 50-141 ml of cord blood containing 27-197 x 10 (7) nucleated cells was collected from sibling infants soon after delivery. HLA antigens were identical in 14 and one to three antigens mismatched in four. Engraftment of donor cord blood was achieved in 17 cases. Autologous hematopoiesis was recovered in one case. Days of engraftment were 13-29 days (median 19 days) for neutrophils (500/microliter), 18-67 days (median 30 days) for reticulocytes (2%) and 21-96 days (median 46 days) for platelets (50 x 10 (3)/microliter). Acute GVHD was grade 0 in seven cases, grade I in five cases and grade II in one case in HLA-identical pairs, but became grade II in two cases and grade III in two cases in HLA-mismatched pairs. Chronic GVHD of limited type developed in two out of 17 evaluable cases, however both responded to immunosuppressive therapy. Altogether, 14 out of 18 patients are currently surviving 4-27 months following transplantation. Probabilities of overall survival and disease free survival were estimated to be 77.0 and 71.8% using Kaplan-Meier tests.

Biological, serological and molecular evidence has shown that the disease is caused by a geminivirus belonging to the genus Begomovirus. The nucleotide sequence of the viral genomic DNA was determined and compared with sequences obtained from other tomato-infecting begomoviruses. The nucleotide sequence exhibited 98% similarity to a Tomato yellow leaf curl virus sourced from Israel (TYLCV-Is), indicating the begomovirus that currently affects tomato plantation in Kyushu, Japan, is in fact TYLCV-Is. Our results also suggest that the virus, designated as TYLCV-Ng (Ng), has a monopartite type genome composed of two virussense open reading frames (ORFs)[V1 (CP) and V2], four complementary-sense ORFs [C1 (Rep), C2, C3 and C4] and a non-coding region termed the intergenic region (IR). We also analyzed the nucleotide sequence of another TYLCV isolate (TYLCV-Sz. Sz) collected from Shizuoka Prefecture in Tokai area, Japan. The Ng and Sz types were found to belong to the same species, and were classified as TYLCV-Is in accordance with the current classification system for geminiviruses. However, clear molecular differences were found in the nucleotide sequences of the Ng and Sz types, especially in the region from the C1 ORF to the IR, which in this paper we tentatively refer to as the\" variable region\".

SZT2 functions as a regulator of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling in cultured human cell lines and mouse tissues. However, it remains to be determined whether mutations in SZT2 in human patients alter mTORC1 signaling. In this study, we aimed to investigate the functional consequence of biallelic SZT2 variants in Epstein-Barr virus-induced lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) established from two patients with a typical SZT2-related neurodevelopmental disease. Increased phosphorylation of S6 kinase and S6 was identified in patient-derived cell lines under amino acid-starved condition, suggestive of constitutive hyperactivation of mTORC1 signaling. This result was validated by constitutive lysosomal localization of mTOR in patients\u2019 LCLs. Furthermore, patients\u2019 LCLs display an excessive response to slight amino acid stimulation. Our data suggest the loss-of-function nature of SZT2 mutations in the patients, and consequent hyperactivation of mTORC1 signaling in response to both amino acid starvation and stimulation in their LCLs. By these functional analyses, the pathogenicity of newly identified SZT2 variants can be determined, allowing for more detailed characterization of genotype-phenotype correlations.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["363"]}

The research activity was interrupted several times by violent action by anti-whaling groups. As a result, both sighting and sampling surveys in the Area V East were canceled and sampling survey in the Area IV East and Area V West was not fully completed.

HPV test reagents are currently being developed to aid detection of these strains. The present study compared a novel HPV genotyping reagent using a Luminex device, which enables simultaneous quantitation of multiple targets using fluorescent beads, and gene-specific multiplex polymerase chain reaction (Luminex method) with approved in vitro diagnostics. Subjects comprised 256 patients examined at our hospital for either secondary cervical cancer testing or follow-up (mean age, 40 years; age range, 20-85 years) and specimens were obtained using a cervical brush and lavage fluid. The HPV-positive rate with the Luminex method was 51.4%(132/256), of which single and multiple strain infections constituted 65.9%(87/132) and 34.1%(45/132), respectively. Correlation testing of 50 positive and 50 negative Luminex method specimens was conducted using the HPV DNA Hybrid Capture II (HCII), revealing high overall (97%[97/100]), positive (100%[47/47]) and negative (94.3%[50/53]) concordance rates. Correlation was also high for the Clinichip HPV (Clinichip), with overall, positive and negative concordance rates of 98%(98/100), 100%(48/48) and 96.2%(50/52), respectively. Furthermore, the detection concordance rate with the Clinichip was 95.8%(46/48).

Biopsy specimen of a tumor in the left orbit suggested an inflammatory pseudotumor. The orbit was irradiated and the exophthalmos disappeared. During admission, an erythema was noted on her anterior chest wall. After discharge, right exophthalmos and generalized skin eruptions developed. The skin eruption on her anterior chest wall was histopathologically diagnosed as angiocentric lymphoma and she was readmitted. Since her serum was positive for anti-HTLV-I antibody, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma was suspected. Chemotherapy yielded limited relief of the right exophthalmos and transient fading of the skin eruptions. She died due to progression of the disease. Close examination of the skin eruption on the calf revealed that the lymphoma cells were CD56-positive immunohistochemically and electron microscopy revealed that they had large membrane-bound granules. Rearrangement of the T-cell receptor beta chain gene was observed. Incorporation of HTLV-I proviral DNA was not observed. Re-examination of the left orbital tumor confirmed the infiltration of these lymphoma cells.

In addition, the overhead of live migration mechanisms should be as low as possible. This paper introduces BLMVisor, a live migration scheme for bare-metal clouds.

Although a security administrator in organizations can install monitoring software, an end-user can remove and bypass this kind of software on conventional operating systems. Most existing commercial operating systems cannot enforce a mandatory security policy to end-users.

To verify the feasibility of this approach, we implemented a framework within Hadoop DFS (HDFS) named Hadoop Data Reduction Framework (HDRF). The features of HDRF is threefold.

In the restaurant industry, which suffers from labor shortages, filtering candidates is unrealistic, and it is important to maintain newly hired employees. In this study, we propose a new model, based on recurrent neural networks, that predicts the early turnover of new restaurant employees by using their attendance records and attributes.

The Yule--Simon process, which has shown the ability to capture the population dynamics of social tagging behavior, does not handle the mechanism of new vocabulary creation because it assumes that new vocabulary creation is a Poisson-like random process. In this research, we focus on the mechanism of vocabulary creation from the microscopic perspective and discuss whether it also follows the random process assumed in the Yule--Simon process. To capture the microscopic mechanism of vocabulary creation, we focus on the relationship between the number of tags used in the same entry and the local vocabulary creation rate.

In the original MPTCP, an ACK packet goes through the same path that its originating packet has come through, even if a better path is available. The path that the originating packet came through is not always an appropriate path because the characteristics of the path (RTT, bandwidth, etc.) can be diverse.

The key idea is to use a distributed hash table and migrate its virtual nodes dynamically so as to skew the workload towards a subset of physical disks while not overloading them. To realize this idea in an autonomous way, virtual nodes are regarded as selfish agents playing a game in which each node receives a payoff according to the workload of the disk on which it currently resides. We model this setting as a potential game, a kind of strategic game in which the incentive of all players to change their strategy can be represented by a single global function. Thus, any increase in the payoff of a virtual node yields a better state in terms of energy conservation. This game model consists of a pair of global and private payoff functions, derived by the Wonderful Life Utility scheme. The former function evaluates how good the current state of the system is, while the latter determines the current payoff of each node. The performance of our method is measured both by simulations and a prototype implementation. From the experiments, we observed that our method consumed 11.1%\u201316.4% less energy than the static configuration.

{"title": "Signal transduction of serotonin release from enterochromaffin cells in mouse ileal crypts\n", "abstract": " Although serotonin (5-HT) release from enterochromaffin (EC) cells is considered to be regulated by multiple receptor-mediated mechanisms, little is known about the signal transduction in EC cells. We investigated the effects of adrenoceptor stimulation on 5-HT release from ileal tissue and intracellular calcium dynamics of epithelial cells in isolated ileal crypts in mice. Ileal tissues placed in organ bath were perfused with a buffered solution. Released 5-HT was measured using HPLC-ECD. Ileal crypts were isolated by collagenase digestion followed by moderate pipetting. Intracellular calcium dynamics were analyzed by digital video-imaging system using fura-2. NE, but not isoprenaline (Iso), induced 5-HT release from mouse ileal tissue. NE-induced 5-HT release was antagonized by yohimbine and rauwolscine, but not by prazosin and bunazosin. NE, but not Iso, also elicited a transient elevation of intracellular calcium in some EC cells. The effect of NE (1 microM) was slightly suppressed by prazosin and bunazosin, but was remarkably suppressed by yohimbine and rauwolscine. UK 14,304 and Clonidine at 10 microM significantly induced an increase in intracellular calcium concentration. NE-induced intracellular calcium dynamics was not significantly affected by timolol, Ro20-1724, rolipram and 8-bromo-cAMP. These results suggest that NE-induced 5-HT release from ileal EC cells is mediated predominantly via alpha 2-, but not beta-adrenoceptors, by a mechanism dependent on elevation of intracellular calcium concentration.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["363"]}

Ideally, the parameter-passing semantics of RMI should be as close as possible to that of local method invocation.

A 66 year old woman was admitted to our hospital with a rectal tumour. A barium enema and colonoscopy revealed that the rectal tumour had a diameter of 1.5 cm. It was located approximately 4.0 cm from the dentate line. An endoscopic polypectomy was performed transanally. Pathologic examination revealed that the tumour was a rectal cancer with pT1 invasion. Additional surgical treatment was required, due to the possibility that unresected cancer was still located at the surgical margin. Endoscopic treatment was performed, using UAS under TEM. The entire rectal wall was fully resected. There were no intraoperative or post-operative complications. We conclude that TEM is a safe and minimally invasive procedure.

For traffic management of this system, travel requests are gathered at a central server and, on this basis, the operation schedule is periodically updated and distributed to each vehicle via intermediate servers. However, the entire traffic system may stop if the central server malfunctions owing to an unforeseen event. To address this problem, we propose a fault-tolerant mechanism for the traffic management system of a last-mile transportation service. We use a modified primary-backup (or so-called passive) replication technique. More precisely, one of the intermediate servers is chosen as the central server and the other intermediate servers periodically receive state-update messages from the central server, allowing them to update their state to match that of the central server. If the central server fails, one of the node servers is selected to take over as the new central server.

Unfortunately, exposing physical hardware to users causes a hardware protection issue for cloud vendors. Since physical hardware uses non-volatile memory (NVM) to store firmware code and configuration data, this is also exposed to users. If the NVM is modified by malicious users, the hardware could be permanently corrupted or infected by malware without being noticed.

We also assessed hematological remission via ROC analysis. The upper cut-off values were calculated to be 220 and 1,820 copies/\u00b5g-RNA in the peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) samples, respectively. Since 50 copies/\u00b5g-RNA was determined to be both, the limit of detection (LOD) and minimal residual disease (MRD) threshold, WT1 mRNA regions below the upper cut-off values indicated remission depth. The detection of high WT1 mRNA levels, even in patients without fusion gene transcripts, reflected the treatment effects and remission depth, demonstrating its capacity to be a useful MRD monitoring marker in ALL.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["363"]}

Our proposed method aims at providing Internet services despite the occurrence of a large-scale disaster. To this end, each service in our method creates replicas in different data centers and coordinates them with an optimistic consensus algorithm instead of a majority-based consensus algorithm such as Paxos. Although our method allows temporary inconsistencies among replicas, it eventually converges on the desired state without an interruption in services. In particular, the method tolerates simultaneous failure of the majority of nodes and a partitioning of the network. Moreover, through interservice communications, members of the service groups are autonomously reorganized according to the type of failure and changes in system load. This enables both load\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["363"]}

Recently, alteration of the IKZF1 gene has been reported to be associated with a poor outcome in pediatric BCP-ALL without BCR-ABL. In addition, it is also reported that a significant proportion of these cases with the alteration of IKZF1 shared the point mutation of JAK2 and over-expression of cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2). Herein, in order to assess the prognostic value of these genetic abnormalities in Japanese cohort, we conducted genetic analysis of IKZF1, JAK2 and CRLF2 in pediatric BCP-ALL.

{"title": "Risk and risk factors of secondary solid cancers after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in adult recipients\n", "abstract": " Background: HCT survivors are at increased risk for developing cardiovascular disease, including A-CHF. We have demonstrated that the risk of post-HCT A-CHF is primarily ascribed to pre-HCT exposure to anthracyclines. This cardiotoxicity is dose-dependent, with well-established modifying risk factors such as age at exposure to anthracyclines, female gender, and mediastinal irradiation. However, these modifiers fail to explain the wide inter-individual variability in the risk of A-CHF. Proposed pathogenesis of A-CHF includes oxidative stress and metabolic derangements induced by intracardiac anthracycline alcohol metabolites. Inherent susceptibility in these pathways could explain the inter-individual variability in risk. Methods: A nested case-control approach was used. Individuals with A-CHF with pre-HCT available germline DNA were identified from patients transplanted at City of Hope between 1990-2007\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["363"]}
{"title": "Dynamic grid quorum: a reconfigurable grid quorum and its power optimization algorithm\n", "abstract": " Power-saving has become a central issue for well-configured SOC platforms. In particular, as a high percentage of the total energy is used by the storage systems, the cost effectiveness of data management is equally as important as reliability and availability. To address this issue, we propose the dynamic grid quorum as a method for reducing the power consumption of large-scale distributed storage systems. The basic principle of our approach is to skew the workload toward a small number of quorums. This can be realized using the following three techniques. First, our system allows reconfiguration by exchanging nodes without any data migration, so that high-capacity nodes can be reallocated to busier quorums. Second, for more effective skewing of the workload, we introduce the notion of dual allocation, which makes it possible to consider two distinct allocations in the same grid for write and read\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["363"]}

{"title": "Simple Certificateless Signature with Smart Cards\n", "abstract": " A certificateless public key cryptosystem (CL-PKC) was proposed for the first time in 2003, and since then it has been attracted. But in fact most CL-PKC is implemented using the pairing technique. So it is difficult so far to apply CL-PKC to an existing encryption system that uses the conventional encryption method such as RSA. Needless to say, it is also difficult in even the system with smart cards. In this paper we propose the signature scheme with the RSA based smart card in the simple CL-PKC. Our scheme does not have user's public key certificate as well as the ID-based cryptography. Also, it has some advantages that there is no escrow problem which occurs in the ID-based cryptography,and that even the manager cannot generate user's falsified signature without changing user's public key.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["363"]}

Our method uses the correlation between events in a sequence to extract distinct characteristics. A key idea behind the ECM method is to regard a sequence as a serialized sequence that originally had structural relations and to extract the embedded dependencies of the events. To test its retrieval performance, we applied the ECM method to the problem of anomaly detection in intrusion detection systems. Specifically, we used the method to model a UNIX command sequence and attempted to detect intruders masquerading as valid users. The experimental results reveal that the ECM method offers distinct characteristic models for analyzing event sequences.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["363"]}

The majority of applet systems at present, as represented by the Java Applet, implement the applets using virtual machine code which is independent of computer architecture. This is advantageous in terms of installation and use in different machine environments. Because virtual machine code is associated with execution by an interpreter or conversion to native code, the design of the virtual machine code greatly impacts performance during execution. Normally, however, representation of virtual machine code is fixed for each applet system and cannot be altered.

Curative resection was considered to be impossible from the clinical findings, so low-dose CDDP+ 5-FU therapy and MTX/5-FU sequential therapy were given. After the chemotherapy, the primary lesion was decreased remarkably and the invasive foci disappeared. Therefore total gastrectomy with perigastric lymphadenectomy and splenic preservation was performed. The histological findings revealed that viable cancer cells remained only in the mucosal layer of the primary lesion. The patient has been alive without recurrence for 66 months after the curative resection. This case report suggests that patients who have good response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy with curative resection appear to have prolonged disease-free and overall survival.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["363"]}

No. 3 boiler and No. 4 boiler were constructed in December, 1988 and July, 1989, respectively, and successfully continue commercial operation. Both the boilers which are of a variable pressure operation natural circulation method reheating type (indoor type) are designed to be 990t/h in continuous steaming rate (by both), 193.2bar in pressure and 541 centigrade in temperature at the superheater outlet. They are provided with a tri-fuel firing burner which facilitates fine coal, heavy oil and natural gas to be exclusively and mixedly fired. Further by taking it into consideration that tunderbolt and other power transmission accidents are predicted to occur on site several times per year, demonstration was also made of individual load operation in the Station, by use of a turbine bypass unit in case of coal firing, seldom used in Japan. 9 figs., 3 tabs.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["363"]}

{"title": "Human monoclonal antibodies with human-mouse hybridomas\n", "abstract": " Our trial to produce human monoclonal antibodies with human-mouse hybridomas is described. Human spleen cells, in comparison with peripheral blood lymphocytes, bone marrow cells and lymphnode lymphocytes, seem to be the best partner to fuse with myeloma line NS-1 to obtain hybridomas. About sixty percent of hybridomas derived from human spleen cells at first produce human Ig which in most cases belong to either IgG or IgM. Fifty percent of hybridomas which had initially produced human Ig continued to do so after 4 months. One of the clones of human monoclonal antibodies reacted with a cell surface antigen expressed on three out of 5 B cell lines, 14 out of 38 Epstein-Barr virus transformed B cell lines and null cell type lymphocytic leukemia cells obtained from one patient out of 34 tested. Other normal or malignant cells, hematopoietic or nonhematopoietic cells examined were negative. The antigen does not seem to be related to EBNA, early antigen and VCA of EB virus, or certain haplotype specificity of HLA-A, B, C, and DR loci. Reports by others on production of monoclonal antibodies with similar approaches were also reviewed.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["363"]}

The meteorological information such as cloud drift winds, cloud top heights are extracted from image data from VISSR. The image data are displayed on a TV-screen of the IPC (Image Processing Console) to manipulate them for man machine interactive processing. In this processing, an analyst selects a target cloud on the TV-screen and inputs the needed information from IPC. The cloud drift winds are reformatted by computer into a WMO code form for teletype transmission to world-wide users twice a day within four hours after the observation. The cloud top heights are used for the production of nephanalysis chart which is sent to final users as facsimile chart four times a day.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["363"]}

{"title": "Exit-Less Isolated Execution\n", "abstract": " Commodity operating systems today rely on a large code base that is hard to be verified, have broad attack surfaces and easily get compromised due to mis-configuration or security bugs. However, the OSs have highest privilege and unrestrained access to the entire system, and applications have no way of preventing their security-sensitive information (eg passwords, encryption keys...) from being revealed or tampered by compromised OSs. Hence mechanisms for securely isolating applications from commodity OSs are highly required [1\u20133]. Previous research [2, 3] proposes easy-to-verify thin hypervisors that isolate applications from OSs. The hypervisors force OS and application domains to be mutually inaccessible by use of nested paging. When execution control is passed between them (due to jumps, interrupts or system calls), the hypervisors trap the events and securely perform context switching between them, properly switching permission of nested pages.However, the context switching by the hypervisors causes costly CPU-mode changes to the hypervisor mode (VM exits), which consume many CPU cycles and heavily pollute cache. Unfortunately, VM exits due to the context switching can be continual because it happens whenever applications are scheduled or invoke system calls, which are more frequent on I/O-intensive workloads. Frequent VM exits result in high overhead on the system performance. To avoid the overhead, we propose ELIE (Exit-Less Isolated Execution): a hypervisor-based scheme for isolating applications from OSs without VM exits. ELIE completely eliminates VM exits from the normal execution path of isolated\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["363"]}
