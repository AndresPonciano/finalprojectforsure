{"title": "A lightweight approach for specification and detection of soap anti-patterns\n", "abstract": " Web-services have become a governing technology for Service Oriented Architectures due to reusability of services and their dependence on other services. The evolution in service based systems demands frequent changes to provide quality of service to customers. It is realised by different researchers that evolution in service based systems may degrade design and quality of service and may generate poor solutions known as antipatterns. The detection of anti-patterns from web services is an important research realm and it is continuously getting the attention of researchers. There are a number of techniques and tools presented for detection of anti-patterns from object oriented software applications but only few approaches are presented for detection of anti-patterns from SOA. The state of the art anti-pattern detection approaches presented for detection of anti-patterns from SOA are not flexible enough and they are limited to detection of only a few anti-patterns. We present a flexible approach supplemented with a tool support to detect 10 anti-patterns from different SOA-based applications. We compare results of our approach with two representative state of the art approaches.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1282"]}
