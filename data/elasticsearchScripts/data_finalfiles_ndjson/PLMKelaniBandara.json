{"title": "Software reliability estimation based on cubic splines\n", "abstract": " Software reliability is one of the most important software quality attribute and Software reliability estimation is a hard problem to solve accurately. However for management of software quality and standard practice of the organization, accurate reliability estimation is important. Non-homogeneous Poisson Process (NHPP) models and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models are among the most important software reliability growth models. In this paper we study an approach using past fault-related data with cubic spline Network model to estimate reliability. A numerical example is shown with simulated datasets. The example shows that the proposed model accurately estimate the software reliability.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1293"]}
{"title": "Optimal selection of failure data for reliability estimation based on a standard deviation method\n", "abstract": " Software reliability is one of software quality factors and it mostly concerns with the failures of the software. Software failures cost money and it affects to the customer satisfaction, as a result the reliability practice is important. However it is evident to say that software reliability practice in the industry is poor. Impairment of accuracy and the complexity of calculations are some of reasons for lack of applicability. Software reliability is estimated using software reliability estimation models based on observed failure data. The software failure behavior change as a result of software code changes during the testing and is a limitation of most reliability estimation models. This fact has not been considered in most of the reliability models. Our study introduces a simple and accurate method for optimal data selection. The optimal failure data are selected based on the fact that the mean is an estimator for sample data and standard\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1293"]}

{"title": "Evaluation of Re-identification Risks in Data Anonymization Techniques Based on Population Uniqueness\n", "abstract": " With the increasing appetite for publicly available personal data for various analytics and decision making, due care must be taken to preserve the privacy of data subjects before any disclosure of data. Though many data anonymization techniques are available, there is no holistic understanding of their risk of re-identification and the conditions under which they could be applied. Therefore, it is imperative to study the risk of re-identification of anonymization techniques across different types of datasets. In this paper, we assess the re-identification risk of four popular anonymization techniques against four different datasets. We use population uniqueness to evaluate the risk of re-identification. As per the analysis, k-anonymity shows the lowest re-identification risk for unbiased samples of the population datasets. Moreover, our findings also emphasize that the risk assessment methodology should depend on the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1293"]}
