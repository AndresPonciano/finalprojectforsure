{"title": "Improved indel detection in DNA and RNA via realignment with ABRA2\n", "abstract": " Motivation           Genomic variant detection from next-generation sequencing has become established as an extremely important component of research and clinical diagnoses in both cancer and Mendelian disorders. Insertions and deletions (indels) are a common source of variation and can frequently impact functionality, thus making their detection vitally important. While substantial effort has gone into detecting indels from DNA, there is still opportunity for improvement. Further, detection of indels from RNA-Seq data has largely been an afterthought and offers another critical area for variant detection.                             Results           We present here ABRA2, a redesign of the original ABRA implementation that offers support for realignment of both RNA and DNA short reads. The process results in improved accuracy and scalability including support for human whole genomes. Results demonstrate\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["18"]}

Many methods exist for assessing CNAs using microarrays, but considerable technical issues limit current CNA calling based upon DNA sequencing. We present SynthEx, a novel tool for detecting CNAs from whole exome and genome sequencing. SynthEx utilizes a \u0393\u00c7\u00a3synthetic-normal\u0393\u00c7\u00a5 strategy to overcome technical and financial issues. In terms of accuracy and precision, SynthEx is highly comparable to array-based methods and outperforms sequencing-based CNA detection tools.

{"title": "A P53-independent DNA damage response suppresses oncogenic proliferation and genome instability\n", "abstract": " The Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex is a DNA double-strand break sensor that mediates a tumor-suppressive DNA damage response (DDR) in cells undergoing oncogenic stress, yet the mechanisms underlying this effect are poorly understood. Using a genetically inducible primary mammary epithelial cell model, we demonstrate that Mre11 suppresses proliferation and DNA damage induced by diverse oncogenic drivers through a p53-independent mechanism. Breast tumorigenesis models engineered to express a hypomorphic Mre11 allele exhibit increased levels of oncogene-induced DNA damage, R-loop accumulation, and chromosomal instability with a characteristic copy number loss phenotype. Mre11 complex dysfunction is identified in a subset of human triple-negative breast cancers and is associated with increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging therapy and inhibitors of ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["18"]}
{"title": "Epstein-Barr virus-positive cancers show altered B-cell clonality\n", "abstract": " Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is convincingly associated with gastric cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and certain lymphomas, but its role in other cancer types remains controversial. To test the hypothesis that there are additional cancer types with high prevalence of EBV, we determined EBV viral expression in all the Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) samples (n = 10,396) from 32 different tumor types. We found that EBV was present in gastric adenocarcinoma and lymphoma, as expected, and was also present in >5% of samples in 10 additional tumor types. For most samples, EBV transcript levels were low, which suggests that EBV was likely present due to infected infiltrating B cells. In order to determine if there was a difference in the B-cell populations, we assembled B-cell receptors for each sample and found B-cell receptor abundance (P \u0393\u00eb\u00f1 1.4 \u251c\u00f9 10\u0393\u00ea\u00c620) and diversity (P \u0393\u00eb\u00f1 8\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["18"]}
{"title": "Virus expression detection reveals RNA-sequencing contamination in TCGA\n", "abstract": " Contamination of reagents and cross contamination across samples is a long-recognized issue in molecular biology laboratories. While often innocuous, contamination can lead to inaccurate results. Cantalupo et al., for example, found HeLa-derived human papillomavirus 18 (H-HPV18) in several of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNA-sequencing samples. This work motivated us to assess a greater number of samples and determine the origin of possible contaminations using viral sequences. To detect viruses with high specificity, we developed the publicly available workflow, VirDetect, that detects virus and laboratory vector sequences in RNA-seq samples. We applied VirDetect to 9143 RNA-seq samples sequenced at one TCGA sequencing center (28/33 cancer types) over 5\u0393\u00c7\u00ebyears. We confirmed that H-HPV18 was present in many samples and determined that viral transcripts from H-HPV18 significantly co-occurred with those from xenotropic mouse leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV). Using laboratory metadata and viral transcription, we determined that the likely contaminant was a pool of cell lines known as the \u0393\u00c7\u00a3common reference\u0393\u00c7\u00a5, which was sequenced alongside TCGA RNA-seq samples as a control to monitor quality across technology transitions (i.e. microarray to GAII to HiSeq), and to link RNA-seq to previous generation microarrays that standardly used the \u0393\u00c7\u00a3common reference\u0393\u00c7\u00a5. One of the cell lines in the pool was a laboratory isolate of MCF-7, which we discovered was infected with XMRV; another constituent of the pool was likely HeLa cells.

{"title": "Pan-cancer analysis of whole genomes.\n", "abstract": " Cancer is driven by genetic change, and the advent of massively parallel sequencing has enabled systematic documentation of this variation at the whole-genome scale1-3. Here we report the integrative analysis of 2,658 whole-cancer genomes and their matching normal tissues across 38 tumour types from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We describe the generation of the PCAWG resource, facilitated by international data sharing using compute clouds. On average, cancer genomes contained 4-5 driver mutations when combining coding and non-coding genomic elements; however, in around 5% of cases no drivers were identified, suggesting that cancer driver discovery is not yet complete. Chromothripsis, in which many clustered structural variants arise in a single catastrophic event, is frequently an early event in tumour evolution; in acral melanoma, for example, these events precede most somatic point mutations and affect several cancer-associated genes simultaneously. Cancers with abnormal telomere maintenance often originate from tissues with low replicative activity and show several mechanisms of preventing telomere attrition to critical levels. Common and rare germline variants affect patterns of somatic mutation, including point mutations, structural variants and somatic retrotransposition. A collection of papers from the PCAWG Consortium describes non-coding mutations that drive cancer beyond those in the TERT promoter4; identifies new signatures of mutational processes that cause base\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["18"]}

A number of methods have recently been developed that improve indel detection in DNA by utilizing realignment and/or localized assembly to aid in discovering mutations that are more difficult to detect than single nucleotide polymorphisms. While significant effort has been put into these methods in the context of DNA discovery, RNA-Seq has not received the same attention. For example, the widely used Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) recommends removal of splice junctions from all reads prior to proceeding with variant calling methods that are very similar to those used for DNA. We hypothesize that utilizing splice junctions to augment localized assembly across exon-exon boundaries can improve read alignments resulting in improved variant detection in RNA-Seq data.We have\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["18"]}
