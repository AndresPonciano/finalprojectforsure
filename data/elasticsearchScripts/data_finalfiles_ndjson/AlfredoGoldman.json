{"title": "Fostering effective inter-team knowledge sharing in agile software development\n", "abstract": " Agile methods have different practices that ultimately foster intra-team knowledge sharing (KS). However, they do not provide recommendations about coping with inter-team KS. Supporting inter-team KS is fundamental in scaling agility across the entire organization, and is regarded as the new horizon for agile software development. This study seeks to understand inter-team knowledge sharing effectiveness in agile software development organizations. Using grounded theory, we analyzed data from four Brazilian organizations and also from an expert in agile methods implementation. We observed that the companies employ different work practices that allow knowledge sharing to occur across team boundaries. Our main contribution is a conceptual model that explains how effective knowledge sharing across agile teams depends on applying purposeful practices, along with organizational conditions and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "88\n", "authors": ["1315"]}

Methods Eleven participants performed the following tests: 1) a maximal cycling incremental test to measure the ventilatory threshold and maximal oxygen uptake (V\u02d9O2max); 2) a cycling workload constant test at moderate domain (90% ventilatory threshold); 3) a cycling workload constant test at severe domain (110% V\u02d9O2max). Oxygen uptake and plasma lactate were measured during the tests. The contributions of the aerobic (AMET), anaerobic lactic (LAMET), and anaerobic alactic (ALMET) systems were calculated based on the oxygen uptake during exercise, the oxygen energy equivalents provided by lactate accumulation, and the fast component of excess post-exercise oxygen consumption, respectively. In order to assess the intra-investigator variation, four different investigators performed the analyses independently using GEDAE-LaB. A direct comparison with commercial software was also provided.   Results All subjects completed 10 min of exercise at moderate domain, while the time to exhaustion at severe domain was 144 \u00b1 65 s.

Indeed, while considering the business process implemented by service compositions, we can distinguish between two classes: compositions that correspond to single business process and those implementing multiple communicating processes. While most of the prior work focuses only on the first case, it is the latter that interests us in this paper. This paper contributes to the service selection by proposing a new algorithm that, in polynomial time, generates a mixed linear integer program for optimizing service compositions based on the service response time and the energy consumption.

{"title": "Using evolving graphs to evaluate DTN routing protocols\n", "abstract": " One of the main challenges of Delay-Tolerant Networks (DTNs) is on how to define effective routing protocols. Contrarily to traditional networks, which use static routing protocols and guarantee end-to-end paths between nodes of the network, connectivity is intermittent in DTNs. A routing path between two nodes is dynamically built over the time, ie, a connection between two intermediate nodes of a routing path is not necessarily established beforehand. Hence, it may happen that at a given time or period there is no direct path between two given nodes, however further future temporary connections between some intermediary nodes may provide a path over time, also called journey, between those two nodes. Temporary connections between nodes, denoted contacts, is thus strongly exploited by DTN routing protocols for message delivery.A DTN routing protocol must carefully select journeys between nodes for performance\u2019s sake. Usually routing takes place using a store and forward mechanism and depends on several parameters such as time of request, availability of connectivity, message size, network traffic, transmission delay, etc. Moreover, different metrics can be exploited for supporting routing decisions like the number of hops between the given nodes, the arrival time of the sent messages at the destination, or even the end-to-end delay to transmit a message between two nodes. Therefore, the aim of a routing protocol is to minimize the chosen metric.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["1315"]}

The current VM assumes a flat memory space, thus not performing as well as it could on these architectures. The NUMA environment presents challenges to the runtime environment in fields varying from memory management to scheduling and load-balancing.

The management of an Informative Workspace (IW) is a challenging task as it can involve many different subjects such as team adaptability, continuous reflection, workspace layout, human cognition, usability, etc. Our paper explores the IW management and it is divided in two phases. The first phase describes a data collection performed on 8 agile teams in order to identify valuable aspects on managing an IW based on their experiences. We proposed a series of suggestions to the teams in order to improve their current context using their IW and we gathered the feedbacks. This process leds to a set of seven heuristics for managing an IW. On the second phase, in order to reinforce the heuristics validity, a five point Likert scale survey was applied resulting mostly in positive evaluations.

Such systems can benefit from a previously proposed routing algorithm based on linear programming that minimizes the average message delay. This algorithm, however, is known to have performance issues that limit its applicability to very simple scenarios.

The results provide practical insight to various design trade-off and performance requirements for the optical components selected to meet the systems specifications. It is found that, under certain conditions, the relaxation induced noise (RIN) in the laser could be more detrimental than the thermal and shot-noise terms.

In particular, we consider an architecture for a massively parallel system where processors arc connected solely by buses. These architectures can use the power of bus technologies, providing a way to interconnect much more processors in a simple and efficient manner. In this paper we model the so-called bus interconnection networks (BINs) by a hypergraph. We consider the gossip operation in the various proposed architectures. We focus on the hyperpath, the d-dimensional hypergrid, the hyperring, and the d -dimensional hypertorus architectures and we give corresponding algorithms for the gossiping operation.

{"title": "Communications satellites versus fiber optics\n", "abstract": " For service within the Continental United States, a competitive comparison between commercial communications fixed satellite trunking service and terrestrial fiber optics transmission media is made. The focus of this paper is on a comparison of individual voice circuit costs versus distance. These individual circuits are derived from either fixed satellite trunking or from fiber optic bulk capacity. The costs of satellite transmission are less sensitive to distance than are the costs of fiber transmission. However, as time passes, the cost break-even distance between satellite and fiber transmission is increasing; it will reach transcontinental distances by the late 1980's. Thus, satellite trunking is becoming less cost-competitive between any two points which also are served by fiber optics. This has serious implications for the long-term economic viability of trunking networks that rely primarily on satellite transmission.However\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1315"]}

This study aims at conducting group development psychology training with student teams, participating in a project course at university, and compare their group effectiveness score to their agility usage over time in a longitudinal design. Seven XP student teams were measured twice (43+40), which means 83 data points divided into two groups (an experimental group and one control group). The results showed that the agility measurement was not possible to increase by giving a 1.5-hour of group psychology lecture and discussion over a two-month period. The non-significant result was probably due to the fact that 1.5 hours of training were not enough to change the work methods of these student teams, or, a causal relationship does not exist between the two concepts. A third option could be that the experiential setting of real teams, even at a university, has many more variables not taken into account in this experiment that affect the two concepts. We therefore have no conclusions to draw based on the expected effects. However, we believe these concepts have to be connected since agile software development is based on teamwork to a large extent, but there are probably many more confounding or mediating factors.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1315"]}

{"title": "Towards automatic actor pinning on multi-core architectures\n", "abstract": " The actor model is a high-level programming abstraction that attempts to ease the development of parallel applications, among others, by shielding the developer from the underlying platform. In this model the execution relies on a runtime environment (RE) to be able to efficiently use the underlying machine. Modern processors possess a hierarchical architecture of memory, thus making the performance of an application dependent on the placement of the application threads. This makes the choices of the RE much more important since the chosen actor placement will have a considerable impact on the application performance. In this paper we describe a work in progress that aims to create an on-line automatic actor placement engine. Using application profiling in association with hardware counters, it will pin and migrate actors to processing units aiming to optimize performance.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1315"]}

Parameter sweep and master-worker applications are suitable for these environments since a failure of a process does not necessarily suspend the overall application. On the other hand, in tightly-coupled parallel applications a failure in a machine may interrupt or crash the entire application. Thus, different application classes require different scheduling strategies. Furthermore, in the context of Computational Grids, each Grid domain has its own administrative policies, user and application profiles and resource properties. All these reasons have motivated us to propose a flexible and extensible architecture for scheduling parallel applications which relies on different services designed as plug-ins.

{"title": "Sensing Trees in Smart Cities with Open-Design Hardware\n", "abstract": " Tree fall is a major issue in large cities as it may obstruct roads and lead to traffic jams, and even injure people. Following these kind of incidents, monitoring the environment through sensors and Internet of Things technologies emerges as an important preventive approach. Another point is that the net primary productivity has a sensitive relation with trees characteristics including plant respiration and net photosynthesis which are highly sensitive to temperature. The health of the tree can then be monitored through leaf transpiration, sap flow measurement, environment evaluation as these methods offer indicators on any chance of a fall. The solution proposed in this paper includes an open-design hardware setup for monitoring trees in Smart Cities with Internet of Things. The setup is connected to a Smart City platform aiming to facilitate the use by other researchers and botanics, specially. Therefore, we noticed that\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1315"]}
{"title": "Using petri-net modelling to support the case for hw-assisted task scheduling\n", "abstract": " Given the pervasiveness of multi-core processors in systems from various domains, the need for efficient parallelization tools has only increased during the last decade. Among the paradigms built to answer this demand, Task Parallelism stands out as a highly productive tool for leveraging data parallelism with minimum code altering. Nonetheless, its current supporting runtimes cannot efficiently execute workloads involving tasks in the fine 1-100us range, limiting its applicability. That said, by performing a thorough Petri-Net-based analysis of task parallel systems with several degrees of HW-assistance, we show that the development of Native CPU support for Task Parallelism is the key for efficiently serving these challenging workloads.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1315"]}
{"title": "Is intel high performance analytics toolkit a good alternative to apache spark?\n", "abstract": " This paper compares the performance and stability of two Big Data processing tools: the Apache Spark and the High Performance Analytics Toolkit (HPAT). The comparison was performed using two applications: a unidimensional vector sum and the K-means clustering algorithm. The experiments were performed in distributed and shared memory environments with different numbers and configurations of virtual machines. By analyzing the results we are able to conclude that HPAT has performance improvements in relation to Apache Spark in our case studies. We independently validated the results and potential presented by the HPAT developers. We also provide an analysis of both frameworks in the presence of failures.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1315"]}
{"title": "Scalable algorithm for the service selection problem.\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we are interested in fast algorithms for the service selection problem. Given an abstract services' composition, the objective in this problem is to choose the best services for implementing the composition such as to minimize a given penalty function.Our work contributes to both the sequential and parallel resolution of this problem. For the sequential resolution, we show how to extend a prior algorithm for QoS prediction to obtain a fast sequential resolution of the service selection problem. Our proposal innovates in the optimization techniques (variable ordering, branch and bound, etc.) used for the runtime minimization. For the parallel resolution, we discuss on two possible formulations for the parallelism: task and data parallelism. We show that on our problem, the latter formulation is adequate because it leads to a more scalable resolution. Finally, we conduct various experiments that show that super-linear speedups can be reached with our new parallel algorithm.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1315"]}
{"title": "Backtracking algorithms for service selection\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we explore the automation of services' compositions. We focus on the service selection problem. In the formulation that we consider, the problem's inputs are constituted by a behavioral composition whose abstract services must be bound to concrete ones. The objective is to find the binding that optimizes the {\\it utility} of the composition under some services level agreements. We propose a complete solution. Firstly, we show that the service selection problem can be mapped onto a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). The benefit of this mapping is that the large know-how in the resolution of the CSP can be used for the service selection problem. Among the existing techniques for solving CSP, we consider the backtracking. Our second contribution is to propose various backtracking-based algorithms for the service selection problem. The proposed variants are inspired by existing heuristics for the CSP. We analyze the runtime gain of our framework over an intuitive resolution based on exhaustive search. Our last contribution is an experimental evaluation in which we demonstrate that there is an effective gain in using backtracking instead of some comparable approaches. The experiments also show that our proposal can be used for finding in real time, optimal solutions on small and medium services' compositions.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1315"]}

{"title": "Combining parallel algorithms solving the same application: What is the best approach?\n", "abstract": " Given a hard computational problem and a pool of heuristics solving it, it is usual to have a subset of problem instances on which no heuristic outperforms all the others when measuring their runtimes on instances. This phenomenon motivated several studies whose goal was to design frameworks, that can automatically synthesize a set of heuristics solving the same problem for generating a superior one. The success of these investigations however introduced another combinatorial problem; indeed, given a basis of parallel heuristics, there are nowadays several frameworks that can be used for a synthesis: how to choose among them? This paper proposes a solution to this question considering three frameworks for heuristics synthesis, based on algorithm portfolio scheduling in parallel and homogeneous context.

{"title": "Optimizing resource sharing on cooperative execution of algorithms\n", "abstract": " Solving hard combinatorial problems has always been a challenge. The constant progress in algorithm design and the emergence of powerful large-scale parallel platforms allow to solve a larger number of instances of such problems. As a consequence, many efficient algorithms are available for solving the same problem. However, none of them strictly dominates the others on all the instances. An important problem is to determine an adequate selection of algorithms for solving a given set of instances in order to minimize the total completion time. However, little is known in cooperation between algorithms for an improved global objective. The execution model of algorithms portfolio is a nice framework for studying this question. It consists in executing all the available algorithms concurrently and interrupt them as soon as a solution is found. This model of execution raises however the question of the resources repartition among the algorithms. Interesting directions in this way have been proposed through parallel algorithms portfolio problem. The idea is that it is possible to learn about the resource sharing based on the observation of executions of the algorithms on a set of instances. Parallel algorithms portfolio problems are generally intractable and thus, many heuristics have been proposed to solve them. However, these solutions do not take into account the possibility of sequential algorithms or unknown speed-ups. We propose in this paper a two phases approach for learning resource sharing in the context of a portfolio. The first phase consists in estimating what may be the optimal useful execution workload for each algorithm. This\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1315"]}

Since interprocessor communication frequently constitutes serious bottlenecks, several architectures were proposed that enhance point-to-point topologies with the help of multiple bus systems so as to improve the communication efficiency. In this paper we study parallel architectures where the communication means are constituted solely by buses. These architectures can use the power of bus technologies, providing a way to interconnect much more processors in a simple and efficient manner.

It is shown that reception at UHF (410-890 MC) frequencies is technically feasible and economically attractive. The TV broadcast system is described using the classical communications equation. The satellite effective radiated power is varied from 40-80 dhw. The area covered at the subsatellite point is varied from 0.5-10.0 million square statute miles thus constraining the transmitting antenna heamwidth and gain. The signal-to-noise ratio at the ground receiver is varied from 21.0-44.5 dh. The required performance of the ground receiver and its antenna is defined by the parameter, Gr/kTB. Data from the Jansky and Bailey study has been used to demonstrate that receiving antenna gains of 20 dh are economically practical.
