{"title": "Review of Machine Learning techniques for glaucoma detection and prediction\n", "abstract": " Glaucoma is a silent thief of sight. Detecting glaucoma at early stages is almost impossible and presently there is no cure of glaucoma at later stages. Different automated glaucoma detection systems were thoroughly analyzed in this study. A detailed literature survey of preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection, Machine Learning (ML) techniques and data sets used for testing and training purpose was conducted. Automated prediction of glaucoma is very important and unfortunately a little work has been done in this regard and minimum accuracy has been achieved. However automated detection of glaucoma at latter stage is at a mature level and most of the ML techniques are able to detect 85% of glaucoma cases accurately. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) can be used effectively for prediction of glaucoma.", "num_citations": "37\n", "authors": ["1553"]}
{"title": "Fully automated robust system to detect retinal edema, central serous chorioretinopathy, and age related macular degeneration from optical coherence tomography images\n", "abstract": " Maculopathy is the excessive damage to macula that leads to blindness. It mostly occurs due to retinal edema (RE), central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR), or age related macular degeneration (ARMD). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging is the latest eye testing technique that can detect these syndromes in early stages. Many researchers have used OCT images to detect retinal abnormalities. However, to the best of our knowledge, no research that presents a fully automated system to detect all of these macular syndromes is reported. This paper presents the world\u2019s first ever decision support system to automatically detect RE, CSCR, and ARMD retinal pathologies and healthy retina from OCT images. The automated disease diagnosis in our proposed system is based on multilayered support vector machines (SVM) classifier trained on 40 labeled OCT scans (10 healthy, 10 RE, 10 CSCR, and 10 ARMD). After training, SVM forms an accurate decision about the type of retinal pathology using 9 extracted features. We have tested our proposed system on 2819 OCT scans (1437 healthy, 640 RE, and 742 CSCR) of 502 patients from two different datasets and our proposed system correctly diagnosed 2817/2819 subjects with the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity ratings of 99.92%, 100%, and 99.86%, respectively.", "num_citations": "36\n", "authors": ["1553"]}

We have also found the use of Fuzzy Logic and Likert Scale effective for handling of discretely measurable as well as scalable NFRs as these techniques can provide a simple way to arrive at a discrete or scalable NFR in contrast to vague, ambiguous, imprecise, noisy or missing NFR.

{"title": "Architecture for Resource Allocation in the Internet of Vehicles for Cooperating Driving System\n", "abstract": " Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is a complex system that consists of resource types such as vehicles, humans, and sensors. Although the Internet of Vehicles is complex, it improvises communication among vehicles on the roads. Quality of service (QoS) enabled the cooperative driving system (CDS) based on 5G technology, enabling vehicles to communicate and cooperate to improve road traffic efficiency. Due to the high vehicle density and limited resources (bandwidth) of current network infrastructure, sometimes a better channel that meets the requirements of cooperative driving is not available that causes network congestion, which directly influences the overall QoS of the CDS. To overcome this, we proposed a 5G network-based architecture for CDS that incorporates a D2D technology-based resource allocation scheme. The proposed network architecture and cooperative behavior-based scheme helps in improving QoS for CDS. We implemented our proposed scheme by incorporating the density-based scattered clustering algorithm with noise for vehicular clustering.
