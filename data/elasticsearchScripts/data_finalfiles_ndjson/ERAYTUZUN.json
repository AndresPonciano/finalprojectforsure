{"title": "Sequence and comparative analysis of the chicken genome provide unique perspectives on vertebrate evolution\n", "abstract": " We present here a draft genome sequence of the red jungle fowl, Gallus gallus. Because the chicken is a modern descendant of the dinosaurs and the first non-mammalian amniote to have its genome sequenced, the draft sequence of its genome--composed of approximately one billion base pairs of sequence and an estimated 20,000-23,000 genes--provides a new perspective on vertebrate genome evolution, while also improving the annotation of mammalian genomes. For example, the evolutionary distance between chicken and human provides high specificity in detecting functional elements, both non-coding and coding. Notably, many conserved non-coding sequences are far from genes and cannot be assigned to defined functional classes. In coding regions the evolutionary dynamics of protein domains and orthologous groups illustrate processes that distinguish the lineages leading to birds and mammals. The distinctive properties of avian microchromosomes, together with the inferred patterns of conserved synteny, provide additional insights into vertebrate chromosome architecture.", "num_citations": "2507\n", "authors": ["158"]}
{"title": "Initial sequence of the chimpanzee genome and comparison with the human genome\n", "abstract": " Here we present a draft genome sequence of the common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). Through comparison with the human genome, we have generated a largely complete catalogue of the genetic differences that have accumulated since the human and chimpanzee species diverged from our common ancestor, constituting approximately thirty-five million single-nucleotide changes, five million insertion/deletion events, and various chromosomal rearrangements. We use this catalogue to explore the magnitude and regional variation of mutational forces shaping these two genomes, and the strength of positive and negative selection acting on their genes. In particular, we find that the patterns of evolution in human and chimpanzee protein-coding genes are highly correlated and dominated by the fixation of neutral and slightly deleterious alleles. We also use the chimpanzee genome as an outgroup to investigate human population genetics and identify signatures of selective sweeps in recent human evolution.", "num_citations": "2063\n", "authors": ["158"]}

We present a detailed sequence and population genetic analysis of a 29.5-kb common human deletion polymorphism that removes the APOBEC3B gene. We developed a PCR-based genotyping assay, characterized 1,277 human diversity samples, and found that the frequency of the deletion allele varies significantly among major continental groups (global FST = 0.2843). The deletion is rare in Africans and Europeans (frequency of 0.9% and 6%), more common in East Asians and Amerindians (36.9% and 57.7%), and almost fixed in Oceanic populations (92.9%). Despite a worldwide frequency of 22.5%, analysis of data from the International HapMap Project reveals that no single existing tag single nucleotide polymorphism may serve as a surrogate for the deletion variant, emphasizing that without careful analysis its phenotypic impact may be overlooked in association studies. Application of haplotype-based tests for selection revealed potential pitfalls in the direct application of existing methods to the analysis of genomic structural variation.

{"title": "Multidimensional classification approach for defining product line engineering transition strategies\n", "abstract": " It is generally acknowledged that the transitioning process to a product line engineering approach is not trivial and as such requires a planned transition process. Different classifications of transition strategies have been proposed in the literature. It appears that these classification schemes are usually based on a single dimension. However, the adoption of a transition strategy is dependent on various criteria and very often it is not easy to characterize the required transition strategy. An appropriate characterization of the transition strategy is important for carrying out the right transition activities and steps to provide an operational product line engineering approach. In this paper, we first provide a conceptual model for defining the concepts related to transition strategies and then propose a multi-dimensional classification approach that aims to provide a more complete view on transition strategies.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["158"]}

One of the initial and important steps of code review process is selecting code reviewer(s) for a given code change.

Code reviewer recommendation has been an active research area over the last few years, and many recommendation models have been proposed in the literature.In this study, we conduct a systematic literature review by inspecting 29 primary studies published from 2009 to 2020.

Ideally, in a bug tracking system, bugs are reported, fixed, verified, and closed. In some cases, bugs have to be reopened mostly due to an incorrect fix. However, instead of reopening the existing bug report, users may submit a new report on a previously reported bug, which causes duplicate bug reports. Additionally, users might report duplicate bugs if they are unable to reopen the previously reported bugs due to the bug being unresolved (i.e., in progress) and when they miss previously reported bug reports. These duplicate bug reports may cost extra maintenance efforts in triaging and fixing bugs.There have been several studies on characterizing reopened bugs and duplicate bug reports, however, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no prior work on understanding the dynamics of their intersection, which is missed reopen bugs\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["158"]}

The application is built as a serious game to reinforce the learning experience of its users by immersing them in its story and theme, helping them learn while having fun. The effectiveness of the game components are measured with a case study of 132 students of 2 software engineering courses. The promising result of this case study suggests CRSG can indeed be used effectively to teach code review.

Due to various reasons, some developers take more responsibility, and this type of developers are more valuable and indispensable for the project. Without them, the success of the project would be at risk. We use the term key developers for these essential and valuable developers, and identifying them is a crucial task for managerial decisions such as risk assessment for potential developer resignations. We study key developers under three categories: jacks, mavens and connectors. A typical jack (of all trades) has a broad knowledge of the project, they are familiar with different parts of the source code, whereas mavens represent the developers who are the sole experts in specific parts of the projects. Connectors are the developers who involve different groups of developers or teams. They are like bridges between teams.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["158"]}
