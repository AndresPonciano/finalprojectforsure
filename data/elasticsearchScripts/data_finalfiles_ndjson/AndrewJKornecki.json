{"title": "Studying interrelationships of safety and security for software assurance in cyber-physical systems: Approach based on bayesian belief networks\n", "abstract": " The paper discusses mutual relationships of safety and security properties in cyber-physical systems (CPS). Generally, safety impacts the system's environment while environment impacts security of a CPS. Very frequently, safety and security of a CPS interact with each other either synergistically or conflictingly. Therefore, a combined evaluation of safety and security that considers their interrelationships is required for proper assessment of a CPS. Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN) can be used for this evaluation where factors related to safety and security of a CPS are assumed to be randomly distributed. The result of this evaluation is an assessment that is non-deterministic in nature but gives a very good approximation of the actual extent of safety and security in a CPS. Using a case study of a SCADA system in an oil pipeline control, the authors present a BBN approach for assessing mutual impacts of security and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "52\n", "authors": ["1483"]}

Supporting NextGen is a nation-wide Aviation Simulation Network (ASN), which allows integration of a variety of real-time simulations to facilitate development and validation of the NextGen software by simulating a wide range of operational scenarios. The ASN system is an environment, including both simulated and human-in-the-loop real-life components (pilots and air traffic controllers). Real Time Distributed Simulation (RTDS) developed at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University, a suite of applications providing low and medium fidelity en-route simulation capabilities, is one of the simulations contributing to the ASN. To support the interconnectivity with the ASN, we designed and implemented a dedicated gateway acting as an intermediary, providing logic for two-way communication and transfer messages between RTDS and ASN and storage for the exchanged data. It has been necessary to develop and analyze safety/security requirements for the gateway software based on analysis of system assets, hazards, threats and attacks related to ultimate real-life future implementation. Due to the nature of the system, the focus was placed on communication security and the related safety of the impacted aircraft in the simulation scenario. To support development of safety/security requirements, a well-established fault tree analysis technique was used. This fault tree model-based analysis, supported by a commercial tool, was a foundation to propose mitigations assuring the gateway system safety and security.

This model is validated against other approaches to modeling resilience described in the literature, followed by a discussion of the resilience metrics. The paper concludes with presenting the strategy of modeling resiliency, based on the assumption that one cannot guarantee absolute protection against attacks, or failures, but can aim at providing successful recovery after disruptions. With safety and security as essential resiliency components, an extended model is proposed involving an attacker, suggesting appropriate performance metric reflecting the distance between the normal state and the degraded state.

In addition to a well established real time applications in military, aerospace, aviation, and medical systems, nowadays the consumer electronics is an area that uses more and more systems with real-time features. For all these systems time criticality and determinism are important, but often safety and reliability are of an equal importance. The software development of such systems requires skills and knowledge exceeding the standards offered by colleges and universities in most computer science and engineering programs.

{"title": "Software Safety in Aviation\n", "abstract": " Safety and security are important issues for modern systems that interact with and often control the environment. Therefore both safety and security must be considered for the system operations in normal as well as in abnormal conditions. Traditionally in aviation, only safety was considered a central factor and approaches were developed to take a broader view of potential accident causes than just component failures. The emphasis is on building in safety rather than adding safety considerations to a completed design. Safety is usually defined as a'negative'property that asserts simply that nothing bad happens to the system or its environment. This is an extension of a concept introduced originally by Leslie Lamport in 1977 to study program correctness [1].Safety is a critical factor for aviation. Progress of technology, particularly in electronics and computing domains, changed the aviation industry. It is a popular saying in the community that modern aircraft is just \u201ca computer with wings\u201d. An aircraft is a large system composed of multiple sub-systems. Typical software-intensive systems in modern aircraft include flight control with autopilot, displays, navigation, communication, engine control, ground steering, thrust reversers, air data, landing gear, collision avoidance, environmental control, electrical power, in-flight entertainment, and more. Evidently, different systems may have different impact on overall aircraft safety.

However, these networks are highly susceptible to attacks, due to both the open and distributed nature of the network, as well as the limited resources of the nodes, which dictate the implementation of sophisticated security frameworks. Trust-aware routing is an important direction in designing secure routing protocols for WSN. The common approach to provide trust-aware routing is to implement an efficient mechanism to evaluate the trustworthiness of neighboring nodes, based on a proper set of trust metrics. In this paper, we discuss several challenges addressed during the implementation of a trust-aware management scheme on commercial sensor nodes, as well as problems faced during the deployment of the test-bed network. As it will be discussed, the limited memory\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1483"]}

{"title": "Operational knowledge acquisition problems for air traffic expert controller\n", "abstract": " Air Traffic Control System (ATC) is a service of the Federal Aviation Administration to accomplish a safe and expeditious flow of the air traffic in the National Airspace System. To assist in AT controller training and to improve the future ATCS operation there is a need to design a computer program that would imitate the decision process of an experienced controller. Such a program, given a set of data describing a current traffic situation, would first analyze, recognize, and process the data to generate a set of facts constituting the bases for the controller's action. Then, using an available ATC operational knowledge base, the program would generate an appropriate controller action. We can differentiate two types of actions. The first type of actions reflect the final controller decision. The second type are actions initializing a request to acquire more data to solve the problem.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1483"]}
{"title": "Building of an air traffic control expert system\n", "abstract": " The Federal Aviation Administration supervising all activities related to the National Airspace System. The role of the Air Traffic Control (ATC) subsystem is to accomplish safe and expeditious flow of the air traffic. order to facilitate ATC training, analyze control strategies, and improve the system performance there is an evident need to design computer program capable of modeling actions of expert ATC controller. There are two basic components of such program. The first one is responsible for real-time data acquisition and recognition of the current air traffic situation which results in creation of some ATC situation facts; the second component is a decision makercontroller action facts are generated based the situation facts and expert rules. negotiation, optimization, search. The algorithms are supported by fast simulation to detect the future conflicts. Examples of applying these techniques to conflict resolution, planning, and operating within real-time constraints may be found elsewhere (1, 2, 3). Volckers presents rule based system for handling aircraft arrivals (16]. The drawback of DPS is its algorithmic structure requiring all precise and mostly numerical data. The human controllers base their decisions on traffic situation in their sector concentrating qualitative description of relations between the aircraft under control. Such decisions are often based on intuition. Therefore an acceptance level of complex, strictly number-crunching algorithms by the controllers is very low. on on", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1483"]}
{"title": "Avionics databus safety criteria and certification\n", "abstract": " The paper considers databuses used in avionics and automotive applications (ARINC 629, ARINC 429, FlexRay, CAN, TTP, SAFEbus, SpaceWire, FireWire and others) and identifies the criteria to evaluate them with respect to safety. The criteria address comprehensive aspects of databus assessment problem, combining mechanical (bus wiring, connectors, pinout, module design and dimensions, etc.), electrical (signal levels, their dynamics to carry information, electromagnetic compatibility, etc.), and logical characteristics, including the protocol of exchanging information between devices over a bus, in all three phases: bus arbitration, data transfer and fault handling. A systematic list of safety-related attributes and their relationships for evaluation of aviation databuses is presented, which would allow building the uniform evaluation criteria for certification purposes. Preliminary simulations and real experiments are aimed at protocol comparison, according to the methodology previously developed by the authors. The study is intended to allow establishing standard and objective criteria for evaluating databus technologies in safety-critical applications.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1483"]}
