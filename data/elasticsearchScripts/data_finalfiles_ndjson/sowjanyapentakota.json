{"title": "Computer aided software integrated automated safety system\n", "abstract": " Software for safety-critical systems must deal with the hazards identified by safety analysis in order to make the system safe. Building a safety-critical software requires special procedures to be used in all phases of the software development process. In this work, we have dealt with safety analysis techniques such as failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) and fault tree analysis (FTA)-based safety-critical approach towards to development of an integrated automotive safety critical system from a safety perspective. A proposal of software safety architecture and software safety lifecycle has developed here using some important safety techniques. A new software development lifecycle with an integration approach, i.e., Agile-V model is proposed. Driver assistance system like ACCS is a safety critical system which is helpful to prevent accidents by reducing the workload on the driver.
