{"title": "Automatic Ordering of Code Changes for Review\n", "abstract": " Code review has been proved to be an extremely important practice to ensure softwarequality. In recent years, the trend has moved towards modern code review, a lightweight and less strict paradigm. Despite its many advantages, this approach still has room for further improvement, especially in the area of cognitive support for reviewers. Previous research stated how ordering code changes based on their relations may constitute an effective way to support reviewers. Based on this premise, this work focuses on studying how this ordering theory may be applied in practice. As result, a tool that automatically orders the modifications in a commit has been created. Moreover, the tool has been tested and an initial investigation of the perceived usefulness of its relations has been conducted. Finally, it has been investigated if the ordering produced by the tool is identified as useful by the developers and which factors may influence this choice.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["974"]}
