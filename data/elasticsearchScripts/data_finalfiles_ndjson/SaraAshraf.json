{"title": "Beneficial effects of silicon in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under salinity stress\n", "abstract": " We evaluated growth performance of two wheat genotypes (Auqab-2000 & SARC-5) differing in salinity tolerance to applied silicon under saline conditions. Plants were grown in pots filled with normal (EC= 1.16 dSm-1) and saline soil (developed EC= 10 dSm-1). Silicon was applied@ 0, 50 and 130 \u00b5g Si/g soil using calcium silicate. Plants were harvested at maturity and different physical and chemical parameters were recorded. Salinity stress significantly (p< 0.01) reduced dry matter production and grain yield of both wheat genotypes; however reduction was lower in SARC-5 than in Auqab-2000. Silicon application in growth medium significantly (p< 0.01) improved dry matter and grain yield of both genotypes grown either in normal and/or in saline conditions. Potassium concentration was significantly increased in plants grown with Si in saline soil. Potassium concentration was lower in plants grown with salinity than those grown in normal soil only in\u2013Si plants. Sodium uptake was higher in plants grown under salinity, however Si application significantly reduced Na uptake, resulting in a significant increase in K: Na ratio in shoots. Sodium concentration in shoots had a significant negative correlation (r> 0.81, p< 0.01) with shoot dry matter in both genotypes, however, reduction in SDM was more in Auqab-2000. Percent increase in Na concentration due to salinity was significantly reduced in plants receiving Si in root environment. Shoot Si concentration significantly correlated with shoot K concentration (r= 0.83, p< 0.01) and negatively with shoot Na concentration (r= 0.57, p< 0.05).

{"title": "Carotenoids and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease\n", "abstract": " Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing health problem around the world, especially in developed countries. NAFLD includes all cases of fatty liver disease from simple steatosis to cirrhosis, without excessive alcohol intake, use of steatogenic medication or hereditary disorders. Pathogenesis is associated with dietary high fat intake, decreased free fatty acid (FFA) oxidation, increased hepatic lipogenesis and lipolysis from the adipose tissue. These metabolic alterations contribute to the hepatic fat accumulation. Consequently, stimulated oxidative stress and inflammation play a major role in hepatocellular damage. Therefore, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents may have a role in the prevention of this disease. Carotenoids are potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory micronutrients, which have been investigated in the prevention and treatment of NAFLD.

{"title": "Sagacious communication link selection mechanism for underwater wireless sensors network\n", "abstract": " In underwater environment, the sensor nodes are deployed for collecting information and sending back to the base station. Establishing astute communication link among these sensor nodes in a multi-link routing environment is a key challenge for all underwater routing protocols. A sagacious communication link can only guarantee the maximum data transfer rate. The link selection mechanism of three underwater routing protocol ie, Energy-aware Opportunistic Routing (EnOR) protocol, Shrewd Underwater Routing Synergy using Porous Energy Shell (SURS-PES) and Underwater Shrewd Packet Flooding Mechanism (USPF) have been investigated. After analyzing performance results of these protocols interms of packet delivery ratio, end-to-end\u200e delay, network lifespan and energy consumption\u200e using NS2 with AquaSim 2.0 simulator. The protocol existing, with sagacious link selection mechanism in multi-link routing environment has been identified. The identification of this sagacious link selection mechanism is a novel approach which can give specific knowledge for targeted output without wasting resources for irrelevant objectives.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["1390"]}
{"title": "Charged black string thin-shell wormholes in modified gravity\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we explore the possibility for the existence of thin-shell wormholes for the charged black string in the framework of f (R) gravity theory. We have carried out our analysis by keeping linear perturbations about static equilibrium solutions where we have surgically pasted the interior spacetime to an exterior vacuum geometry. We have assumed logarithmic as well as exponential form of well-known f (R) models and investigated their role in the modeling of stable/unstable thin-shell wormholes. As a specific case, we perform our analysis through distributions of mass, charge and equation of state parameter. We found that various static thin-shell wormhole backgrounds are possible for different parametric values of f (R) models. We also concluded that modified gravity induced by logarithmic and exponential f (R) models could likely to host wide range of wormholes.", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["1390"]}

We have investigated the stable/unstable regimes for couple of f(R) models using the potential approach formulated by Eiroa with radial perturbation. We have categorized our analysis for different values of charge as well as the parameters involved in the particular mode of f(R) gravity. We have found both stable and unstable regions using modified Chaplygin gas in this scenario and the results are shown through plots. We found that there exists a parametric space for equation of state and quadratic as well as cubic gravities in which one can accommodate more stable thin-shell WHs.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1390"]}
{"title": "Use of immunotherapy in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer\n", "abstract": " Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in the United States and around the world. Approximately 13% of lung cancers are small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is generally classified as a limited-stage and extensive-stage disease depending on the extent of involvement. For patients with the extensive-stage disease, until recently, chemotherapy alone has been the recommended treatment, although radiotherapy could be used in select patients for palliation of symptoms. The standard of care for extensive-stage SCLC is platinum doublet chemotherapy with either cisplatin or carboplatin in combination with etoposide. Even though first-line therapy has an initial response rate of 60\u201380%, the prognosis is poor, with overall survival of 10\u201312 months. The only FDA-approved second line of therapy is topotecan, approved both as an intravenous formulation as well as an oral formulation, with response rates of 6\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1390"]}
{"title": "Juvenile Parkinson Disease\n", "abstract": " Juvenile Parkinson\u2019s disease (JPD) is a rare movement disorder that presents before the age of 21 years. Kufor-Rekab syndrome (KRS) is one of the distinct types of JPD caused by the ATP13A2 mutation and inherited as an autosomal recessive. The pathogenesis of KRS is related to an interrelated metabolism of ATP13A2 with Mn+ 2 and Zn+ 2, bioenergetics of mitochondria, autophagy lysosomal dysfunction, and synuclein metabolism. Clinically, KRS has a variable phenotype and may present with pyramidal or extrapyramidal symptoms and cognitive impairment. Early diagnosis of KRS is important as most of these patients are levodopa-responsive and genetic counseling and screening is important for the whole family. We present a case of a 16-year-old boy who presented with tremors and walking difficulty.

{"title": "Thermodynamics of Modified Cosmic Chaplygin Gas\n", "abstract": " We examine the thermodynamic features of an exotic fluid known as modified cosmic Chaplygin gas in the context of homogeneous isotropic universe model. For this purpose, the behavior of physical parameters is discussed that help to analyze nature of the universe. Using specific heat formalism, the validity of third law of thermodynamics is checked. Furthermore, with the help of thermodynamic entities, the thermal equation of state is also discussed. The thermodynamic stability is explored by means of adiabatic, specific heat and isothermal conditions from classical thermodynamics. It is concluded that the considered fluid configuration is thermodynamically stable and expands adiabatically for an appropriate choice of parameters.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1390"]}
{"title": "Biological Aspects of Date Palm Dust Mite, Oligonychus afrasiaticus (McGregor)(Acari: Tetranychidae) on Fronds of Three Date Palm Cultivars\n", "abstract": " For several years the palm dust mite, Oligonychus afrasiaticus (McGregor) has been an economically important pest of date palm. Biology and life table parameters of the date dust mite, O. afrasiaticus were studied on fronds of three date palm cultivars: Bartamoda (dry), Sewi (semi dry) and Zaghlol (soft) at laboratory conditions of 30 and 35\u00b0C & 60 \u00b15% R.H. and 16L. The results revealed that, the longest and shortest oviposition period and total longevity of O. afrasiaticus females were recorded at 30\u00b0C (22.5 & 26.90 days) on Sewi and 35\u00b0C (6.9 & 10.0 days) on Zaghlol variety, respectively. The fecundity increased as temperature decreased from 30.5, 37.45 and 25.5 eggs at 30\u00b0C to 27.8, 29.15 and 15.94 eggs at 35\u00b0C on Bartamoda, Sewi and Zaghlol varieties, respectively. The lowest and highest values of the intrinsic rate of increase (rm) were 0.107 and 0.229 individuals/female/day that obtained at 30 and 35\u00b0C on Zaghlol and Sewi varieties, respectively. The mean generation time (T) significantly decreased from 23.6, 22.4 and 22.76 days to 13.08, 11.90 and 12.26 days with increasing temperature from 30\u00b0C to 35\u00b0C, on Bartamoda, Sewi and Zaghlol varieties, respectively. The results of this study indicate that O. afrasiaticus could increase rapidly when Sewi and Bartamoda fronds serve as a food source more than Zaghlol date palm variety.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1390"]}
{"title": "Recent Advances and Therapeutic Options in Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome\n", "abstract": " Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune-mediated neurological disorder that manifests as muscle fatigue, diminished tendon reflexes, with symptoms of cholinergic overactivity. It can be associated with certain neoplastic conditions, the most common being small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). The basic pathophysiology involved is antibody-mediated targeting of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC), which decreases the release of acetylcholine in the synaptic junction. Multiple treatment options have been introduced in the past and, recently, a new drug, amifampridine, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of weakness associated with these patients.

{"title": "Effect of antioxidant rich diets on lipid profile and blood pressure in cardiovascular patients\n", "abstract": " [en] A sample of 200 patients was randomly selected and interviewed. Various data related to their food consumption in previous weeks and other behavioral attitudes were recorded. Their blood pressure was measured and blood was analyzed for total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides (TG). Spearman's correlation coefficient was worked out between blood pressure, serum lipid parameters and tea, vitamin C and fibre intake. Tea showed significant correlation with diastolic blood pressure (DBP)(-0.2373; P< 0.02), systolic blood pressure (SBP)(-0.2299; P< 0.02) and TC (-0.3454; P< 0.01). Vitamin C showed a negatively significant correlation with TC (-0.4676; P< 0.01), and LDL-C (-2661; P< 0.01) and significant positive correlation with HDL-C (+ 0.2227; P< 0.05). The tea intake was found strongly correlated with blood pressure as compared to vitamin C, while vitamin C had stronger correlation with TC as compared to tea intake. Fibre was not found significantly correlated with any of the studied parameters. A 30-day control trial on 50 subjects revealed that antioxidant therapy during fat-restricted diet period significantly affected blood pressure and serum lipids. Comparative effect showed that lemon juice showed best results. Lemon juice decreased DBP, SBP, TC, TG and increased HDL-C, while tea added with lemon only significantly decreased DBP, SBP and TC. Salad, especially onion, only improved HDL-C and LDLC levels. Vitamin C supplement also significantly lowered DBP, SBP, TC, LDL-C and TG.
