The cyclic accumulation of permanent deformation (strain ratcheting) necessarily produces mesh dependence when the finite element size dictates the rate of crack growth.

In the lower-transition region, cleavage fracture often occurs under conditions of large-scale yielding but without prior ductile crack extension. The increased toughness develops when plastic zones formed at the crack tip interact with nearby specimen surfaces which relaxes crack-tip constraint (stress triaxiality). In the mid-to-upper transition region, small amounts of ductile crack extension (often < 1-2 mm) routinely precede termination of the J-fla curve by brittle fracture. Large-scale yielding, coupled with small amounts of ductile tearing, magnifies the impact of small variations in microscale material properties on the macroscopic fracture toughness which contributes to the large amount scatter observed in measured Jc-values.Previous work by the authors described a micromechanics fracture model to correct measured Jc-values for the mechanistic effects of large-scale yielding. This new work extends the model to also include the influence of ductile crack extension prior to cleavage. Ductile crack extensions of 10-15 x the crack-tip opening displacement at initiation are considered in plane-strain, finite element computations. The finite element results demonstrate a significant elevation in crack-tip constraint due to macroscopic \"sharpening\" of the extending tip relative to the blunt tip at initiation of growth.

The approximate stresses are used as input to estimate the effective driving force for cleavage fracture (Jo ) using the micromechanically based approached introduced by Dodds and Anderson. Finite element analyses for a wide variety of planar cracked geometries are conducted which have elastic biaxiality parameters (B) ranging from -0.99 (very low constraint) to +2.96 (very high constraint). The magnitude and sign of B indicate the rate at which crack-tip constraint changes with increasing applied load. All results pertain to a moderately strain hardening hardening material (strain hardening exponent(n) of 10). These analyses suggest that B is an effective indicator of both the accuracy of T-MBL estimates of Jo and of applicability limits on evolving fracture analysis methodologies (i.e. T-MBL, J-Q, and J/Jo ). Specifically, when lBl >0.4 these analyses show that the T -MBL approximation of Jo is accurate to within 20% of a detailed finite-element analysis. As \"structural type\" configurations, i.e. shallow cracks in tension, generally have lBl > 0.4, it appears that only an elastic analysis may be needed to determine reasonably accurate Jo values for structural conditions.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["886"]}

{"title": "The effect of weld metal strength mismatch on the deformation and fracture behavior of steel butt weldments\n", "abstract": " Considerable Naval and industrial experience dating from the explosion bulge studies of Pellini and Hartbower in the early 1950s has indicated the engineering utility of using weld metal having strength greater than the plates being joined (overmatching). This practice shields the weld region, which typically has lower toughness than the plate and is often the site of defects, from the high strains that develop during an overload. This practical advantage, coupled with the ease of achieving overmatch in lower strength steel alloys (80 ksi yield strength or less) has led to codification of overmatching as a requirement in most structural design codes and fabrication specifications. However, overmatching has certain economic and technical disadvantages which undermatched (weld metal strength less than plate strength) systems might alleviate. Examples of undermatch benefits discussed in the literature include reduction of the preheat needed to avoid hydrogen cracking and increase of weld metal deposition rate relative to overmatched practice. Such changes could reduce the need to hold electrodes at an elevated temperature prior to use, extend the welder's duty cycle, reduce the lack of fusion / lack of penetration defect rate, reduce restraint stresses, and increase weld metal toughness. This information suggests that overmatched welds, while quite effective for low strength steel construction, may not be as advantageous when fabricating structures from higher strength grades. However, undermatched welds cannot be immediately adopted for use due to the much greater strains that would have to be borne by the weld metal.

{"title": "Constraint and ductile tearing effects in statistical analyses of cleavage fracture\n", "abstract": " This study describes a computational framework to quantify the influence of constraint loss and ductile tearing on the cleavage fracture process, as reflected by the pronounced effects on macroscopic toughness (Jc,Oc). Our approach adopts the Weibull stress, Ow, as a suitable near-tip parameter to describe the coupling of remote loading with a micromechanics model incorporating the statistics of microcracks (weakest link philosophy). Unstable crack propagation (cleavage) occurs at a critical value of Ow which may be attained prior to, or following, some amount of stable, ductile crack extension. A central feature of our framework focuses on the realistic numerical modeling of ductile crack growth using the computational cell methodology to define the evolution of near-tip stress fields during crack extension. Under increased remote loading (J), development of the Weibull stress reflects the potentially strong variations of near-tip stress fields due to the interacting effects of constraint loss and ductile crack extension. Computational results are discussed for well-contained plasticity, where the near-tip fields for a stationary and a growing crack are generated with a modified boundary layer (l\\ffiL) formulation (in the form of different levels of applied T-stress).

{"title": "A Procedure for Drop-Tower Testing of Shallow-Cracked, Single-Edge Notched Bend Specimens\n", "abstract": " Unacceptably pessimistic predictions of structural reserve capacity often result from the use of conventional initiation fracture-toughness values (for example, J Ic, \u03b4 c) measured using deeply cracked bend specimens. Conversely, favorable comparison between predictions and structural fracture behavior have been reported when the predictions are based on toughness values measured in such a manner that the crack-tip constraint and the loading rate closely match those experienced in service. As a result, considerable attention has been paid recently to the elevated fracture initiation resistance of cracks shallower than the 0.45 to 0.75 crack length/width (a/W) used in standardized tests. However, standardized procedures for estimating the fracture initiation resistance of shallow cracks, particularly at the high loading rates characteristic of certain severe service conditions, have yet to be developed.

{"title": "Failure prediction of notched pressure vessels using the CTOD approach\n", "abstract": " Currently accepted analysis procedures to determine failure pressures of notched vessels are limited to the types of behavior defined by Linear Elastic Fracture mechanics (LEFM) or by various types of limit load calculations. LEFM is restricted to very brittle material behavior (linear elastic plane-strain behavior, K/sub Ic/, as defined by ASTM E-399). Limit load calculations generally are restricted to upper shelf, flow stress dependent material behavior. There is a wide range of material behavior between these two types of analysis where Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics (E-PFM) analysis should be used. This paper discusses the application of the Crack Tip Opening Displacement (CTOD) elastic-plastic fracture parameter to predict burst pressures. A series of burst tests performed on notched pressure vessels was analyzed. The tested vessels exhibited behavior ranging from very brittle to entirely ductile. The current British Welding Institute (Burdekin-Dawes design curve) approach as well as the finite element method was used to obtain the analytical burst pressures for each vessel. Nonlinear finite element computations were performed on both 2-D and 3-D models of the notched vessels.

Values of elastic-plastic fracture toughness, here characterized by the crack tip opening displacement (CTOD), are presented for square (cross-section) three-point bend specimens with a/W ratios of 0.15 and 0.50 throughout the lower-shelf and lower-transition regions. Three-dimensional, finite-element analyses are employed to correlate the measured load and crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) values to the corresponding CTOD values, thus eliminating a major source of experimental difficulty in previous studies of shallow crack specimens. In the lower-transition region, where extensive plasticity (but no ductile crack growth) precedes brittle fracture, critical CTOD values for short crack specimens are significantly larger (factor of 2-3) than the CTOD values for deep crack specimens at identical temperatures. Short crack specimens are shown to exhibit increased toughness at the initiation of ductile tearing and decreased brittle-to-ductile transition temperatures. Numerical analyses for the two a/W ratios reveal large differences in stress fields ahead of the crack tip at identical CTOD levels which verify the experimentally observed differences in critical CTOD values. Correlations of the predicted stresses with measured critical CTOD values demonstrate the limitations of single-parameter fracture mechanics (as currently developed) to characterize the response.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["886"]}

Unfortunately, the standard 8-node \"brick\" element with full integration exhibits strong shear-locking under bending deformations and thus overly stiff behavior. Three alternative elements are examined here: the 8-node element with single-point integration, the 8-node element with enhanced (incompatible) modes and the 20-node (quadratic) element. Element performance is assessed through analyses of a thin M(T) fracture specimen loaded in remote tension. This specimen generates strong compressive (T- )stresses parallel to the crack growth direction which leads to out-of-plane bending in the crack front region (triggered by a small normal force).

{"title": "Finite element modeling of strain localization induced by geometric irregularities\n", "abstract": " The concentration of deformation into zones of intense shearing, known as shear bands, is a common phenomenon in inelastic deformation. The modeling of this phenomenon by the finite element method is hampered by a number of factors; the lack of a priori knowledge of the location, direction, and onset of the localized zones, and the inability of conventional isoparametric elements to model the high strain gradients which occur in these zones. This study develops new techniques for the finite element modeling of strain localization. Special isoparametric elements with enhanced strain fields derived from incompatible modes are developed to model the high gradients which occur during strain localization. The incompatible modes are modified to insure that the derived element stiffness satisfies the patch test, thereby preserving the convergence properties of the parent element. Use of these elements in place of conventional isoparametric elements allows equivalent results to be obtained with much less computational effort. Additionally, simple criteria predict the onset, direction, and location of the strain localization, allowing the enhanced elements to be used only when and where they are needed, further reducing the computational effort. Numerical experiments elucidate the effectiveness of the new formulation.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["886"]}

This brief note provides further arguments in support of the modified Weibull stress methodology. This short presentation also shows that Lei\u2019s conclusions are not necessarily substantial as they follow from incorrect interpretation of the Weibull stress framework.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["886"]}
{"title": "Comparison of Flaw Driving Force Estimates in Simulated Weld Residual Stress Fields\n", "abstract": " Previous work has focused on the methods and results for calculating flaw driving force in simulated three-dimensional (3D) weld residual stress (WRS) fields using contour (J) integral techniques. This paper extends that work to look at explicit modeling of the crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) in these same WRS fields, and for the same range of semi-elliptical flaws. Comparison is made between the predicted trends of driving force with crack size for the calculated driving force (J-integral) versus the \u201cmeasured\u201d value (CTOD). Implications for fracture assessments are given, and recommendations for future work are made.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["886"]}

{"title": "Modeling of Three-Dimensional Effects on Fatigue Crack Closure Processes in Small-Scale Yielding\n", "abstract": " In ductile metals, plasticity-induced closure of fatigue cracks often retards significantly measured crack growth rates in the Paris regime and contributes strongly to the observed R-ratio effect in experimental data. This work describes a similarity scaling relationship based on the 3D small-scale yielding framework wherein the thickness, B, defines the only geometric length-scale of the model. Dimensional analysis suggests a scaling relationship for the crack opening loads relative to the maximum cyclic loads (Kop/Kmax) governed by the non-dimensional load parameter ) governed by the non-dimensional load parameter  = Kmax/\u03c30 \u221aB, i.e., a measure of the in-plane plastic zone size normalized by the thickness. Both Kop and Kmax refer to remotely applied values of the mode I stress-intensity factor. Large-scale, 3D finite element analyses described here demonstrate that Kop/Kmax values vary strongly across the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["886"]}

In the lower\u2014transition region, cleavage frac\u2014ture often occurs under conditions of large\u2014scale yielding but without prior ductile crack extension. The increased toughness develops when plastic zones formed at the crack tip in-teract with nearby specimen surfaces which relaxes crack\u2014tip constraint (stress triaxiality).

{"title": "Theoretical and software considerations for general dynamic analysis using multilevel substructured models\n", "abstract": " An approach is presented for the dynamic analysis of complex structure sy~t'=!!!S using the finite element method and multilevel substructured models. The fixedinterface method is selected for substructure reduction because of its efficiency, accurac and adaptability to restart and reanalysis. This method is extended to reduction of substructures which are themselves composed of reduced substructures. Emphasis is placed on the implementation and performance of the method in a general purpose software system. Solution algorithms consistent with the chosen data structures are presented in detail. This study demonstrates that successful finite element software requires the use of software executives to supplement the algorithmic language. As modeling and analysis techniques become more complex, proportionally more implementation effort is spent on data and computer resource management. Executive systems are essential tools for these tasks. The complexity of the implementation of restart and reanalysis porcedures also illustrate the need for executive systems to support the non computational aspects of the software. The example problems show that significant computational efficiencies can be achieved through proper use of substructuring and reduction techniques without sacrificing solution accuracy. The unique restart and reanalysis capabilities developed in this study and the flexible procedures for multilevel substructured modeling allow analysts to achieve economical yet accurate analyses of complex structural systems.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["886"]}
{"title": "Discussion of \u201cFracture Mechanics of Reinforced Concrete\u201d\n", "abstract": " The authors are congratulated for developing a very interesting and potentially useful model to represent cracking in reinforced concrete. However, the writers feel that certain issues raised by the authors in regard to cracking models based upon strength criteria merit discussion. Cracking models founded on a limiting stress criterion were never intended for applications in which the propagation of individual cracks dominate the behavior of a structure. These models were developed to predict the macroscopic behavior of reinforced concrete members, including general crack patterns and load-deflection curves. For such applications, the stress controlled models have proved satisfactory. The standard stress controlled model, implemented with either discrete or smeared cracking, adequately defines the formation of a crack by a simple tension failure.
