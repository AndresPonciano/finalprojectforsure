{"title": "Modal testing and analysis of structures under operational conditions: industrial applications\n", "abstract": " Experimental identification of structural dynamics models is usually based on the modal analysis approach. In the classical modal parameter estimation approach, the baseline data which are processed are frequency response functions measured under laboratory conditions. However, in many applications, the real operating conditions may differ significantly from those applied during the modal test. Hence, the need arises to identify a modal model in operational conditions. This issue is even more complicated by the fact that in most cases, only response data are measurable while the actual loading conditions are unknown. Therefore, the system identification process will need to base itself on output-only data. In the last decade, the problem of output-only modal analysis has typically been approached by applying a peak-picking technique to the auto- and cross-powers of the measured responses, resulting in\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "583\n", "authors": ["1032"]}

Further analysis and background information are available in the references. 10, 11 It was found that the identified common-denominator model closely fit the measured frequency response function (FRF) data. However, when converting this model to a modal model by reducing the residues to a rank-one matrix using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), the quality of the fit decreased. 9 Another feature of the common-denominator implementation is that the stabilization diagram can only be constructed using pole information (eigenfrequencies and damping ratios). Neither participation factors nor mode shapes are available initially. 12 The theoretically associated drawback is that closely spaced poles will erroneously show up as a single pole. These factors provided motivation for a polyreference version of the LSCF method, using a so-called right matrix-fraction model. In this approach, the participation factors are also available when constructing the stabilization diagram.

However, in some cases, the operational vibration data are acquired while rotating equipment is active in the background or while it is even the main source of excitation. The structural responses will then consists of a broadband response from which the structural modes can be determined and additional harmonic response at discrete frequencies, which are disturbing the parameter identification process. Sometimes, the harmonic response is dominating and the Operational Modal Analysis methods only find poles at these harmonic frequencies.Therefore, it is desired to try to remove the disturbing harmonics from the data before applying Operational Modal Analysis. In this paper, a method that serves this purpose will be discussed. If the fundamental frequency of the disturbing harmonics is not known, it will be estimated by applying a \u201ctacho-less rpm extraction\u201d procedure.

{"title": "Modal parameter estimation from inconsistent data sets\n", "abstract": " Most modern modal model estimation algorithms start from the observation that parameters such as resonance frequencies, damping ratios and modal participation factors areglobal'for the structure under test. By means of a least squares procedure, a global model is forced on the available time or frequency domain data. In many practical cases however, these data are slightly to strongly inconsistent. Mass loading effects, temperature variations etc. make that the data measured consecutively in differentpatches' can show slightly differing resonant frequencies. When trying to fit a global model through these data, errors can result by identifying multiple close poles instead of one single pole near single resonances. But most importantly, the mode shape extraction can be seriously affected as modal residues are extracted forglobal'pole values that do not correspond to the actual value of the FRF or impulse response under consideration. This may lead to major problems in postprocessing the data by modal substructuring or modification analysis. Also, the columns of FRF matrices relating to multiple excitation tests are often inconsistent. Shaker or suspension constraints and small nonlinearities are often indicated as possible error sources. The relevance of these problems will be briefly reviewed by some practical case studies and pragmatic remedies are evaluated. This leads to the observation that such methods could also be useful as a smoothing pre-processor for FRF based impedance methods (substructuring, load analysis), where data inconsistencies may lead to major matrix inversion errors.", "num_citations": "58\n", "authors": ["1032"]}

OPA is a fully-operational method requiring only operational measurements of the path references (eg body-side mount accelerations, pressures close to vibrating surfaces, nozzles, apertures) and target response (s). A transmissibility matrix between references and target (s) is estimated from operational data under different test conditions (eg run up, run down). The claim for its accuracy is based on being able to reproduce the original target signal (s) by summing the calculated path contributions. However, this provides no evidence that the individual path contributions are correct. In this paper, the OPA method is critically examined and compared to a classical TPA measurement. The results of this examination reveal three significant limitations: i) The first critical element is the cross-coupling between the path references. Due to the system's modal behaviour, a single force in one of the mounts causes vibrations at all path references. This cross-coupling easily leads to a false identification of significant paths and to wrong engineering decisions. ii) The second limitation of OPA are the numerical conditioning problems related to transmissibility estimations from operational data. These problems lead to unreliable transmissibility estimates in many cases. iii) The third critical element are the potential\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "44\n", "authors": ["1032"]}

{"title": "Tools to improve detection of structural changes from in-flight flutter data\n", "abstract": " Airworthiness authorities require specific in-flight flutter testing be performed before flight certificates are granted to new aircraft. Flutter tests consist of flying the aircraft at different airspeeds to provide evidence that no unsafe aeroelastic phenomena show-up in the flight domain. Data collected through in-flight tests are then processed to extract eigenfrequencies and damping ratios in varying flight conditions to track the dynamical characteristics for different airspeed values. However, extracting modal parameters from inflight tests generates a variety of inherent problems. This encompasses measurement noise, missing or noised excitation signals, and low number of sensors generating spatial aliasing. Noisy data generate more spurious poles in stabilization diagrams; this in turn increases the difficulty to select stable poles (pole-picking) and to correctly identify mode shapes. A new technique is presented based on energy considerations and a ruled-based pole-picking tool is introduced to improve the pole selection process. They allow detecting and removing mathematical poles from the stabilization diagram and speeding up the pole selection process. Furthermore, the first technique, when coupled with other techniques such as cluster analysis or fuzzy logic, provides a ranking for the pole selection, paving the way to the implementation of a tool to automatically select only physically meaningful poles.", "num_citations": "40\n", "authors": ["1032"]}

Despite the fact that TPA is used in a large variety of applications today, the method remains an expert methodology requiring insight in both the NVH problem and all the related signal and system analysis constraints. TPA is proven to be reliable, but the main bottleneck remains the huge measurement time to build the full data model. For this reason, industry is constantly seeking for simpler and faster methods. One such method is Operational Path Analysis (OPA), which was introduced about two years ago. OPA is a fully-operational method, requiring only operational measurements of the path references (body-side mount accelerations, pressures close to vibrating surfaces, nozzles and apertures, etc.) and target response (s). The OPA method is indeed very time-efficient, but suffers from several limitations leading to false path contributions and wrong engineering decisions. Its major limitations are:(i) cross-coupling effects between path references which may lead to faulty interpretations,(ii) potential errors due to missing paths and (iii) numerical illconditioning problems related to the estimation of transmissibilities from operational data. So, despite the fact that OPA is a very time-efficient approach, its benefit is limited in most application cases. This paper introduces a novel path contribution method which combines the advantages of classical TPA and OPA. The method is based on simplifications that allow balancing path accuracy and speed of execution. The principles of the method are first outlined.

This is essential, because in the next development program to which the engineering task will be applied, the required capability will increase as a result of constant product innovation.

To meet the requirements for product engineering with more innovation embedded in the products and within shorter development cycles, progress is mandated in testing and simulation to always have the required technical capability for the next development program. To adopt such an approach, the total development process has to be reconsidered in view of what is feasible at which stage. This requires trading off various attribute goals at the concept level before committing to detailed design and analysis. It also relies heavily on cascading system-level targets down to the subsystem and component level for concurrent design and engineering. At each level, multi-attribute optimization must be conducted. Also the effect of component and subsystem design changes on the total system performance must be evaluated.

{"title": "Subspace system identification for mechanical engineering\n", "abstract": " System identification for mechanical engineering applications has lately regained a strong interest. One of the key approaches introduced in the last years is subspace system identification. This paper summarizes the stateof-the-art of subspace identification algorithms. Stochastic and combined deterministic-stochastic subspace identification algorithms are treated. These methods estimate state sequences directly from the given data, through an orthogonal or oblique projection of the row spaces of certain block Hankel matrices of data into the row spaces of other block Hankel matrices, followed by a singular value decomposition (SVD) to determine the order, the observability matrix and/or the state sequence. The extraction of the state space model is then achieved through the solution of a least squares problem. Each of these steps can be elegantly implemented using well-known numerical linear algebra algorithms such as the singular value decomposition and the QR decomposition. The theory is illustrated with application results.", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["1032"]}

One of the main bottlenecks preventing its even more widespread use in the actual vehicle development process is the test time to build the full data model, requiring not only in-operation tests but also extensive Frequency Response Function tests. As a consequence, several new approaches have appeared over the past years attempting to circumvent this limitation, such as Fast and Multilevel TPA and Operational TPA. The latter method attracts quite some attention as it only requires operational data measured at the path references and target locations.

In Japan, a Guideline for such sound was proposed and a first generation of systems is installed in recent vehicles such as Nissan LEAF. The present paper investigates the related sound and sound system engineering requirements. The two main challenges are the sound design and the sound\" delivery\" at the critical VRU locations. Perceptual considerations for the sound design as discussed in detail by Tabata are further investigated for a specific vehicle sound which is subjected to a critical signal and sound quality analysis (spectrum, level, modulation). A parametric synthesis approach to the sound design is proposed. For the sound propagation, feasible high-frequency noise simulation methods such as Multipole BEM and Ray-Tracing are evaluated, taking into account vehicle and environmental constraints.

{"title": "Modal testing and analysis of a car under operational conditions\n", "abstract": " Classically, the modal parameters of a car are derived from FRF measurements in well-controlled laboratory conditions using hammer of shaker excitation. However, the modal vibro-acoustic behavior of a car on the road may differ significantly from the one during the laboratory test due to eg pre-stress and non-linear behavior of the suspension system. Hence, the need arises to identify a modal model of a car in driving condition. In this case, only response data are measurable while the actual loading condition is unknown. In the last decade, the problem of output-only operational modal analysis has typically been approached by applying a peak-picking technique to the auto-and crosspowers of the responses. resulting in approximate estimates for the resonance frequency and operational deflection shapes. These shapes were then compared to or even decomposed into the laboratory modal results. In this paper, it is investigated how more advanced techniques such as the Polyreference LSCE fed by correlation functions and the stochastic subspace method can be used for the extraction of the modes of a car on the road. The basic principles of the two methods are briefly reviewed and practical advantages and drawbacks are discussed. Subsequently, the two methods are applied to structural response data of the rear suspension system of a family car. The obtained modal parameters are correlated with the values derived from the laboratory FRF data, allowing to assess the modes which are dominant in driving condition.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["1032"]}
{"title": "Vibro-acoustic measurements and techniques for electric automotive applications\n", "abstract": " In this study, noise and vibration measurements were carried out on a multi-phase 12/8 switched reluctance (SR) motor and analyzed with vibro-acoustic techniques. When evaluating the behavior of electric powertrains for automotive applications, it is necessary to perform a vibro-acoustic analysis, particularly in view of the acoustic comfort perceived by the driver and passengers. High frequency tonal noise can be very annoying and even causes long term damage. Therefore, the noise and vibrations must be deliberately optimized. In case of a SR motor, the radial magnetic forces between the stator and rotor are the main excitation source, yielding large deformations of the stator housing and emissions of noise. Measurements and simulation results are compared for different load conditions. The dominant vibration modes are analyzed with modal analysis techniques. The unpleasant tonal noise of the motor is objectively quantified by noise metrics. Finally, the relationship between the current profiles, radial magnetic forces, and mechanical and acoustical vibrations is investigated in order to obtain a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the vibro-acoustic behavior of the motor.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["1032"]}

{"title": "Automated diagnosis system for mechanical faults in IC engines\n", "abstract": " Big end bearing knock faults and piston slap faults are considered to be two common mechanical faults in engines. A limited number of researchers have investigated the technique of using the vibration signals for the diagnostics of these two mechanical faults, but when these vibration-based techniques are applied in a real situation, the bearing knock and piston slap faults cannot easily be diagnosed from the analysed vibration signals. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have the potential to solve the problem of automated diagnostics of the mechanical faults. But the critical issue for the application of ANNs is having sufficient input data to train the networks and it is uneconomical to achieve this by performing large numbers of experiments with faults for all possible combinations of fault size and location, over large speed and load ranges. For the results in this paper, bearing knock and piston slap faults for different speed/load and clearance conditions were simulated separately. The simulation models were validated and updated from a (relatively small) series of experiments. Owing to the second order cyclostationary characteristics of the vibration signals, it was deduced that the diagnostic information of the mechanical faults should lie in their envelope signals. Two ANN systems were designed for the piston slap faults and the bearing knock faults separately. The features extracted and selected from the simulated envelope signals were used to train the ANNs and the experimental data were used to test the ANNs.

The electro-mechanical coupling between the structure and the sensor/actuator pair is calculated and included in the state-space model. Eventually, a feedback controller is implemented.

{"title": "Parameter uncertainty and variability in the structural dynamics modeling process\n", "abstract": " Finite Element (FE) analysis is widely employed in today\u2019s Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) to model realworld structures in an early design stage. FE models are deterministic, implicitly assuming that all design parameters are precisely known and that the manufacturing process produces identical structures. This is typically not valid. Parameter variability and uncertainty limit the predictive capabilities of FE models in the mid-frequency range, as even small parameter changes may have substantial effects on the product performance. For a realistic prediction of structural and vibro-acoustic behavior it is therefore required that variability and uncertainty are incorporated in the modeling process. Probabilistic approaches are generally used to model parameter variabilities. Uncertainties are typically assessed with possibilistic approaches to identify worst-case scenarios, as lack of knowledge on the parameter distribution functions prohibits the use of stochastic methods. In this paper, both method classes are demonstrated on a realistic automotive example: an assembly of a car body, a front cradle and a rear cradle with non-uniquely defined mount stiffness. Uncertainty of the stiffness is assessed with the Transformation Method, an approach based on fuzzy arithmetic that allows visualizing uncertainty on dynamic responses.

The results show that hard chopping increases the loudness of acoustic noise compared to soft chopping, with a frequency shift to higher values.

On the level of interior sound, one is often inclined to assume that NVH problems in EV have disappeared together with the combustion engine. Three observations demonstrate that this is not the case. First of all, only the dominant engine sound disappears, not the noise from tire, wind or auxiliaries, which consequently become increasingly audible due to the removal of the broadband engine masking sound. Secondly, new noise sources like tonal sounds from the electro-mechanical drive systems emerge and often have, despite their low overall noise levels, a high annoyance rating. Thirdly, the fact that engine/exhaust sounds are often used to contribute to the \u201ccharacter\u201d of the vehicle leads to an open question how to realize an appealing brand sound with EV.

{"title": "Reducing Body Development Time by Integrating NVH and Durability Analysis from the Start\n", "abstract": " Due to the trend to build more vehicle models on a common platform, body development is very often on the critical path in the automotive development process. While the virtual assessment of attributes like crash, structural rigidity or production feasibility is common practice today, it is done less systematically for NVH and durability. They are traditionally only considered close to the availability of prototypes. Performance issues discovered at this stage will lead to additional design cycles which conflicts with the need to further shorten the total development time. The process proposed in this paper results in a better initial design by doing more NVH analysis in the pre-CAD phase and a reduced number of iteration cycles required for NVH and durability engineering by iterating much faster to the final design.

{"title": "Industrial relevance of operational modal analysis-Civil, aerospace and automotive case histories\n", "abstract": " During the last 15 years or so, Operational Modal Analysis developed and reached a mature state with advanced parameter estimation algorithms, commercial software implementations, and very relevant industrial applications. This paper will discuss some case histories. A first application is structural health monitoring in civil engineering: in order to assess the health of structures by means of vibration measurements, the dynamic characteristics of the structure need to be identified from measurements. For monitoring purposes, it is evident that the structure has to be tested in its operational conditions, being excited by wind or traffic, and that artificial measurable excitation is often no option. The second part of the paper focuses on aerospace applications with a case on using operational modal analysis during a satellite vibration qualification test and a case involving flight flutter testing. Aircraft in-flight vibration tests allow the validation of the analytical models under various real flight conditions and, more important, allow to assess the aero-elastic interaction between the structure and the aerodynamic forces as they may lead to a sudden unstable behaviour known as flutter. During these tests, the trends of eigenfrequencies and damping ratios of the critical modes as a function of airspeed are carefully studied. The present paper will concentrate on the cases where the aircraft is excited by natural turbulences only. A final case study is operational automotive testing: in troubleshooting, competitive benchmarking, or target setting projects, it is common to acquire a lot of vibration data while the car is driven on the road or tested on a roller bench.

It has proved to be reliable but a complete analysis takes a long time and relatively large effort. Therefore there is an ongoing research for simpler and faster methods and several have been proposed in the last years. One such method, most often referred to as operational path analysis (OPA), attracted particular attention as it uses only measured operational input and output signals and calculates the transmissibilities between them to characterize the paths. The claim for its accuracy is based on being able to reproduce the original output signal by summing the calculated partial contributions but it has not yet been compared to other TPA methods. This fully operational method is now critically examined and compared to a reference classical TPA measurement. The results of this examination reveal three significant weaknesses. This paper will focus on one of them, namely showing the effect of neglecting a path in the analysis. In classical TPA the error clearly shows up in the summed contribution and thus can be recognized, whereas in OPA this mistake can result in erroneous individual path contributions yet remain unnoticed because it will not affect the summed contribution in some cases.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1032"]}

The requirement to develop multiple innovative body variants for each new vehicle platform while shortening the overall time-to-market, puts body development on the critical path in the vehicle development process. The only possible answer to this challenge is to evaluate and optimize all critical functional attributes like weight, crashworthiness, durability and NVH as early as possible in the process, calling for a fully CAE-driven approach.

Morphing the FE mesh of a predecessor model enables the analyst to formulate design recommendations in the concept phase. Advanced contribution analysis allows quick detection of weak points. Novel model reduction techniques shorten calculation time, enabling more modifications to be evaluated and making real optimization studies feasible. A first approach is based on a modal projection of the modifications and is used to carry out sensitivity analyses and assess small modifications.

This paper proposes an ANN-based automated diagnostic system which combines torsional vibration and rotation of the block for more robust misfire diagnosis.

Firstly, an extensive experimental study was performed on a trimmed SAAB 340 test section. A full frequency response function matrix was measured between a large number of structural and acoustical degrees of freedom. Based on these data a non-parametric (vibro-acoustical principal field shape) system model was identified. Furthermore, a full FE model was derived for the SAAB 340 acoustic test section. First a model of the fuselage structure was formed and evaluated by means of eigenvalue analysis. Based on prior test results this model was updated. The remaining parts of the fuselage section, containing the cabin air cavity, trim panels and the material between the cabin structure and trim panels, was formed into a second model. This model was also analysed by means of eigenvalues followed by connecting the two (sub-) models, by means of modal coupling, to form the complete description of the cabin section. For this model, the frequency response functions were evaluated at the nodes corresponding to the experimental analysis. Finally, a correlation analysis between the FE and the test model was performed. Hereto, direct FRF correlation between the FE and test models, as well as a correlation of the principal field shapes corresponding to both data sets was executed. As a general conclusion, the value of using principal field shapes to evaluate the correlation between medium frequency test and analysis models was well demonstrated.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1032"]}

Extending their application to the testing phase opens new opportunities for test data exploitation and allows measuring previously unmeasurable quantities and designing reduced test configurations. A common workflow is followed: a validated multiphysics system model provides a prediction of the system states which is corrected by the estimation algorithms using the measurement data. The model can then generate data of the non-measurable quantities (eg virtual sensors). While the general concept of virtual sensing is well adopted, the systematic reuse of design engineering simulation models to this purpose offers new opportunities. A wide range of models can be used, including analytical, lumped parameter 1D system models and 3D (FE and Multibody) models. Key is that these models should be easy to evaluate and have a small number of states, while capturing the dominant physics. Advanced model order reduction techniques are hence a key to enable the (re) use the complex design engineering models.

More and more bridge structures are being monitored. Permanent monitoring is installed because of the increasing traffic and loading of the structures. This refers to both rail bridges, in which the increasing load is related with the increasing train speed, as well as ordinary road bridges. One of the limits, as far as permanent monitoring systems is concerned, is its high installation cost which is partially caused by the costs of cabling. A solution to this bottleneck is a wireless monitoring system. The challenge and crucial operation aspect of a wireless system is synchronization of measurements in the whole sensor network. The presented system uses a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) to collect the relevant physical parameters (vibrations, temperature, humidity) and to transmit data to the main server. The system eliminates stand-alone laboratory bench top equipment sets and cable-based, hard-wired sensor networking. The paper describes the developed hardware solution, laboratory tests and an in-field case study.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1032"]}

The PolyMAX polyreference frequency-domain method can be implemented in a very similar way as the industry standard polyreference (time-domain) LSCE method: in a first step a stabilisation diagram is constructed containing frequency, damping and participation information. Next, the mode shapes are found in a second least-squares step, based on the user selection of stable poles. One of the specific advantages of the technique lies in the very stable identification of the system poles and participation factors as a function of the specified system order, leading to easy-to-interpret stabilisation diagrams.

But the increasing awareness of environmental issues is widening the definition of better product, in order to address the conflicting demand for better performances and reduced emissions. Hybrid vehicles seem to offer an immediate solution to pollution without requiring the massive investments on infrastructures that would be needed to adopt the fully electric vehicle as the most environmentally friendly solution. However, hybrid power trains introduce a variety of specific NVH problems ranging from the driver's comfort to the interior noise level, including engine order tracking in presence of multiple rotating speeds. Comfort analysis mainly refers to the lack of correlation between the driver's actions and the interior noise of a hybrid vehicle. On idling conditions only the IC engine works and the noise level is comparable to standard cars. When engaging the gear and moving at very low speed, only the electric motor supplies power and the noise level suddenly drops. When more power is required, the internal combustion engine supplies the missing power even if the driver releases the accelerator pedal. This paper reports the analysis results of an intensive test campaign carried out on a Toyota Prius. The tests concentrate on both road noise and comfort analysis.

{"title": "The integration of operational modal analysis in vibration qualification testing\n", "abstract": " In the process of the structural integrity and launchenvironment survivability assessment of satellite structures, dynamic mathematical models are used for load prediction. These analytical models need to be test-verified. Therefore, it is of vital importance to correlate the Finite Element model with experimental vibration data and to further fine-tune and update the model. Classically, the modal test is performed in the laboratory. Frequency response functions are measured and fed into a conventional modal analysis package in order to estimate eigenfrequencies, damping ratios, mode shapes and participation factors. Once the analytical model is test verified and the component loads have been estimated, the satellite equipment is subjected to shaker tests with various shaker levels to ensure their structural integrity and launch survivability. This paper investigates the possibilities to integrate both the modal survey and the qualification test. The issue is complicated by the fact that during the qualification test only response data are measured while the actual loading conditions are unknown. Therefore, operational modal analysis has to be applied to the outputonly data. A test structure was subjected to a typical vibration qualification test.

But, despite the fact that TPA is today successfully used in a large variety of applications, its main bottleneck remains the huge measurement time to build the full data model. Over the past years, several new approaches were developed to circumvent this limitation. An example is the recently developed Operational Path Analysis (OPA) approach, requiring only operational data measured at the path references (eg mount accelerations, pressures closeby vibrating surfaces, nozzles and apertures, etc.) and target locations. This OPA method is indeed very time-efficient, but suffers from several limitations that may lead to incorrect path contributions and wrong engineering decisions. The main limitations are three-fold:(i) cross-coupling effects between path references which lead to faulty interpretations,(ii) contributions of missing paths that are distributed over the remaining paths and (iii) ill-conditioning problems leading to unreliable transmissibility estimates. The key TPA challenge hence remains to reconcile speed and accuracy. In this context the present paper introduces a new TPA approach, providing a good compromise between path accuracy and measurement time. The principles of the new method are first outlined. Then, the method is compared with existing classical TPA approaches using an automotive example.

Therefore, new simulation models, which can simulate combustion faults and mechanical faults in engines, were developed and are reported in this paper. In order to evaluate and update the simulation models, a small number of experiments with combustion faults and mechanical faults were carried out and the experimental vibration signals were studied first. The torsional vibration of the crankshaft and angular acceleration of the engine block were used to detect engine misfires. In contrast to the misfires, it has been demonstrated that an appropriate signal processing approach for diagnosis of the mechanical faults is envelope analysis of the vibration signals. The simulated signals were processed by the same signal processing techniques as the measurements and the selected features from the processed data were used to train the networks. The processed simulated data, with added random variations of the same order as in the measurements, provided sufficient data for the training of the ANNs. Finally, it was demonstrated that the networks trained on simulated data can efficiently detect both the combustion faults and mechanical faults in real tests and identify the location and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1032"]}

{"title": "Inertial property estimation by the modal model method\n", "abstract": " In general, there are two vibration-based inertia property estimation methods: one is based on masslines, and the other one is based on a modal model. The mass line method has been proved to be accurate and also integrated into some commercial software. But the mass line is vulnerable to contamination from the lower residual of bending modes. The modal model based method is an alternative under these conditions. Moreover, the properties of the suspension are sometimes of interest in the product design and machine condition monitoring processes, and they can only be extracted by the modal model method. In this paper, the modal model method was investigated. After the modal parameters were identified by the advanced modal analysis technique, two different approaches were used to calculate the inertia properties. The first considered that the damping of the suspension is proportional damping. The parameters were derived from the mode shapes under unit modal mass conditions. The second approach considered general nonproportional damping and all parameters were related to the poles and mode shapes with unity maximum component. By the diagonal characteristic and zero elements in the matrices, the elements in the inertia matrix can finally be obtained from both different mode shape approaches. Based on computer simulation data, the calculation processes of both the unity modal mass approach and the unity maximum component approach have been illustrated and the final results were tested.

{"title": "Virtual Car Sound Synthesis Approach for Hybrid and Electric Vehicles\n", "abstract": " The electrification of powertrains causes a radical change in the world of vehicle sound engineering. Decades of experience in designing brand-specific sound, based on noise and vibrations generated by combustion engines, cannot be simply transferred to Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (HEV). Although electric vehicles are significantly quieter, their interior noise is marked by high-frequency noise components, which can be subjectively perceived as annoying. Moreover, disturbing noise shares from other components (oil pump, HVAC system, battery fan, alternator, transmission systems, etc.) are no longer masked by combustion engine noise and give rise to complex sound signatures. These changes pose new Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH) challenges to the interior sound quality and comfort.In this study, a dedicated Virtual Car Sound (VCS) synthesis approach has been developed for HEV. This approach is very useful for sound quality evaluation studies and for the design and engineering of brand specific sounds. The sound synthesis is based on a so-called Sound Quality Equivalent (SQE) model which is simplified in nature and can reproduce the typical sound signal components of HEV in real-time on a driving simulator.

{"title": "Simulating faults in IC engines\n", "abstract": " Simulation is proving to be a viable way of generating data to train neural networks to detect, diagnose and classify faults in machines. This approach is now being applied to internal combustion (IC) engines, which raise different problems than rotating machines such as gearboxes. Faults can be divided into combustion faults such as misfire and engine knock, and mechanical faults such as piston slap and bearing knock. This paper describes the advances that have been made in simulating engine faults, both combustion and mechanical. Software packages are now available which allow modelling of the kinetics of whole engines, usually with the components such as engine block, crankshaft, connecting rods and pistons treated as rigid. This has been found suitable for modelling the effects of misfire, on both crankshaft torsional vibration and block angular accelerations. The flexibility of the crankshaft of larger engines can be taken into account. For mechanical faults such as piston slap and bearing knock, the excitation forces are more impulsive, and therefore a higher frequency modal response must be taken into account, but on the other hand the response is more localised, so the whole engine does not necessarily need to be modelled. For misfire detection, the amplitude and phase of the first few harmonics of the cycle frequency are suitable feature vector components when using either torsional vibration or angular acceleration of the engine block. For the higher frequency faults such as piston slap and bearing knock, the first few harmonics of the envelope signal (of an appropriate bandpass signal) can be used in a similar way.

Today's order tracking techniques (eg frequency domain method, order domain method, etc.) only provide decent order values when the order content does not change during the observation interval. So to get the best out of these algorithms, the ideal measurement sequence would consist of a truly constant RPM during each observation period, also known as a semi-stationary measurement. Such an approach has several disadvantages:(i) the total measurement time is far higher than in a run-up measurement;(ii) spurious effects occurring only during the transition from one RPM to the next go unnoticed, giving rise to an unacceptable number of semi-stationary levels;(iii) at high RPMs, even the slightest oscillations in RPM result in large phase shifts.

A first approach is based on (operational) modal analysis. Based on vibration measurements, the modal parameters of the structure are estimated. The idea is now to automate this process so that, without human intervention, a representative dynamic model of the structure is always available. A second approach uses multiple-model estimation in the case when the state-space models\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1032"]}

Absorption is often not effective enough or even not possible, so the other method has to be applied. The knowledge of generation mechanisms is important to be able to handle advisedly. Accelerometers are generally used to detect the acoustical parameters on the surface. Unfortunately, sometimes it is too difficult or even impossible to use them. There are also cases where not only the radiating surface but also other effects like airpumping generate the noise as well. In these cases more sophisticated methods are required.The work presented here was part of the BRITE-Euram Project TINO [1]. The main goal of the project was to find ways for the analysis and reduction of tyre noise. Farfield pressure measurements\u2013the resulting noise-effects\u2013are hardly correlated to nearfield measurements, so in order to be able to conclude on the noisiness of a tyre, it is not enough to put it on a test bench and perform nearfield pressure measurements.

Results show that even speed orders are amplified and damped in the vibration and sound-pressure-wave measurements in faulty and healthy conditions respectively. At low speeds, the sixth speed order also appears in the torque, due to the non-activation of one phase. This order however tends to disappear at high speed, due to the filtering effect of the mechanical inertia of the test bench.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1032"]}

Firstly to optimize the powertrain noise at source, not just for quietness but to give the correct sensations to the driver. As the core part of the drive system is an electrical device the influence of controls and electronics on the noise generated are equally important as the mechanical elements.

In order to decrease the annoyance of the air traffic produced noise, an optimization of the flight path can be performed by mean of a source-transfer-receiver approach and a sound quality analysis. Aircraft in general and particularly helicopter flyover noise represent a challenging auditory scenario. Not just the trajectory of the maneuvers has to be considered, but also the balance among the noise sources components is important in order to obtain a more pleasant sound.The need of a more pleasant sound is also expressed by medical studies that show the negative effects of the noise on population healthy. Several acoustic and psychoacoustic factors play a role and affect human perception, role that can be quantified by mean of psychoacoustic metrics. This paper presents a flyover noise synthesis approach which allows investigating the human perception and noise annoyance of rotorcraft operations.

Amongst these, one of the most recent methods is the OPAX (Operational Path Analysis with eXogeneous inputs) technique which uses parametric models (eg dynamic stiffness model for the mounts) for identifying the operational loads. The advantage of such a method is that only a limited amount of measurement data is needed to build up the TPA model since only a few model parameters are to be estimated to describe the loads over the whole frequency range. This is different in the traditional Matrix Inversion (MI) method where the parameter estimation has to be done separately for each frequency line, requiring a much larger amount of data. This makes the OPAX method more robust, fast and scalable, enabling the engineer to use a smaller amount of measurement data for quick troubleshooting. This paper reports on a validation test campaign which was carried out on a full vehicle to assess the OPAX method and compare it to the traditional Mount Stiffness (MS) and Matrix Inversion (MI) TPA methods. Specific focus is on the validation of the OPAX models by comparing the dynamic stiffness estimations to mount measurement data.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1032"]}

This paper presents several innovative strategies to optimize the design and operation of industrial wind turbines. Firstly, a Finite Element (FE) strategy is adopted to model and validate individual components, subsystems and finally the system-level design. Secondly, a Multi-Body Simulation (MBS) approach is proposed to calculate the system-level loads, and subsequently optimize the design (eg gear contact) and fatigue life of components and subsystems.

This paper presents a wireless measurement system designed by LMS and IMEC and deals with 1) the selection of MEMS accelerometers and comparison with a classical accelerometer; 2) wireless system architecture, data transmission and reception; 3) measurements over a scaled civil structure with a wireless MEMS sensor network and a traditional one and 4) the comparison of both performances. The present study proves that, in spite of the current performance limitations of commercially available digital accelerometers-when compared with state of the art analog sensors-accurate modal testing can be carried out with standard wireless technology and MEMS sensors.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1032"]}
{"title": "Automatic identification of noise annoyance features from engine run-up sounds\n", "abstract": " This paper presents a noise annoyance identification tool that was developed to assess the interior noise quality of passenger cars on an objective basis. The tool automatically extracts resonances, masking effects, order non-linearities, booming phenomena and amplitude modulations from a vehicle run-up sound and visualizes these features on the rpm-frequency spectrogram of the sound.A unique order-based approach is used. In a first stage, an automatic order detection algorithm is employed to detect the significant engine orders in the run-up sound. An advanced order tracking technique is then used to accurately track these order components in amplitude and phase. Once this is achieved, the noise annoyance features are automatically extracted from the order data and displayed in the rpm-frequency colormap of the sound.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1032"]}
{"title": "CAE approach to the design of smart structures applications\n", "abstract": " During last years, smart materials and control concepts developments have led to exploring practical applications. To make the step to industrial use, related design processes however must become part of the industrial product creation process. This requires the product functional performance simulation models to support the specific aspects related to advanced materials, active systems, actuators, sensors and control and integrate these into system level virtual prototype models. An industrial constraint is that these simulations make maximal use of standard simulation tools such as major FE/BE and MBS codes, 1-D simulation tools as Matlab-Simulink (MSL) etc. This involves developing modelling capabilities for the intelligent material systems and sensor/actuator components inside FE or as 1-D models in MSL. For the control system models, the key element is to link the worlds of 1-D control simulation and geometry-based structural simulation. To design the actual system-level application, a two-step approach is followed. The most promising macro configurations (control on panels, beams, mounts\u22ef) are selected based on 3-D FE/MBS models using simplified controller models. In the second step, the selected configurations are optimised in terms of actuator and controller strategies/parameters using the 1-D Simulink environment. The research is executed as part of the EC-IP InMAR.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1032"]}
{"title": "Booming noise study on hybrid cars\n", "abstract": " The Toyota Prius represents the first worldwide commercially produced hybrid vehicle. Recently the Toyota produced the new Prius version, significantly improving the performances of its predecessor and introducing the concept of\" Hybrid Synergy Drive\"(THS II), an evolution of the past\" Toyota Hybrid System\"(THS). Three rotating components form the vehicle transmission. The internal combustion engine is a 4-cylinders 4-strokes engine using the Atkinson thermodynamic cycle; the electric motor and the generator are both three-phases permanent magnet synchronous AC motors. These three rotating components are connected each other with a kind of CVT transmission characterized by a planetary gear box, referred to as Power Split Device. An electronic control system regulates the rpm of the three components based on many variables such as the external loads, the fuel consumption, the emissions, the state of charge of batteries and the user power demand, which directly relates to torque. This paper reports on the results of a test campaigns carried out on both THS and THS II to assess vibration and acoustic responses under real on-road conditions. The analysis deals with multiple rpm order tracking and shows how different rotating components affect the interior vibro-acoustic comfort as well as the car drivability and pleasantness.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1032"]}

{"title": "Optimizing the performance of the whole vehicle with effective virtual prototypes\n", "abstract": " Engineering an automobile has an ever-increasing challenge: to satisfy many competing objectives for the attributes of the full vehicle. The vehicle development process is under continuous pressure to reduce development time, reduce product cost, and come up with innovative designs by exploring more options. At the same time, customer demands and product legislation keep pushing-out the required performance. The result is a demand to front-load the design analysis process. Virtual prototypes offer a way to meet this demand, but the virtual prototyping system must properly support the characterization, validation and improvement of the functional performance of components, subsystems and whole vehicles. This demands that design analysis technologies are adapted and relevant to each stage of the cycle: concept and planning, design and development, verification and production. The design analysis activity must also be integrated into the wider design process and the overall business process. The paper presents several enabling technologies, developed to facilitate virtual prototyping, including: the integration of multiple functional-performance analysis techniques into a seamless process; rapid conversion of models from one type to another; fast but accurate computational methods for the solution of vibro-acoustic equations with the necessary accuracy for robust design; and the capture of analysis sequences into processes which can be repeated for trends analysis and optimisation.

Several solutions are already available on the market ranging from low emission diesel engines to a full hybrid approach, which combines a gasoline engine with one or more electrical motors, achieving higher system efficiency. Gas engines are often used as a dedicated solution in public transport. Such a variety of engines and powertrains entail particular effects on the vibro-acoustic performances of the vehicles.

The paper discusses an approach for damage detection and identification based on variations in the experimentally identified structural dynamics model of the structure under analysis. The approach starts from a nominal modal model for the undamaged structure. Newly measured experimental data (not necessarily reduced to modal parameters) are then confronted with this model using a statistical test calculation procedure. The method allows to detect the onset of damage, but it was also developed into a procedure to assess the location of the damage, provided a numerical structural model is available. The method is demonstrated by several examples, including a forced damage test on a car component and the detection of damage in a bridge\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1032"]}
{"title": "Industrial applicability of modal analysis on operating data\n", "abstract": " Traditionally, vibration analysis in operating conditions (on the road or on a bench) had to be combined with experimental modal analysis in controlled laboratory conditions in order to understand the modal behaviour of the structure. This requires additional measurements, costs and time. However, in many applications, the real operating conditions may differ significantly from those applied during the modal test and hence the vibration modes from the modal test might not be representative for the active modes in operation conditions. The need for a capability of doing a modal analysis on data from operating conditions is obvious. Over the last years, several modal parameter estimation techniques have been proposed and studied for modal parameter extraction from output-only data. Each method needs to make a number of assumptions and has some limitations. In this paper, the capabilities and limitations of the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1032"]}

In the case of Modal Analysis, a parametric system model in terms of modal parameters is used. Since in practice the measured data are contaminated to a certain extent by errors, the inherent sensitivity of the modal parameters to these errors is an important characteristic of the estimation procedure. A mathematical technique is presented that calculates the first order evolution of the model parameters as a function of data variations. Since this approach provides detailed qualitative as well as quantitative information on the sensitivity of the estimated parameters as a function of data variations, the condition of the modal model identification process can be evaluated. Additionally, this error sensitivity analysis allows to establish bounds for the model parameters as well as requirements for data accuracy.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1032"]}

{"title": "FATIGUE ANALYSIS AND ACOUSTIC RADIATION PREDICTION IN VIEW OF BETTER CAR DESIGN\n", "abstract": " Acoustic radiation, or noise in general, dynamic fatigue and vibrations are frequently interrelated aspects in the structural dynamics optimization of cars. Realistic assessment of these phenomena is today only possible after development of first prototypes, therefore at a stage where larger design modifications are only implemented at considerable expense.For acoustic radiation prediction, techniques based on the BEM method are promising but several aspects remain to be improved: the solution to the coupled fluid-structure problem, modelling of specific boundary conditions and proper simulation of excitation. Methodology for traditional fatigue analysis is well developed for predictions based on crack initiation, but less for the crack growth case. Furthermore, the methodology is currently mostly applied at the stage when first prototypes are available. The underlying relation between fatigue and structural vibrations is rarely developed at all, even in the prototype optimization phase. As a consequence, the effect of structural dynamics modifications on the fatigue behaviour is seldom understood. The ESPRIT project 2486, DYNAMO, develops improved methods for acoustic radiation prediction and fatigue analysis, including the relation with structure vibration models.

{"title": "STRAIN-BASED EXPERIMENTAL MODAL ANALYSIS: USE OF MODE CURVATURE AND STRAIN-TO-DISPLACEMENT RELATIONS\n", "abstract": " A very well established way of performing experimental modal analysis is to use acceleration based transducers that lead to the identification of the displacement mode shapes. However, strain gauges and modal analysis with strain based transducers have recently become a popular alternative to the more common way of carrying out experimental modal analysis, since strain gauges and strain measurements have already been commonly used for static load testing of mechanical products in the aeronautic, automotive and mechanical industry and are also directly related to stress, fatigue and failure, and therefore have been a common choice on structural health monitoring systems. Additionally, any sort of system that uses strain gauges for static testing can also use the same sensors for dynamic testing without incurring additional sensor costs, which can save costs in instrumentation. Moreover, applications where sensor size and placement might be critical are also good candidates for strain-based methods. Helicopters, wind turbines and gas turbines are a good example where strain gauges are more suited for vibration measurements. This gain in popularity has recently led to more research on the strain modal analysis theory and practical applications. In this work, the strain modal analysis theory will be presented, and a methodology to scale the strain modes on beam structures will be presented. This methodology will also show how reciprocity in strain modal analysis can be met in some cases.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1032"]}
