{"title": "Emerging security challenges of cloud virtual infrastructure\n", "abstract": " The cloud computing model is rapidly transforming the IT landscape. Cloud computing is a new computing paradigm that delivers computing resources as a set of reliable and scalable internet-based services allowing customers to remotely run and manage these services. Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) is one of the popular cloud computing services. IaaS allows customers to increase their computing resources on the fly without investing in new hardware. IaaS adapts virtualization to enable on-demand access to a pool of virtual computing resources. Although there are great benefits to be gained from cloud computing, cloud computing also enables new categories of threats to be introduced. These threats are a result of the cloud virtual infrastructure complexity created by the adoption of the virtualization technology. Breaching the security of any component in the cloud virtual infrastructure significantly impacts on the security of other components and consequently affects the overall system security. This paper explores the security problem of the cloud platform virtual infrastructure identifying the existing security threats and the complexities of this virtual infrastructure. The paper also discusses the existing security approaches to secure the cloud virtual infrastructure and their drawbacks. Finally, we propose and explore some key research challenges of implementing new virtualization-aware security solutions that can provide the pre-emptive protection for complex and ever- dynamic cloud virtual infrastructure.", "num_citations": "96\n", "authors": ["589"]}
{"title": "An ensemble oversampling model for class imbalance problem in software defect prediction\n", "abstract": " Software systems are now ubiquitous and are used every day for automation purposes in personal and enterprise applications; they are also essential to many safety-critical and mission-critical systems, e.g., air traffic control systems, autonomous cars, and SCADA systems. With the availability of massive storage capabilities, high speed Internet, and the advent of Internet of Things devices, modern software systems are growing in both size and complexity. Maintaining a high quality of such complex systems while manually keeping the error rate at a minimum is a challenge. Therefore, automated detection of faulty components in a software system is important during software development and also post-delivery. Fault detection models usually needs to be trained on a labeled-balanced dataset with both faulty and nonfaulty samples. Earlier work, e.g. Mohsin et al.

Tracing the evolution and transmission of the virus is crucial to respond to and control the pandemic through appropriate intervention strategies. This paper reports and analyses genomic mutations in the coding regions of SARS-CoV-2 and their probable protein secondary structure and solvent accessibility changes, which are predicted using deep learning models. Prediction results suggest that mutation D614G in the virus spike protein, which has attracted much attention from researchers, is unlikely to make changes in protein secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility.

{"title": "Origin of novel coronavirus (COVID-19): a computational biology study using artificial intelligence\n", "abstract": " Origin of the COVID-19 virus has been intensely debated in the scientific community since the first infected cases were detected in December 2019. The disease has caused a global pandemic, leading to deaths of thousands of people across the world and thus finding origin of this novel coronavirus is important in responding and controlling the pandemic. Recent research results suggest that bats or pangolins might be the original hosts for the virus based on comparative studies using its genomic sequences. This paper investigates the COVID-19 virus origin by using artificial intelligence (AI) and raw genomic sequences of the virus. More than 300 genome sequences of COVID-19 infected cases collected from different countries are explored and analysed using unsupervised clustering methods. The results obtained from various AI-enabled experiments using clustering algorithms demonstrate that all examined COVID-19 virus genomes belong to a cluster that also contains bat and pangolin coronavirus genomes. This provides evidences strongly supporting scientific hypotheses that bats and pangolins are probable hosts for the COVID-19 virus. At the whole genome analysis level, our findings also indicate that bats are more likely the hosts for the COVID-19 virus than pangolins.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["589"]}

The proposed SSPL simplifies the task of developing standard unambiguous policy statement. The policies can be developed in any specific domain free of any restriction (if the ontology exists the policy will be enforceable, or else it will not). The idioms of the domain ontology can be developed and added to the language at runtime. And the SSPL framework will refresh the new concepts.

The recent success of cloud computing has made a big step towards this goal where Platform as a Service (PaaS) can provide general and comprehensive software development services within an integrated online environment for building Software as a Service (SaaS). However, currently, most PaaS are in a \"white-box\" which still requires significant learning efforts for software developers and lets alone inexperienced project managers or end users.

{"title": "RCM: Requirement Capturing Model for Automated Requirements Formalisation\n", "abstract": " Most existing automated requirements formalisation techniques require system engineers to (re)write their requirements using a set of predefined requirement templates with a fixed structure and known semantics to simplify the formalisation process. However, these techniques require understanding and memorising requirement templates, which are usually fixed format, limit requirements captured, and do not allow capture of more diverse requirements. To address these limitations, we need a reference model that captures key requirement details regardless of their structure, format or order. Then, using NLP techniques we can transform textual requirements into the reference model. Finally, using a suite of transformation rules we can then convert these requirements into formal notations. In this paper, we introduce the first and key step in this process, a Requirement Capturing Model (RCM) - as a reference model - to model the key elements of a system requirement regardless of their format, or order. We evaluated the robustness of the RCM model compared to 15 existing requirements representation approaches and a benchmark of 162 requirements. Our evaluation shows that RCM breakdowns support a wider range of requirements formats compared to the existing approaches. We also implemented a suite of transformation rules that transforms RCM-based requirements into temporal logic(s). In the future, we will develop NLP-based RCM extraction technique to provide end-to-end solution.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["589"]}

Those edge servers are deployed at base stations to provide nearby users with high-quality services. Thus, data caching is extremely important in ensuring low latency for service delivery in the edge computing environment. To minimize the data caching cost and maximize the reduction in service latency, we formulate this Edge Data Caching (EDC) problem as a constrained optimization problem in this paper. We prove the NP-completeness of this EDC problem and provide an optimal solution named IPEDC to solve this problem based on Integer Programming.

{"title": "The challenges of leveraging threat intelligence to stop data breaches\n", "abstract": " Data breaches and security incidents are becoming increasingly costly and statistics show that hackers are highly motivated to acquire confidential data as the financial benefits are substantial. Hence, business data has become a top priority to be compromised. Threat Intelligence has been recently introduced by organisations as a means to gain greater visibility of cyber threats, especially data breaches, in order to better protect their digital assets. A well-planned implementation of threat intelligence enables organisations to predict and (at least partially) prevent cyber crime, such as data breaches or data exfilteration ({\\ie} attempts to move data outside an organization\u2019s secure perimeters). This allows an organisation to better understand different aspects of threats, including identifying the adversary and how and why they intend to compromise digital assets, consequences of attacks, which assets can be compromised, to what level and how to detect threats, how to respond to them. A key enabler to implement threat intelligence is to build sophisticated data-driven architectures using machine learning that allows an organisation's cyber data (stored in different silos throughout an organisation's digital infrastructure) to be managed effectively. However, one of the biggest challenges of machine learning in cybersecurity is to enable an efficient implementation that scales in today's complex threat landscapes and digital infrastructure, respectively.

{"title": "SRCM: A Semi Formal Requirements Representation Model Enabling System Visualisation and Quality Checking.\n", "abstract": " Requirements engineering is pivotal to the successful development of any given system. The core artifact for such phase is the requirements specification document. Requirements can be specified in informal, semiformal, and formal notations. The majority of the requirements across many fields and domains are written natural language. However, natural language is inherently ambiguous and imprecise and the requirements cannot be automatically validated. Formal notations on the other hand enable automated testing and validation but is only comprehensible by experts and requires rewriting the requirements. Semi-formal notations strikes a good balance between comprehension and checking for several systems. However, the majority of the existing representation models mandates the requirements to be (re) written to adhere to certain templates. They also do not support automated checking. In this paper, we present SRCM\u2013a semi-formal requirements representation model based on a comprehensive requirements capturing model (RCM) that does not enforce much limitations on how the requirements can be written.

Because of these frauds, card users are hesitant in making purchases and both the merchants and financial institutions bear heavy losses. Some major challenges in credit card frauds involve the availability of public data, high class imbalance in data, changing nature of frauds and the high number of false alarms.
