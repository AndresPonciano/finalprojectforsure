{"title": "The cost of email interruption\n", "abstract": " The use of email by employees at the Danwood Group was studied and it was found that the interrupt effect from emails is more than generally believed. Employees allowed themselves to be interrupted almost as frequently as telephone calls and the common reaction to the arrival of an email is to react almost as quickly as they would respond to telephone calls. This means the interrupt effect is comparable with that of a telephone call. The recovery time from an email interruption was found to be significantly less than the published recovery time for telephone calls. It is to be concluded, therefore, that while Email is still less disruptive than the telephone, the way the majority of users handle their incoming email has been shown to give far more interruption than expected.  By analysing the data captured the authors have been able to create recommendations for a set of guidelines for email usage within the workplace\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "224\n", "authors": ["376"]}

Firstly, there is the question of what knowledge should be taught in a subject where new areas of interest can appear, flourish and then largely disappear within a few years. Secondly there is the question of how the subject should be taught to try to ensure that the students not only acquire knowledge which enables them to pass their University examinations but can put that knowledge into practical use in their subsequent careers.This paper presents a method that has been used by the authors successfully over a number of years to supplement conventional lecture and laboratory classes. The approach is designed to convince the students that they are capable of working in groups on problems that they have not encountered previously. The students are asked to tackle open ended problems which, typically, require the students to both apply some of the knowledge that they have been taught and acquire new knowledge for themselves. The tasks are designed to allow students at different levels of ability to succeed in achieving something worthwhile while also ensuring that even the most able and well motivated students will still be left with unfulfilled challenges.", "num_citations": "52\n", "authors": ["376"]}

The problem now is the failure of these projects may lead to a waste of resources. Current literature shows that developing countries face more challenges when implementing ICT projects than developed countries. This paper analyses and synthesises the factors for success and failure based on a literature review and a preliminary qualitative analysis of data collected in Kenya. The data was collected via interviews with 26 staff from 9 government ministries where ICT projects had taken place, and through the analysis of related documentation. Factors affecting ICT are broadly categorised into factors for success and failure. These factors for success are further categorised into drivers and enablers while factors for failure are categorised as barriers and inhibitors. The paper seeks to find ICT best practices that can be adapted and adopted for Africa and specifically looks at the infrastructural issues in Africa. The impact of the lack of e-government policies, legislation and regulatory frameworks is highlighted. The paper provides a framework, based on the literature and preliminary findings, for evaluating ICT projects before, during and after ICT project implementation. Governments in developing countries to plan and organise the implementation of ICT projects and also to identify risks, requirements and areas for local and international support can use the suggestions made in this paper for successful ICT implementation.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["376"]}

{"title": "The need for evidence innovation in educational technology evaluation\n", "abstract": " More complex and chaotic methods are being adopted in the development of technology to enhance learning and teaching in higher education today in order to achieve innovation in teaching practice. However, because this type of development does not conform to a linear process-driven order, it is notoriously difficult to evaluate its success as a holistic educational initiative. It is proposed that there are five factors that impact on effective educational technology evaluation, which contributes to insubstantial evidence of positive outcomes, these being: premature timing; inappropriate software evaluation techniques and models; lack of shared understanding of the terminology or the semantics of education technology; the growing complexity of agile and open development; and the corporatisation of higher education. This paper suggests that it is no longer helpful for policy makers to evaluate whether educational technology project outcomes were successful or unsuccessful but instead they should use agile evaluation strategies to understand the impact of the product, process and outcomes in a changing context. It is no longer useful to ask the question, \u2018did the software work?\u2019 The key is for software developers and policy-makers to ask \u2018what type of software works, in which conditions and for whom?\u2019 To understand this, the software development community needs to look at adopting evaluation strategies from the social science community.

Although there are many such process models now available for software engineers to follow, they can be classified according to one of five basic types. They differ in the level to which the process might be applied and also in the additional guidelines and philosophies they define. In this paper we define those five fundamental process types. The paper goes on to present a definitive technique for comparing such process models\u2014the Functionality\u2010Time graph. By combining this technique with a Functionality\u2010Cost/Benefit graph, it helps to identify the key decision points in the software development process with respect to a software system's\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["376"]}

The primary aim of this project is to develop a practical, business-oriented approach to managing knowledge within an organisation. The four key areas that have been recognised as critical to the success of a KM scheme are \u2018strategy\u2019,\u2018technology\u2019,\u2018measurement\u2019and \u2018culture\u2019. The latter is being explored in this paper, where the authors give an insight into the difficulties of deploying KM in an organisation that is characterised by its traditional \u2018rolebased\u2019culture and highly hierarchical management structure. Performing research in a commercial environment instantly highlights the need for practical outcomes. Danwood, like many companies that invest into research projects, want to see tangible business-term results. However, the benefits of KM are hard to demonstrate on such strict timescales, which would inherently result in a growing resistance by top-level management towards further investment. This paper suggests \u2018KM activities\u2019 should be labelled with terms that are relevant and conceivable by the organisation and progressively integrated with mission-critical business processes that will generate faster bottom-line results. The aim is to highlight KM as creditable for these benefits and secure future investment into an \u2018official\u2019KM scheme. The additional advantage of this approach is that it facilitates the need for a cautious, moderately paced adaptation of KM\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["376"]}

{"title": "Towards an approach for analysing the strategic alignment of software requirements using quantified goal graphs\n", "abstract": " Analysing the strategic alignment of software requirements primarily provides assurance to stakeholders that the software-to-be will add value to the organisation. Additionally, such analysis can improve a requirement by disambiguating its purpose and value, thereby supporting validation and value-oriented decisions in requirements engineering processes, such as prioritisation, release planning, and trade-off analysis. We review current approaches that could enable such an analysis. We focus on Goal Oriented Requirements Engineering methodologies, since goal graphs are well suited for relating software goals to business goals. However, we argue that unless the extent of goal-goal contribution is quantified with verifiable metrics, goal graphs are not sufficient for demonstrating the strategic alignment of software requirements. Since the concept of goal contribution is predictive, what results is a forecast of the benefits of implementing software requirements. Thus, we explore how the description of the contribution relationship can be enriched with concepts such as uncertainty and confidence, non-linear causation, and utility.

{"title": "A Case Study of the Adoption and Implementation of STEP\n", "abstract": " The widespread adoption and implementation of a standard is not always as successful as originally anticipated. Academics and practitioners who have devoted themselves to the development of these standards are often left asking why adoption and implementation falls short of expectations, despite evidence of the benefits of the standards. For example, a study commissioned by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) found that STEP, the'standard for the exchange of product model data'(ISO 10303), has the potential to save the automotive, aerospace and shipbuilding industries in the United States approximately $1 billion per year in interoperability costs (Brunnermeier and Martin 1999). A further study commissioned by NIST in 2002 found that STEP is conservatively estimated to be saving the transportation equipment manufacturing community over $150 million per year in mitigation and avoidance of interoperability costs, with the figure expected to rise to $700 million by 2010 (Gallaher et al. 2002). Despite these findings, Meister (2004), in his study of the development and implementation of STEP over 20 years, notes that,'while STEP is in use in companies around the world, its adoption has not been as widespread as initially expected'. An extensive review of the literature revealed that only two specific studies (Meister 2004 and Dreverman 2005) have assessed the factors that affect the adoption of ISO data-exchange standards like STEP.

This was a pilot exercise forming part of a larger exercise to evaluate the costs and benefits of using computers to help further communications throughout the company. The times taken to read, write and carry out other functions with email were measured for a sample of employees. The email content was also monitored to determine which emails were business related. It was found that nearly two thirds of all emails dealt with were non-business related at the start of the research, but this figure decreased exponentially to a consistent 43% towards the end of study. Overall the findings indicate that despite the fact that only one third of email use was business orientated, the time taken is still worthwhile compared with other traditional communication methods. However, it was not possible to fully quantify the benefits of email over these other methods, as the data for the alternatives has not yet been collected. The study showed that further research is necessary in this respect. The paper concludes that the analysis has been a useful learning experience for the company showing the value of cost-benefit research and highlighting the difficulties involved.

As a first step, a knowledge audit was carried out of the existing working systems, including a review of computerised information systems used by the company. This audit revealed that two independent systems had a significant overlap of functionality and data stored. A detailed examination of these systems showed that there were potential savings to be made by combining the systems so that they could share the data and some of the functionality. A design proposal was then put to the company to merge the two systems.The company accepted the proposal in principle, but it never approved the funding to carry out the necessary changes. This led the research team to carry out an in-depth review of their knowledge management implementation approach to discover where it had gone wrong. It was found that while the company management had recognised the inefficiency in their systems and they had accepted the suggested improvement, the initiative had failed as the company had not perceived they had any significant problem with the systems concerned and, therefore, the improvement was given the lowest priority. These systems performed adequately in that they delivered what they were required to do, even if it was not in the most efficient manner, whereas there were other areas of their business where there were problems that required more immediate attention. This meant that there was a lack of enthusiasm to even start the system merger project.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["376"]}

{"title": "Business needs driving IT decisions-using feature analysis and stakeholder evaluation in Rolls-Royce\n", "abstract": " This experience paper is a follow-on from an experience paper presented at last year\u2019s EASE conference which looked at the use of feature analysis to support strategic IT decision-making within an engineering support function in Rolls-Royce [1]. The feature analysis tool is exceedingly powerful and informative, particularly appreciated by senior managers. The graphical output enabled senior managers to make strategic decisions quickly and effectively. The tool was extended by the creation of different views of the business, of which the feature and system comparison view has been by far the most useful. The other views proved interesting, but did not ultimately have the impact of the feature and system comparison. Feature analysis is an informative and effective tool for managers and developers but is not complete in itself. A stakeholder analysis also proved extremely useful and powerful. It can concisely summarise who has influence and why. The analysis focussed thinking on how to manage the stakeholders. Feature analysis combined with stakeholder analysis proved to be particularly effective.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["376"]}

{"title": "12 steps to successful knowledge management implementation\n", "abstract": " Knowledge management initiatives often fail to live up to expectations and many result in  failure. Unfortunately, many knowledge management initiatives fail because they have been  introduced, simply because knowledge management has been recognised by senior management as  a \u201cgood thing\u201d and something their competitors are undertaking. This can lead to a knowledge  manager being appointed without any clear direction and knowledge management initiatives being  undertaken without any clear purpose or measurable target criteria.    To overcome these problems, a twelve step methodology for knowledge management implementation  is presented, illustrated with a series of small case studies. Starting from a problem audit, subsequent  steps ensure a baseline measure for improvement is identified, and a comprehensive, costed solution  to a recognised problem is designed which is capable of gaining buy-in from both management and  the system users. The system is designed with user involvement and must consider the operation of  the proposed system as well as the implementation. Subsequent to the implementation, a review  process involving the identification of measurable cost-benefits can become the basis for future  expansion and roll-out of knowledge management and can become the first steps in the building of a  comprehensive knowledge environment.    The case studies illustrate the value of each step in the methodology with examples of good and bad  practice drawn from the author\u2019s previously published experiences. This paper brings the lessons  from these case studies together to form the twelve step\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["376"]}

Some of these documents can be very large, which can make the retrieving of the knowledge difficult and time consuming. In large technical documents such as military standards, navigation through these documents is usually by traditional linear scrolling or the use of a hierarchical menu. These documents commonly contain semantic knowledge within their text that leads to non-traditional navigation. This non-traditional navigation is normally achieved through users jumping between sections.This pilot study has been conducted with BAE Systems. It uses the military standard known as the Tactical Data Link (TDL), Link 16 standard. This document is over 7000 pages, which highlights the potential problems that can be experienced in document navigation. Users of these large technical manuals are often searching for specific segments of knowledge from within the text. The text contains sections, which may or may not be amenable to semantic modelling.

The errors in the program are run time errors which are by their nature usually far harder to trace than errors that prevent the program compiling. One of the distinguishing features of C, compared with Pascal and most other procedural languages, is that with a little experience it is relatively easy to get a C program to compile. Programs in C tend to have a far higher proportion of run time errors than their equivalents written in other languages with the consequence that C programs can take more time and effort to debug.This section gives a check list for some of the more common C run time errors. It is certainly not a complete list but it may prove to be worthwhile checking to see whether a program has any of the errors given first before any more elaborate debugging techniques.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["376"]}

{"title": "What's in it for me?-Implementing Knowledge Management to Give Value for the Individual''\n", "abstract": " The implementations of Knowledge Management systems are often less successful than expected. After an initial period of enthusiasm, the use of many systems gradually declines until there is only a small core of users, or it may fall into disuse altogether. Often the problems occur when the principle knowledge providers realise they are putting a lot of effort into the system yet are getting very little back in return. This paper describes a case study in a computer company that provides hardware and software solutions for a wide variety of customers. The company was considering the implementation of a knowledge management system to capture the computer system configuration decisions made for each customer so that analysts could learn from each other and, in particular, new employees could benefit from the knowledge of their more experienced colleagues. On a company wide level, such a knowledge management system made sense and a business case for the design and implementation of the system was soon accepted. However, when research was carried out to examine the system from the perspective of each individual user, it soon became clear that there were differences between the needs of experienced knowledge providers and those of the inexperienced, would-be knowledge receivers, and the system proposed would not satisfy either very well. Following a survey and interviews with the users to determine the needs and working practices of individuals, a range of alternative solutions were proposed that would better satisfy the needs of all users yet, at the same time, was simpler and considerably easier to implement.

{"title": "GETTING THE BEST VALUE FROM THE INTRANET: A CASE STUDY\n", "abstract": " Many companies have established Intranets that offer their employees corporate wide information. This paper reviews the points needed for consideration when developing a successful site and how they are applied within an industrial environment. A case study was undertaken to develop a site for a small department within the Naval Marine business of Rolls-Royce with members located some 150 miles apart. It was established that published guidelines on site layout, style and support were accurate and useful but there is little published information on the information content for an intranet web. The information within the site needs to be useful to the users or the site will not be used, will become out of date and will loose credibility. By working closely with the users, a site was produced which met their information needs. This was confirmed with the use of a questionnaire, which collected their feedback on the site. The site\u2019s success may be due to the size of the user group, which was small and manageable. It is concluded that further research is required on this aspect.This paper establishes that a successful intranet requires careful planning and consultation with the users. Above all, to avoid failure it is important to ensure the information is relevant and maintainable. Rolls-Royce continue to take active steps to ensure its intranet sites are both usable, relevant and easily maintained, across all business groups.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["376"]}

{"title": "Managing Process Compliance With Standards\n", "abstract": " The current best practice of providing reliable systems is to embody the development process in recent industry safety standards and guidelines, such as IEC 61508. These standards generally define practices in terms of constraints. The degree of standards compliance can be established by checking the execution of essential activities against these constraints. However, every application is different because of the differences in project details. The lack of the ability to ensure that a process is planned and performed complying with a standard necessitates the improvements in the current workflow management systems (WfMS). Our Compliance Flow research project aims to provide support for handling complex, ad-hoc, dynamic changing, and collaborative engineering design process. This paper describes the use of an intelligent compliance agent, called Inspector, in Compliance Flow to ensure a standard complied process. The standards that the design process intended to be complied with are modelled into a model of standards using the Standard Modelling Language (SML)-we developed. The Inspector performs a number of matching processes between the model of standards and the development process to achieve the compliance. Some examples drawing on IEC 61508 are used to illustrate the mechanism of modelling and compliance checks.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["376"]}
