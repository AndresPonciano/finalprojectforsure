The software industry suffers from a plague of bugs on a near-biblical scale. One promising technique in alleviating this problem is the application of formal methods that provide a rigorous mathematical basis to software development. When correctly applied, formal methods produce systems of the highest integrity and thus are especially recommended for security- and safety-critical systems. Unfortunately, although projects based on formal methods are proliferating, the use of these methods is still more the exception than the rule, which results from many misconceptions regarding their costs, difficulties, and payoffs.

We consider not only effectiveness of some testing criterion in itself but a variance of effectiveness of different test sets satisfied the same testing criterion. We name this property \"tolerance\" of a testing criterion and show that, for practical using a criterion, a high tolerance is as well important as high effectiveness. The results of empirical evaluation of tolerance for different criteria, types of faults and decisions are presented. As well as quite simple and well-known control-flow criteria, we study more complicated criteria: full predicate coverage, modified condition/decision coverage and reinforced condition/decision coverage criteria.", "num_citations": "43\n", "authors": ["1594"]}

This new criterion has been developed from the well-known Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC) criterion and is more suitable for the testing of safety-critical software where MC/DC may not provide adequate assurance. As a formal language for describing the criteria, the Z notation has been selected. Formal definitions in the Z notation for RC/DC, as well as MC/DC and other criteria, are presented.

{"title": "A brief history of early museums online\n", "abstract": " BackgroundMuseums are in a unique position of both recording the history of human communication through networks and also using the medium to their own advantage. Fast communication of messages at long distance dates back much earlier than the Internet on which many people rely today. For example, at Masada in Israel, there are the remains of a two thousand year old columbarium tower or dovecot (see Figure 1) on the well-fortified hilltop, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which could have enabled communication with the outside world from this isolated outpost. During the Napoleonic Wars of the late 18 th and early 19 th century, in England a set of shutter telegraph links was set up from London to allow fast communication with the navy on the coast, as presented at the Royal Signals Museum (see Figure 2). Of course there was a delay as each relay station forwarded the message since line-of-sight viewing was necessary between each neighbouring location. Later in the 19 th century, optical communication techniques gave way to electrical communication in the form of the electrical telegraph, using cable connections and eventually via wireless signals (see Figure 3). This has been dubbed the \u2018Victorian Internet\u2019in the light of later developments (Standage, 1998).In the late 20 th century, telecommunications of all sorts became increasingly dominated by computer networks and specifically the Internet, which started as the ARPANET, originally in 1969 with four nodes in the US.

In the paper entitled Digitalism: the New Realism, the authors focus on how digital tools and technology have changed ways of doing, knowing, and being, while here we look at how today\u2019s digital landscape is changing ways of artistic expression, narration, communication, and human interaction. The growing use of digital tools and technology in the arts and culture is dramatically transforming traditional curatorial practice and by extension archival practice, so that we are moving from a gatekeeping model to an open model steeped in digital relationships across global networks and the Internet. As we immerse ourselves in the digital world, where anyone with a smartphone can be a digital curator and marshal a range of Internet services, such as Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and more specifically for example Behance (for online portfolios), artists are enabled to freely engage and interact with their audience using to their advantage crowdsourcing, \u201clikes\u201d, chat, blogs, games and email.

Based on the properties of Boolean specifications, the analysis identifies the detection conditions for six kinds of faults. The results allow the measurement of the effort required in testing and the effectiveness of generated test sets satisfying the MCDC and RCDC criteria.

Our approach is to derive the denotational semantics from the algebraic semantics. We first present the algebraic laws for Verilog. Every program can be expressed as a guarded choice that can model the execution of a program. In order to investigate the parallel expansion laws, a sequence is introduced, indicating which instantaneous action is due to which exact parallel component. A head normal form is defined for each program by using a locality sequence. We provide a strategy for deriving the denotational semantics based on head normal form. Using this strategy, the denotational semantics for every program can be calculated.

The generated code is standard ANSI C and isplug compatible'with LEX-generated lexical analysers prepared for YACC. In contrast to YACC, however, the generated code is modular and thus allows parts of scripts to be compiled separately and linked in incrementally. But it remains e cient in practice, and the generated code has run as fast or faster than YACC-generated code in trials with real programming language specifications.", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["1594"]}

So far, science museums have yet to tap into this potential to any great extent, partly due to the relative newness of the technology involved and partly due to the expense.

It is hoped that this will be helpful to science museums and centers that are considering the addition of personalization features to their own Web site. Currently, Web site personalization should be used with caution, but larger organizations should be considering the potential if they have not already started to do so.", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["1594"]}
{"title": "Experimental evaluation of the tolerance for control-flow test criteria\n", "abstract": " Fault\u2010detection effectiveness of coverage criteria has remained one of the controversial issues in recent years. In order to detect a fault, a test set must execute the faulty statement, cause infection of the data state and then propagate the faulty data state to bring about a failure. This paper sheds some light on the earlier contradictory results by investigating the infection aspect of coverage criteria. For a given test criterion, the number of test sets satisfying the criterion may be very large, with varying fault\u2010detection effectiveness. In a recent work the measure of variation in effectiveness of a test criterion was defined as \u2018tolerance\u2019. This paper presents an experimental evaluation of tolerance for control\u2010flow test criteria by exhaustive test set generation, wherever possible. The approach used here is complementary to earlier empirical studies that adopted analysis of some test sets using random selection techniques\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["1594"]}

In this paper, we consider the inverse work, deriving the operational semantics and denotational semantics from algebraic semantics for BPEL. In our model, we introduce four types of typical programs, by which every program can be expressed as the summation of these four types. Based on the algebraic semantics, the strategy for deriving the operational semantics is provided and a transition system is derived by strict proof.

{"title": "PTSC: Probability, time and shared-variable concurrency\n", "abstract": " Complex software systems typically involve features like time, concurrency and probability, where probabilistic computations play an increasing role. It is challenging to formalize languages comprising all these features. In this paper, we integrate probability, time and concurrency in one single model, where the concurrency feature is modelled using shared-variable-based communication. The probability feature is represented by a probabilistic nondeterministic choice, probabilistic guarded choice and a probabilistic version of parallel composition. We formalize an operational semantics for such an integration. Based on this model we define a bisimulation relation, from which an observational equivalence between probabilistic programs is investigated and a collection of algebraic laws are explored. We also implement a prototype of the operational semantics to animate the execution of probabilistic programs.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["1594"]}
{"title": "Semantics of RTL and validation of synthesized RTL designs using formal verification in reconfigurable computing systems\n", "abstract": " The functional validation of a state-of-the-art reconfigurable computing system design is usually a laborious, ad hoc and open-ended task. It can be accomplished through two basic approaches: simulation and formal verification. In validation using a formal verification approach, it attempts to establish that the register transfer level (RTL) design synthesized from the algorithmic behavioral specification is mathematically correct. Therefore, finding the verification methods to provide accurate and fast validation easily would be very useful. In this paper, we develop a semantics based on a partial order based model (POM) for RTL and, through this semantics, propose a formal verification method to prove the correctness of the RTL synthesis result. This method can be used to achieve the following. On one hand, it can accurately verify an RTL description with respect to a behavioral specification of the system; on the other\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["1594"]}

A more comprehensive entry could include further, more detailed information on the museum's history, collections, organization, one or more photographs, etc. It should be noted that Wikipedia entries are intended to provide an independent and informational view, so direct promotional material should be avoided and used only on the museum's own Web site. An entry on Wikipedia can help by improving search engine rankings (especially Google), directing Web users to a museum Web site, etc.Our demonstration at MW2006 is intended to give advice to museums on how to create an initial Wikipedia entry if there is none for the museum in question and how to improve the entry if one exists already.

One of the main difficulties faced in practice is due to the large number of mutants that can be generated for a given implementation. Earlier research to solve this problem has suggested variants of mutation testing, and finding an effective set of mutation operators. This paper presents an alternative approach for reducing the cost of testing by the identification of hierarchies among first-order mutants. The theory described here is also applicable to the quantitative assessment of testing effort and can be used to guide successive testing steps in fault-based testing.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1594"]}

They cannot operate simultaneously. However, if somehow the final FPGA location can be determined at runtime, one or both of these overlapping configurations can be relocated to a new location that was previously unused to allow for simultaneous use. The configurations can be relocated by either rotation or shifting in an FPGA fabric. In this paper, our research has shown that the relocating configurations can be specified and reasoned formally by algebraic laws for checking whether a chip of given size and a given feasible schedule allow a feasible placement. Our examination is done on a generic partially reconfigurable FPGA and Ruby algebra is used to specify and reason in this case.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1594"]}

The grammar has also been used as a basis for grammars aimed at other compiler-compilers, including yacc and PCCTS. The important goal in publishing it here is to make the accepted ZRM grammar for Z publicly available in concrete form and thus to promote the production of Z-based utilities. The formalization has been tested by interpreting it standardly 1) in PRECC as a parse-tree builder, and, more abstractly, 2) as a generator of its valid phrases. In the non-standard configuration it has generated a suite of test expressions for the standard parser and some examples from that test suite are provided here. The first of these has a rigorous claim to the title of most trivial non-trivial Z specification possible, but all are good tests for any parser of Z.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1594"]}

Issues which were important when hardware resources were more scarce are now less critical. Precc is a new compiler-compiler tool that is much more versatile than yacc, whilst retaining efficiency of operation on modern computers. It copes with the context-dependent BNF grammar descriptions and higher order meta constructions that are naturally encountered in semi-formal concrete syntax specifications, building fast and efficient infinite-lookahead tools in the form of ANSI-compliant C code. This paper provides a demonstration of this state-of-the-art compiler-compiler technology using the programming language occam as an example. The parsing of occam is particularly difficult compared to some programming languages since the indentation is an integral part of the language. However the precc tool allows a natural implementation of an occam parser that follows the syntax very closely.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1594"]}

A stream representation allows the use of coinductive principles in stream calculus. In particular, using the coinductive proof principle, we show that behavioral stream functions in the three-stage synthesis process (scheduling, register allocation and binding, allocation and binding of functional units) are always bisimilar regardless of changes in a scheduling\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1594"]}

The use of formal regulatory requirements could help to eliminate ambiguity or misunderstanding of informal definitions, to allow rigorous assessment of satisfaction with respect to requirements and finally to increase the safety level of a system.

Distributed systems can offer greater adaptability. Their nature forces them to be designed in a modular way and this can be used to advantage to allow incremental (and possibly dynamic) changes in performance and functionality by the addition or removal of elements. The performance of distributed systems can be made much better than that of centralized systems and with the fall in the price of microprocessors can also be very much cheaper. However, this performance gain is usually manifested in the form of greater capacity rather than response. Increasing the latter is currently limited by our ability to make use of parallelism, which is mainly a software problem, and will probably see more progress in the area of tightly coupled systems.

{"title": "Online communities: Visualization and formalization\n", "abstract": " Online communities have increased in size and importance dramatically over the last decade. The fact that many communities are online means that it is possible to extract information about these communities and the connections between their members much more easily using software tools, despite their potentially very large size. The links between members of the community can be presented visually and often this can make patterns in the structure of sub-communities immediately obvious. The links and structures of layered communities can also be formalized to gain a better understanding of their modelling. This paper explores these links with some specific examples, including visualization of these relationships and a formalized model of communities using the Z notation. It also considers the development of such communities within the Community of Practice social science framework. Such approaches may be applicable for communities associated with cybersecurity and could be combined for a better understanding of their development.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1594"]}

When the sequence of reconfigurations to be performed is not predictable, resource allocation decisions have to be made on-line. Dynamical reconfiguration can be necessary to relocate a running physical configuration, and to rearrange the logic resources into the variety of physical portions. Our proposed algorithm is formally developed to enable implementing an on-line management of FPGA logic resources, supporting the rearrangement of running functions, releasing enough contiguous space for configuration of new incoming functions, and performing the defragmentation in a way completely transparent to the applications currently running.

It is challenging to formalize languages comprising all these features. In this paper, we integrate probability, time and concurrency in one single model, where the concurrency feature is modelled using shared-variable based communication. The probability feature is represented by a probabilistic nondeterministic choice, probabilistic guarded choice and a probabilistic version of parallel composition. We formalize an operational semantics for such an integration. Based on this model we define a bisimulation relation, from which an observational equivalence between probabilistic programs is investigated and a collection of algebraic laws are explored. We also implement a prototype of the operational semantics to animate the execution of probabilistic programs", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1594"]}

The main sessions were held on Wednesday and Thursday, 29th and 30th June, and were followed by a half-day session on educational issues of formal methods, held in the 12th century School of Pythagoras on the morning of July 1st. This provided an opportunity for educators and industrialists to discuss their ideas on the teaching of formal methods in general, and Z in particular. Four full papers were presented, and there were a number of poster displays. Fortuitously, the location and timing of the meeting added a historical flavour to the event. Forty-five years previously to the week, the first ever European conference on computer science was held in Cambridge, in which the early EDSAC computer, designed and constructed by Prof. Maurice V.

This is the same in museums; there are some tools available to help people select what they want to see such as maps, brochures, etc. Just as in a real museum, where maps and brochures help people organize their visit, search engines support the user in their navigation on the Web by assisting them in finding the most relevant material, while ignoring the rest. The Web is a unique\" museum\" where there are all sorts of data, including multimedia objects, so it is particularly crucial to respect the potentially different attitudes of users that may have various interests and different perspectives.(This is once again the same in museums.) The role of search engines is particularly problematic because they have to guarantee the efficiency of the service without betraying the multiplicity of users' purposes. The aim of this paper is to show the result of testing the difficulty of access to useful museum-related resources that are not very well known, but contain relevant information when search engines and other query techniques are used. We will show that many museum Web sites and databases belong to the hidden part of the Web that is not accessible unless the precise URL is known.
