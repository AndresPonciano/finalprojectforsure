{"title": "Crowdfunding creative ideas: The dynamics of project backers\n", "abstract": " Entrepreneurs are turning to crowdfunding as a way to finance their creative ideas. Crowdfunding involves relatively small contributions of many consumer-investors over a fixed time period (generally a few weeks). The purpose of this chapter is to add to our empirical understanding of backer dynamics over the project-funding cycle. Publicly available data of two years on projects listed on Kickstarter are used to establish that the typical pattern of project support is U-shaped\u2014in general, backers are more likely to contribute to a project in the first and last weeks as compared to the middle period of the funding cycle. We further establish that this U-shaped pattern of support is pervasive across projects, including both successfully and unsuccessfully funded projects, those with large and small goals, and projects in different categories. We then empirically explore the dynamics associated with several factors\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1134\n", "authors": ["2085"]}
{"title": "Crowdsourcing new product ideas over time: An analysis of the Dell IdeaStorm community\n", "abstract": " Several organizations have developed ongoing crowdsourcing communities that repeatedly collect ideas for new products and services from a large, dispersed \u201ccrowd\u201d of nonexperts (consumers) over time. Despite its promises, little is known about the nature of an individual's ideation efforts in such an online community. Studying Dell's IdeaStorm community, serial ideators are found to be more likely than consumers with only one idea to generate an idea the organization finds valuable enough to implement, but they are unlikely to repeat their early success once their ideas are implemented. As ideators with past success attempt to again come up with ideas that will excite the organization, they instead end up proposing ideas similar to their ideas that were already implemented (i.e., they generate less diverse ideas). The negative effects of past success are somewhat mitigated for ideators with diverse commenting\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1026\n", "authors": ["2085"]}

To do this, the authors analyze cross-sectional data from a household panel using a structural equation modeling approach. They also test for potential moderating effects using a two-stage least square estimation procedure. They find that the personal characteristics of age and income are stronger predictors of newproduct ownership in the consumer electronics category than innate consumer innovativeness as a generalized personality trait. The authors also find that personal characteristics neither influence innate consumer innovativeness nor moderate the relationship between innate consumer innovativeness and new-product adoption behavior.", "num_citations": "854\n", "authors": ["2085"]}
{"title": "Network effects and competition: An empirical analysis of the home video game industry\n", "abstract": " Building on the resource\u2010based view of the firm, we advance the idea that a firm's customer network can be a strategic asset. We suggest that network effects are a function of network size (i.e., installed customer base) and network strength (i.e., the marginal impact of a unit increase in network size on demand). We empirically study these network effects in the 16\u2010bit home video game industry in which the dominant competitors were Nintendo and Sega. In the spirit of the new empirical IO framework, we estimate a structural econometric model assuming the data are equilibrium outcomes of the best fitting noncooperative game in price and advertising. After controlling for other effects, we find strong evidence that network effects are asymmetric between the competitors in the home video game industry. Specifically, we find that the firm with a smaller customer network (Nintendo) has higher network strength than the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "597\n", "authors": ["2085"]}
{"title": "The market evolution and sales takeoff of product innovations\n", "abstract": " In contrast to the prevailing supply-side explanation that price decreases are the key driver of a sales takeoff, we argue that outward shifting supply and demand curves lead to market takeoff. Our fundamental idea is that sales in new markets are initially low because the first commercialized forms of new innovations are primitive. Then, as new firms enter, actual and perceived product quality improves (and prices possibly drop), which leads to a takeoff in sales. To provide empirical evidence for this explanation, we explore the relationship between takeoff times, price decreases, and firm entry for a sample of consumer and industrial product innovations commercialized in the United States over the past 150 years. Based on a proportional hazards analysis of takeoff times, we find that new firm entry dominates other factors in explaining observed sales takeoff times. We interpret these results as supporting the idea that\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "519\n", "authors": ["2085"]}

Given its prevalence in practice, understanding the determinants and implications of firm proliferation strategies clearly has important managerial relevance. Previous theoretical research has identified three primary effects of a proliferation strategy: (1) a broad product line can increase the overall demand faced by the firm, (2) a broad product line can affect supply by increasing costs, and (3) broad product lines can have strategic consequences (e.g., long product lines can deter entry, thereby allowing an incumbent firm to raise prices). However, despite the theoretical interest in this common business practice, there has been very little empirical research on this topic.

{"title": "The financial rewards of new product introductions in the personal computer industry\n", "abstract": " Based on data from firms in the personal computer industry, we study the effect of new product introductions on three key drivers of firm value: profit rate, profit-rate persistence, and firm size as reflected in asset growth. Consistent with our theoretical development, we find that new product introductions influence profit rate and size; however, we find no effect on profit-rate persistence. Interestingly, we also find that the effect of new product introductions on profit rate stems from a reduction in selling and general administrative expenditure intensity rather than through an increase in gross operating return. Notably, firms decrease their advertising intensity in the wake of a new product introduction. Firm profitability in this industry apparently benefits from new product introductions because new products need less marketing support than older products.", "num_citations": "360\n", "authors": ["2085"]}
{"title": "Does my contribution to your crowdfunding project matter?\n", "abstract": " In this study, we consider the dynamics of crowdfunding project support over time. We propose that people support crowdfunding projects financially when they believe that their contribution will make an impact. Because perceptions of impact are positively related to goal proximity, we predict that support for a crowdfunding project will increase as the project funding approaches its target goal. In addition, because motivation decreases after a goal is attained, we further predict that crowdfunding contributions will significantly decrease after the target goal is reached. We find strong support for these hypotheses from a large-scale field study involving Kickstarter. Furthermore, we show that several factors related to the expected impact moderate the effects of goal proximity; that is, the positive effect of goal proximity on project support is accentuated if the project is nearing its funding deadline, if the target goal is relatively\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "344\n", "authors": ["2085"]}

Situations in which the duopolists are symmetric as well as asymmetric in terms of their estimates of market size and product development capabilities are considered. When firms are symmetric, the authors show that an equilibrium exists when the firms enter at different times with different performance levels. In the asymmetric cases, the firm that has a higher estimate of market size enters first, as does the firm with a\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "282\n", "authors": ["2085"]}
{"title": "The role of pre-entry experience, entry timing, and product technology strategies in explaining firm survival\n", "abstract": " Studying the U.S. personal computer industry from its inception in 1974 through 1994, we address the following questions. What product technology strategies increase the survival chances of entrants into new, technologically dynamic industries? Does the effectiveness of these strategies differ by pre-entry experience? Does the effectiveness of these strategies differ by when firms enter a new industry? Consistent with the published literature, we find that diversifying entrants have an initial survival advantage over entrepreneurial startups. But, we find the reverse for later entrants: startups that enter later in the industry have a survival advantage over the later entering diversifying entrants. We explain this finding in terms of the firms' product technology strategies (i.e., offering products based on the technology standard and products incorporating the latest technology), pre-entry experience, and entry timing.

However, very limited empirical information on this topic is available. In this paper, product lifetimes are directly measured as the time between product introduction and withdrawal. Statistical analyses of desktop personal computer models introduced between 1974 and 1992 are conducted at various product market levels. Results indicate that (1) product technology and product model lifetimes have not accelerated, and (2) manufacturers have not systematically reduced the life-cycles of products within their lines. Instead, the products of firms that have entered this industry in the more recent years tend to be based on previously existing technology, and, not surprisingly, these products have lifetimes that are shorter than those of established firms.

The possible predatory and anticompetitive implications of this behavior recently surfaced in the antitrust case United States v. Microsoft Corporation. Taking the perspective that a new product announcement is a strategic signal among firms, the authors consider the possibility that intentional vaporware is a way to dissuade competitors from developing similar new products. An examination of empirical data for the software industry suggests that some firms use vaporware in a strategic manner. The authors then formulate and analyze the preannouncement and introduction timing decisions in a game-theoretic model of two competing firms. They find that vaporware can be a way for a dominant firm to signal its product development costs and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "243\n", "authors": ["2085"]}

Results based on univariate and multivariate analyses of replacement buyers of new automobiles indicate that \u201cearly\u201d replacement buyers are more concerned with styling and image and less concerned with costs than \u201clate\u201d replacement buyers. Further, early replacers have higher income, but lower levels of educational achievement and occupational status, than late replacers. Late replacers engage in more search activity.

Comparable efforts with consumer durable goods, however, are generally absent. This paper presents an application of the brand switching model proposed by Colombo and Morrison (1989) to a set of four major home appliances. Appliance brand loyalty, however, is shown to be a function of the timing of replacements, a factor that has not entered into the modelling of packed goods. As a result, the brand switching matrices are analyzed over the replacement cycle. This application illustrates how a brand switching analysis can be used to assess the relative competitive position of a firm in terms of the primary customer sources that a brand attracts.", "num_citations": "165\n", "authors": ["2085"]}

We explicitly model market demand uncertainty, a firm's internal cost structure, and competition, using an infinite-horizon Markov decision process. Based on a large-scale numerical analysis, we find that more frequent new-product introductions are optimal under faster clockspeed conditions. In addition, we find that a firm's optimal product-quality decision is governed by a firm's relative costs of introducing new products with incremental versus more substantial improvements. We show that a time-pacing product introduction strategy results in a production policy with a simple base-stock form and performs well relative to the optimal policy.

This paper presents an alternative rationale based on the buying behavior for products with overlapping replacement cycles (i.e., next generation products). A model for consumer sales of a new durable is developed by incorporating the replacement behavior of a previous generation product. Pricing strategies for two product generations are investigated analytically and with numerical methods. Results indicate that durable replacement behavior leads to a wider set of optimal pricing strategies than previously obtained.
