This paper presents the design and implementation of an architecture for resource management in a hosting center operating system, with an emphasis on energy as a driving resource management issue for large server clusters.

A key challenge for these systems is to provision shared resources on demand to meet service quality targets at least cost. This paper presents a new approach to utility resource management focusing on coordinated provisioning of memory and storage resources. Our approach is model-based: it incorporates internal models of service behavior to predict the value of candidate resource allotments under changing load. The model-based approach enables the system to achieve important resource management goals, including differentiated service quality, performance isolation, storageaware caching, and proactive allocation of surplus resources to meet performance goals.

{"title": "The vigilance task and the measurement of attentional deficits\n", "abstract": " Jerison (1967) and other investigators (J. Mackworth, 1970; Bakan, 1966) have contended that certain critical questions about the nature of attention could best be studied by utilizing a vigi-lance paradigm. Jane Mackworth (1970) summarized the literature in which the vigilance task allowed investigation of the physiological-psychological parameters of human attention. Excellent examples of this approach to the study of attention are provided by her work which related vigilance to habituation and levels of arousal, and by the work of Kaider, Spong, and Lindsley (1964) which related vigilance performance to evoked cortical potentials. Norman Mackworth (1950) foresaw the discovery of a relation-ship between attention and vigilance when he observed the simi-larity between monitoring failure and failures of alertness in patients with brain damage. The term \u201cvigilance\u201d was adopted to describe his research primarily because it was the term in current vogue among British neurologists at that time to characterize the dimension of behavior involving arousal and activation. Mackworth applied the term \u201cvigilance\u201d to that dimension of behavior critical to the missing of signals by radar observers. A result of his work was the development of the Mackworth Clock Test (Mackworth, 1950), a vigilance task which simulated the attentiondemanding features of the radar system monitored by the observer. In current vigilance research, the typical vigilance experiment is structurally indistinguishable from many detection or discrimi-", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1925"]}

A monitor is coupled to the model table and programmed both to model resource consumption in a service providing infrastructure, and also to store the modeled resource consumption in the model table. A router is coupled to the model table, and the router is programmed to route each service request to a corresponding service instance disposed in an associated service host having a service providing infrastructure. The associated service host includes a grid host in a grid computing system.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1925"]}
{"title": "Optimizing greenness\n", "abstract": " A greenness metric is obtained for a plurality of services. The greenness metric of each of the plurality of services are compared. One or more services are determined from the plurality of services based at least in part upon the greenness metric for each of the plurality of services.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1925"]}
{"title": "Enforcement of service terms through adaptive edge processing of application data\n", "abstract": " An adaptive data replication and caching system configured to enforce service terms at the network edge. Service terms can include, but are not limited to established quality of service (QoS) terms, as well as the terms of a service level agreement (SLA). This system can include a data caching system configured to cache application data in a data store and to satisfy queries for application data from the cache. The system also can include a data replication system configured to replicate application data in the data store and to satisfy queries for application data against the replicated application data. Finally, the adaptive data replication and caching system can include a configurator for configuring portions of the data store for exclusive use by the data caching system and the data replication system based upon the service terms.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1925"]}
{"title": "Hierarchical load balancing\n", "abstract": " Popular object requests are handled using a front-end cache, and hashing is applied only to the requests in the stream that were not handled by the front-end cache. A cache (eg, a web proxy cache) is placed in front of a Level 7 switch and services the popular requests from the cache based on the content of the request (eg, based on the portion of an HTTP request following the domain name). The remaining requests are hashed and then routed to the back-end server. Requests that make it past the cache are still routed to the back-end server. A Level 4 switch is placed in front of a plurality of web proxy caches, each of which are in turn placed in front of a respective Level 7 switch, each of which are connected to a respective server farm, so that incoming web requests are handled on a round robin basis (or other SLB technique) before being sent to the cache.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1925"]}
{"title": "Transition between manual management and autonomic management of autonomic systems\n", "abstract": " A method for the autonomic management of autonomic systems can include monitoring a managed system and recommending a course of action to be performed in the managed system. It can be determined whether the recommended course of action has been performed by an administrator. Responsive to the determination, it further can be determined whether an outcome from the course of action comports with a predicted outcome. If so, a point count can be changed responsive to a further determination that the outcome from the course of action comports with the predicted outcome. Conversely, the point count can be oppositely changed responsive to a further determination that the outcome from the course of action does not comports with the predicted outcome. In any case, when the point count crosses a threshold value, the management of the managed system can be transitioned to an adaptive component.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1925"]}
