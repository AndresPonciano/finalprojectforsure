Recently, LIM mineralization protein-1 (LMP-1) was reported to be an essential positive regulator of osteoblast differentiation. In the present study, we found that the expression of LMP-1 is downregulated in OS tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Moreover, we restored the expression of LMP-1 through a recombinant adenovirus. Overexpression of LMP-1 inhibited cell proliferation and invasion, arrested cell cycle progression, and induced apoptosis in vitro. Finally, ectopic LMP-1 expression suppressed the expression of Runx2 and BMP-2 in OS cells.

{"title": "The application of Montreal classification in inflammatory bowel disease\n", "abstract": " OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical features of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) according to the Montreal classification. METHODS: The clinical data of 110 cases of CD or UC were reviewed. The age at diagnosis, location and clinical behavior were assessed with the Montreal criteria. RESULTS: CD patients diagnosed at an age younger than 16 years were rare (3.6%), the majority of the CD patients was diagnosed at 17-40 years old (65.5%). Although ileocolon lesions were most common in the patients diagnosed at 17-40 years old (37.3%), yet ileum lesions were a little more than those of other parts of digestive tract in the patients diagnosed after 40 years old (14.5%), the difference was not significant (P= 0.054). Stricture frequently occurred (50.4%), especially when the lesions were located at ileum or ileocolon. Perforation rarely happened (5.3%). There was no significant difference between different location groups for clinical behaviors (P= 0.096). The incidence of stricture or perforation was almost same among different age groups (P= 0.984). UC patients mostly presented with mild or moderate symptoms even in the group with extensive lesion. UC patients with severe symptoms were rare (6.8%). There was no significant difference in severity between the groups with different extent of lesion (P= 0.056). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of CD patients was diagnosed at 17-40 years old. Stricture is much more than perforation, penetrating, occurring mostly at ileum.

Under adjusting the amount of zinc acetate, the synthesized porous ZnO nanofibers show various structures (fiber, tube, and fiber-in-tube). And the formation mechanism was discussed in detail. These porous ZnO samples show the uniform structure about 200 to 300 nm in diameter and several microns in length. All the fibers are composed of many ZnO nanoparticles (20\u201330 nm) that assemble to form the porous structure and induce the large surface area and high pore volume of the sample. These porous ZnO nanofibers were configured as high performance sensors for acetone sensing, showing high sensitivity (S = 243.3 at 500 ppm), low detection limit (10 ppm), fast response/ recovery (7/17 s), and very good selectivity.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["26"]}
{"title": "The study of open source software collaborative user model based on social network and tag similarity\n", "abstract": " Open source software (OSS) has become a mainstream in software development, utilizing a global information infrastructure. OSS is a complicated social process to understand. OSS is a multi-faceted phenomenon including code, a licensing structure, a community, development best practices, a method of diffusion. However, the current OSS collaborative researches place too much emphasis on collaborative behaviors, but ignore the study on collaborative process. By using the social network theory to abstract collaborative network topology, this paper proposes a method for constructing social network model, which considers both the contact relationship and level of collaboration between collaborators. Based on the definition of three types of contact behavior, this paper presents an approach to measuring the contact relationship intensity. Based on introducing and improving TF-IDF (term frequency\u2013inverse document frequency), this paper presents the methods for calculating tag weights and work similarity between collaborators. Finally, by evaluating the model using data from the OSS website www. Codeplex. com, we verify that our model outperforms conventional models in both describing and forecasting collaborative behavior.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["26"]}

RESULTS: Three hundred forty-four post-transplantation diabetes mellitus patients from 1872 ones after kidney grafting were found from February 1984 to December 2006. The prevalence of new onset posttransplant diabetes mellitus and impaired fasting glucose in kidney allograft recipients were 18.4% and 12.7% respectively, being significantly higher than that in general population and other inpatients. The options of immunosuppressants were significantly associated with the prevalence of post-transplantation diabetes mellitus. By multivariate logistic regression analysis, the baseline characteristics of the post transplantation diabetes mellitus patients were significantly associated with increased age (OR: 1.309, P= 0.049), elevated level of the triglyceride (OR: 1.311, P= 0.005), treatment with tacrolimus (FK506)(OR: 1.522, P= 0.008), and large dose of intravenous pulsed prednisolone (OR: 1.239, P= 0.011), as compared with patients without post-transplantation diabetes mellitus. Besides, the number of patients with at least one acute rejection episode was significantly greater in the post-transplantation diabetic patients. Mycophenolate mofetil (OR: 0.716, P= 0.028) and diltiazem (OR: 0.737, P= 0.015) were associated with lower risk of post-transplantation diabetes mellitus.

Past studies have shown that exploiting a flattened structure with auxiliary information extracted from the source catalog can improve the integration results. Although earlier studies have also shown that exploiting a hierarchical structure in classification may bring better advantages, the effectiveness has not been testified in catalog integration. In this paper, we propose an enhanced catalog integration (ECI) approach to extract the conceptual relationships from the hierarchical Web thesaurus and further improve the accuracy of Web catalog integration.

{"title": "Iterative MLSE for MIMO underwater acoustic channels\n", "abstract": " Multi-input multi-output (MIMO) is an attractive solution to high data rate underwater acoustic communications (UAC) with limited bandwidth. However, the long delay spread characteristic of UAC channels makes the equalization challenging for those MIMO schemes. Although maximum likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) is known to be optimum and is intensively used in many terrestrial wireless applications, it is not applicable for UAC channels since the computational complexity of MLSE increases exponentially with the number of channel taps. This paper presents an iterative reduced state MLSE scheme for MIMO UAC by taking advantage of the inherent line-of-sight feature of UAC channels. The proposed scheme spans the MLSE state space only from the dominant UAC channel taps and iteratively eliminates the residual inter-symbol interference (ISI) caused by the weak taps.

{"title": "Experimental reduction of acoustic noise through cancellation of impulsive forces\n", "abstract": " Background and Motivation A simple spring model has been used previously [1] to motivate and demonstrate an MRI acoustic noise cancellation mechanism that utilizes modifications of the gradient pulse sequence. The general idea is to create a follow-up impulsive force to cancel the vibration set up by an initial impulsive force. A more realistic model for impulsive forces is the forced damped vibrating string, which provides a physical basis for the experimental suppression of certain frequencies through the optimized variation of the length of a trapezoidal pulse (this experimental suppression has been noticed previously in [2]), and which is an embodiment of a general linear response description for the experiment (the relevance to a time-stationary linear system has been noted in [3]). The string model has been suggested previously [4] to describe the dominant frequency for the longitudinal and transverse gradient vibrational modes. Since the gradient vibrational frequency spectrum (ie, the gradient frequency response function) is rich and broad with a number of important frequency peaks, the important question is the degree to which a sufficient number of these peaks can be suppressed so as to lead to noticeably less noise for the MRI patient.Methods and Model Guidelines Using the forced damped string model as a guide, successive convolutions of boxcars are seen to lead to a pattern of additional zeros in the frequency spectrum. The pattern corresponds to the interference between the respective force impulses associated with turning the gradient on and off. With the appropriate timings, a boxcar can kill one frequency (and its harmonics\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["26"]}

{"title": "Cross corner effect in rectangular magnetron sputtering: experiments and monte carlo simulation.\n", "abstract": " In the rectangular magnetron sputtering used for large area deposition, anomalous erosion usually occurs at the boundary of the straight and the curved section, causing negative effect on uniformity of the deposited film and the utilization of target material. This anomalous erosion is commonly referred to as cross corner effect. It is usually thought to be mainly caused by the weaker magnetic field at the curved section. However our further experiments indicate that the different radius at which the magnetic field line is tangent to the cathode surface will also contribute to the nonuniformity. In this paper, a Monte Carlo method is used to investigate the origin of the effect. By adjusting the magnetic field, a series of electron trajectories are simulated. It is found that the high-energy electrons tend to drift faster under weaker magnetic field or larger radius.

{"title": "A MODEL FOR BACK PAIN PREDICTION AND MITIGATION IN MILITARY PILOTS AND VEHICLE OCCUPANTS\n", "abstract": " INTRODUCTION: Low back pain while piloting military air vehicles is a significant operational and health problem. Seating, task posture and vibration are major lumbar pain contributors. Asymptomatic pilots start to experience pain and repeated painful episodes lead to pain sensitization and chronic pain. Pilot readiness is reduced and operational availability affected. Modeling can improve crew station design, seating, procedures, and training to enhance pilot operational performance and health. METHODS: Pain events were identified and classified using reported pain sources and mechanisms. Pain mechanism models were identified using nociception and pain theories. Human model complexity requirements were determined using operational helicopter crew station, flight equipment and mission stressors. Model component linkage methods were identified to form an integrated model. The resulting model contained biomechanical, muscle metabolic and pain predictive components. A musculoskeletal back model with a reduced order lumbar functional spinal unit (FSU) model was linked to a muscle metabolic model to predict spinal loading, back muscle activation and fatigue and metabolic species production. Pain prediction methods employed subjective and computational methods. Empirically-derived subjective pain response to muscle metabolites and damage chemical species was combined with Hodgkin-Huxley and Gate Control theory models to predict mechanical strain or metabolic and damage chemical species pain response.

Recent experimental studies also suggested the presence of remarkable interplay among the Fe-vacancy order and the antiferromagnetic structure[2]. Here we demonstrate that the well-characterized superconducting KxFe2-ySe2 (0.6 {\\leg} x {\\leg} 0.8, 0.2 {\\leg} x {\\leg} 0.3) samples contain complex microstructure features and undergo successive phase transitions at low temperatures. In-situ TEM observations on a number of the KxFe2-ySe2 superconductors demonstrated the presence of a remarkable collapse of the Fe-vacancy order above the superconducting transition, as a result, the superconducting phase actually adopts a tetragonal structure without the Fe-vacancy ordering. Moreover, our analysis at the low temperatures suggests that the superconductors likely adopt a Fe-deficient structure with composition of K0.75Fe2-ySe2. These results are important not only for the further optimization of superconducting phase in present system but also for understanding the mechanism of the Fe-based superconductivity.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["26"]}

{"title": "Extensions for Integrated Queries on Heterogeneous Semantic Web Resources\n", "abstract": " Semantic Web query languages are designed to carry out the machine understandability of the semantic Web. However, most popular semantic Web query languages are separately designed for two incompatible semantic Web frameworks, the resource description framework (RDF) and topic maps (TM). Due to the absence of cross-framework query support, the interoperations between RDF and TM resources cannot be achieved seamlessly. In this paper, we propose extensions on a popular RDF query language, SPARQL, to help RDF users inquire the TM resources.With the SPARQL-X extensions, TM resources can be interoperated in a usual RDF-like triple format. Furthermore, the challenges of querying resources from different frameworks and the corresponding design issues are discussed. Some use cases of using SPARQL-X to query XML Topic Maps (XTM) resources are also presented in comparison with\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["26"]}
{"title": "Acoustic noise reduction through pulse sequence design: timings, eddy-currents, fMRI\n", "abstract": " Background and Methods: Guided by both spring and string ideas [1-3], we have previously investigated the manner in which sets of vibrational frequencies can be canceled by the appropriately designed gradient pulse. A picture of the cancellation of vibrations produced with a Lorentz impulsive force by an \u201canti-impulsive\u201d follow-up force has emerged. This also provided a physical understanding of the oscillatory behavior observed in [4, 5] and showed the utility of studying the dominant frequencies in a string model [6] of the gradient system. The method suggests that properly designed sets of timings for the gradient pulse sequence can be used to attenuate important contributions to the acoustic spectrum. Successive convolutions of boxcars lead to a pattern of additional zeros in the frequency spectrum [3, 7]. With the appropriate timings, a boxcar can kill one frequency (and its harmonics), a trapezoid can kill two different frequencies, and the convolution of each additional boxcar with the original pulse can be used to cancel out one more frequency. The output acoustic power spectrum is P (\u03c9)=| X (\u03c9) H (\u03c9)| 2, which shows a direct relation between the output acoustic noise power spectrum and the gradient pulse spectrum.Experimental Results and Discussion: We have analyzed in more detail the results from experiments performed on a 1.5 T Siemens Espree system. Comparisons with our theoretical predictions are made for all measurements. For both scanners, acoustic noise from z gradient pulse trains with repetition time TR= 10ms have been measured with a microphone placed in the scanner room and its digital recording Fourier\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["26"]}
{"title": "Control law and characteristics of solid propellant air-turbo-rocket\n", "abstract": " Mathematical model was set to study the control law and characteristics of solid propellant air-turbo-rocket (SPATR) with single and two control parameters, and the computational program based on the model was developed. In the mathematical model the total temperature of combustor exit is calculated based on interpolation of the experimental data. The velocity characteristics of SPATR with different control laws were computed in four cases which are the gas flow mass in turbine inlet is constant, the gas flow mass in turbine inlet is adjustable, the throat area of nozzle is adjustable and both the gas flow mass in turbine inlet and the throat area of nozzle are adjustable, respectively. The bivariate control law of SPATR was designed, and the adjusted ratio of gas flow mass in turbine inlet and the throat area of nozzle were obtained. Computational results show that SPATR has a wide flight envelope and better characteristics with the bivariate control law.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["26"]}
{"title": "Simulation study on the second harmonic ultrasound field of a Bessel Beam\n", "abstract": " In order to study the property of the second harmonic of limited diffraction Bessel beam, the fundamental and second harmonic ultrasound fields of a zeroth-order Bessel beam in Absorbing medium were computed and simulated by solving the KZK equation with a Bessel boundary condition, using a frequency domain finite difference method. Distribution of the second harmonic along the propagation direction was also investigated. The result shows that compared with the foundamental component, the second harmonic field has the same limited diffraction property, furthermore, the second harmonic has a narrower mainlobe in the farfield and lower sidelobes in the nearfield. It agrees well with that of the experiment. The study verifies the analytic solution derived from the quasi-linear approximation of KZK equation, and modified some limitations of the solution. This implies that in ultrasonic harmonic imaging better resolution and contrast can be obtained using the second harmonic, in the farfield and nearfield respectively.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["26"]}

To better understand the scattering and transmission of light to the detectors, HiRes measures light from different calibrated sources. We compare scattered light from laser shots a few kilometers away from the two HiRes detectors, with direct light from stable portable light sources placed a few meters in front of the phototubes. We use two HiRes detectors to study and isolate contributions to fluctuations of the measured light. These contributions include fluctuations in the source intensity, the night sky background, scattering and transmission of the laser beam, the phototubes and electronics, and photostatistics\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["26"]}

By measuring the cutting forces and the micro-hardness of chips and comparing the experimental results of cutting both in Ar and in air, the mechanism of chip formation in turning Ti alloys (Ti--6Al--4V, TC-9) and the main reason why they are difficult to cut are explained. According to the experimental results in turning Ti alloys and carbon steel (AISI 1045), which have been compared and analyzed in different aspects, it is shown that the deformation of chips and work-hardening of Ti alloys are less than those of C steel under the same experimental condition. In turning Ti alloys, the shear type chips are formed, while in turning C steel one gets continuous ribbon type chips. The mechanisms of these two types of chip formation are different under the same cutting conditions.

{"title": "Web Taxonomy Fusion using Topic Maps-driven Ontological Concepts and Relationships\n", "abstract": " Since most of the Web taxonomies and catalogs are organized in conceptual hierarchies, taxonomy fusion can be viewed as a specialized case of hierarchical ontology coalition in real-world applications. Hence, different kinds of semantic information can be further extracted to facilitate Web taxonomy fusion, such as intra-ontological concepts and interontological relationships. This paper proposes approaches to effectively improve the accuracy of Web taxonomy fusion by using a taxonomy fusion model based on the ontological concepts and relationships of Topic Maps. Specifically, a novel fusion model based on inter-ontological mapping as well as intra-topic concept is presented to outperform a Na\u0131ve Bayes (NB) classifier and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) by 20% to 30% in F1 measure over real-world Web taxonomies.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["26"]}

The concept of a small world and the six degree of separation* are the most well-known examples about social networks [* REF _Ref254452353\\r\\h*\\* MERGEFORMAT* 11*]. To represent a social network, a simple way is to use a graph representation with individuals or actors as nodes and relationships or interactions as edges. When a social network is constructed, the nodes and edges within the social network can be appropriately analyzed and investigated to discover the important actors and relationships.

{"title": "IMPROVING WEB QUERY CLASSIFICATION BY LATENT TOPIC ANALYSIS\n", "abstract": " As Web search engines play an important role in helping people find required information from massive Web data, the Web query classification (WQC) problem becomes an important research issue. Contrast to traditional classification problems, WQC is to classify Web queries into relevant categories of a Web taxonomy. In addition to the typical challenge of processing short and ambiguous queries, WQC faces the practical difficulty of classifying queries into more than one category. In this paper, we propose a semantic-based scheme that uses the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to exploit the latent topic semantics of expanded queries and Web categories for WQC. To evaluate the effectiveness, we have conducted experiments in comparison with the algorithm proposed by Shen et al. in 2005. The results show that our approach has 6.5% and 6.6% improvements in the top-5 classification results for\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["26"]}
{"title": "A Visual Interface Design for Search Results from Multiple Search Engines\n", "abstract": " Because of the explosively growing amount of infor-mation on the World Wide Web, it is a time-consuming task to find the demanded information. Although many search engines exist to help users search for the information, most of them reveal limited information, because they show the search results in list-based interfaces, and users need to check each entry to have a clear view of the search results. In this paper, a visual interface is proposed to display the search results collected from multiple back-end search engines and to help users discover important information. A prototype has been implemented, and it visualizes the search results from six popular search engines. Two kinds of information are further visualized: hyperlink reference relationships and whether some pages are of a same site. In the aspect of information exhibition, the visual interface can help users reduce the time of seeking the relevant results\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["26"]}

How to effectively and appropriately provide users with such abundant digital content is a crucial issue. Nowadays Internet users can freely publish their opinions and share knowledge using Web 2.0 services such as blogs and Wikipedia. Since most of the digital content is sequentially itemized with textual descriptions, users cannot comprehensively understand the panorama of the user opinions in a bird\u2019s eye view. This study proposes a visualization technique called Visual Opinion Wall (VOW) to present the user opinions.
