{"title": "Logic in Computer Science: Modelling and reasoning about systems\n", "abstract": " Recent years have seen the development of powerful tools for verifying hardware and software systems, as companies worldwide realise the need for improved means of validating their products. There is increasing demand for training in basic methods in formal reasoning so that students can gain proficiency in logic-based verification methods. The second edition of this successful textbook addresses both those requirements, by continuing to provide a clear introduction to formal reasoning which is both relevant to the needs of modern computer science and rigorous enough for practical application. Improvements to the first edition have been made throughout, with extra and expanded sections on SAT solvers, existential/universal second-order logic, micro-models, programming by contract and total correctness. The coverage of model-checking has been substantially updated. Further exercises have been added. Internet support for the book includes worked solutions for all exercises for teachers, and model solutions to some exercises for students.", "num_citations": "2345\n", "authors": ["1607"]}

Recently highlighted inadequacies of implemented systems have demonstrated the importance of formally verifying the underlying voting protocols. The applied pi calculus is a formalism for modelling such protocols, and allows us to verify properties by using automatic tools, and to rely on manual proof techniques for cases that automatic tools are unable to handle. We model a known protocol for elections known as FOO\u00a092 in the applied pi calculus, and we formalise three of its expected properties, namely fairness, eligibility, and privacy. We use the ProVerif tool to prove that the first two properties are satisfied. In the case of the third property, ProVerif is unable to prove it directly, because its ability to prove observational equivalence between processes is not complete.

{"title": "Election verifiability in electronic voting protocols\n", "abstract": " We present a formal, symbolic definition of election verifiability for electronic voting protocols in the context of the applied pi calculus. Our definition is given in terms of boolean tests which can be performed on the data produced by an election. The definition distinguishes three aspects of verifiability: individual, universal and eligibility verifiability. It also allows us to determine precisely which aspects of the system\u2019s hardware and software must be trusted for the purpose of election verifiability. In contrast with earlier work our definition is compatible with a large class of electronic voting schemes, including those based on blind signatures, homomorphic encryption and mixnets. We demonstrate the applicability of our formalism by analysing three protocols: FOO, Helios 2.0, and Civitas (the latter two have been deployed).", "num_citations": "233\n", "authors": ["1607"]}
{"title": "Coercion-resistance and receipt-freeness in electronic voting\n", "abstract": " In this paper we formally study important properties of electronic voting protocols. In particular we are interested in coercion-resistance and receipt-freeness. Intuitively, an election protocol is coercion-resistant if a voter A cannot prove to a potential coercer C that she voted in a particular way. We assume that A cooperates with C in an interactive fashion. Receipt-freeness is a weaker property, for which we assume that A and C cannot interact during the protocol: to break receipt-freeness, A later provides evidence (the receipt) of how she voted. While receipt-freeness can be expressed using observational equivalence from the applied pi calculus, we need to introduce a new relation to capture coercion-resistance. Our formalization of coercion-resistance and receipt-freeness are quite different. Nevertheless, we show in accordance with intuition that coercion-resistance implies receipt-freeness, which implies privacy\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "213\n", "authors": ["1607"]}
{"title": "Collaborative Networked Communication: MUDs as Systems Tools.\n", "abstract": " A systems administration group is only as effective as its internal communication mechanisms. On-line communication has traditionally been managed via electronic mail or news, which are neither real-time nor truly collaborative. Communication tools which let multiple parties work together in real-time have become widespread on the Internet in the last several years.In an effort to keep a physically disjoint systems staff working together effectively, we have explored the use of MUDs as communications tools. By allowing many people to interact in an extensible environment, MUDs have solved many of the problems that we had with on-line communication, and provided many unexpected benefits as well.", "num_citations": "195\n", "authors": ["1607"]}
{"title": "New privacy issues in mobile telephony: fix and verification\n", "abstract": " Mobile telephony equipment is daily carried by billions of subscribers everywhere they go. Avoiding linkability of subscribers by third parties, and protecting the privacy of those subscribers is one of the goals of mobile telecommunication protocols. We use formal methods to model and analyse the security properties of 3G protocols. We expose two novel threats to the user privacy in 3G telephony systems, which make it possible to trace and identify mobile telephony subscribers, and we demonstrate the feasibility of a low cost implementation of these attacks. We propose fixes to these privacy issues, which also take into account and solve other privacy attacks known from the literature. We successfully prove that our privacy-friendly fixes satisfy the desired unlinkability and anonymity properties using the automatic verification tool ProVerif.", "num_citations": "191\n", "authors": ["1607"]}

We develop and extend\" certificate transparency}\", a proposal in this direction, so that it efficiently handles certificate revocation. We show how this extension can be used to build a secure end-to-end email or messaging system using PKI with no requirement to trust certificate authorities, or to rely on complex peer-to-peer key-signing arrangements such as PGP. This makes end-to-end encrypted mail possible, with apparently few additional usability issues compared to unencrypted mail (specifically, users do not need to understand or concern themselves with keys or certificates). Underlying these ideas is a new attacker model appropriate for cloud computing, which we call\" malicious-but-cautious\".", "num_citations": "166\n", "authors": ["1607"]}
{"title": "Analysing unlinkability and anonymity using the applied pi calculus\n", "abstract": " An attacker that can identify messages as coming from the same source, can use this information to build up a picture of targets' behaviour, and so, threaten their privacy. In response to this danger, unlinkable protocols aim to make it impossible for a third party to identify two runs of a protocol as coming from the same device. We present a framework for analysing unlinkability and anonymity in the applied pi calculus. We show that unlinkability and anonymity are complementary properties; one does not imply the other. Using our framework we show that the French RFID e-passport preserves anonymity but it is linkable therefore anyone carrying a French e-passport can be physically traced.", "num_citations": "160\n", "authors": ["1607"]}
{"title": "Feature integration using a feature construct\n", "abstract": " A feature is a unit of functionality that may be added to (or omitted from) a system. Examples of features are plug-ins for software packages or additional services offered by telecommunications providers. Many features override the default behaviour of the system, which may lead to unforeseen behaviour of the system; this is known as feature interaction.We propose a feature construct for defining features, and use it to provide a plug-and-play framework for exploring feature interactions. Our approach to the feature interaction problem has the following characteristics: \u2022Features are treated as first-class objects during the development phase.\u2022A method is given for integrating a feature into a system description. It allows features to override existing behaviour of the system being developed.\u2022A prototype tool has been developed for performing the integration.\u2022Interactions between features may be witnessed.In principle\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "160\n", "authors": ["1607"]}
{"title": "Operators and laws for combining preference relations\n", "abstract": " The paper is a theoretical study of a generalization of the lexicographic rule for combining ordering relations.

We present four kinds of results.         \u2022 We show that the lexicographic rule is the only way of combining preference relations which satisfies natural conditions (similar to those proposed by Arrow).         \u2022 We show in what circumstances the lexicographic rule propagates various conditions on preference relations, thus extending Grosof's results.         \u2022 We give necessary and sufficient conditions on the priority relation to determine various relationships between combinations of preferences.         \u2022 We give an algebraic treatment of this form of generalized prioritization.

The evaluation includes not only assessing whether the policies give legitimate users enough permissions to reach their goals, but also checking whether the policies prevent intruders from reaching their malicious goals. Policies of the access control system and goals of agents must be described in the access control description and specification language introduced as RW in our earlier work. The algorithm takes a policy description and a goal as input and performs two modes of checking. In the assessing mode, the algorithm searches for strategies consisting of reading and writing steps which allow the agents to achieve their goals no matter what states the system may be driven into during the execution of the strategies.

{"title": "Sharing actions and attributes in modal action logic\n", "abstract": " Distributed systems may be specified in Structured Modal Action Logic by decomposing them into agents which interact by sharing attributes (memory) as well as actions.

The semantic structures are Kripke models, as is usual for modal logic. The \u201cpossible worlds\u201d in a Kripke model are the states of the agent, and there is a separate relation on the set of states for each action term.             Agents potentially share actions as well as attributes in a way controlled by locality annotations in the specification texts. These become locality axioms in the logical theories the texts denote. These locality axioms provide a refined way of circumscribing the effects of actions.
