One is to extract the topics covered by the event and the tweets; the other is to segment the event. So far these problems have been viewed separately and studied in isolation. In this work, we argue that these problems are in fact inter-dependent and should be addressed together. We develop a joint Bayesian model that performs topic modeling and event segmentation in one unified framework.

Being hosted by sediments and having no obvious affinity to igneous activities, these deposits occur in continent-continent (Indo-Asian) collisional orogen and are controlled by thrust-nappe structures, thus obviously different from the well-known sediments-hosted base metal deposits in the world. They were formed in Tertiary foreland basins developed from Paleo-Tethyan rifting basins and Mesozoic depression basins. During mineralization, thrust-nappe structures juxtaposed Mesozoic strata over Tertiary strata through a series of parallel reverse/thrust faults in the basins. The deposits are strictly controlled by thrust-nappe structures. There exist four types of ore deposits: the Jinding-type deposits is formed in a thrusting-related dome structure combined with lithologic trap, the Hexi-Sanshan-type deposit is controlled by a pop up structure, the Fulongchang-type deposits are located in thrusting-related second-order faults within clastics, and the Dongmozhazhua-type deposits are hosted by second-order faults within limestone of the hanging-walls of major thrust faults.

In this paper, an efficient deep network called CrackNet-V is proposed for automated pixel-level crack detection on 3D asphalt pavement images. Compared with the original CrackNet, CrackNet-V has a deeper architecture but fewer parameters, resulting in improved accuracy and computation efficiency. Inspired by CrackNet, CrackNet-V uses invariant spatial size through all layers such that supervised learning can be conducted at pixel level. Following the VGG network, CrackNet-V uses 3 \u00d7 3 size of filters for the first six convolutional layers and stacks several 3 \u00d7 3 convolutional layers together for deep abstraction, resulting in reduced number of parameters and efficient feature extraction.

{"title": "Comparison of mercury concentrations measured at several sites in the Southern Hemisphere\n", "abstract": " Our knowledge of the distribution of mercury concentrations in air of the Southern Hemisphere was until recently based mostly on intermittent measurements made during ship cruises. In the last few years continuous mercury monitoring has commenced at several sites in the Southern Hemisphere, providing new and more refined information. In this paper we compare mercury measurements at several remote sites in the Southern Hemisphere made over a period of at least 1 year at each location. Averages of monthly medians show similar although small seasonal variations at both Cape Point and Amsterdam Island. A pronounced seasonal variation at Troll research station in Antarctica is due to frequent mercury depletion events in the austral spring. Due to large scatter and large standard deviations of monthly average median mercury concentrations at Cape Grim, no systematic seasonal variation could be found there. Nevertheless, the annual average mercury concentrations at all sites during the 2007\u20132013 period varied only between 0.85 and 1.05 ng m\u22123. Part of this variability is likely due to systematic measurement uncertainties which we propose can be further reduced by improved calibration procedures. We conclude that mercury is much more uniformly distributed throughout the Southern Hemisphere than the distributions suggested by measurements made onboard ships. This finding implies that smaller trends can be detected in shorter time periods. We also report a change in the trend sign at Cape Point from decreasing mercury concentrations in 1996\u20132004 to increasing concentrations since 2007.", "num_citations": "81\n", "authors": ["1160"]}

{"title": "Public perception of water consumption and its effects on water conservation behavior\n", "abstract": " The usual perception of consumers regarding water consumption is that their bills do not match their actual water consumption. However, this mismatch has been insufficiently studied; particularly for cases related to specific water-use patterns, water conservation practices, and user socio-demographics. In this study, a total of 776 households in 16 villages situated in the rural Wei River Basin are investigated to address the gap in the literature. Questionnaires and 3-day water diaries are used for data collection and comparison. Results show that significant relations exist between perceived water consumption and actual water consumption. Participants have different perceptions of specific water-use patterns. Participants tend to underestimate their outdoor and kitchen water consumption and overestimate their indoor water consumption. Females and elder consumers accurately estimate their water consumption, whereas consumers with high education levels and incomes underestimate their actual water consumption. The groups who can accurately estimate water consumption have better water conservation consciousness and water conservation practices than those who underestimate their water consumption. The huge disparities highlighted by the results suggest that community policies and programs to improve public water conservation consciousness or practices must be implemented to enhance consumer understanding of water consumption.

Most of the existing works take into account the anomaly features of the traffic caused by DDoS. However, these detection methods suffer from either less generality or high computational and memory costs in detecting subtle DDoS attacks. In this paper, we first present a model for DDoS attacks with quantitative measurements. Based on this model, we find that there are two factors that have a severe influence on the deviation of traffic features. In view of these two factors, the DDoS attack traffic observed by monitors can be trivial, leading to the subtle DDoS attacks which are difficult to detect. To detect the subtle DDoS anomalies at monitors close to the attack sources, we propose a novel multistage DDoS detection framework that consists of a NTS (Network Traffic State) prediction, a fine-grained singularity\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "67\n", "authors": ["1160"]}

With the increasing role of culture in the study of psychology in the recent decade, researchers have now begun to turn their attention to the study of how culture can influence creativity. Answering this question in a scientific way is of profound significance to the ongoing educational reform in China. Based on the unique thinking style of Chinese people and focusing on knowledge workers engaged in creative activities, our study explored the relationships among thinking style, organizational commitment and creativity of Chinese employees. We theorized that the thinking style of connection and change would influence employee creativity both directly and indirectly. Data analysis from a sample of 134 Chinese subordinates supported our hypothesis, indicating that connection was correlated positively to creativity, whereas change was correlated negatively. Furthermore, connection was found to have a moderating effect on the relationship between organizational commitment and creativity; and the influence of change on employee creativity was partially mediated by organizational commitment.

{"title": "Revisiting the thermocline depth in the equatorial Pacific\n", "abstract": " The thermocline depth is defined as the depth of the maximum vertical temperature gradient. In the equatorial Pacific, the depth of 20\u00b0C isotherm is widely used to represent the thermocline depth. This work proposes that under the circumstance of a significant mean climate shift, it is better to use the original definition of the thermocline depth in studying the long-term changes in mean climate and tropical coupled climate variabilities. For instance, during the transient period of global warming, the tropical thermocline is usually enhanced because the surface layer warms more and faster than the lower layers. The depth of maximum vertical temperature gradient shoals, which is consistent with the enhanced thermocline. However, the 20\u00b0C isotherm depth deepens, which suggests a weakened thermocline. This discrepancy exists in both the observations and the future climate simulations of coupled models.", "num_citations": "51\n", "authors": ["1160"]}

Due to the extreme condition encountered during FW and the highly thermomechanical coupled nature of FW, finite element methods have been widely developed to study the FW process. In the light of reasonable simplification, we developed several effective methods based on the ABAQUS environment. Initially 2D models were developed to investigate the complete FW process, where an implicit method with remeshing and map solution techniques and an explicit method with the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) adaptive mesh controls were proposed to effectively overcome the excessive element distortion by using the ABAQUS Standard and Explicit packages, respectively. In addition, a 3D model was also developed to obtain better simulation results with the help of the ALE adaptive mesh controls in the ABAQUS/Explicit package and the map solution technique in the ABAQUS/Standard package combined with the HYPERWORKS software.

The results showed that the ultrastructure of the liver and kidney in fluoride treated rats displayed shrinkage of nuclear and cell volume, swollen mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum and vacuols formation in the liver and kidney cells. MPPP significantly attenuated these fluoride-induced pathological changes. The MDA levels in serum and liver tissue of fluoride alone treated group were significantly higher than those of the control group (p< 0.05). The presence of 5 g/kg MPPP in the diet reduced the elevation of MDA levels in blood and liver, and increased the SOD and GSH-Px activities in kidney and GSH level in liver and kidney compared with the fluoride alone treated group (p< 0.05). In addition, MPPP alleviated the decrease of Bcl-2 protein expression and the increase of Bax protein expression induced by fluoride.

Coal consumption is still the biggest contributor to the increased carbon emissions in Shandong. Decomposition results show that the affluence effect is the most important contributors to the carbon emissions increments. The energy intensity effect is the dominant factor in curbing carbon emissions. The emission coefficient effect plays an important negative but relatively minor effect on carbon emissions.

Iterative design schemes are proposed for successively improving the performance of a controller until a satisfactory design is achieved. Specifically, the exact design procedure is based on the generalized Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation of the cost function of nonlinear stochastic systems, and the approximate design procedure for the infinite-time nonlinear stochastic regulator problem, is developed by using the upper and lower bounds of the cost functions. Stability of this problem is also considered. For a given controller, both the upper and lower bounds to its cost function can be obtained by solving a partial differential inequality.

Hepatic fibrosis is usually associated with chronic liver diseases caused by infection, drugs, metabolic disorders, or autoimmune imbalances. Effective clinical therapies are still lacking. Autophagy is a cellular process that degrades damaged organelles or protein aggregation, which participates in many pathological processes including liver diseases. Autophagy participates in hepatic fibrosis by activating hepatic stellate cells and may participate as well through influencing other fibrogenic cells. Besides that, autophagy can induce some liver diseases to develop while it may play a protective role in hepatocellular abnormal aggregates related liver diseases and reduces fibrosis. With a better understanding of the potential effects of autophagy on hepatic fibrosis, targeting autophagy might be a novel therapeutic strategy for hepatic fibrosis in the near future.", "num_citations": "44\n", "authors": ["1160"]}

A key question is how closely Hg concentrations in the human food chain, especially in fish and other aquatic wildlife, will track the changes in atmospheric Hg that are expected to occur following anthropogenic emission reductions. We investigated this question by evaluating several regional groups of case studies where Hg concentrations in aquatic biota have been monitored continuously or intermittently for several decades. Our analysis shows that in most cases Hg time trends in biota did not agree with concurrent Hg trends in atmospheric deposition or concentrations, and the divergence between the two trends has become more apparent over the past two decades.

Game Optimization Theory, which is a comprehensive system, could not only handle multi-objective optimization problems effectively, but also could offset the disadvantages of traditional optimization theories, such as lack of framework and the insufficient consideration of relevant elements. In this paper GOT is used for the first time in solving the distribution systems planning (DSP) issue by implementing distributed generation. The proposed model integrates costs, losses, and voltage index to achieve optimal size and site of distributed generation. The model allows minimizing total system costs, system power losses and maximizing voltage improvement.

{"title": "Ascites increases expression/function of multidrug resistance proteins in ovarian cancer cells\n", "abstract": " Chemotherapy resistance is the major reason for the failure of ovarian cancer treatment. One mechanism behind chemo-resistance involves the upregulation of multidrug resistance (MDR) genes (ABC transporters) that effectively transport (efflux) drugs out of the tumor cells. As a common symptom in stage III/IV ovarian cancer patients, ascites is associated with cancer progression. However, whether ascites drives multidrug resistance in ovarian cancer cells awaits elucidation. Here, we demonstrate that when cultured with ascites derived from ovarian cancer-bearing mice, a murine ovarian cancer cell line became less sensitive to paclitaxel, a first line chemotherapeutic agent for ovarian cancer patients. Moreover, incubation of murine ovarian cancer cells in vitro with ascites drives efflux function in these cells. Functional studies show ascites-driven efflux is suppressible by specific inhibitors of either of two ABC transporters [Multidrug Related Protein (MRP1); Breast Cancer Related Protein (BCRP)]. To demonstrate relevance of our findings to ovarian cancer patients, we studied relative efflux in human ovarian cancer cells obtained from either patient ascites or from primary tumor. Immortalized cell lines developed from human ascites show increased susceptibility to efflux inhibitors (MRP1, BCRP) compared to a cell line derived from a primary ovarian cancer, suggesting an association between ascites and efflux function in human ovarian cancer. Efflux in ascites-derived human ovarian cancer cells is associated with increased expression of ABC transporters compared to that in primary tumor-derived human ovarian cancer cells.

This paper proposes a random linear network coding based fault-tolerant routing mechanism to instantaneously recover the native packets omitted by the source. This mechanism couples the multi-path routing and random linear network coding technique by improving the conventional method of coding nodes selection. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed fault-tolerant routing\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "35\n", "authors": ["1160"]}

{"title": "Item-level social influence prediction with probabilistic hybrid factor matrix factorization\n", "abstract": " Social influence has become the essential factor which drives the dynamic evolution process of social network structure and user behaviors. Previous research often focus on social influence analysis in network-level or topic-level. In this paper, we concentrate on predicting item-level social influence to reveal the users' influences in a more fine-grained level. We formulate the social influence prediction problem as the estimation of a user-post matrix, where each entry in the matrix represents the social influence strength the corresponding user has given the corresponding web post. To deal with the sparsity and complex factor challenges in the research, we model the problem by extending the probabilistic matrix factorization method to incorporate rich prior knowledge on both user dimension and web post dimension, and propose the Probabilistic Hybrid Factor Matrix Factorization (PHF-MF) approach. Intensive experiments are conducted on a real world online social network to demonstrate the advantages and characteristics of the proposed method.", "num_citations": "35\n", "authors": ["1160"]}

The typical setting of traditional active learning methods is querying labels from an oracle. This is only possible if an expert exists, which may not be the case in many real world applications. In this paper, we focus on designing easier questions that can be answered by a non-expert. These questions poll relative information as opposed to absolute information and can be even generated from side-information. We propose an active learning approach that queries the ordering of the importance of an instance's neighbors rather than its label.

Two types of DGT binding phases were evaluated, one by immobilizing CFCN on Chelex 100 resin gels (Chelex-CFCN) and the other on poly(acrylic acid) gels (PAA-CFCN). Both DGT devices were successfully applied to the measurement of low levels of stable 133Cs and radioactive 137Cs in synthetic solutions and in natural river waters. In all cases, the DGT labile concentrations measured with the PAA-CFCN DGT agreed very well with total dissolved Cs concentrations, whereas those measured by the Chelex-CFCN DGT were much lower than total Cs concentrations. The difference was attributed to the different binding kinetics of Cs+ on the two gels suggesting that this might be a promising means of measuring biologically relevant Cs concentrations in natural waters.", "num_citations": "34\n", "authors": ["1160"]}

Cyt b gene introns were frequently present in the fungal kingdom and some lower plants, but generally absent or rare in Chromista, Protozoa, and Animalia. Fungal Cyt b introns were found at 35 positions in Cyt b genes and the number of introns varied at individual positions from a single representative to 32 different introns at position 131, showing a wide and patchy distribution. Many homologous introns were present at the same position in distantly related species but absent in closely related species, suggesting that introns of the Cyt b genes were frequently lost. On the other hand, highly similar intron sequences were observed in some distantly related species rather than in closely related species, suggesting that these introns were gained independently, likely through lateral transfers. The intron loss-and-gain events could be mediated by transpositions that might have occurred between nuclear and mitochondria. Southern hybridization analysis confirmed that some introns contained repetitive sequences and might be transposable elements.

{"title": "Superlens from complementary anisotropic metamaterials\n", "abstract": " Metamaterials with isotropic property have been shown to possess novel optical properties such as a negative refractive index that can be used to design a superlens. Recently, it was shown that metamaterials with anisotropic property can translate the high-frequency wave vector k values from evanescence to propagating. However, electromagnetic waves traveling in single-layer anisotropic metamaterial produce diverging waves of different spatial frequency. In this work, it is shown that, using bilayer metamaterials that have complementary anisotropic property, the diverging waves are recombined to produce a subwavelength image, i.e., a superlens device can be designed. The simulation further shows that the design can be achieved using a metal/oxide multilayer, and a resolution of 30 nm can be easily obtained in the optical frequency range.", "num_citations": "31\n", "authors": ["1160"]}

Herein, we identified the role of miR-126 in human gastric cancer (GC) growth and development in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MiR-126 expression was investigated in GC tissue samples and cell lines by real-time PCR. Crystal violet test and Transwell assay were conducted to explore the effects of miR-126 on the proliferation and invasion of human GC cell lines, respectively. The impaction of miR-126 over expression on putative target Crk (v-crk sarcoma virus CT10 oncogene homolog) was subsequently confirmed via Western blot. Crk specific siRNA was used to suppress Crk expression. RESULTS: MiR-126 expression was frequently and markedly downregulated (p< 0.05) in human gastric cancer tissues. Overexpression of miR-126 inhibited GC cells invasion but did not affect its proliferation in vitro. Moreover, overexpression of miR-126 significantly decreased (p< 0.05) the protein levels of Crk, which has previously been identified as a direct target of miR-126. Knockdown of Crk also markedly suppressed GC cells invasion. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that overexpression of miR-126 inhibited GC cells invasion in part by targeting Crk. These findings suggested that miR-126 played major roles in the malignant behavior of GC and it might be a promising therapeutic target of GC.", "num_citations": "30\n", "authors": ["1160"]}

{"title": "Development and bin mapping of gene-associated interspecific SNPs for cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) introgression breeding efforts\n", "abstract": " Cotton (Gossypium spp.) is the largest producer of natural fibers for textile and is an important crop worldwide. Crop production is comprised primarily of G. hirsutum L., an allotetraploid. However, elite cultivars express very small amounts of variation due to the species monophyletic origin, domestication and further bottlenecks due to selection. Conversely, wild cotton species harbor extensive genetic diversity of prospective utility to improve many beneficial agronomic traits, fiber characteristics, and resistance to disease and drought. Introgression of traits from wild species can provide a natural way to incorporate advantageous traits through breeding to generate higher-producing cotton cultivars and more sustainable production systems. Interspecific introgression efforts by conventional methods are very time-consuming and costly, but can be expedited using marker-assisted selection. Using transcriptome sequencing we have developed the first gene-associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for wild cotton species G. tomentosum, G. mustelinum, G. armourianum and G. longicalyx. Markers were also developed for a secondary cultivated species G. barbadense cv. 3\u201379. A total of 62,832 non-redundant SNP markers were developed from the five wild species which can be utilized for interspecific germplasm introgression into cultivated G. hirsutum and are directly associated with genes. Over 500 of the G. barbadense markers have been validated by whole-genome radiation hybrid mapping.

Methods The current paper reports results from: 1) an original hospital-based case-control study, which included 252 incident cases of HNC and 236 controls frequency-matched to cases on sex and age; and 2) a meta-analysis combining the results of the current case-control study and 13 previously published studies (9 cohort studies with 727,569 subjects and 550 HNC outcomes and 5 case-control studies with 4,017 HNC cases and 10,928 controls).   Results In the original case-control study, we observed a strong inverse association between allergies and HNC [odds ratio = 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.27\u20130.62].

{"title": "Sample geometry and size effects on tensile properties of friction stir welded AA2024 joints\n", "abstract": " Dog-bone specimens with different geometries and sizes are commonly used to characterize the tensile behavior of friction stir welded (FSWed) joints. Here a significant effect of sample geometry/size on the tensile behavior of FSWed AA2024 joints was observed, caused by various ratios of weld width to gauge length of samples. The elongation drops sharply while the yield stress gradually increases with increasing the gage length from 12.5 to 25\u00a0mm. The ultimate tensile strength is independent on the sample geometry/size. A critical gauge length of about 2.5 times of tool shoulder diameter is proposed, e.g. 25\u00a0mm in this study for AA2024, which roughly equals to the transverse width across all the softened zones in the joint. Over this critical value there will be no sample geometry/size effect on the tensile properties of FSW joints.", "num_citations": "27\n", "authors": ["1160"]}

To date, several agents that can block LECs proliferation have been studied, but none have been used in clinic. Recently, accumulating evidence has suggested rapamycin, the inhibitor of mTOR (mammalian target of Rapamycin), was associated with the induction of apoptosis in LECs. The purpose of our study was to investigate the potential effects of rapamycin on HGF-induced LECs and the underlying mechanisms by which rapamycin exerted its actions. Using cell proliferation, cell viability and flow cytometric apoptosis assays, we found that rapamycin potently not only suppressed proliferation but also induced the apoptosis of LECs in a dose-dependent manner under HGF administration. Further investigation of the underlying mechanism using siRNA transfection revealed that rapamycin could promote apoptosis of LECs via inhibiting HGF-induced phosphorylation of AKT/mTOR, ERK and JAK2/STAT3 signaling molecules. Moreover, the forced expression of AKT, ERK and STAT3 could induce a significant suppression of apoptosis in these cells after treatment of rapamycin. Together, these findings suggested that rapamycin-induced apoptosis in HGF-stimulated LECs is accompanied by inhibition of AKT/mTOR, ERK and JAK2/STAT3 pathways, which supports its use to inhibit PCO in preclinical studies and provides theoretical foundation for future possible practice.

However, in many real world applications, the data features usually evolve over time smoothly. In this case, it would be very expensive in both computation and storage to rerun the whole NMF procedure after each time when the data feature changing. In this paper, we propose Evolutionary Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (eNMF), which aims to incrementally update the factorized matrices in a computation and space efficient manner with the variation of the data matrix. We devise such evolutionary procedure for both asymmetric and symmetric NMF.

Since thermal expansion is closely associated with the anharmonicity of the lattice vibrations, the role of phonon in NTE is necessary to be given a detailed investigation. The vibrational properties indicate that: despite the NTE behavior in experiments, the contribution from overall phonons to thermal expansion is positive. Moreover, different phonon modes have different effects. Acoustic phonons promote larger volume expansion. In contrast, optical phonons lead to volume contraction. Due to the distinction of occupied phonon modes in different temperatures, this can be used to explain the normal thermal expansion below room temperature based on the related experiments.", "num_citations": "23\n", "authors": ["1160"]}

The ISS-modular approach provides a simple and effective way for controlling non-linear systems by the command filtered back-stepping approach, simultaneously solving the problem of `explosion of complexity`.

However, labeled examples are often difficult or time consuming to obtain since they require substantial human labeling efforts. On the other hand, unlabeled data are often relatively easy to collect. Semisupervised learning addresses this problem by using large quantities of unlabeled data with labeled data to build better learning algorithms. In this paper, we use the manifold regularization approach to formulate the semisupervised learning problem where a regularization framework which balances a tradeoff between loss and penalty is established. We investigate different implementations of the loss function and identify the methods which have the least computational expense. The regularization hyperparameter, which determines the balance between loss and penalty, is crucial to model selection.

The miniature pig is also diphyodont, making it a valuable alternative model for understanding human tooth development and replacement. However, little is known about gene expression and function during swine odontogenesis. The goal of this study is to undertake the survey of differential gene expression profiling and functional network analysis during morphogenesis of diphyodont dentition in miniature pigs. The identification of genes related to diphyodont development should lead to a better understanding of morphogenetic patterns and the mechanisms of diphyodont replacement in large animal models and humans. The temporal gene expression profiles during early diphyodont development in miniature pigs were detected with the Affymetrix Porcine GeneChip. The gene expression data were further evaluated by ANOVA as well as pathway and STC analyses. A total of 2,053 genes were detected with differential expression. Several signal pathways and 151 genes were then identified through the construction of pathway and signal networks. The gene expression profiles indicated that spatio-temporal down-regulation patterns of gene expression were predominant; while, both dynamic activation and inhibition of pathways occurred during the morphogenesis of diphyodont dentition.

Specifically, NLP assumes that nearby points should have similar class indicators. The data labels are propagated under the guidance of NL information and the geometric structure revealed by both labeled and unlabeled points, by employing some specified initialization\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["1160"]}

Several methods for evaluating the productivity of the horizontal wells have been presented in the literature. With such methods, however, it is still difficult to obtain an accurate result. This paper firstly presents the dimensionless conductivity theory of vertical fractures. Then models for calculating the equivalent wellbore radius and the skin factor due to flow convergence to the well bore are proposed after analyzing the steady-state flow in porous reservoirs. By applying the superposition principle to the pressure drop, a new method for evaluating the productivity of horizontal wells intercepted by multiple finite-conductivity fractures is developed.

{"title": "Dynamic changes of plant hormones in developing grains at rice filling stage under different temperatures\n", "abstract": " Temperature at grain filling stage has great impact on grain development. It has been well known that high percentage of chalky grains, poor cooking and eating quality may be caused by high temperature during the filling period, which is probably attributed to the shortened duration of grain filling, the low photosynthesis rate and activity changes of some enzymes relevant to grain filling. However, little information has been known about the effect of temperature on main endogenous hormones in developing grains at filling stage, which commonly plays an important role in grain development as a growth signal. In this paper, two temperature treatments, ie daily average temperature 32\u2103(high) and 22\u2103(optimum), were established to compare the difference in the endogenous hormone levels between two temperature treatments with two early indica rice cuhivars applied, aiming to recognize the relationship between the effect of temperature on grain development and the response of endogenous hormone in grains to temperature. The results showed that by higher temperature, grain development was accelerated at early grain-filling stage, and the grain filling duration was shortened (Fig. 1). The contents of 1AA, ZR and GA3 in developing rice grains were dramatically reduced at early grain filling stage when the plants were exposed to higher temperature, while a little difference was found in their contents between two temperature treatments at later stage (Fig. 2-4).Compared with optimum temperature treatment, there was much higher ABA content in developing grains throughout the whole filling stage in high temperature treatment in spite of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["1160"]}

In this work, a novel approach for interface stability was proposed to integrate the cathode/solid electrolyte by forming an electrolyte buffer layer on the rough surface of the cathode and coating a layer of graphite on the side of the electrolyte facing the lithium anode. This hybrid structure significantly improves the integration and the interface stability of the electrode/electrolyte. The interfacial resistance was dramatically reduced, the stability of the plating/stripping of Li metal was enhanced, and the growth of lithium dendrites was also inhibited due to the formation of the LiC6 transition layer.

The current study evaluates the changing trends and regime shifts in runoff and sediment loads at both the annual and monthly time scales. The associated spatial and temporal variations are analyzed by a sequential t-test analysis of the regime shifts (STARS) approach and the \u201cbreaks for additive seasonal and trend\u201d(BFAST) model using hydrological data at eight stations from the 1950s to 2011. Both runoff and sediment loads exhibit significant declines (p< 0.05), except in the upper reaches of the river near the Tangnaihai station. The regime shifts detected by the STARS approach are not completely consistent with the results from the BFAST method. In most cases, the regime shifts occurred in 1969 and 1986, due to the construction of large reservoirs. Climate change and other human activities, such as large-scale soil and water conservation measures, can result in abrupt changes in hydrological series at some stations. The trapping effects of reservoirs not only cause regime shifts of runoff and sediment loads, but also adjust their inter-annual and seasonal distributions. Various soil and water conservation measures are responsible for the significant reduction in runoff and sediment loads in the mid-lower reaches of the Yellow River Basin. In addition, water withdrawals from both river runoff and ground water play a critical role in the changing trends in runoff and indirectly alter the sediment loads. The findings provide a good reference for the effective promotion of climate change adaptation, water resources planning\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["1160"]}

In this paper, we address the MOT problem by embedding contextual proposal distributions and contextual observation models into a mixture tracker which is implemented in a Particle Filter framework. The proposal distributions are adaptively selected by motion conditions of targets which are determined by context information, and the multiple features are combined according to their discriminative power between ambiguity prone objects.

Grasping an object is often reduced to pushing a button on the interface. This paper presents the design and realization of a haptic forceps for microsurgery training, and its integration on a haptic 6DOF DELTA device. Psychophysical experiments were first conducted to determine the critical factors for the design. The haptic forceps has similar dimensions as a microsurgery forceps and integrates two active degrees of freedom for rotation about its axis as well as opening and closing. The transformation of the force/torque from the forceps tip to the haptic device TCP, necessary to compute the desired force/torque at the forceps tip, was derived and implemented. Preliminary experiments demonstrate the potential of this haptic forceps in a VR microsurgery trainer.", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["1160"]}

M3FS targets to find those features that would result in the maximal separation of different clusters and incorporates manifold information by enforcing smoothness constraint on the clustering function. Specifically, we define scale factor for each feature to measure its relevance to clustering, and irrelevant features are identified by assigning zero weights. Feature selection is then achieved by the sparsity constraints on scale factors.

{"title": "Drosophila TRPA channel painless inhibits male\u2013male courtship behavior through modulating olfactory sensation\n", "abstract": " The Drosophila melanogaster TRPA family member painless, expressed in a subset of multidendritic neurons embeding in the larval epidermis, is necessary for larval nociception of noxious heat or mechanical stimuli. However, the function of painless in adult flies remains largely unknown. Here we report that mutation of painless leads to a defect in male\u2013male courtship behavior and alteration in olfaction sensitivity in adult flies. Specific downregulation of the expression of the Painless protein in the olfactory projection neurons (PNs) of the antennal lobes (ALs) resulted in a phenotype resembling that found in painless mutant flies, whereas overexpression of Painless in PNs of painless mutant males suppressed male\u2013male courtship behavior. The downregulation of Painless exclusively during adulthood also resulted in male\u2013male courtship behavior. In addition, mutation of the painless gene in flies caused changes in olfaction, suggesting a role for this gene in olfactory processing. These results indicate that functions of painless in the adult central nervous system of Drosophila include modulation of olfactory processing and inhibition of male\u2013male courtship behavior.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["1160"]}

Among all the solvers for this problem, belief propagation (BP) provides a general and efficient way to derive approximate solutions. However, for large scale graphs the computational cost of BP is still demanding. In this paper, we propose a multilevel algorithm to accelerate belief propagation on Markov Random Fields (MRF). First, we coarsen the original graph to get a smaller one. Then, BP is applied on the new graph to get a coarse result. Finally the coarse solution is efficiently refined back to derive the original solution. Unlike traditional multi- resolution approaches, our method features adaptive coarsening and efficient refinement. The above process can be recursively applied to reduce the computational cost remarkably.

{"title": "A Novel Feature Selection Algorithm Based on Hypothesis-Margin.\n", "abstract": " Iterative search margin based algorithm (Simba) has been proven effective for feature selection. However, it still has the following disadvantages:(1) the previously proposed model still lacks enough robust to noises; and (2) the given model does not use any global information, in this way some useful discrimination information may be lost and the convergence speed is also influenced in some cases. In this paper, by incorporating global information, a novel margin based feature selection framework is introduced. According to the newly designed model, an improved margin based feature selection algorithm (Isimba) is proposed. By effectively adjusting the contribution of the global information, Isimba can efficiently reduce the computational cost and at the same time obtain more effective feature subsets as compared to Simba. The experiments on 6 artificial and 8 real-life benchmark datasets show that Isimba is effective and efficient.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["1160"]}

Our previous study indicated that sevoflurane preconditioning (SPC) also reduced intestinal IRI in rats. However, whether the protective effect of SPC is similar to IPC and the mechanisms of SPC are unclear. Thus, we compared the efficacy of SPC and IPC against intestinal IRI and the role of protein kinase C (PKC) and mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channel (mKATP) in SPC. A rat model of intestinal IRI was used in this study. The superior mesenteric artery (SMA) was clamped for 60 min followed by 120 min of reperfusion. Rats with IPC underwent three cycles of SMA occlusion for 5 min and reperfusion for 5 min before intestinal ischemia. Rats with SPC inhaled sevoflurane at 0.5 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) for 30 min before the intestinal ischemic insult. Additionally, the PKC inhibitor Chelerythrine (CHE) or mKATP inhibitor 5-Hydroxydecanoic (5-HD) was injected intraperitoneally before sevoflurane inhalation.

The test results show that the real time data transmission rate is up to 10\u00a0kHz, the integration drift is typically less than 0.4\u00a0uVs/s and drift performance is a little worse in real long pulse\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["1160"]}

The results show that the model can simulate the basic distribution of cloud cover, and however, obvious differences still exist compared with ISCCP satellite data and ERA reanalysis data. The simulated cloud cover is less in general, especially the abnormal low values in some regions of ocean. By improving the cloud cover scheme, simulated cloud cover in the eastern Pacific and Atlantic, summer hemisphere's oceans from subtropical to mid-latitude is considerably improved. But in the tropical Indian Ocean and West Pacific the cloud cover difference is still evident, mainly due to the deficiency of high cloud simulation in these regions resulting from deep cumulus convection. In terms of the analysis on radiation and cloud radiative forcing, we find that simulation on long wave radiation is better than short wave radiation. The simulation error of short wave radiation is caused mostly by the simulation difference in short wave radiative forcing, sea ice, and snow cover, and also by not involving aerosol's effect. The simulation error of long wave radiation is mainly resulting from deficiency in simulating cloud cover and underlying surface temperature. Corresponding to improvement of cloud cover, the simulated radiation (especially short wave radiation) in eastern oceans, summer hemisphere's oceans from subtropical to mid-latitude is remarkably improved. This also brings obvious improvement to net radiation in these regions.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["1160"]}

Stu dies of mineral prospect evaluation, ore controls, and localization-prognosis were carried out to solve the key problems in the process of mineral exploration. Regional correlation suggests that the Tuotuohe area has similar geological setting to the regions in\" Sanjiang belt\"(eg Lanping basin) that host many large sediment-hosted Pb-Zn deposits. The geological settings during the mineralization, ie, thrust structure, sedimentation of red beds and development of carbonate adjacent to dark mudstone were favorable for Pb-Zn mineralization. In combination with extensive zinc-lead geochemical anomalies, the authors hold that the Duocaima area has good potential in search for large deposits. The Duocaima deposit is a carbonate-hosted, low-temperature, and epigenic deposit characterized by ores in breccia, no affinity with igneous activity, and involvement of sulfur generated by bacterial sulfate reduction, indicative of Mississippi Valley-type (MVT) origin. The ore body mainly occurs in fractured Permian limestone of the Jiushidaoban Formation (Pj) that is adjacent to Permian clastics of the Nayixiong Formation (Pn) and above a thrust fault. Audio magnetotelluric sounding measurements revealed resistivity distribution of several profiles, one of which determined the location of a potential underground ore body in southern Pj limestone of Kongmolong ore block.

By introducing the VCG auction mechanism, an optimum resource allocation scheme is obtained to enhance each femtocell user and the whole macrocell network's revenue both.

Ensemble simulations are performed under both the transient and stable CO2 forcing. It is found that the dominant mechanism for temperature change differs in different stages of global warming. During the transient stage, the surface heat flux is a major driving factor for the tropical surface warming. During the equilibrium stage, the dominant mechanism to maintain the surface warming is the meridional advection. The heat flux forcing becomes a damping factor instead, particularly for the western tropical Pacific. Different from the surface warming, the subsurface warming results from the oceanic mixings during the entire period of global warming, whereas the advection terms generally play a cooling role, consistent with the slowdown of the shallow meridional overturning\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1160"]}

To capture the phase boundary evolution of the droplet and substrate interface with respect to the surrounding vacuum phase, the binary phase diagram is extended to a ternary model system at one particular temperature between the melting points of Al and Au. Due to diffusion of Al and Au at the droplet/substrate interface, intermetallic phase is formed.

In the process of plastic deformation, both low angle and high angle twist GB fractures occur in the center of the interface, which is completely different from the situation of thick materials reported by other references.

In the downlink, specially, the strong interference from Femtocell Base Stations (FBSs) to nearby macrocell users (MUEs) causes significant coverage holes. Applying different power control techniques has been heavily discussed in 3GPP as an efficient approach for handling dominant interference scenarios. Instead of relying on system level simulations, this paper proposes an analytical model for evaluating downlink power control at femto-tier based on spatial Poisson Point Process (PPP).

In this paper, a new Tree-based Backtracking Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (TBOMP) algorithm is presented with the idea of the tree model in wavelet domain.

This paper introduces a method merging with mean value coordinates. The method firstly computes the mean value coordinates of the vertices in the source mesh with respect to its boundary. After specifying the difference between the two mesh's boundaries, it interpolates the difference of the source's inside vertices through the coordinates, and then constructs a new mesh to merge. With the same framework, smoothing the seaming line can be achieved by interpolating tangent vector variations.

With the first model, we investigate the morphological evolution under the influence of spinodal decomposition. The model requires that a gradient energy contribution for the concentration field should be incorporated, in order to stabilize phase separation when the liquid concentration is inside the region of miscibility gap. The free energy of the system in this model is derived from direct interpolation of the bulk energy densities. This, however, results in simulation regions in nanometer scale due to contributions from the chemical free energy of the system to the total surface excess. With the second model, our purpose is to develop a phase-field model to simulate scales that are larger than nanometer, where the departures from equilibrium are very small resulting in phase concentrations outside the spinodal region.

PDG data is recorded under the unconstrained circumstances, so that it cannot avoid effects due to noise, rate fluctuation and interference from other wells. These effects make the measured pressure trends declining or rising and then obscure or distort the traditional flow behavior, which makes the following analysis difficult. In this thesis, the problems encountered in analysis of PDG transient pressure are investigated. A new algorithm, multi-well deconvolution, and corresponding computer codes are developed. The algorithm is based on linear recursion with added non-linear least squares optimization to deal with the noise problem in time domain. With this developed algorithm, the inter-well interference effect can be extracted and the variable-rate superposition effect can be solved at the same time. New deconvolution-based rate transient analysis and pressure transient analysis methods are both proposed in this thesis.

METHODS: The expression of HLA-I of HPBMc by ST pretreatment at six different dosages (0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2 mg/L) were detected with Flow cytometry (FCM) and Western blot respectively. RESULTS: FCM quantitative analysis revealed that the expressions of HLA-I of HPBMc in vitro as represented by fluorescence intensity after ST treatment for 24 hrs at all the five experimental concentrations were all lower than that of the control group. The inhibiting effects at relatively higher concentration groups (0.5, 1 and 2 mg/L) were of significance (P< 0.05). A dose-effect relationship between ST concentration and the inhibiting effect on HLA-I expression was found at the concentration range from 0.125 mg/L to 2 mg/L (r= 0.841, P< 0.01). Western Blotting results further confirmed the above results. CONCLUSION: Within the dosage range from 0.125 mg/L to 2 mg/L, ST could inhibit the expression of HLA-I of HPBMc in vitro negative dose-dependently.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1160"]}
{"title": "Simulation and evaluation of building cluster's wind environment with PHOENICS software [J]\n", "abstract": " The practical and easy method of computer numerical simulation is selected as an incisive approach to the research of wind environment, and the selection and establishment of the turbulence mathematical model suitable for wind environment and its boundary conditions are introduced in detail. Firstly, the flow field around a single building is simulated by the CFD software PHOENICS. Secondly, through converting the three dimensional CAD drawing into PHOENICS, the wind speed field around a real complex building cluster is simulated under the most unfavorable operation condition with the winter north wind, and this combines theory with practice commendably. The result is proved that the wind environment of building clusters can be simulated with the business software PHOENICS, which is very useful to the optimization design of the wind environment of building clusters.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1160"]}

{"title": "A measuring study for single-trace Lg coda Q (Lg)(c)\n", "abstract": " A stacked spectral ratio method is applied to the measurement of Lg coda Q(Lg)(c) at regional epicentral, distances (Delta < 500km). In order to test the stability and reliability of the method, we select two sets of high signal to noise ratio seismic records at different regions. One set is Lg coda time series from the Beijing telemetry seismic network observed 15 aftershocks of the Datong principal earthquake on Oct 18, 1989 (M-L = 5.9). Other set is from the portable digital seismic network observed two earthquakes in Pingliang, Gansu province. The source parameters basically are same among every set of earthquakes, that is to say, their ray paths to the given station are almost same. So obtained Q(Lg)(c) can be regarded as an average attenuation effect over the paths, which is not affected by the sources. The measuring Q(Lg)(c) results show that: (1) Although there are different instruments used in two seismic\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1160"]}
{"title": "Numerical investigation on fracture evolution of asphalt mixture compared with acoustic emission\n", "abstract": " To reveal the fracture damage of asphalt mixture, an image-based numerical approach is proposed in this study considering the distribution of aggregate and asphalt mortar. Both digital image processing technique and discrete element method are applied to simulate the inhomogeneity of specimen and its fracture evolution at low temperature. At the same time, the acoustic emission (AE) activities are measured in laboratory to be compared with the micromechanical responses of numerical models. Results indicate that the developed method is suitable for modelling the numerical specimen of asphalt mixture, taking into account the size gradation and morphology of aggregates in the two-dimensional image. The numerical results of asphalt mixture have a good agreement with that of laboratory tests in cracking distribution and statistical probability. Cracks first appear on the aggregate\u2013mortar interface, located in\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1160"]}

{"title": "Tuning Crystal Structures and Thermoelectric Properties through Al Doping in ReSi1. 75\n", "abstract": " Binary rhenium silicide, ReSi1.75, and its aluminium\u2010doped variants have been synthesized. Their crystal structures were characterized by X\u2010ray diffraction, solved and refined through the use of superspace group models. The binary undoped ReSi1.75 is a commensurate (supercell) structure of the previously well\u2010known MoSi2\u2010type structure. Al doping renders an incommensurate structure that was solved and refined, and reported for the first time. The thermoelectric properties of these compounds were also measured, including their electrical resistivities, thermal conductivities, and Seebeck coefficients. Compared with the commensurate structure of binary ReSi1.75, the Al\u2010doped incommensurate phase exhibits lower lattice thermal conductivity, lower electrical resistivity, a higher Seebeck coefficient, and ultimately a much higher figure of merit (ZT).
