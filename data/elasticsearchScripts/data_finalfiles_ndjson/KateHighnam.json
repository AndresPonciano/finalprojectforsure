{"title": "An uncrewed aerial vehicle attack scenario and trustworthy repair architecture\n", "abstract": " With the growing ubiquity of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), mitigating emergent threats in such systems has become increasingly important. In this short paper, we discuss an indicative class of UAVs and a potential attack scenario in which a benign UAV completing a mission can be compromised by a malicious attacker with an antenna and a commodity computer with open-source ground station software. We attest to the relevance of such a scenario for both enterprise and defense applications. We describe a system architecture for resiliency and trustworthiness in the face of these attacks. Our system is based on the quantitative assessment of trust from domain-specific telemetry data and the application of program repair techniques to UAV flight plans. We conclude with a discussion of restoring trust in post-repair UAV mission integrity.", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["1106"]}
{"title": "Real-time detection of dictionary dga network traffic using deep learning\n", "abstract": " Botnets and malware continue to avoid detection by static rule engines when using domain generation algorithms (DGAs) for callouts to unique, dynamically generated web addresses. Common DGA detection techniques fail to reliably detect DGA variants that combine random dictionary words to create domain names that closely mirror legitimate domains. To combat this, we created a novel hybrid neural network, Bilbo the \u201cbagging\u201d model, that analyses domains and scores the likelihood they are generated by such algorithms and therefore are potentially malicious. Bilbo is the first parallel usage of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network for DGA detection. Our unique architecture is found to be the most consistent in performance in terms of AUC,  score, and accuracy when generalising across different dictionary DGA classification tasks compared to current\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1106"]}
{"title": "Deep learning for real-time malware detection\n", "abstract": " Domain generation algorithm (DGA) malware makes callouts to unique web addresses to avoid detection by static rules engines. To counter this type of malware, we created an ensemble model that analyzes domains and evaluates if they were generated by a machine and thus potentially malicious. The ensemble consists of two deep learning models-a convolutional neural network and a long short-term memory network, both which were built using Keras and Tensorflow. These deep networks are flexible enough to learn complex patterns and do not require manual feature engineering. Deep learning models are also very difficult for malicious actors to reverse engineer, which makes them an ideal fit for cyber security use cases. The last piece of the ensemble is a natural-language processing model to assess whether the words in the domain make sense together. These three models are able to capture the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1106"]}
{"title": "GENNI: Visualising the Geometry of Equivalences for Neural Network Identifiability\n", "abstract": " We propose an efficient algorithm to visualise symmetries in neural networks. Typically, models are defined with respect to a parameter space, where non-equal parameters can produce the same input-output map. Our proposed method, GENNI, allows us to efficiently identify parameters that are functionally equivalent and then visualise the subspace of the resulting equivalence class. By doing so, we are now able to better explore questions surrounding identifiability, with applications to optimisation and generalizability, for commonly used or newly developed neural network architectures.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1106"]}
