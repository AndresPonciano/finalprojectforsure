Therefore, such a system must be dependable and ensure reliability, fault-tolerance, safety and other critical aspects, in order to deploy it in real scenario. Also, the management of the infrastructure resources must be efficient and the eventual system reconfiguration must be reliably performed. This paper encounters some of these issues and proposes a component platform with specific support for several QoS aspects, namely fault tolerance, safe inter-component communication and resource management. The platform adopts the Service Component Architecture (SCA\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["82"]}

These systems represent, in fact, valid instruments to improve the patient care not only to facilitate the monitoring of symptoms of any diseases but also supporting the correct diagnosis of pathology, such as the dysphonia. In this paper, we propose a new marker, namely the dysphonia detection index, able to support the evaluation of voice disorders, which can be embedded in a mobile health solution. Four acoustic parameters are combined in a single marker to globally evaluate the state of the health of the voice and to assess the presence or not of a voice disorder.

In order to realize high-reliability and low-latency communication for 5G, F-RANs have become a potential evolution path. However, F-RANs still face several challenges regrading infrastructure, network traffic, and caching mechanism. From the point of view of integrating AI, F-RANs, and cloud, this article proposes intelligent traffic prediction and cognitive caching toward IF-RANs. First, a traffic flow prediction algorithm is developed that is based on LSTM with an attention mechanism. The algorithm can effectively predict real-time traffic of different data types.

In order to achieve objectives such as huge amount of connection and wide area coverage within NB-IoT, the problem of network congestion generated by random access of numerous devices should be solved. In this paper, we first introduce the background of NB-IoT and investigate the research on random access optimization algorithm. Then we summarize relevant features of NB-IoT uplink and narrowband physical random access channel and design random access with differentiated barring (RADB), which can improve the insufficiency of traditional dynamic access class barring method. At last, the algorithms proposed in this paper are realized with established NB-IoT model using OPNET Modeler platform, and simulations are conducted. The simulation results show that RADB is able to effectively solve preamble request conflict generated by random access of numerous devices and preferentially provide efficient and reliable random access for latency-sensitive devices.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["82"]}
{"title": "ASM based synthesis of handwritten Arabic text pages\n", "abstract": " Document analysis tasks, as text recognition, word spotting, or segmentation, are highly dependent on comprehensive and suitable databases for training and validation. However their generation is expensive in sense of labor and time. As a matter of fact, there is a lack of such databases, which complicates research and development. This is especially true for the case of Arabic handwriting recognition, that involves different preprocessing, segmentation, and recognition methods, which have individual demands on samples and ground truth. To bypass this problem, we present an efficient system that automatically turns Arabic Unicode text into synthetic images of handwritten documents and detailed ground truth. Active Shape Models (ASMs) based on 28046 online samples were used for character synthesis and statistical properties were extracted from the IESK-arDB database to simulate baselines and word slant or skew. In the synthesis step ASM based representations are composed to words and text pages, smoothed by B-Spline interpolation and rendered considering writing speed and pen characteristics. Finally, we use the synthetic data to validate a segmentation method. An experimental comparison with the IESK-arDB database encourages to train and test document analysis related methods on synthetic samples, whenever no sufficient natural ground truthed data is available.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["82"]}

{"title": "A multi-class task scheduling strategy for heterogeneous distributed computing systems\n", "abstract": " Performance enhancement is one of the most important issues in high performance distributed computing systems. In such computing systems, online users submit their jobs anytime and anywhere to a set of dynamic resources. Jobs arrival and processes execution times are stochastic. The performance of a distributed computing system can be improved by using an effective load balancing strategy to redistribute the user tasks among computing resources for efficient utilization. This paper presents a multi-class load balancing strategy that balances different classes of user tasks on multiple heterogeneous computing nodes to minimize the per-class mean response time. For a wide range of system parameters, the performance of the proposed multi-class load balancing strategy is compared with that of the random distribution load balancing, and uniform distribution load balancing strategies using simulation. The results show that, the proposed strategy outperforms the other two studied strategies in terms of average task response time, and average computing nodes utilization.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["82"]}
{"title": "A Stepwise Self-adaptive Model for Improving Cloud Efficiency Based on Multi-Agent Features.\n", "abstract": " Today, the multi-agent systems are the most common systems that have intelligent behavior and able to adapt features based on the environmental changes. On the other side, cloud applications enable the stakeholders to customize their resources and software they need based on the requested domain. These applications face many challenges such as how to handle the changes of the stakeholder requirements at run-time, how to reconfigure the constituted architecture dynamically to be in consistency with the new services, and how to cope with the highly inherent expensive cost. To deal with these challenges, we proposed a new model that uses basic agent features for enhancing the cloud infrastructure functionalities by reconfiguring their allocated resources and software at run-time. The proposed model is composed of three levels. The first level is the cloud level which via its functionalities the consistent image that maps the user\u2019s requests through its manual components can be created & established. The second level is the intermediate level, which is responsible for two issues: playing the role of connector between the cloud level and the multi-agent level, and verifying the consistent of outputs for both of the upper and lower levels. The third level is the multi-agent, which is responsible for improving the quality of the constituted cloud images by co-operating the information, reasoning, learning and mobile agents. Finally, the urban transportation system is used to proof the applicability and usage of the proposed model.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["82"]}
{"title": "Reflective and adaptive middleware for software evolution of information systems\n", "abstract": " The high volatility and competitively of organizational ('socio-techno-economical') environment are putting tremendous pressure on software-intensive developers to come up with adaptive and evolving approaches. To contribute to such topical efforts towards adaptive information system at early phases, the present thesis addresses the rigorous development of self-adapting information systems. The approach we are putting forwards is referred to as RAMSES (Reflective and Adaptive Middleware for Software Evolution of non-stopping information Systems), and provides a reflective architecture for adapting the software applications, in response the requirements and environmental changes.The reflective middleware is based on a UML-compliant base-and meta-level. RAMSES provides objects with the ability of dynamically changing their behavior by exploiting their design information. The meta-level of the proposed architecture reifies UML diagrams including structural and behavioral information of the system to adapt; then it uses such data for dynamically adapting the software system against environmental changes. The evolution takes place in two steps: a meta-object, called evolutionary meta-object, plans a possible evolution against the detected external events then another meta-object, called consistency checker meta-object validates the feasibility of the proposed plan before really evolving the system. The meta-objects use the system design information to lead its evolution.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["82"]}

Based on two-dimensional texture matching, it allows global registration of surfaces with poor and ambiguous three-dimensional features, which are common to surface inspection applications. No prior information about relative sensor position is necessary, which makes our approach suitable for semi-automatic and manual measurement. The algorithm is robust and works with challenging measurements, including uneven illumination, surfaces with specular reflection as well as sparsely textured surfaces.
