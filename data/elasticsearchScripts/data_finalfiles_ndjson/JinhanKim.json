{"title": "Beupright: Posture Correction Using Relational Norm Intervention\n", "abstract": " Research shows the critical role of social relationships in behavior change, and the advancement of mobile technologies brings new opportunities of using online social support for persuasive applications. In this paper, we propose Relational Norm Intervention (RNI) model for behavior change, which involves two individuals as a target user and a helper respectively. RNI model uses Negative Reinforcement and Other-Regarding Preferences as motivating factors for behavior change. The model features the passive participation of a helper who will undergo artificially generated discomforts (eg, limited access to a mobile device) when a target user performs against a target behavior. Based on in-depth discussions from a two-phase design workshop, we designed and implemented BeUpright, a mobile application employing RNI model to correct sitting posture of a target user. Also, we conducted a two-week study to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["2035"]}
{"title": "Elicast: Embedding Interactive Exercises in Instructional Programming Screencasts\n", "abstract": " In programming education, instructors often supplement lectures with active learning experiences by offering programming lab sessions where learners themselves practice writing code. However, widely accessed instructional programming screencasts are not equipped with assessment format that encourages such hands-on programming activities. We introduce Elicast, a screencast tool for recording and viewing programming lectures with embedded programming exercises, to provide hands-on programming experiences in the screen-cast. In Elicast, instructors embed multiple programming exercises while creating a screencast, and learners engage in the exercises by writing code within the screencast, receiving auto-graded results immediately. We conducted an exploratory study of Elicast with five experienced instructors and 63 undergraduate students. We found that instructors structured the lectures into\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["2035"]}
