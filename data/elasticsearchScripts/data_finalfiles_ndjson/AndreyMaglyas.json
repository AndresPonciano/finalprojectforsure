The paper reports the conduct and the results of a systematic mapping study which identified 25 studies on SPM. Still, most of the papers had only hypotheses and theories that were not empirically confirmed or the confirmation was based on a small set of cases.

The survey was conducted through a public LinkedIn group for a period of nine months. During this timeframe it received 201 responses. The responses were analyzed qualitatively to identify the essential components and properties of product management from the practitioners' viewpoint. In comparison with the existing product management frameworks and definitions, the responses showed a tendency to mix product management and product marketing. Although the respondents had difficulties in naming all product management activities, we identified six that represent the core activities of product managers in the industry.

It is necessary to integrate ERP with other business information systems inside and outside the company. With the grounded theory, we aim to understand how integration challenges emerged in a large manufacturing enterprise when the long-term ERP system reached the beginning of its retirement. Structural changes, an information technology governance model, lack of organisational vision, having no architectural descriptions, lack of collaboration, cost cutting, and organisational culture made integration governance troublesome. As a consequence, the enterprise suffered from several undesired effects, such as complex integration scenarios between internal systems, and failing to provide its customers the needed information.

We studied thirteen software organizations representing various types of software products and analyzed the collected data by applying the grounded theory method. As a result, we summarized the observations, explaining the main differences between SMEs and LEs and identified SPM activities that are size-dependent, size-independent, and specific for SMEs and LEs only. Our results indicate that the company size affects goals and activities of SPM. Therefore, companies of different size require different approaches in the adoption of SPM activities.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1540"]}

An inductive case study was made to examine a long-term ERP system of a large manufacturing enterprise to better understand the nature and importance of ERP system integration. Our results can be summarized as four findings about the current life cycle models: 1) integration should be a major consideration when choosing ERPs, 2) deployments are continuous, 3) external integration is not just an extension phase after the project and 4) integration remains as a continuous challenge which is never fully achieved due to the constantly changing business requirements and organizational landscape. The results can help managers when making decisions on integration issues, yet effective approaches for integration governance are needed in order to avoid the increased costs and complexity.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1540"]}

We examined the development and integration of a customized ERP system used by a global manufacturing enterprise by interviewing 21 industrial experts. By using Grounded Theory as the data analysis approach, four groups of factors influencing ERP system integration were revealed. Business environment sets the constraints for integration that is governed in a dynamic organizational landscape, hindered by political agendas.

{"title": "Overcoming the complexity of software product management\n", "abstract": " This thesis describes an approach to overcoming the complexity of software product management (SPM) and consists of several studies that investigate the activities and roles in product management, as well as issues related to the adoption of software product management. The thesis focuses on organizations that have started the adoption of SPM but faced difficulties due to its complexity and fuzziness and suggests the frameworks for overcoming these challenges using the principles of decomposition and iterative improvements.  The research process consisted of three phases, each of which provided complementary results and empirical observation to the  problem of overcoming the complexity of SPM. Overall, product management processes and practices in 13 companies were studied and analysed. Moreover, additional data was collected with a survey conducted worldwide. The collected data were analysed using the grounded theory (GT) to identify the possible ways to overcome the complexity of  SPM. Complementary research methods, like elements of the Theory of Constraints were used for deeper data analysis.  The results of the thesis indicate that the decomposition of SPM activities depending on the specific characteristics of companies and roles is a useful approach for simplifying the existing SPM frameworks. Companies would benefit from the results by adopting SPM activities more efficiently and effectively and spending fewer resources on its adoption by concentrating on the most important SPM activities.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1540"]}

At the same time, the proportion of successful projects is still quite low according to the previous research. Although almost every project's team knows main areas of responsibility which would help to finish project on time and on budget, this knowledge is rarely used in practice. So it is important to evaluate the success of existing software development projects and to suggest a method for evaluating success chances which can be used in the software development projects.   The main aim of this study is to evaluate the success of projects in the selected geographical region (Russia-Ukraine-Belarus). The second aim is to compare existing models of success prediction and to determine their strengths and weaknesses.   Research was done as an empirical study. A survey with structured forms and theme-based interviews were used as the data collection methods. The information gathering was done in two stages. At the first stage, project manager or someone with similar responsibilities answered the questions over Internet. At the second stage, the participant was interviewed; his or her answers were discussed and refined. It made possible to get accurate information about each project and to avoid errors.  It was found out that there are many problems in the software development projects. These problems are widely known and were discussed in literature many times. The research showed that most of the projects have problems with schedule, requirements, architecture, quality, and budget.

Instead, many stakeholders are involved in the implementation of ERP systems. However, the ERP research often concentrates on relationships between two stakeholders only. In this study we take a broader viewpoint to relationships between external stakeholders in ERP development networks. We investigated the ERP development networks of three global enterprises and revealed eight types of relationships between the stakeholders. Understanding of what types of relationships exist is important for locating potential problems. As an example, we describe how an overtrusted relationship can lead to technical challenges.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1540"]}
