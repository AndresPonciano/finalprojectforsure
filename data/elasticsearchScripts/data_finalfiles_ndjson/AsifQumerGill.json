Finally, we summarize a number of industrial case studies carried out over several years in order to test and improve the efficiency of our theory of adding SPI to an agile methodological approach.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["2226"]}

Through this chapter, we present current emerging trends in IoT in different industry sectors as well as discuss the key privacy challenges impeding the growth of IoT to reach its potential in the smart home context. The majority of the existing literature on IoT smart home platforms focuses on functionalities provided by smarter connected devices; however, it does not address the concerns from a consumer\u2019s viewpoint. Thus, the key questions are: What are the privacy concerns related to IoT, particularly from a \u201csmart home device\u201d consumer viewpoint? What are the existing remedial approaches for privacy management? This chapter proposes a framework to assist smart home user and IoT device manufacturer to make informed privacy management decisions.

Although IBS is very common in developed countries, however, its adoption by customers in developing countries is still very slow. This may well be due to the lack of customer\u2019s trust in IBS in developing countries. This paper studies the important issue of customer\u2019s initial trust in IBS in the Jordanian context and proposes the customer initial trust model. The objective of this model is to understand and analyse the underlying factors that affect the early stage of trust (ie initial customer trust) in IBS, which may, impact customer\u2019s initial intention to use IBS. The proposed model of customer\u2019s initial trust in IBS integrates constructs from Diffusion of Innovation (DoI) theory, Hofstede culture theory and trust literature. The distinguishable property of this model is the incorporation of national culture dimensions on initial trust. The proposed model will assist Jordanian banks in understanding the factors that may impact their customers\u2019 initial trust in IBS.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["2226"]}

Indeed, software systems are typically developed as an assembly of existing components. The complexity of the assessment process is due to lack of clarity on how to compare the cost of adaptation of an existing component versus the cost of developing it from scratch. Indeed, often pursuit of reuse can lead to excessive rework and adaptation, or developing suites of components that often get neglected. This paper is an important step towards modelling the complex reuse assessment process. To assess the success factors that can underpin reuse, we analyze the cognitive factors that belie developers\u2019 behavior during their decision-making when attempting to reuse.

{"title": "Secure big data ecosystem architecture: challenges and solutions\n", "abstract": " Big data ecosystems are complex data-intensive, digital\u2013physical systems. Data-intensive ecosystems offer a number of benefits; however, they present challenges as well. One major challenge is related to the privacy and security. A number of privacy and security models, techniques and algorithms have been proposed over a period of time. The limitation is that these solutions are primarily focused on an individual or on an isolated organizational context. There is a need to study and provide complete end-to-end solutions that ensure security and privacy throughout the data lifecycle across the ecosystem beyond the boundary of an individual system or organizational context. The results of current study provide a review of the existing privacy and security challenges and solutions using the systematic literature review (SLR) approach.

It is a diffused and complex area of knowledge due to the diversity of IoT devices and the nature of data generated by the IoT devices. Many international bodies have developed metamodels for IoT-enabled ecosystems to allow knowledge sharing. However, these are often narrow in focus and deal with only the IoT aspects without taking into account the management and analytics of big data generated by the IoT devices. Hence, in this article we propose a metamodel for the Integrated Big Data Management and Analytics (IBDMA) framework for IoT-enabled smart buildings. The IBDMA Metamodel can be used to facilitate interoperability between existing big data management and analytics ecosystems deployed in smart buildings or other smart environments.

{"title": "A Social Engagement Framework for the Government Ecosystem: Insights from Australian Government Facebook Pages\n", "abstract": " Government agencies are using social media in an ad-hoc manner for bi-directional broadcast style communication, rather than systematic and deep engagement through open participation for co-creating value. However, capabilities and practices of participation for value creation is less understood for an increasingly networked government ecosystem. This calls for the need of a structured social engagement framework for government agencies. Thus, based on an empirical analysis of over 68 federal government Facebook pages, this paper presents insights on online engagement and levels of maturity among Australian federal government Facebook pages. Informed through engagement research and social architecture lens, we propose an empirically bounded government Facebook engagement framework (GFEF) that has implications and recommendations for agency benchmarking and social engagement capability building.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2226"]}

{"title": "Constructing enhanced default theories incrementally\n", "abstract": " The main difference between various formalisms of non-monotonic reasoning is the representation of non-monotonic rules. In default logic, they are represented by special expressions called defaults. In default logic, commonsense knowledge about the world is represented as a set of named defaults. The use of defaults is popular because they reduce the complexity of the representation, and they are sufficient for knowledge representation in many naturally occurring contexts. This paper offers an incremental process to acquire defaults from human experts directly and at the same time it provides added semantics to defaults by adding priorities to defaults and creating additional relations between them. The paper uses an existing incremental framework, NRDR, to generate these defaults. This framework is chosen as it not only enables incremental context driven formulation of defaults, but also allows\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2226"]}

Traditional technology-based silos between health and emergency services are challenged by the changing needs of the community that could benefit from integrated health and safety services. Lowcost smart-home automation solutions, wearable devices and Cloud technology make it feasible for communities to interact with each other, and with health and emergency services in a timely manner.Objectives: This paper proposes a new community-based care model, supported by technology, that aims at reducing healthcare and emergency services costs while allowing community to become resilient in response to health and emergency situations.Methods: We looked at models of care in different industries and identified the type of technology that can support the suggested new model of care. Two prototypes were developed to validate the adequacy of the technology. Results: The result is a new community-based model of care called \u2018Le Bon Samaritain\u2019. It relies on a network of people called \u2018Bons Samaritains\u2019 willing to help and deal with the basic care and safety aspects of their community. Their role is to make sure that people in their community receive and understand the messages from emergency and health services. The new care model is integrated with existing emergency warning, community and health services. Conclusion: Le Bon Samaritain model is scalable, community-based and can help people feel safer, less isolated and more integrated in their community.

IBS have been widely adopted and used in developed countries; however IBS adoption in developing countries such as Jordan is still low. Lack of customer' trust is considered the most important impediment to the use of IBS in developing countries. The aim of this study is to investigate and identify the factors that influence customer's initial trust of IBS in the Jordanian context. This paper adopts the qualitative literature survey approach and reports two main categories: Human category and Information Technology category. Human category includes: personality-based trust, cognition-based trust (Reputation), Institutional-based trust (structural assurance), social factors (culture) and supporting factors (relative advantages). Information Technology category includes: website factors (security, privacy, and general online experiences)). We argue that these factors can be useful for organisations in understanding and addressing customer's initial trust about IBS in the Jordanian context.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2226"]}
