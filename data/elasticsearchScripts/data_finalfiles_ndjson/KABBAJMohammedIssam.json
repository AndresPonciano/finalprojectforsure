{"title": "A deviation management system for handling software process enactment evolution\n", "abstract": " An important problem encountered in Process-centered Software Engineering Environments (PSEE) is that software development processes are subject to permanent evolution during enactment. Without managing evolution, PSEEs are condemned to fail in being adopted in software industry. This article presents an original approach to process enactment evolution, based on formal management of process deviations. Deviations are defined as operations that violate process constraints. Once a deviation is detected, a deviation-tolerance model attached to the preset process is used to decide whether to accept or to reject the deviation.", "num_citations": "31\n", "authors": ["396"]}
{"title": "Towards an approach to improve business process models using risk management techniques\n", "abstract": " Business process management aims to create and develop value inside organizations. Though, business processes are exposed to different risks that may cause failures in their execution. In order to preserve this value, applying risk management principles in Business process management discipline has become a field that takes a lot of attention. Risk-aware Business Process Management (R-BPM) is an area that combines the advantages of Business Process Management and Risk Management. Some works tried to propose approaches for mitigating risks but only in the execution phase. Our research work aims to mitigate risks by design using a method based on a risk analysis technique HAZOP (HA-Zard OP-erability). In this paper, our objective is twofold. We will firstly introduce an approach for analyzing business process models using an adaptation of HAZOP, propose recommendations for reducing risks\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["396"]}

{"title": "Towards an active help on detecting data flow errors in business process models\n", "abstract": " Successful business process management depends on effective Workflow design, modelling and also analysis [Sun et al.(2006)]. Many analysis techniques have been developed focusing on verification and discovery of design errors. Most of them check only the control flow perspective while ignoring data. However the role of data in the workflow is important since routing constraints in a workflow are typically based on data. In addition, data flow errors can arise even when the control flow structure is correct. A workflow model containing data-flow errors can cause unexpected process interruptions, resulting in high costs to debug and fix at the execution phase. The goal of this paper is to address an important issue in workflow data analysis by active help. Recently many business process data analysis models have been proposed, offering a passive help to the analyst. Which means that when analysing a workflow, it usually consists of creating the model, incorporating data and then ensuring its correctness. Still, the correction of errors discovery doesn\u2019t guarantee that the resulting model is correct. So, it is unavoidable to revalidate the entire model to ensure its correctness. In this paper we introduce an approach for ad hoc detecting data modelling errors in business process models. It consists on applying verification when modelling. At each time, we verify the fragment of the model and correct it before to continue modelling and so, we have a complete model fragment. Thus we don\u2019t need to revalidate the entire model at the end. We present a \u201cDataRecord\u201d concept that we have used to store the last set of each data in the model and the last\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["396"]}
{"title": "Analyzing Risks in Business Process Models using a Deviational Technique\n", "abstract": " In a business environment, many processes are performing ineffectively due to different risks. Several methods and techniques for the identification and management of risks in business processes have been proposed. Some of them originate from other domains and have been adapted to the business environment such as deviational approaches. Nevertheless, there are few examples for potential applications of those methods in business process redesign. This paper addresses this gap through proposing an approach that adapts HAZOP (HA-Zard OP-erability), a systematic deviational technique, to business process environment. We discuss how this method can contribute to the improvement of business process models.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["396"]}
{"title": "Improvement of performance intrusion detection system (IDS) using artificial neural network ensemble\n", "abstract": " The main focus from one of the problems in computer networks is computer security systems because of the high threat of attack from the internet in recent years. Therefore, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that monitors the traffic of computer networks and oversight of suspicious activities in a computer network is required. Research on intrusion detection system have been carried out. Several researches have used artificial neural networks combined with a fuzzy clustering method to detect attacks. However, there is an issue that arise from the use of such algorithms. A single artificial neural network can produce overfitting on intrusion detection system output. This research used two methods of artificial neural networks, namely Lavenberg-Marquardt and Quasi-Newton to overcome that issue. Both algorithms are used to detect computer networks from attack. In addition, the use Possibilistic Fuzzy C-Means (PFCM) before going into the neural network ensemble with simple average. Then on the output, Naive Bayesian classification method is used. Dataset used in the research were NSL-KDD dataset which is an improvement of KDD Cup'99. KDDTrain+ used for training data and KDDTest+ for testing data. Evaluation results show good precision in detection of DoS (89.82%), R2L (75.78%), normal (72.25%) and Probe (70.70%). However, U2R just get 14.62%. At recall, good results achieved by normal state (91.44%), Probe (87.11%) and DoS (83.31%). Low results occurred in U2R (9.50%) and R2L (6.14%).

{"title": "LSTM-based models for earthquake prediction\n", "abstract": " Over the last few years, many works have been done in earthquake prediction using different techniques and precursors in order to warn of earthquake damages and save human lives. Plenty of works have failed to sufficiently predict earthquakes, because of the complexity and the unpredictable nature of this task. Therefore, in this work we use the powerful deep learning technique. A useful algorithm that captures complex relationships in time series data. The technique is called long short-term memory (LSTM). The work employs this method in two cases of study; the first learns all the datasets in one model, the second case learns the correlations on two divided groups considering their range of magnitude. The results show that learning decomposed datasets gives more well-functioning predictions since it exploits the nature of each type of seismic events.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["396"]}

This approach suggests a design change based on the results of risk analysis. Actually, we advocate, in this work, that risk controls can be addressed at an early stage of business process lifecycle: the design stage, so as to minimize failures during process execution. To this aim, we present a method for analyzing business process models using an adaptation of a risk analysis technique HAZOP (HA-Zard OP-erability). Afterward, we rep-resent the mechanisms used to evolve from the risk analysis phase into the design phase using patterns that implement recommendations related to a specific kind of risk controls.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["396"]}
{"title": "Process discovery: Automated approach for block discovery\n", "abstract": " Process mining is a set of techniques helping enterprises to avoid process modeling which is a time-consuming and error prone task. Process mining includes three topics: process discovery, conformance checking, and enhancement (IEEE Task Force on Process Mining: Process Mining Manifesto, 2012). The principle of process discovery is to extract information from event logs to capture the business process as it is being executed. Several techniques in literature (a algorithm, a+ algorithm and others) can be applied to discover a process model from a workflow log. However, as the amount of information grows exponentially, the log files (input of a process discovery algorithm) get bigger. In fact, classical techniques, which inspect relation between each couple of tasks will have problem dealing with big data. To this end, we introduced in (Boushaba et al., 2013) a new approach aiming to extract a block of tasks\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["396"]}

{"title": "Optimized Approach for Dynamic Adaptation of Process Models\n", "abstract": " Process model deviations when occurring can be handled by adjusting the model and considering some properties that ensure that all constraints are satisfied. However, sometimes we cannot replace the whole missing fragment and wait the full execution of the sub-activities as structured in the initial order. For example, during software development process, Coding can start while missing the Design activity, hence deviation is raised. We have to put in place the adjusted fragments to ensure that coding will be done correctly; In other words, producing a Design-Model artifact before completing the coding will remediate to the deviation and minimize the risk. In this article, we will suggest a new approach that considers criticality and dependency of the sub-activities pertaining to the missing fragment and handles the deviation smartly and quickly.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["396"]}

The combination of PSO and GA is used for weight initialization to improve the computational process and minimize the errors. CG method can change every learning rate of neural network, so that the addition of CG can increase the rate of convergence. PSO, by its calculation velocity, can get quickly the solutions and GA act to expand the searching area of PSO solution. This new algorithm is called CN-PSOGA.
