{"title": "A technique for quality evaluation of e-learning from developers perspective\n", "abstract": " Problem statement: E-learning is gaining more acceptance as days pass because it provides learning opportunity any time and in any place. Different people have different preferences in terms of learning style such as reading text, listing audio or video, speaking and communication. To support these different learning preferences, there is need for multiple e-learning delivery methods and teaching techniques. Furthermore, there are many stakeholders of e-learning systems such as system developers, administrators, instructors, instructional designers, multimedia designers, online facilitators, independent evaluators. Whose views are important indicators for a complete e-learning system evaluation, but the most important views of e-learning quality are user view, developer\u2019s view and manger\u2019s view. Approach: The main aim of this study is to propose a new technique to evaluate e-learning website quality from developer\u2019s view. To achieve our objective an extensive study on related resources was conducted. Our technique adopts the weights of quality characteristics which are obtained by carefully selected questionnaires\u2019 from professional developers. We also present the evaluation process using AHP technique and the result of trial evaluation for validation of our technique Result: We proposed four quality characteristics named Service Content, System Functionality, Information Technology and System Reliability. We further, proposed 11 subcharacteristics with its attributes by following the structure of standard IOS/IEC 912. Conclusion: Our results show that the proposed technique could be useful and effective for ensuring that high quality\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "77\n", "authors": ["1240"]}
{"title": "A mapping study to investigate component-based software system metrics\n", "abstract": " A component-based software system (CBSS) is a software system that is developed by integrating components that have been deployed independently. In the last few years, many researchers have proposed metrics to evaluate CBSS attributes. However, the practical use of these metrics can be difficult. For example, some of the metrics have concepts that either overlap or are not well defined, which could hinder their implementation. The aim of this study is to understand, classify and analyze existing research in component-based metrics, focusing on approaches and elements that are used to evaluate the quality of CBSS and its components from a component consumer's point of view. This paper presents a systematic mapping study of several metrics that were proposed to measure the quality of CBSS and its components. We found 17 proposals that could be applied to evaluate CBSSs, while 14 proposals could\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "64\n", "authors": ["1240"]}
{"title": "Toward unified DevOps model\n", "abstract": " DevOps community advocates collaboration between development and operations staff during software deployment. However this collaboration may cause a conceptual deficit. This paper proposes a Unified DevOps Model (UDOM) in order to overcome the conceptual deficit. Firstly, the origin of conceptual deficit is discussed. Secondly, UDOM model is introduced that includes three sub-models: application and data model, workflow execution model and infrastructure model. UDOM model can help to scale down deployment time, mitigate risk, satisfy customer requirements, and improve productivity. Finally, this paper can be a roadmap for standardization DevOps terminologies, concepts, patterns, cultures, and tools.", "num_citations": "42\n", "authors": ["1240"]}
{"title": "Component-based software system dependency metrics based on component information flow measurements\n", "abstract": " The motivation of this paper is that the measurement based on the flow of information connecting software components can be used to evaluate component-based software system dependency. The ability to measure system dependency implies the capability to locate weakness in the system design and to determine the level of software quality. In this paper, dependency between components is considered as a major factor affecting the structural design of Component-based software System (CBSS). Two sets of metrics namely, Component Information Flow Metrics and Component Coupling Metrics are proposed based on the concept of Component Information Flow from CBSS designer\u2019s point of view. We also discuss the motivation for and possible uses of system level metrics and component level metrics. Initial results from our on-going empirical evaluation indicate that the proposed metrics are very intuitive.", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["1240"]}
{"title": "Multidimentional size measure for design of component-based software system\n", "abstract": " The motivation of this study is to bridge the gap between component providers and component users, especially in the area of component evaluation, using component information flow (CIF) measurement and multidimensional approaches for measurement interpretation. By measuring the design of component-based software systems (CBSS), software designers, testers and maintainers may be able to locate weaknesses in the system design and to estimate the effort required to test as well as the cost of maintenance. This study proposes a CIF based on inter-component flow and intra-component flow. Moreover, a set of metrics based on the CIF was developed to characterise and evaluate the effect of the component design size on the quality of CBSS design. The theoretical evaluation results indicated that the proposed metrics are valid size measures.

{"title": "Complexity metrics for component-based software systems: developer perspective\n", "abstract": " Background: A Component-Based Development (CBD) is an integration centric system focusing on assembling individual components in order to build a software system. Most of the existing CBD metrics rely on parameters that are too difficult to measure in practice due to the component\u2019s internal elements may not be visible to developers or testers. Objective: We proposed two suite of metrics to measure the structural complexity and interaction complexity of Component-Based Software System (CBSS) from perspective of component developer. Methods: Based on the analysis of the component specification, the elements of interface which includes properties, methods and events are measured. The proposed metrics quality is evaluated from a mathematical perspective using BMB properties. Finding: The theoretical evaluation results indicated that the proposed metrics are valid internal measures. The proposed metrics are useful in understanding and identifying the areas in the design where improvements are likely to have a high attention. Thus, the proposed metrics appear promising as a means of capturing the quality of the CBSS design in question. Application/Improvements: It has been widely reported that lower complexity is believed to provide advantages such as lower maintenance time, easier to test, highly reusable and easier to understand.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1240"]}
