{"title": "Finding collaborative innovation networks through correlating performance with social network structure\n", "abstract": " This paper contributes to the ongoing stream of research correlating social network structure with individual and organizational performance. While teaching a course on optimizing online communication behaviour and social network analysis, we collected preliminary data on the relationship between dynamic social network structures and individual and team performance. Students from Helsinki University of Technology and University of Cologne, who had never met face to face, formed virtual interdisciplinary teams collaborating on a common task, the communication analysis of online communities. As part of their task, students correlated performance of the community they were analysing with social network structure. In this research, we compare social network structure and individual and team performance of participants in a multi-user online computer game with social network structure and performance\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "155\n", "authors": ["2224"]}

{"title": "Adopting SAFe to scale agile in a globally distributed organization\n", "abstract": " Large software development organizations adopting agile methods need solutions and models to help scale agile to fit their needs. During recent years, several frameworks for scaling agile have been created by consultants, including the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), Large-scale Scrum (LeSS) and Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD). However, research on how these frameworks are adopted in practice is seriously lacking. In this paper we describe how Comptel, a globally distributed software development company, adopted the SAFe framework in two business lines. Based on eleven interviews we present why and how the organization adopted SAFe, and discuss related challenges and success factors. The comparison of the two adoptions showed that investing in SAFe trainings, engaging people and change agents, hiring a coach, investing in a full-time release train engineer, preparing well for the first\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "99\n", "authors": ["2224"]}
{"title": "Communication needs, practices and supporting structures in global inter-organizational software development projects\n", "abstract": " This paper presents communication needs, supporting structures and communication practices collected from global software development projects. The data was gathered by 32 interviews from seven global interorganizational projects. We identified four important communication needs: problem solving, informing and monitoring, relationship building, and decision-making and coordination. Structures supporting communication were: organizational structure with communicating roles, partial synchronization of intra-organizational processes, and project level coordination. Communication practices are built upon and facilitated by these structures. A surprising finding was that companies rarely had any company level practices that were used in all interorganizational projects. Instead, the practices were formed by trial and error and were mainly project specific.", "num_citations": "44\n", "authors": ["2224"]}

However, its adoption in industry has often been problematic, partly due to social challenges. However, there is little knowledge of the exact nature of the challenges, and how different stakeholders perceive the need for and adoption of continuous integration. In this paper, we describe how the introduction of continuous integration was perceived by different stakeholders in a R&D program at Ericsson. The case provided a rare opportunity to study the adoption of continuous integration in a large distributed organization. We interviewed 27 stakeholders and found differing perceptions of continuous integration: how suitable it is for the organization, how adoption should be organized, and whether it is possible to achieve sufficient quality through automated testing. These differences of perception were mainly consequences of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "36\n", "authors": ["2224"]}
{"title": "Communication Practices in Inter-Organisational Product Development\n", "abstract": " Geographically distributed, inter-organisational product development projects are becoming increasingly common. However, companies face challenges in managing this kind of complicated projects. Most of the challenges are related to communication. This study focused on communication needs, problems and practices in distributed inter-organisational product development projects.  The main objective was to identify and describe successful communication practices. In addition, the study aimed to increase the understanding of the communication needs behind the practices, as well as to identify communication problems and unsuccessful practices. From the methodological point of view, studying daily communication in distributed projects is challenging. In this study we experimented with the usage of social process simulation as a tool to study communication.  Methodologically, the research was a qualitative multiple-case study consisting of 12 case projects. The cases were grouped into two separate studies according to the industry. Study 1 concentrated on distributed inter-organisational projects that developed plastic products, whereas Study 2 examined global software development projects. In Study 1, data was collected using the social process simulation method, which combines several data collection methods, such as semi-structured interviews and simulation sessions. In Study 2, semi-structured interviews were used.  The main contribution of this research is a set of eighteen successful communication practices that were identified in distributed product development projects. The practices include, e.g., frequent deliveries, the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "27\n", "authors": ["2224"]}

The data was gathered by ten semi-structured interviews: we interviewed four coaches and six persons from the coached projects. We describe how the coaches cooperated with the case projects, helping them to adopt agile practices. We present the challenges the projects faced, as well as the benefits they gained. Our results show that when coaching globally distributed projects it is especially important to gain executive support from all the sites, to involve all sites in the change process, to build a common vision in a collaborative workshop, to invite coaches as early as possible, to aim for a long-term coaching relationship, and to remember that the project team owns the change\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["2224"]}

There is data publicly available on how these information sources and media channels are being used, which could potentially be analyzed for their effects on the election process. This chapter aims to determine if social media, Internet traffic, and traditional media data can be used to predict elections by searching for patterns between the data and poll numbers for 2016 US Republican and Democratic primaries. The results suggest that machine learning models with linear regression can produce quite accurate predictions; also statistically significant correlations were found between polls and betting odds and polls and Facebook page likes.

Differences in understanding historical events can lead to intercultural misinterpretation and conflicts that cause negative consequences for international relations. We identified the most important historical events, mined cross-cultural relations, investigated word usage in war-related pages and performed network, complexity, and sentiment analysis. We also analyzed the usage of war-related words and the quantity of war-related events mentioned in different languages. Our findings suggest that World War I and World War II are the most important historical events within English, French, and German cultures and English Wikipedia contains more violence and war-related content, with a higher level of complexity than other\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["2224"]}
{"title": "Communication in Networked Product Development-A Case Study\n", "abstract": " New products are increasingly developed in inter-company networks. There are several benefits arising from collaboration between firms, eg, speeding up product development; obtaining resources, knowledge or technology; and sharing costs and risks. However, several studies have shown that the objectives of a collaboration are not always met (eg Bruce et al, 1995). Many of the problems leading to unsuccessful collaborative projects originate from a lack of communication and trust (Wynstra et al, 2001; Bruce et al, 1995). Moreover, previous communication research studying intra-organisational projects has shown that effective and efficient communication is a prerequisite for the success of a project (Moenaert et al, 2000) and that the better the product development team members are connected to each other and to key external parties, the more successful the project is going to be (Tushman & Katz, 1980).This study hypotheses that successful communication is even more important for networked, inter-organisational product development projects than it is for intraorganisational projects, since these networked projects face barriers that are not so common in intra-organisational projects, such as geographical distance and differences in organisational culture and operating procedures. Arranging successful co-operation, and especially communication, in spite of these barriers, poses new challenges and brings out several questions: What are the needs for communication of networked new product development projects? How should communication be arranged? When should communication take place? What kind of information should be\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["2224"]}

{"title": "Benefits and Challenges of Adopting SAFe-An Empirical Survey\n", "abstract": " During the last two decades, turbulent business environments tempted firms to adopt agile methods to cope with the everchanging customer demands. The success of agile methods in small and co-located teams inspired companies to apply them to large-scale endeavors. Agile scaling frameworks, such as the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), have been proposed by practitioners to scale agile practices to large projects and enterprises. Companies are increasingly taking these frameworks into use. However, the number of quantitative empirical studies assessing the benefits and challenges of adopting the agile scaling frameworks is still limited. This paper starts filling in this gap by presenting the results from a survey of 100 industry participants around the world on their perception of the benefits and challenges of adopting the SAFe framework. Our results show that the SAFe adoption improves transparency, as well as collaboration and dependency management between agile teams. The most commonly mentioned challenges of the SAFe adoption are organizational politics, difficulties in establishing an agile mindset, change resistance, and team formation challenges.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["2224"]}
{"title": "Evolution of the Agile Scaling Frameworks\n", "abstract": " Over the past decade, agile methods have become the favored choice for projects undertaken in rapidly changing environments. The success of agile methods in small, co-located projects has inspired companies to apply them in larger projects. Agile scaling frameworks, such as Large Scale Scrum and Scaled Agile Framework, have been invented by practitioners to scale agile to large projects and organizations. Given the importance of agile scaling frameworks, research on those frameworks is still limited. This paper presents our findings from an empirical survey answered by the methodologists of 15 agile scaling frameworks. We explored (i) framework evolution,(ii) main reasons behind their creation,(iii) benefits, and (iv) challenges of adopting these frameworks. The most common reasons behind creating the frameworks were improving the organization\u2019s agility and collaboration between agile teams. The most commonly claimed benefits included enabling frequent deliveries and enhancing employee satisfaction, motivation, and engagement. The most mentioned challenges were using frameworks as cooking recipes instead of focusing on changing people\u2019s culture and mindset.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["2224"]}
