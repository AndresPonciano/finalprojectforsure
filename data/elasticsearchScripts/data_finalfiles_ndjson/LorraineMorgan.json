Drawing on three case studies of service providers and their customers, this study will contribute to the existing cloud technologies literature that does not address the complex and multifaceted nature of adoption. The findings are analyzed using the adoption of innovation literature as a lens to reveal how technological, organizational and environmental factors impact cloud adoption.

In a traditional \u2018closed innovation\u2019 model all new business development processes and marketing and development of new products takes place within the boundaries of the organization. This approach is characterized by firms that invest in their own R&D, employing smart and talented people to surpass their competitors in new product and service development. Additionally, after producing a stream of new ideas and inventions, firms must thoroughly defend their intellectual property against the competition. Open innovation, on the other hand, fundamentally challenges how organizations innovate new product development ideas by extending the pool from which ideas are drawn. This model is concerned with combining internal and external ideas, as well as internal and external paths to market, to stimulate and advance the development of new products and technologies. This approach suggests that firms develop processes to ensure a flow of ideas across its boundaries because not all smart people work for the organization and there is an increasing geographical dispersion of knowledge. Although firms may not exclusively develop all the research they use, they can still profit from it. In addition, firms may acquire relevant IP and integrate it into their internal processes.

{"title": "An analysis of COSPA\u2013a consortium for open source in the public administration\n", "abstract": " This paper reflects on a two-year EU funded specific research targeted project that officially began in January 2004 entitled COSPA, a Consortium for studying, evaluating and supporting the introduction of Open Source Software and Open Data Standards in the Public Administration. COSPA focuses on office automation and desktop system software and aims at rigorously measuring the effort, costs and benefits of a transition to Open Source. The project involves 15 European Universities and Public Administrations from Italy, Hungary, Ireland, Denmark, UK, Belgium and about sixty observers, including the University of Alberto (Canada), Victoria University of Wellington (New Zealand) and the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO).", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["921"]}
{"title": "Cloud Computing: An Exploration of Factors Impacting Adoption\n", "abstract": " The rapid emergence, prevalence, and potential impact of cloud computing has sparked a significant amount of interest among IS and IT industry and research. It has \u201cthe potential to transform a large part of the IT industry\u201d(Armbrust et al., 2010) and be a \u201ccatalyst for innovation\u201d as cloud computing becomes \u201ccheaper and ubiquitous\u201d(Brynjolfsson et al., 2010). A recent survey of 527 large and midsize organizations revealed that three in every four are using cloud adoption to gain competitive advantage either through agility, increased innovation, reduced costs or scalability, or indeed through a combination of these (HBR and Verizon, 2014).There are, however, a number of limitations of the current cloud computing body of knowledge. For example, research efforts have been largely dedicated to addressing technical problems (Khajeh-Hosseini et al., 2010; Leimeister et al., 2010). Moreover, the perceived benefits and challenges of cloud computing lack strong empirical validation, as despite a small amount of research (eg Iyer and Henderson, 2010), the body of knowledge is comprised of position papers (eg Armbrust et al., 2009, 2010) and relies heavily on anecdotal evidence found mainly in white papers, web articles, technical reports, and practitioner papers (Morgan and Conboy, 2013). A key issue not being addressed in current research is that many cloud adopters are still experiencing substantial difficulties in their attempts to effectively leverage the transformational business capabilities afforded by cloud computing (Linthicum, 2012; Da Silva et al., 2013). We argue that this lack of success is due to a failure to address the true nature of cloud\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["921"]}

{"title": "A theoretical framework for examining IT governance in living laboratory ecosystems\n", "abstract": " In recent years Living Labs, which embody an open innovation milieu, have gained currency as representing a salient catalyst for Smart City research and development. However, the current body of Living Lab research, in conjunction with the fragmented isolated nature of existing Living Labs dispersed across the European Union (EU), indicate that a lack of common standardised IT governance procedures are currently being operationalised. While cross border pan European Living Lab initiatives are emerging to rectify this issue, further research is warranted to better understand the role of IT governance in Living Labs and identify how varying IT governance mechanisms impact the effectiveness of open innovation processes. Thus, this paper begins a theory building process for examining IT governance in living labs. The paper concludes by presenting a conceptual framework for future testing.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["921"]}
{"title": "Crowdsourcing and crowdfunding mechanisms for scientific research funding Agencies\u2013A Preliminary Entity Categorisation Matrix (PECM)\n", "abstract": " Research has shown that crowdsourcing and crowdfunding are accelerators and facilitators of societal, business and institutional change, presenting numerous potential benefits to the triple helix of government, industry and university. Scientific Research Funding Agencies play an important role in the triple helix and play an important role in the development and instantiation of public policy. E-participation and e-government platforms have invited a new actor to the triple helix in the form of the crowd. The citizen as a member of the crowd presents potential solutions to public needs. This paper shows that whereas numerous models are available for the private and public use of crowdsourcing and crowdfunding, a limited number of models are available for use by science funding agencies. Accordingly, this research in progress paper attempts to fill this gap by examining the actors involved in the crowd process and presenting a preliminary categorisation of the associated types of users of the crowd. This paper is part of an overall project that focuses on building a suitable crowd model for these agencies. The research herein advances a Preliminary Entity Categorisation Model (PECM) to facilitate this process.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["921"]}
{"title": "Opening up the Agile Innovation Process\n", "abstract": " The objective of this panel is to discuss how firms can operate both an open and agile innovation process. In an era of unprecedented changes, companies need to be open and agile in order to adapt rapidly and maximize their innovation processes. Proponents of agile methods claim that one of the main distinctions between agile methods and their traditional bureaucratic counterparts is their drive toward creativity and innovation. However, agile methods are rarely adopted in their textbook, \u201cvanilla\u201d format, and are usually adopted in part or are tailored or modified to suit the organization. While we are aware that this happens, there is still limited understanding of what is actually happening in practice. Using innovation adoption theory, this panel will discuss the issues and challenges surrounding the successful adoption of agile practices. In addition, this panel will report on the obstacles and benefits\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["921"]}
