{"title": "Improving collaborative filtering based recommenders using topic modelling\n", "abstract": " Standard Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms make use of interactions between users and items in the form of implicit or explicit ratings alone for generating recommendations. Similarity among users or items is calculated purely based on rating overlap in this case, without considering explicit properties of users or items involved, limiting their applicability in domains with very sparse rating spaces. In many domains such as movies, news or electronic commerce recommenders, considerable contextual data in text form describing item properties is available along with the rating data, which could be utilized to improve recommendation quality. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve standard CF based recommenders by utilizing latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to learn latent properties of items, expressed in terms of topic proportions, derived from their textual description. We infer user's topic\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "33\n", "authors": ["1098"]}

Traditional clustering algorithms are inadequate in this context, as a multidimensional feature vector represents a subscriber profile at an instant of time, and grouping of subscribers needs to consider variation of subscriber preferences across time. Clustering in this case usually requires complex multivariate time series analysis\u2010based models. Because conventional time series clustering models have limitations around scalability and ability to accurately represent temporal behaviour sequences (TBS) of users, that may be short, noisy, and non\u2010stationary, we propose a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) based model to represent temporal behaviour of mobile subscribers as compact and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1098"]}

{"title": "Automatically Optimized Gradient Boosting Trees for Classifying Large Volume High Cardinality Data Streams Under Concept Drift\n", "abstract": " Data abundance along with scarcity of machine learning experts and domain specialists necessitates progressive automation of end-to-end machine learning workflows. To this end, Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has emerged as a prominent research area. Real world data often arrives as streams or batches, and data distribution evolves over time causing concept drift. Models need to handle data that is not independent and identically distributed (iid), and transfer knowledge across time through continuous self-evaluation and adaptation adhering to resource constraints. Creating autonomous self-maintaining models which not only discover an optimal pipeline, but also automatically adapt to concept drift to operate in a lifelong learning setting was the crux of NeurIPS 2018 AutoML challenge.

{"title": "Scene recognition by combining local and global image descriptors\n", "abstract": " Object recognition is an important problem in computer vision, having diverse applications. In this work, we construct an end-to-end scene recognition pipeline consisting of feature extraction, encoding, pooling and classification. Our approach simultaneously utilize global feature descriptors as well as local feature descriptors from images, to form a hybrid feature descriptor corresponding to each image. We utilize DAISY features associated with key points within images as our local feature descriptor and histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) corresponding to an entire image as a global descriptor. We make use of a bag-of-visual-words encoding and apply Mini- Batch K-Means algorithm to reduce the complexity of our feature encoding scheme. A 2-level pooling procedure is used to combine DAISY and HOG features corresponding to each image. Finally, we experiment with a multi-class SVM classifier with several kernels, in a cross-validation setting, and tabulate our results on the fifteen scene categories dataset. The average accuracy of our model was 76.4% in the case of a 40%-60% random split of images into training and testing datasets respectively. The primary objective of this work is to clearly outline the practical implementation of a basic screne-recognition pipeline having a reasonable accuracy, in python, using open-source libraries.

Traditionally, customer segmentation using clustering algorithms is performed using a single attribute set.

Multi-view clustering provides a meaningful way to combine groupings in different feature subsets by assigning customers to multiple segments, representing different perspectives of customer behavior.

{"title": "Mobile subscriber fingerprinting: A big data approach\n", "abstract": " Mobile advertising campaigns must use subscriber data to target subscribers relevant to the product or service being recommended. However, the matching of recommendations to subscribers is most often inexact, and no straightforward \u201cattribute-value\u201d matching algorithm suffices. Arbitrary matching degrades subscriber experience and results in lower conversion rates.One viable solution is to cluster subscribers by common attributes, and then match recommendations with the same attributes to subscribers in the associated cluster. This approach presents a few significant challenges in the data architecture: the clusters are extremely large and need not have exact boundaries, and their representation must facilitate real-time recommendations. We describe here a novel architecture which we call subscriber \u201cfingerprinting\u201d. The proposed system is capable of analyzing extremely large volumes of data (in the order of terabytes) using sophisticated large scale distributed Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) operations followed by distributed data analytics involving statistical models. The insights generated from this process can be used to serve personalized recommendations in real-time.
