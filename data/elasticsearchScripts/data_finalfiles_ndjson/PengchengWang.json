{"title": "CCSharp: An efficient three-phase code clone detector using modified PDGs\n", "abstract": " Detecting code clones in software systems is becoming more and more important with the blossom of open source projects. In spite of numerous active researches, there is still a lack of detecting clones especially high-level clones efficiently and accurately. In this paper, we present CCSharp, a three-phase PDG-based clone detector which can detect much more clones besides high-level ones in software systems. To solve the problem of PDG-based tool's high time cost, we adopt two strategies to decrease the overall computing quantity of our tool: PDG's structure modification and characteristic vector filtering. In PDG's structure modification, we propose a novel technique to merge procedure invocation nodes which can make clone detection get rid of influence of procedure's parameters and disguise as well as downscale PDG's structure. We proceed clone detection on both real-world and artificial codebase by\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["1005"]}
{"title": "Duplication detection in news articles based on big data\n", "abstract": " Electronic media has been developing rapidly nowadays, resulting in a large number of news articles produced online, and thus duplication detection is needed. Besides, articles duplication is directly related to articles plagiarism. Existing studies on news articles duplication detection mainly focus on newspaper articles, and we further explore the duplication detection in news articles from the newest online We Media data. In this paper, we propose a tool, NDFinder, using fingerprinting technique with hash index to detect articles duplication. To validate our proposed approach, we crawled a total number of 33,244 news articles data for detection. The results show that our tool accurately detects 2,150 duplicate articles, and the overall precision reaches 97%. Moreover, we apply our approach to detect plagiarism articles based on our duplication results, and we successfully identify 64 pairs of plagiarism articles in our\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1005"]}
