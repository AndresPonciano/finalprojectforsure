{"title": "Cationic polymer intercalation into the lipid membrane enables intact polyplex DNA escape from endosomes for gene delivery\n", "abstract": " Developing improved cationic polymer\u2013DNA polyplexes for gene delivery requires improved understanding of DNA transport from endosomes into the nucleus. Using a FRET-capable oligonucleotide molecular beacon (OMB), we monitored the transport of intact DNA to cell organelles. We observed that for effective (jetPEI) and ineffective (G5 PAMAM) vectors, the fraction of cells displaying intact OMB in the cytosol (jetPEI \u226b G5 PAMAM) quantitatively predicted the fraction expressing transgene (jetPEI \u226b G5 PAMAM). Intact OMB delivered with PAMAM and confined to endosomes could be released to the cytosol by the subsequent addition of L-PEI, with a corresponding 10-fold increase in transgene expression. These results suggest that future vector development should optimize vectors for intercalation into, and destabilization of, the endosomal membrane.

Here we describe the symmetry-directed design of an extremely stable, enzymatically active, hollow protein cage of Mr \u2248 2.1 MDa with dimensions similar to those of a small icosahedral virus. The cage was constructed based on icosahedral symmetry by genetically fusing a trimeric protein (TriEst) to a small pentameric de novo-designed coiled coil domain, separated by a flexible oligo-glycine linker sequence. Screening a small library of designs in which the linker length varied from 2 to 12 residues identified a construct containing 8 glycine residues (Ico8) that formed well-defined cages.

We probed the structure of immobilized peptides using spectroscopic methods and correlated such structural information to the measured antimicrobial activity.

In this work, we demonstrate a folic acid (FA)-triggered exosite binding of a generation five poly(amidoamine) (G5 PAMAM) dendrimer scaffold to bovine folate binding protein (bFBP). The protein exosite is a secondary binding site on the protein surface, separate from the FA binding pocket, to which the dendrimer binds. Exosite binding is required to achieve the greatly enhanced binding constants and protein structural change observed in this study. The G5Ac-COG-FA1.0 conjugate bound tightly to bFBP, was not displaced by a 28-fold excess of FA, and quenched roughly 80% of the initial fluorescence. Two-step binding kinetics were measured using the intrinsic fluorescence of the FBP tryptophan residues to give a KD in the low nanomolar range for formation of the initial G5Ac-COG-FA1.0\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["92"]}

However, very few studies have been conducted on understanding the fundamental interactions between TMDs and other molecules including biological molecules, making the rational design of TMD-based sensors (including biosensors) difficult.
