{"title": "Problems in measuring effectiveness in software process improvement: A longitudinal study of organizational change at Danske Data\n", "abstract": " Software process improvement (SPI) is a widely recognized approach that software companies implement to improve quality, productivity, and time-to-market. Assessing and analyzing performance improvements are important SPI activities. However, many SPI managers have found it difficult to develop and implement effective performance measurement programs for SPI, in part because guidelines for conducting SPI measurements are scarce. We address this gap in the SPI literature by examining major problems that SPI change agents encounter when developing and implementing SPI measurement programs. We report on a longitudinal study of an SPI change initiative and the challenges that the SPI Team faced in dealing with the issues of measuring effectiveness of the initiative. We systematically analyze an SPI performance measurement program to understand its limitations and the problems that the SPI\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "77\n", "authors": ["1368"]}
{"title": "Cultivation and engineering of a software metrics program\n", "abstract": " This paper reports from a case study of an organization that implements a software metrics program to measure the effects of its improvement efforts. The program measures key indicators of all completed projects and summarizes progress information in a quarterly management report. The implementation turns out to be long and complex, as the organization is confronted with dilemmas based on contradictory demands and value conflicts. The process is interpreted as a combination of a rational engineering process in which a metrics program is constructed and put into use, and an evolutionary cultivation process in which basic values of the software organization are confronted and transformed. The analysis exemplifies the difficulties and challenges that software organizations face when bringing known principles for software metrics programs into practical use.

Evaluating tools for collaborative writing and editing\n", "abstract": " Businesses and other organizations are relying increasingly on virtual teams to perform a range of business activities. A key challenge in utilizing virtual teams is to support collaboration among team members who are separated by distance and/or time. In this paper we use a research model based on a combination of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Task Technology Fit (TTF) model to examine two approaches to supporting students in collaboratively creating and editing a report for an introductory course in information systems. In our study, one group of students used MS Word with Track Changes turned on combined with emailing the document among students. A second group was provided access to a wiki where they created the report. Results show that students found the Word and email combination more useful and easier to use than the wiki environment in completing the project. Further, there was no perceived difference in the effort of collaboration between the two methods. This study raises questions about the widely held belief that web-based collaboration platforms are superior to emailing documents among collaborators.", "num_citations": "40\n", "authors": ["1368"]}

{"title": "Problem diagnosis software process improvement\n", "abstract": " This paper addresses software process improvement. In particular it reports on action research undertaken to understand the problems with software processes of a large Danish company. It is argued that in order to understand what the specific problems are we may, on the one hand, rely on process models like CMM or Bootstrap. On the other hand, we may also see the specific and unique features of software processes in this company through what we call problem diagnosis. Problem diagnosis deals with eliciting problems perceived by software project managers and with forming commitment structures to enable process improvement to effectively take place. It is argued that problem diagnosis a useful approach and that it has advantages over model-based assessment.

Main concerns in such a SPI program includes creating commitment towards SPI, involving all parts of the organization in the SPI program, and creating opportunities for learning. We suggest the use of project assessments to support SPI programs in addressing these and other important concerns. In this paper we present two techniques to perform project assessments. The paper contains actual results from applying the two techniques in two longitudinal SPI projects in Danske Data and L.M. Ericsson Denmark.

{"title": "An Examination of the Characteristics Impacting Collaborative Tool Efficacy: The Uncanny Valley of Collaborative Tools.\n", "abstract": " As collaboration among teams that are distributed in time and space is becoming increasingly important, there is a need to understand the efficacy of tools available to support that collaboration. This study employs a combination of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Task-Technology Fit (TTF) model to compare four different technologies used to support the task of collaboratively creating and editing a report. The characteristics of the four technologies operationalize different collaborative processes and quality of the editor enabling the examination of how well each addresses previously identified challenges to electronic collaboration. The study compared the use of MS Word combined with emailing the document among collaborators, Twiki, Google Docs, and Office Live by university students to collaboratively write a research paper. The study measured Task-Technology Fit, Perceived Ease of Use, and Perceived Usefulness of the technologies. The findings suggest that certain technological factors associated with the collaborative tool can impact effective use of the tool. A powerful interface with which the user has some experience is necessary, and support for distributed collaboration can be the distinguishing factor in making a tool an effective collaborative writing and editing technology. Our study suggests that Word/email and Google Docs outperform Twiki and Office Live due to tool experience and superior Task-Technology Fit that may be due to the sophistication of the writing and editing tool, support for collaboration, and the clarity of the collaboration process.We speculate that the surprisingly poor showing for Office Live is\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1368"]}

{"title": "The Impact of Experience and Technology Change on Task-Technology Fit of a Collaborative Technology.\n", "abstract": " This study continues a long running effort to examine collaborative writing and editing tools and the factors that impact Task-Technology Fit and Technology Acceptance. Previous studies found that MS Word/email performed better than technologies such as Twiki, Google Docs, and Office Live. The current study seeks to examine specifically the impact of experience on these outcomes. Fortuitously, during the course of the study, Office Live was redesigned and renamed as Office 365, thus also allowing the examination of tool characteristics. In contrast to previous studies, Google Docs and Office 365 now performed significantly better than MS Word/email on the outcome measures despite users having significantly more experience with the latter. We speculate that as users gain experience with tools that perform the collaborative writing and editing task differently than did past tools, they perceive that the old technology no longer fits the task as well and thus it performs lower on outcome measures. We also observed that even though the Word/email technology did not change during the time of the study, its scores went down, possibly due to users\u2019 experience with newer technologies more suited to the task.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1368"]}

The desire to investigate ERP solutions was brought about by their recent adoption of Lean Manufacturing and its associated kaizen events, which allowed them to change their business processes very quickly. However, their homegrown IT systems are difficult to change, and cannot always accommodate the rapid changes in the business processes. IT management wants to adopt a new ERP system to replace many of their existing homegrown systems. This process is complicated by the need for significant flexibility in the adopted system, by a desire to standardize platforms across all companies held by Braebill, and by a previous effort by a sister company to adopt an ERP system.
