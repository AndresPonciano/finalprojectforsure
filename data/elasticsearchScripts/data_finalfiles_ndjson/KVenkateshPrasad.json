{"title": "Using deformable templates to infer visual speech dynamics\n", "abstract": " The visual image of a talker provides information complementary to the acoustic speech waveform, and enables improved recognition accuracy, especially in environments corrupted by high acoustic noise or multiple talkers. Because most of the phonologically relevant visual information is from the mouth and lips, it is important to infer accurately and robustly their dynamics; moreover it is desirable to extract this information without the use of invasive markers or patterned illumination. We describe the use of deformable templates for speechreading, in order to infer the dynamics of lip contours throughout an image sequence. Template computations can be done relatively quickly and the resulting small number of shape description parameters are quite robust to visual noise and variations in illumination. Such templates delineate the inside of the mouth, so that the teeth and the tongue can also be found.< >", "num_citations": "154\n", "authors": ["896"]}

In this paper an in-focus image is used to provide radiance information.

A defocused image is modeled as the combinatorial outcome of the depths and intensities of the volume elements (voxels) of an opaque 3-D object. A large depth-of-field image is used to constrain the intensities of the voxels. The depths of voxels are estimated from a highly defocused image by using simulated annealing to solve a constrained optimization problem. It is concluded that the method provides a framework for high-resolution depth recovery from defocused images. The method is computationally-intensive; however, it is amenable to parallel processing and is well suited for small field-of-interest applications.< >", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["896"]}

The existing data aggregation algorithms have proven that compressed sensing (CS) is promising for energy efficient data aggregation. However, these methods compromise on at least one of energy efficiency, on-node computational complexity and recovery fidelity. In this paper, we propose a novel CS-aided low-complexity compressed data aggregation (LCCDA) method that divides the network into constrained overlapped clusters thereby offering an optimal trade-off among energy consumption, on-node computational complexity and recovery error. We show that the measurement matrix constructed from constrained overlapped clustering satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP) that guarantees the recovery of the aggregated data\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["896"]}

Among the factors causing postharvest losses, improper harvesting method is major one, which affects postharvest quality and shelf life of mango fruits. Hence, an attempt was made to observe the response of mango towards harvesting method. For this study, four commercial cultivars of mango (Amrapali, Chausa, Dushehariand, and Langra) grown at ICAR-IARI, New Delhi were selected. Fruits were harvested manually and mechanically at full maturity, desaped, pre-cooled and stored in corrugated fibre board boxes (CFB) at ambient conditions for 10 days. Observations on various postharvest loss parameters were recorded, right from harvesting, till the end of shelf-life. Results revealed that significant differences occurred among cultivars and storage days in both manual and mechanically harvested fruits. Further, mechanical harvesting was found efficient not only in controlling quantitative loss but also maintained postharvest quality and increased shelf-life significantly. Interestingly, cultivar Amrapali and Dushehari were recorded as more responsive towards mechanical harvesting as they exhibited for less postharvest losses and maintained better quality than Langra and Chausa. Thus, mechanical harvesting and knowledge of cultivar response towards mechanical harvesting will help growers in reducing postharvest losses and increasing shelf-life and quality of mango fruits.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["896"]}

{"title": "Rootstock mediated effect on fruit ripening behaviour and phytochemical composition: an overview\n", "abstract": " Rootstock plays an important role in propagating fruit trees and is being used in fruit production for more than 200 years. Yield, market value and fruit quality depend on grower's decisions on cultivation and harvesting practices, one of such factor is selection of rootstock, which mediates not only ripening behaviour, but also phytochemical composition of fruit. Fruit ripening behaviour is the series of physiological and biochemical events, exhibited by the fruit during its ripening process. Earliness and delay in ripening, ripening rate, fruit colour, firmness, chemical constituents and postharvest shelf life are the result of ripening behaviour and in turn affect the phytochemical composition of fruit as well. Rootstock mediates its role through absorption of water, nutrient and mineral translocation, source-sink rate, hydraulic and stomatal conductivity, dwarfness, photosynthesis, regulation and signalling of plant growth hormones, mRNA, gene expression, and phloem proteins transport. This impact on fruit ripening and composition occurs in both positive and negative way. Any rootstock species found to be the best choice for a particular scion cultivar, however, showed worst choice for another cultivar. Rootstock selection affects fruit quality attributes and thereby consumer liking and acceptance. It also serve as a method of enhancing phytochemicals, nutritional security and enhanced quality of postharvest products. Knowledge of rootstock mediated effect on fruit ripening and phytochemical composition can play a major role to evolve rootstock-scion combinations for enhanced postharvest quality of fruits.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["896"]}

The use of invasive procedures like endotracheal intubation, placement of central intravenous lines and invasive monitoring techniques, combined with risks of prolonged ICU stay and need for broad-spectrum antibiotics has led to the emergence of new and resistant pathogens including fungi. Fungal septicemia is the third most common cause of late onset sepsis. Its incidence varies with many factors, but generally it is inversely proportional to the gestational maturity and birth weight. An overall incidence of 1-4% and mortality as high as 25-50% has been reported.[1] Various muco-cutaneous manifestations of fungal septicemia have been described in literature.Cutaneous involvement occurs in 50-60% of VLBW neonates with systemic candidiasis. Congenital cutaneous candidiasis is a distinct entity first described by Benirschke and Raphael in 1958. The extensive rash, usually appears within 12 hours of birth.[2] It presents as an erythematous, maculopapular eruption of the trunk and extremities which rapidly becomes pustular, then improves with generalized desquamation. Most often, it resolves spontaneously in term infants, but may lead to invasive disease and result in mortality in VLBW babies. Colonization of skin and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) with Candida sp. forms an important and initial step in the pathogenesis of systemic infection.[3] Kaufman et al., reported that the skin and GIT are colonized before the respiratory tract.

By KR Rao and JJ Hwang\n", "abstract": " Perhaps no group is more closely associated with the trials and tribulations of working with electronic images than our group\u2014the readership of Electronic Imaging. For those of us who have experienced more trials than tribulations, Rao and Hwang\u2019s book \u2018\u2018Techniques and Standards for Image, Video and Audio Coding\u2019\u2019might provide some welcome relief. While this book is about redundancy reduction (coding) and about standards, it is also about the rapidly evolving state of technologies related to information communication modalities\u2014be they in the form of still images, video clips, audio signals, or any combination of these. For over forty years consumers have noticed little change with regard to television broadcast standards. In the past few years, however, significant changes have been proposed and some have just recently been accepted, such as the High Definition TV (HDTV) Grand Alliance (GA) proposal\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["896"]}
{"title": "Automated inspection for remote telerobotic operations\n", "abstract": " Automated inspection techniques being developed for surface inspection of remote space platforms are reported. The unique problems of performing visual telerobotic inspection in space are identified. An image differencing method to detect changes to surfaces over a period of time is presented, together with a scale-space technique for flaw identification. Examples from images of laboratory mockups of space platform modules are presented to illustrate the results.< >", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["896"]}
{"title": "Learning visual speech\n", "abstract": " The performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems can be greatly enhanced by incorporating phonologically relevant features contained in video sequences of speakers. Humans, particularly the hearing impaired, can utilize visual information {through lipreading {for improved accuracy. We present a system for doing ASR that relies on both classical and learning algorithms to identify and process relevant visual information. Classical image processing operations such as convolution and thresholding are used to reduce each frame to a small intermediate (vector) representation of the image content. Sequences of these vectors are used as inputs to a modi ed time delay neural network, which is trained to output the corresponding phoneme. The network learns to extract visual-temporal features which are useful in classi cation. Eventually, the learning procedure may be extented to directly utilize the\" raw\" pixels, however, in present practice, the classical operations act as a means of compressing the visual information down to manageable amounts. Our current visual speech recognizer, in combination with a similar acoustic recognizer reduces the error rate by 75% when compared with the acoustic subsystem alone.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["896"]}
{"title": "Depth restoration from defocused images: A surface evolution approach\n", "abstract": " Defocused images are a rich source of depth information. Several methods to extract depth from defocused images, generally known as\" depth-from-defocus\"(DFD) techniques, have been proposed recently. A new approach to DFD, that results in high-resolution depth-maps, is presented in this dissertation. In this method, a defocused image is viewed as the outcome of a combinatorial process, where a set of three-dimensional voxels, some in-focus and the others out-of-focus, are mapped via a two-dimensional projection to an image (pixel) plane. The restoration of depth information is realized by formulating the DFD process as a combinatorial optimization problem. A priori knowledge of the geometrical and optical properties of the object, such as finite size, smoothness, opacity, and coarse depth, is used to form constraints that reduce the ambiguity of the solution. Several constrained optimization techniques\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["896"]}
{"title": "Automatic language recognition based on phonetic structure of languages\n", "abstract": " The performance of an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system can be improved by using knowledge about the phonetic structure of a language. This paper discusses an Automatic Language Recognition (ALR) algorithm which can recognize the language of the input speech so that the knowledge component specific to that language can be activated in an ASR designed for more than one language. Performance of the ALR algorithm developed for three languages\u2014Hindi, English and Telugu, is also discussed.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["896"]}

The method of Bishop and Adams (1974) was used to prepare irradiated vaccine. The infected blood was processed separately for 50 Kr and 60 Kr irradiation. The clinical reactions for both vaccinated and unvaccinated control male calves were studied after challenging them with B. bigemina infected erythrocytes. Observations indicated that irradiated vaccine shows appreciable immunizing effect in the vaccinated animals.(MGB)", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["896"]}

The other reasons are wrong delivery, despatch of wrong issue number(forming duplicate), mistakes in accounting by the publisher etc.A librarian may probably satisfy the audit by showing letters with'extension of subscription' or'refund of money'but not the user who suffers a gap in the communication chain created by the missing issues.
