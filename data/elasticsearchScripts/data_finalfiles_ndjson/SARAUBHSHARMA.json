We have annotated 124,201 gene loci distributed nearly evenly across the homeologous chromosomes and subgenomes. Comparative gene analysis of wheat subgenomes and extant diploid and tetraploid wheat relatives showed that high sequence similarity and structural conservation are retained, with limited gene loss, after polyploidization. However, across the genomes there was evidence of dynamic gene gain, loss, and duplication since the divergence of the wheat lineages. A high degree of transcriptional autonomy and no global dominance was found for the subgenomes. These insights into the genome biology of a polyploid crop provide a springboard for faster gene isolation, rapid genetic marker development, and precise breeding to meet\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1102\n", "authors": ["22"]}

The mechanism by which these peptide hormone genes are induced and then either maintained or repressed during development is unknown, but their coexpression in early precursor cells suggests the involvement of common regulatory factors. Here we show that the somatostatin transcription factor STF-1 is also a principal regulator of insulin expression in beta-cells of the pancreas. STF-1 stimulates the insulin gene by recognizing two well defined islet-specifying elements on the insulin promoter and by subsequently synergizing in trans with the juxtaposed helix-loop-helix protein E47.

We recently took advantage of next-generation sequencing technology to develop MutMap, a method that allows rapid identification of causal nucleotide changes of rice mutants by whole genome resequencing of pooled DNA of mutant F2 progeny derived from crosses made between candidate mutants and the parental line. Here we describe MutMap+, a versatile extension of MutMap, that identifies causal mutations by comparing SNP frequencies of bulked DNA of mutant and wild-type progeny of M3 generation derived from selfing of an M2 heterozygous individual. Notably, MutMap+ does not necessitate artificial crossing between mutants and the wild-type parental line. This method is therefore suitable for identifying mutations that cause early development lethality, sterility, or generally hamper crossing. Furthermore, MutMap+ is potentially useful for gene isolation in crops that are recalcitrant to artificial crosses.", "num_citations": "189\n", "authors": ["22"]}
{"title": "Mucoadhesive polymers: means of improving the mucoadhesive properties of drug delivery system\n", "abstract": " The goal of any drug delivery system is to provide a therapeutic amount of drug to the proper site in the body to achieve promptly & then maintain the desired drug concentration. That is why the drug delivery system should deliver dr ug at a state dictated by the needs of the body over a specified period of treatment. This idealized objective points to the two aspects most important to drug delivery, namely, spatial placement relates to targeting a drug to a specific organ or tissue while temporal delivery refers to the control of rate of drug delivery to the target tissue. Bioadhesion can be defined as the process by which a natural or a synthetic polymer can adhere to a biological substrate. When the biological substrate is a mucosal layer then the phenomena is known as mucoadhesion. The substrate possessing bioadhesive property can help in devising a delivery system capable of delivering a bioactive agent for a prolonged period of time at a specific delivery site.

We develop a conditional generative model that combines the strength of VAE and GANs and in addition, via an unconditional discriminator, learns the marginal feature distribution of unlabeled images. We empirically show that our model learns highly discriminative CNN features for five datasets, ie CUB, SUN, AWA and ImageNet, and establish a new state-of-the-art in any-shot learning, ie inductive and transductive (generalized) zero-and few-shot learning settings.

The structural, functional and evolutionary aspects of the satellite repetitive DNA families, and their organization in the chromosomes is reviewed. The tandem satellite DNA sequences exhibit characteristic chromosomal locations, usually at subtelomeric and centromeric regions. The repetitive DNA family(ies) may be widely distributed in a taxonomic family or a genus, or may be specific for a species, genome or even a chromosome. They may acquire large-scale variations in their sequence and copy number over an evolutionary time-scale. These features have formed the basis of extensive utilization of repetitive sequences for taxonomic and phylogenetic studies. Hybrid polyploids have especially proven to be excellent models for studying the evolution of repetitive DNA sequences.

Results from screening methods revealed that hemolytic and BATH assays are not reliable methods to check biosurfactant production because hemolytic assay relies on lysis of blood cells, which can be caused by compounds produced by microbes other than the biosurfactants. In that case hemolytic assay may include strains that do not produce biosurfactant. BATH assay relies on hydrophobicity or adherence of cells with hydrophobic compounds. Results obtained in BATH assay for three bacterial isolates, Branhamella catarrhalis, Citrobacter intermedius and Klebsiella ozaenae were positive, but when the same isolates screened for drop collapse, oil spreading, and surface tension measurement the results were negative. This indicates that these bacterial cells are either acting as biosurfactant themselves (cell surface) or they don\u0393\u00c7\u00d6t have the ability to produce biosurfactants.

Three methods were selected for biodegradation, viz. agar overlay and liquid media methods; stationary and shaking conditions at 25 \u252c\u2591C. Aspergillus niger recorded maximum decolorization of the dye Basic fuchsin (81.85%) followed by Nigrosin (77.47%), Malachite green (72.77%) and dye mixture (33.08%) under shaking condition. Whereas, P. chrysosporium recorded decolorization to the maximum with the Nigrosin (90.15%) followed by Basic fuchsin (89.8%), Malachite green (83.25%) and mixture (78.4%). The selected fungal strains performed better under shaking conditions compared to stationary method; moreover the inoculation of fungus also brought the pH of the dye solutions to neutral from acidic. Seed germination bioassay study exhibited that when inoculated dye solutions were used, seed showed germination while uninoculated dyes inhibited germination even after four days of observation. Similarly, microbial growth was also inhibited by uninoculated dyes. The excellent performance of A. niger and P. chrysporium in the biodegradation of textile dyes of different chemical structures suggests and reinforces the potential of these fungi for environmental decontamination.", "num_citations": "97\n", "authors": ["22"]}

The present research was conducted to study Pb and Cd level concentrations in soil and vegetations along a major highway with high traffic density. Soil and vegetable samples along highway were collected from 10 sites in Agra district (India) and analyzed for two heavy metals (lead and cadmium) using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS). The soil physicochemical properties were also determined. The general decrease in concentrations of these metals with distance from the highway indicates their relation to traffic. Higher accumulations of metals have been observed on vegetation and soil samples near to the highway (0-5 m) than on vegetation and soil samples from sites a little farther away ( at 5-10 m & 10-15 m). This is attributed mainly to aerial deposition of the metal particulates from motor vehicles.

However, their exact mechanisms of action are yet to be clarified. In breast cancer research, several lncRNAs are identified as tumor driving oncogenic lncRNAs and few are identified as tumor suppressive lncRNAs. They are involved in cell growth, apoptosis, cell migration and invasiveness as well as cancer cell stemness. Therefore, this new class of RNAs may serve as biomarkers for diagnostic and prognostic purpose and also as potential therapeutic targets.

The effect of these treatments in influencing the lead induced changes on hepatic and renal oxidative stress and biochemical changes along with histopathological alterations in soft tissues was studied. The data showed significant increase in liver and kidney LPO levels in animals treated with lead nitrate while the effect was attenuated by the plant extracts. Also, lead caused a significant decrease in antioxidant enzyme activity and this effect was reversed in groups treated with plant extract. Treatment with coriander significantly reduced the adverse effects related to most of biochemical parameters altered in animals treated with lead, related to hepatic and renal oxidative stress.

A correlation between kp values and the underlying catalyst structures is developed using DFT-computed ligand cone angles and ion pair separation energies as structural and electronic descriptors. The correlation takes the form of an Arrhenius-like relationship where the pre-exponential factor is correlated to the ligand cone angles and the activation energy term is correlated to the ion pair separation energies. This finding is consistent with the idea that the ability of the monomer to access the metal center is a key factor affecting the reaction rate.", "num_citations": "64\n", "authors": ["22"]}

We study the relations between stellar kinematics and chemical abundances of a large sample of RAVE giants in search of the selection criteria needed for disentangling different Galactic stellar populations, such as thin disc, thick disc and halo. A direct comparison between the chemo-kinematic relations obtained with our medium spectroscopic resolution data and those obtained from a high-resolution sample is carried out with the aim of testing the robustness of the RAVE data. Methods. We selected a sample of 2167 giant stars with signal-to-noise per spectral measurements above 75 from the RAVE chemical catalogue and followed the analysis performed by Gratton and colleagues on 150 subdwarf stars spectroscopically observed at high resolution.

{"title": "Oxidative stress: a novel strategy in cancer treatment\n", "abstract": " There is an equilibrium between a free radical (FR)/reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and endogenous antioxidant defense mechanisms, but if this balance is disturbed, it can produce oxidative stress. This state of oxidative stress can result in injury to all the important cellular components like proteins, DNA and membrane lipids which can cause cell death. In recent years, increasing experimental and clinical data has provided compelling evidences for the involvement of oxidative stress in large number of pathological states including carcinogenesis (1, 2). Oxidative stress however, is not always detrimental. Selective oxidative stress sometimes is desirable and can be utilized therapeutically also. There are numerous drugs which are known to act by the mechanism of oxidative stress and can be utilized therapeutically like chloroquin, quinine, mefloquine, primaquin, artemisinin (3) and ciprofloxacin (4) etc. Recently, new therapeutic strategies that take advantage of increased reactive oxygen species or inhibition of endogenous antioxidant defense, hence producing a state of oxidative stress selectively in cancer cells have gained importance.", "num_citations": "59\n", "authors": ["22"]}

Two cultivated bread wheat accessions were selected as parental lines. Population phenotyping was carried out on 133 F2: 3 families. Two field experiments and two experiments in the greenhouse were conducted at IPK-Gatersleben, Germany with control and post-anthesis stress conditions in each experiment. Thousand-grain weight was recorded as the main wheat yield component, which is reduced by post-anthesis drought stress. Chemical desiccation was applied in three experiments as simulator of post-anthesis drought stress whereas water stress was applied in one greenhouse experiment. Analysis of variance showed significant differences among the F2: 3 families. The molecular genetic linkage map including 293 marker loci associated to 19 wheat chromosomes was applied for QTL analysis. The present study revealed four and six QTLs for thousand-grain weight under control and stress conditions, respectively. Only one QTL on chromosome 4BL was common for both conditions. Five QTLs on chromosomes 1AL, 4AL, 7AS, and 7DS were found to be specific to the stress condition. Both parents contributed alleles for drought tolerance.

Nanoemulsion is a dispersion consisting of oil, surfactant and an aqueous phase, which is a isotropically clear and thermo-dynamically or kinetically stable liquid solution, usually with droplet diameter within the range of 10-500nm. Although interest in nano-emulsions was developed for more than two decades now, mainly for nanoparticle preparation, it is in the last few years that direct applications of nano-emulsions in consumer products are being developed, mainly in pharmacy and cosmetics. These recent applications have made that studies on optimization methods for nano-emulsion preparation be a requirement. The design of effective formulations for drugs has long been a major task, because drug efficacy can severely limited by instability or poor solubility in the vehicle. Nanoemulsion is being applied to enhance the solubility and bioavailability of water insoluble drugs. The nanosized droplets leading to an enormous increase in interfacial areas associated with nanoemulsion would influence the transport properties of the drug [1, 2]. Recently, there has been a considerable attraction for this formulation, for the delivery of hydrophilic as well as hydrophobic drug as drug carriers because of its improved drug solubilization capacity, long shelf life, ease of preparation and improvement of bioavailability of drugs.

The antimicrobial activity of plant extracts was determined by using agar well diffusion method. The plant extracts showed varied levels of antimicrobial activity against antibiotic-sensitive and resistant S. aureus isolates. Extracts of Syzygium cumini (Jamun) and Lawsonia inermis (Mehndi) showed good activity against most of the sensitive and resistant isolates whereas the extracts of Ficus religiosa (Peepal), Ocimum sanctum (Tulsi) and Zizyphus mauritiana (Ber) showed moderate activity against most of the sensitive and resistant isolates. The plant extracts showed variable initial MIC values against resistant and sensitive S. aureus isolates being minimum for S. cumini (1.2 mg/ml, 0.6 mg/ml) and L. inermis (0.6 mg/ml, 1.2 mg/ml). The final MIC and MBC values were observed to be either same or 2 to 4 fold higher than initial MIC.

{"title": "Association between common variants near LBX1 and adolescent idiopathic scoliosis replicated in the Chinese Han population\n", "abstract": " Background Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is one of the most common spinal deformities found in adolescent populations. Recently, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a Japanese population indicated that three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs11190870, rs625039 and rs11598564, all located near the LBX1 gene, may be associated with AIS susceptibility [1]. This study suggests a novel AIS predisposition candidate gene and supports the hypothesis that somatosensory functional disorders could contribute to the pathogenesis of AIS. These findings warrant replication in other populations.   Methodology/Principal Findings First, we conducted a case-control study consisting of 953 Chinese Han individuals from southern China (513 patients and 440 healthy controls), and the three SNPs were all found to be associated with AIS predisposition. The ORs were observed as 1.49 (95% CI 1.23\u0393\u00c7\u00f41.80, P = 5.09E-5), 1.70 (95% CI 1.42\u0393\u00c7\u00f42.04, P = 1.17E-8) and 1.52 (95% CI 1.27\u0393\u00c7\u00f41.83, P = 5.54E-6) for rs625039, rs11190870 and rs11598564, respectively. Second, a case-only study including a subgroup of AIS patients (N = 234) was performed to determine the effects of these variants on the severity of the condition. However, we did not find any association between these variants and the severity of curvature.   Conclusion This study shows that the genetic variants near the LBX1 gene are associated with AIS susceptibility in Chinese Han population.

CDDP-induced emesis and diarrhoea are also marked toxicities that may be due to intestinal injury. Chrysin (5,7-dihydroxyflavone), a natural flavone commonly found in many plants, possesses multiple biological activities, such as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In the present study, we investigated the protective effect of chrysin against CDDP-induced jejunal toxicity. The plausible mechanism of CDDP-induced jejunal toxicity includes oxidative stress, p53 and apoptosis via up-regulating the expression of caspase-6 and -3.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 33 year old female presented with right loin pain and obstruction on intravenous urography with the classical \"fish-hook\" appearance. She was counseled on the various methods of repair and elected to have a robot assisted repair. The following steps are performed during a pure robotic retrocaval ureter repair. The patient is placed in a modified flank position, pneumoperitoneum created and ports inserted. The colon is mobilized to expose the retroperitoneal structures: inferior vena cava, right gonadal vein, right ureter, and duodenum. The renal pelvis and ureter are mobilized and the renal pelvis transected. The ureter is transposed anterior to the inferior vena cava and a pyelopyelostomy is performed over a JJ stent. RESULTS: This patient was discharged on postoperative day 3. The catheter and drain tube were removed on day 1. Her JJ stent was removed at 6 weeks postoperatively. The postoperative intravenous urography at 3 months confirmed normal drainage of contrast medium.

{"title": "A study of Compositae plant extract reactions in photosensitivity dermatitis.\n", "abstract": " In subjects with chronic photosensitivity of the photosensitivity dermatitis/actinic reticuloid type the persistent reaction of the skin appears to be due to a number of factors, including those of contact allergic sensitivity and of photosensitivity (ie, phototoxicity and/or photoallergy). The assessment of the relevant importance of these factors can be complicated by the reactivity of the skin resulting in false positive responses from skin patch and photopatch testing. Moreover, difficulties may also arise in the assessment of the results using commercially available patch test materials. However, the study described here indicated that, provided the reactivity of the skin is suppressed prior to investigation, reliable results are obtained from photopatch testing and that these results are similar whether the extract is from a commercial source or has been obtained from locally grown Compositae plants. Also, that although there may be a photoallergic component in the cutaneous photosensitivity, the results of the in vivo and in vitro studies reported here indicate the likely involvement of phototoxicity as well.", "num_citations": "45\n", "authors": ["22"]}

The prior model considers the smoothness of disparity map and is defined as a pixel-wise energy function using adaptive interaction among neighboring disparities. The disparity is determined by minimizing the joint energy function which combines the likelihood model with prior model. These processes are performed in the multi-resolution approach. The disparity map is interpolated using the reliability of likelihood model and color-based similarity in the neighborhood.

{"title": "RSA algorithm using modified subset sum cryptosystem\n", "abstract": " RSA is the asymmetric cryptography system. The security of RSA public key cryptosystem is based on the assumption that factoring of a large number (modulus) is difficult. In RSA if one can factor modulus into its prime numbers then the private key is also detected and hence the security of the cryptosystem is broken. The Subset-Sum cryptosystem (Knapsack Cryptosystem) is also an asymmetric cryptographic technique. The Merkle-Hellman system is based on the subset sum problem (a special case of the knapsack problem): given a list of numbers and a third number, which is the sum of a subset of these numbers, determine the subset. In general, this problem is known to be NP-complete. However, if the set of numbers (called the knapsack) is superincreasing, that is, each element of the set is greater than the sum of all the numbers before it, the problem is `easy' and solvable in polynomial time with a simple\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "40\n", "authors": ["22"]}

We took a series of case-control studies, trying to understand whether Leptin gene polymorphisms are involved in the etiology of the AIS or the change in leptin level is a secondary event, to assess the level of leptin receptor, and to evaluate the differences of response to leptin between AIS cases and controls. We screened all exons of Leptin gene in 45 cases and 45 controls and selected six tag SNPs to cover all the observed variations. Association analysis in 446 AIS patients and 550 healthy controls showed no association between the polymorphisms of Leptin gene and susceptibility/severity to AIS. Moreover, adipogenesis assay of bone mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) suggested that the adipogenic ability of MSCs from AIS girls was lower than controls. After adjusting the differentiation rate, expressions of leptin and leptin receptor were similar between two groups. Meanwhile, osteogenesis assay of MSC showed the leptin level was similar after adjusting the differentiation rate, but the leptin receptor level was decreased in induced AIS osteoblasts. Immunocytochemistry and western blot analysis showed less leptin receptors expressed in AIS group. Furthermore, factorial designed studies with adipogenesis and osteogenesis revealed that the MSCs from patients have no response to leptin treatment.

The present paper reports the sampling, pre-identification and complete identification of macroinvertebrates together with measurement of physico-chemical parameters and calculation of% abundance of families of various macroinvertebrates taxonomic groups, identified upto family level, from both the sites. The water quality was assessed using Nepalese biotic score system as well as national sanitation foundation water quality index. A comparison of both the system revealed the same water quality classes indicating the complete applicability of NEPBIOS as a tool for assessment of ecological status of stream & rivers in Hindu-Kush Himalayan (HKH) region. However, the development of a bio-assessment tool for India is being developed because different macroinvertebrate taxa is available in different parts of the country. The taxonomic keys based on macro-invertebrate taxa being developed for HKH region in particular and for India in general will be a valuable tool for assessing the water quality of stream & rivers in minimum time and with least cost in comparison to physico-chemical methods needing much time and costly equipment.[Life Science Journal. 2008; 5 (3): 67\u0393\u00c7\u00f472](ISSN: 1097\u0393\u00c7\u00f48135).", "num_citations": "31\n", "authors": ["22"]}

Majority of adults are becoming increasingly overweight and one of the subpopulations in which this prevalence is growing most rapidly is postmenopausal women. 8.3 million population is forecasted to be obese in age of 50 years or older in 2010 (1).Postmenopausal women have an increased tendency for gaining weight. It is as yet unclear whether the menopausal transition itself leads to weight gain, but is known that the physiological withdrawal of estrogen brings about changes in fat distribution (2), together with physical inactivity, are probably the major causes of this phenomenon. Other contributing factors include ethnicity, reduced lean mass, resting metabolic rate and treatment with certain drugs, eg steroids, insulin, glitazones (3). Moreover, estrogen withdrawal during menopause has a detrimental effect on metabolism and bring changes in body fat distribution from a gynoid to an android pattern, reduced glucose tolerance, abnormal plasma lipids, increased blood pressure, increased sympathetic tone, endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation. As a result postmenopausal obesity compounds the situation leading to increased rates of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease and mortality. Additional consequences of obesity may include hormone-dependent cancer, gallstones, nephrolithiasis, and osteoarthritis with increased mortality (4).", "num_citations": "31\n", "authors": ["22"]}

Salinity up to 15.7 dS m-1 induced increased uptake of Na+ and Cl- but higher levels of salinity were not accompanied by further increase in uptake of these ions. Observed increases in Na+ and Cl- concentrations at higher salinities seemed to be the consequence of reduction in growth. Uptake of K+ was decreased; more in salt sensitive cultivar.

Liposome drug delivery systems have played a significant role in formulation of potent drug to improve therapeutics. Recently the liposome formulations are targeted to reduce toxicity and increase accumulation at the target site. There are several new methods of liposome preparation based on lipid drug interaction and liposome disposition mechanism including the inhibition of rapid clearance of liposome by controlling particle size, charge and surface hydration. Most clinical applications of liposomal drug delivery are targeting to tissue with or without expression of target recognition molecules on lipid membrane. The liposomes are characterized with respect to physical, chemical and biological parameters. The sizing of liposome is also critical parameter which helps characterize the liposome which is usually performed by sequential extrusion at relatively low pressure through polycarbonate membrane (PCM). This mode of drug delivery lends more safety and efficacy to administration of several classes of drugs like antiviral, antifungal, antimicrobial, vaccines, anti tubercular drugs and gene therapeutics. Present applications of the liposomes are in the immunology, dermatology, vaccine adjuvant, eye disorders, brain targeting, infective disease and in tumour therapy.

The robot trajectory (path and speed) is generated incrementally by avoiding obstacles optimally one at a time, thus reducing the original problem from one that avoids m obstacles to m simpler problems that avoid one obstacle each. The computational complexity of this planner is therefore linear in the number of obstacles, instead of the typical exponential complexity of traditional geometric planners. This approach is quite general and applicable to any cost function and to any robot dynamics; it is treated here for minimum time motions, a planar point mass robot, and circular obstacles.

The effects of solvent, metal, counterion, and ligand structure were investigated by experiments and by DFT calculations. A solvent with a high dielectric constant led not only to an increase in the chain propagation rate but also to a change in the reaction order. Catalyst reactivity was found to be controlled by the difficulty of ion pair separation and steric congestion at the metal center, which were quantified from DFT simulation by SCF ion pair separation energies and ligand cone angles. A Cp*Ti(OC6H4-2-Br)Me2/B(C6F5)3 catalyst exhibits unusually high reactivity, which was correlated to the formation of a partial bond between the aryloxide ortho substituent bromide and Ti upon ion pair separation.

Based on data from the developed countries, recommendations have been made regarding the age at which cytology screening should begin and the interval with which rescreening should be performed. However, these recommendations may not be applicable for a developing country like India due to human and financial resource constraints. WHO has recommended that for countries where resources are limited the aim should be to screen every woman at least once in her life-time at an appropriate age. Hence, it is essential to determine the age at which screening may be offered to derive maximum gains. With this in background, based on the data of national cancer registries, an attempt has been made for Indian population to estimate the reduction in the cumulative incidence rate of cervical carcinoma which can be achieved in a cohort of women aged 20-64 years by screening once in her life-time at an appropriate age. Our findings revealed that the first screening offered at 45 years of age could produce gains to the extent of 20-27%, while the screening offered at 50 or 55 years produced the maximum gains to the extent of 25-29%. However, keeping in view the produce years of lives lost in younger women, it may be reasonable to offer once in life-time screening to women aged 45 years.", "num_citations": "29\n", "authors": ["22"]}

{"title": "Nutritional status of the elderly.\n", "abstract": " Elderly become vulnerable to malnutrition owing to inappropriate dietary intake, poor economic status and social deprivation. Elderly are known to be easily subjected to inanition and avitaminosis resulting in multiple nutritional deficiencies. Urban slum dwellers, rural poor and those living alone appear to be at a higher risk of poor dietary intake. Though food consumption patterns of rural and urban elderly show a distinct difference, these are greatly influenced by regional dietary patterns. The diets of institutionalised and free living elderly reveal adequate nutrient intakes except iron and vitamin A. The nutrients least adequately supplied in the diets of Indian elderly are calcium, Iron, vitamin A, riboflavin and niacin along with energy deficits. Changes in body composition which mark the onset of the ageing process, include decline in lean body mass and increase in adipose tissue. A high prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia has also been reported among Indian elderly.", "num_citations": "27\n", "authors": ["22"]}

Its metastasis is extremely rare, ranging between 0.0028 and 0.55 of all BCC cases. The usual metastasis to lymph nodes, lungs, bones, or skin is from the primary tumor situated in the head and neck region in nearly 85% cases. A 69-year-old male developed progressively increasing multiple, fleshy, indurated, and at places pigmented noduloulcerative plaques over back, chest, and left axillary area 4 years after wide surgical excision of a pathologically diagnosed basal cell carcinoma. The recurrence was diagnosed as infiltrative BCC and found metastasizing to skin, soft tissue and muscles, and pretracheal and axillary lymph nodes. Three cycles of chemotherapy comprising intravenous cisplatin (50\u0393\u00c7\u00ebmg) and 5-florouracil (5-FU, 750\u0393\u00c7\u00ebmg) on 2 consecutive days and repeated at every 21 days were effective. As it remains unclear whether metastatic BCC is itself a separate subset of basal cell carcinoma, we feel that early BCC localized at any site perhaps constitutes a biological continuum that may ultimately manifest with metastasis in some individuals and should be evaluated as such. Long-standing BCC is itself potentially at risk of recurrence/dissemination; it is imperative to diagnose and appropriately treat all BCC lesions at the earliest.", "num_citations": "26\n", "authors": ["22"]}

In plants, spontaneous generation of MG through breakdown of triose sugars (dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate) is believed to be the major route for MG formation. MG is maintained at basal levels in plants under normal conditions that accumulate to higher concentrations under various stresses, probably as a general consequence of all abiotic stresses. The toxic effects of MG is due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells, either directly through increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or indirectly via advanced glycation end product (AGE) formation. Thus, elevated MG levels have implications in inhibition of growth and development in plants.

However, in heterogeneous catalytic reactions each catalyst needs an individual substrate as support. Herein, a versatile approach to immobilize metal catalysts on chitosan as a common substrate is presented. Chitosan, accommodating many metal catalysts, is grafted onto the microchannel surface as nanobrush. The versatility, catalytic efficiency, and stability/durability of the microreactor are demonstrated for a number of organic transformations involving various metal compounds as catalysts.Organic transformations commonly involve metal catalysts with the catalyst supported on a substrate to more effectively transform reactants. Development of sustainable and environmentally friendly processes for chemical transformation has attracted a growing interest in recent years, microreactor technology has efficiently contributed in this direction.[1] Immobilization of toxic/costly metal catalysts directly on the microreactor channel is best achieved using packed bed systems; however, immobilization often causes clogging and high back pressure and is sometimes not suitable for continuous-flow synthesis.[2] In addition, if a catalyst is immobilized on a wettable or swellable polymer attached to the channel surface, the efficiency of the catalyst and productivity can be enhanced by providing accessibility to all catalytic sites.

Data were collected with questionnaire from 20 consumption households randomly selected from 3 out of the 30 communities in the area. The sampling frame used for the study was obtained from the National population Commission for the area. Sixty households were sampled in the area. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and ordinary least squares multiple regression technique. The results identified garri, pounded cassava, tapioca, cassava chips, and cassava flour as the various cassava products consumed in the area. The results show further that about 11% of the monthly income of an average household in the area was spent on cassava products while about 23% of their monthly income was spent by them on substitutes. Garri was identified as the major cassava product consumed by the respondents in the area while rice and plantain are the major substitutes consumed by them. The findings of the study show also that household size, household income, and the cost of substitutes were the statistically significant determinants of the quantity consumed of cassava products by the respondents in the area. The significant variables have positive coefficients, which imply that an increase in their magnitude will lead to an increase in the quantity consumed of cassava products in the area and vice versa.

Traditional mycobacteria culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST) is either time-consuming or expensive and for that reason uptake of these technologies has remained limited in many resource-constrained settings. However, several non-commercial culture and DST methods that do not require sophisticated infrastructure and techniques have been developed. One such method is the microscopic observation drug susceptibility assay (MODS). In this method microcolonies that form in the liquid culture medium after specimen inoculation to drug-free and drug-containing micro-wells are detected by visual observation with a simple inverted microscope.

So to increase its permeation across the skin, nanoemulsion based gel formulations were prepared and characterised. Fish oil was used as the oil phase and was also exploited for its anti-inflammatory effect along with BD in the treatment of inflammation associated with psoriasis. Nanoemulsion formulations were prepared by aqueous phase titration method, using fish oil, Unitop 100, PEG 400 and water as the oil phase, surfactant, co-surfactant and aqueous phase respectively.

This paper presents the results of a basin scale rainfall-runoff modeling on Bagmati basin in Nepal using the hydrologic model HEC-HMS in a GIS environment. The model, in combination with the GIS extension HEC-GeoHMS, was used to convert the precipitation excess to overland flow and channel runoff. The rainfall data used were: rain gauge data alone, TRMM data alone and both rain gauge and TRMM data. The simulation was done for a period of four months (June-September) covering the total rainy season of year 2004. The predicted hydrograph was calibrated against observed one and the model parameters were manually optimized for good simulation. The predicted peak discharge, using rain gauge data, was close to the observed value and the smaller discharges followed the observed trend. The model framework developed in the study considered the spatial variation in the runoff response of the watershed through the use of Curve Numbers based on soil type and land use and the spatial distribution of the rainfall in the watershed by using rainfall data from a number of rain gauge stations located in different parts of the basin. The peak flow of the derived hydrograph was used as an input in hydraulic model (HEC-RAS) for producing flood maps showing inundation area extent and flood depths, thus directly linking the model to operational flood forecast.

How the parasite adapts to these challenging conditions is not well understood. We have systematically investigated the expression of three cytosolic antioxidant proteins, thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1), peroxiredoxin-1 (TPx-1), and 1-Cys peroxiredoxin (1-Cys Prx), in developing ookinetes of the rodent parasite Plasmodium berghei under various growth conditions. Transcriptional profiling showed that tpx-1 and 1-cys prx but not trx-1 are more strongly upregulated in ookinetes developing in the mosquito bloodmeal when compared to ookinetes growing under culture conditions. Confocal immunofluorescence imaging revealed comparable expression patterns on the corresponding proteins. 1-Cys Prx in particular exhibited strong expression in mosquito-derived ookinetes but was not detectable in cultured ookinetes. Furthermore, ookinetes growing in culture upregulated tpx-1 and 1-cys prx when challenged with exogenous ROS in a dose-dependent fashion. This suggests that environmental factors in the mosquito bloodmeal induce upregulation of cytosolic antioxidant proteins in Plasmodium ookinetes. We found that in a parasite line lacking TPx-1 (TPx-1KO), expression of 1-Cys Prx occurred significantly earlier in mosquito-derived TPx-1KO ookinetes when compared to wild type (WT) ookinetes. The protein was also readily detectable in cultured TPx-1KO ookinetes, indicating that 1-Cys Prx at least in part compensates for the loss of TPx-1 in vivo.

With over 3000 mtDNA variations reported across databases, establishing pathogenicity of variations in mtDNA is a major challenge. We have designed and developed a comprehensive weighted scoring system (MtSNPscore) for identification of mtDNA variations that can impact pathogenicity and would likely be associated with disease. The criteria for pathogenicity include information available in the literature, predictions made by various in silico tools and frequency of variation in normal and patient datasets. The scoring scheme also assigns scores to patients and normal individuals to estimate the cumulative impact of variations.

Greatest solubility is observed in solvents of intermediate polarity and particularly where low polarity is combined with a pronounced tendency to interact with the benzoquinone substituent of the ubiquinone molecule. This includes solvents like chloroform and benzene. Ubiquinone-10 is somewhat less polar than ubiquinol-10 as judged by comparative solubilities of the two molecules. Proton-NMR chemical shift measurements and aggregation studies in selected solvents indicate that in ubiquinone-10 in the liquid phase and in solution in hydrocarbons like dodecane the molecules have a preferred association possibly involving stacking of the benzoquinone rings.

The rapidly changing dynamics of eco-processes require modeling through non-linear concepts such as non-discreet fuzzy theory. The classification of data has been done using maximum likelihood classifier and Gaussian distribution. To better capture an event such as landslide it is imperative that the inherent continuity of the causative factors of the phenomenon are well represented. And that the uncertainties involved in assigning the probabilities of occurrences are taken care of. Decision making depends upon multiple parameters and their collective evaluation. Hence multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) of fuzzy variables has been implemented. A fuzzy knowledge-based geographical information system to categorize a given region into five levels of landslide susceptibility very high, high, moderate, low, and very low, has been presented in this chapter.

We use money as a measuring unit in pricing a transaction, offer it as a medium for exchange of goods and services, settlement of debts, for deferred payments in economic activities and make it a store of value for our savings.Money, as we know it today, is the result of a long process of evolution. At the beginning, there was no money and people were engaged in barter in which there was exchange of merchandise for merchandise without value equivalence. This elementary form of trade prevailed at the beginning of civilization and is found even today among people of primitive economies, especially in regions where difficult access makes money scarce. This exchange, however, is not free from difficulties, since there is no common measure of value among the items bartered. At some point in the development of ancient societies people began to recognize that simple bartering can be cumbersome and slow. This led to the acceptance of commodity money. Many items, which were thought of having value were used ascommodity money. These included many objects such as naturally scarce precious metals, conch shells, beads, etc. However, with the growth of society towards commercialization, the society as well as economy shifted to metallic money. At this stage, coins of various metals such as gold, silver and copper were designated as money.

To ensure proper use of C. globosum in agriculture, accurate data is essential for population monitoring. A PCR-based marker has been developed for detection of this biocontrol agent, which will help to detect the fungus at the place of its application. Out of twelve URP primers tested against 15 isolates of C. globosum and other Chaetomium species, URP 2R amplified a monomorphic band of 1,900 bp only in C. globosum isolates. This amplicon was cloned and sequenced, and based on the sequence obtained, four primer sets were designed, one of which in PCR assays amplified a region (SCAR; SCCgRA1900) of the expected size (1.9 kb) in C. globosum isolates. The specific marker also detected the presence of C. globosum in soil, roots and leaves. The detection limit of marker in conventional PCR assay was 75 pg. The sensitivity and usefulness of SCAR marker was further enhanced by developing qPCR using the primer set SCCgQF/SCCgQR designed from SCCgRA1900, which detected as much as 1 pg of DNA (4.83 x105 copy number of target DNA).

However, most of these variations locked up in distant gene pools require the use of ploidy manipulation, bridge crosses, and ovule/embryo culture. Using these techniques, resistance to many pests and diseases from secondary gene pool species has been transferred to A. hypogaea. Four cultivars containing genes from wild Arachis have been released for cultivation in some parts of the world. Wild Arachis species from the tertiary gene pool have also been successfully crossed with A. hypogaea; however, the utility of these crosses towards releasing useful genetic variation for selection is yet to be demonstrated.

So there is a requirement of various means to drive these vehicles without a heavy modification in the engine of these vehicles. This situation leads to requirement of alternative fuels for engines. Biodiesel is the best substitute of the Diesel in the Diesel Engine (1). Vegetables oil is the best alternative fuel. The main advantage of vegetable oil over the conventional fuel (as diesel in the diesel engine) is of reducing the cost and able to reduce net CO2 and CO emissions to atmosphere due to their agricultural origin (2). In this paper we investigate the prospective of Jatropha oil to use as a Bio-fuel in the conventional diesel engine. Jatropha oil is derived from Jatropha curcas plant which has been considered as a sustainable alternate fuel for diesel engine and also Jatropha curcas plant is renewable and non edible (3). However several durable and operational problems of using straight vegetable oils in the diesel engine are reported in literature, due to their higher viscosity and low volatility as compare to mineral diesel fuel (4). Hence vegetable oil does not give the better performance without proper modification. In this experimental work, performance of diesel engine operating on preheated Jatropha oil was evaluated and compared with diesel operation.

Such abstractions can very well represent the underlying dynamics of the system when modeled as network of vertices coupled by edges. Prediction of dynamics in these structures based on topological attribute or dependency relations is an important task. Link Prediction in such complex networks is regarded useful in almost all type of networks as it can be used to extract missing information, identify spurious interactions and evaluate network evolving mechanisms. Various similarity and likelihood based indices have been employed to infer different topological and relation based information to form a link prediction algorithm.

The utilization of this variability through conventional breeding requires a clear understanding of its reproductive biology and breeding system.

However, a proximal placement of the stigma and the anther and a synchrony between the receptivity and dehiscence of anthers strongly predispose the species to self pollination and selfing. However open pollination results in equally high percentage of fruit and seed set as on controlled selfing indicating that the species shows facultative autogamy. This raises the probability of genetic improvement through hybridization. The somatic complements revealed a diploid number of 2n=48 in all the accessions tested.

The study of inheritance of seed size (100 SW) is important for adopting appropriate breeding strategies to develop large-seeded kabuli chickpea cultivars. Earlier studies have shown that large-seeded progenies could be obtained from crosses involving parents with small and large seeds (Kumar and Singh 1995; Malhotra et al. 1997).

In the monocotyledonous Poaceae, five SPS genes have been identified. Here we present a detailed analysis of the wheat SPSII family in wheat. A set of homoeologue-specific primers was developed in order to permit both the detection of sequence variation, and the dissection of the individual contribution of each homoeologue to the global expression of SPSII. The expression in bread wheat over the course of development of various sucrose biosynthesis genes monitored on an Affymetrix array showed that the SPS genes were regulated over time and space. SPSII homoeologue-specific assays were used to show that the three homoeologues contributed differentially to the global expression of SPSII. Genetic mapping placed the set of homoeoloci on the short arms of the homoeologous group 3 chromosomes. A resequencing of the A and B genome copies allowed the detection of four haplotypes at each locus. The 3B copy includes an unspliced intron. A comparison of the sequences of the wheat SPSII orthologues present in the diploid progenitors einkorn, goatgrass and Triticum speltoides, as well as in the more distantly related species barley, rice, sorghum and purple false brome demonstrated that intronic sequence was less well conserved than exonic. Comparative sequence and phylogenetic analysis of SPSII gene showed that false purple brome was more similar to Triticeae than to rice.

Hence, measures are needed to minimise the phyto-toxicity of Se on plants. Ascorbic acid (Asc) has vital roles as a redox buffer, a strong antioxidant, regulator of enzymes of photosynthesis, phytohormones, cell division and growth in plants. In the present study, rice, which is a sensitive to Se-stress, was grown under controlled laboratory conditions (30/25; 15/9h, light/dark; light intensity: 350 umol m-2 s-1, RH: 65-70%) with selenium (as sodium selenate; 1, 2.5 and 5 ppm) in the absence or presence of 50 \u252c\u2561M Asc for ten days in half-strength Hoagland solution. Se at 2.5 ppm concentration resulted in 22.6 and 30% inhibition of roots and shoots, respectively, which increased markedly at 5.0 ppm (47% for roots 60% for shoots). Addition of Asc to the rice plants treated with 2.5 and 5.0 ppm Se resulted in 36 and 21% improvement in root growth and 28 and 38% increase in shoot growth, respectively, over the plants growing without Se. The uptake of Se increased with rise in its exogenous concentration but it was not affected by Asc application. Asc-supplemented plants showed significant prevention of damage caused by Se to membranes, chlorophyll and PSII function. A significant reduction in oxidative stress, measured as malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide content, was observed in the presence of Asc in Se-stressed plants, which was found to be associated with improvement in activities of enzymatic (pertinently, ascorbate peroxidase\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["22"]}
{"title": "CPU and/or GPU: Revisiting the GPU vs. CPU myth\n", "abstract": " Parallel computing using accelerators has gained widespread research attention in the past few years. In particular, using GPUs for general purpose computing has brought forth several success stories with respect to time taken, cost, power, and other metrics. However, accelerator based computing has signifi- cantly relegated the role of CPUs in computation. As CPUs evolve and also offer matching computational resources, it is important to also include CPUs in the computation. We call this the hybrid computing model. Indeed, most computer systems of the present age offer a degree of heterogeneity and therefore such a model is quite natural. We reevaluate the claim of a recent paper by Lee et al.(ISCA 2010). We argue that the right question arising out of Lee et al. (ISCA 2010) should be how to use a CPU+GPU platform efficiently, instead of whether one should use a CPU or a GPU exclusively. To this end, we experiment with a set of 13 diverse workloads ranging from databases, image processing, sparse matrix kernels, and graphs. We experiment with two different hybrid platforms: one consisting of a 6-core Intel i7-980X CPU and an NVidia Tesla T10 GPU, and another consisting of an Intel E7400 dual core CPU with an NVidia GT520 GPU. On both these platforms, we show that hybrid solutions offer good advantage over CPU or GPU alone solutions. On both these platforms, we also show that our solutions are 90% resource efficient on average. Our work therefore suggests that hybrid computing can offer tremendous advantages at not only research-scale platforms but also the more realistic scale systems with significant performance\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["22"]}

{"title": "On the estimation and correction of bias in local atrophy estimations using example atrophy simulations\n", "abstract": " Brain atrophy is considered an important marker of disease progression in many chronic neuro-degenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). A great deal of attention is being paid toward developing tools that manipulate magnetic resonance (MR) images for obtaining an accurate estimate of atrophy. Nevertheless, artifacts in MR images, inaccuracies of intermediate steps and inadequacies of the mathematical model representing the physical brain volume change, make it rather difficult to obtain a precise and unbiased estimate. This work revolves around the nature and magnitude of bias in atrophy estimations as well as a potential way of correcting them. First, we demonstrate that for different atrophy estimation methods, bias estimates exhibit varying relations to the expected atrophy and these bias estimates are of the order of the expected atrophies for standard algorithms, stressing the need for bias\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["22"]}

Time demands to promote a multidisciplinary, multi-factorial, comprehensive approach to the care of these women. By the medium of this editorial and our experience in dealing women in advancing age in and around menopause, we express our concern to the CVS diseases related mortality and morbidity in Postmenopausal womens (PMWs). The global burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is rapidly increasing. CVD is the leading cause of death in women around the world. Hypertension affects more men than women until 55 years of age, but after age 55, the percentage of women is higher. More than 450,000 women succumb to heart disease annually, and 250,000 die of coronary artery disease (1). Estrogen deficiency has been linked to the rapid increase in cardiovascular disease in women who have undergone natural or surgical menopause (2).Cardiovascular disease risk increases after the menopause which may be related to metabolic and hormonal changes (3). Menopause is a risk factor for (CVD) because estrogen withdrawal has a detrimental effect on cardiovascular function and metabolism. The menopause compounds many traditional CVD risk factors, including changes in body fat distribution from a gynoid to an android pattern, reduced glucose tolerance, abnormal plasma lipids, increased blood pressure, increased sympathetic tone, endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation (4).", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["22"]}

The effectiveness of the sub-surface barrier to arrest salinity movement is studied by choosing its locations at X1= 1.2 and X1= 2.8. The time evolution of the zone of salt-water concentration is studied for two years, four years, six years and ten years period for all the situations. It is observed that due to the barrier location at X1= 2.8, the salinity plume at the upper boundary is restricted in comparison to the non-barrier case. However, due to barrier, location at X1= 1.2 salinity intrusion is controlled significantly.[Nature and Science. 2006; 4 (4): 32-39].", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["22"]}

{"title": "Realistic inspection of proposed Ant algorithm with Antnet algorithm using NS-2\n", "abstract": " Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is the study of ant's actions to figure out how organic natural ants act in practice of searching foodstuff meant for them. It has been identified from the ants behavior that they in some way communicate with each other by smelling the substance called pheromone which is left by the other ants on that path who have already followed that path. The ants will go after the path having the best pheromone concentration. This procedure will ultimately allow them to follow the best path. This foraging behavior of swarm of ants may be used to solve complex computational optimization problems. Due to foraging behavior of swarm of ants, they are able to find the best way to reach to the destination of their food source from their current location. In spite of being practically blind they communicate indirectly to work for the common goal. Ants deposit a chemical substance called pheromone for marking path from their current location to the food source. By sensing these pheromone trails, foragers may follow the path to food discovered by other ants. The route with the maximum concentration of pheromone will be the shortest one and almost all ants end up using this path. This communal behavior demonstrates collective and unsupervised learning without any centralized control. This decentralized and simple but effective collective pheromone trail-laying and pheromone trail-following behavior is the inspiring source of ACO. In this paper we have proposed a new ant based routing algorithm and we have implemented and simulated it on network simulator NS-2 and we have compared the simulation results with one of the existing ant\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["22"]}
{"title": "Financial services for low-income women: Opportunities for economic empowerment?\n", "abstract": " Over the past thirty years, financial service interventions have featured prominently in efforts to advance women economically. They include informal savings groups, the integration of women into formal banking, and financial intermediaries that bridge the divide between them. Many efforts, particularly microcredit targeted at poor women, have achieved large scale, especially in some countries such as India, Bangladesh and Bolivia. A whole spectrum of methodologies is being applied by a wide range of institutions, some of which now offer varied products including savings and microinsurance. In the last 15 years, technological advances such as mobile phone-based banking offer new opportunities for greater outreach and scale. Some banks are also making efforts to provide loans to more women small and medium entrepreneurs.Although these financial interventions have been extensively studied, using a range of evaluation techniques in different contexts, they have not often been examined comprehensively in the context of empowering women economically. Nor is much information available about the contexts in which particular approaches succeed and where they do not, or what products are more suitable or better meet particular demands.

A design methodology, by evaluatingm the ratio of the effective channel length to the natural length for the different devices (single or double gate FETs) and technology (SOI or GOI), is proposed to minimize short channel effects (SCEs). The optimization of non-overlapped gate-source/drain ie underlap channel architecture is extremely useful to limit the degradation in SCEs caused by the high permittivity channel materials like Germanium as compared to that exhibited in Silicon based devices. Subthreshold slope and Drain Induced Barrier Lowering results show that steeper S/D gradients along with wider spacer regions are needed to suppress SCEs in GOI single/double gate devices as compared to Silicon based MOSFETs.

However, longer duration of wild Cicer species and nonsynchronization of flowering with cultigen remains a major deterrence for their use in chickpea improvement. In this study, the response to vernalization (V), photoperiod (P), and combination of both (V + P) was studied in terms of rate of progress toward flowering in cultivated and wild Cicer species belonging to primary, secondary, and tertiary gene pools. Both V and P treatments, alone and in combination, significantly increased the rate of progress toward flowering in wild Cicer species compared with control. Effect of P in increasing the rate of progress toward flowering was significantly higher than V in C. reticulatum Ladiz., C. echinospermum P. H. Davis, C. judaicum Boiss., C. pinnatifidum Jaub. & Spach, C. bijugum Rech. f., and C. yamashitae Kitam. and vice versa in C. chorassanicum (Bunge) Popov and C. cuneatum Hochst. ex A. Rich. Synergistic effects of V and P were observed in C. bijugum, C. yamashitae, C. chorassanicum, and C. cuneatum. However, both V and P treatments had minimal effect on the rate of progress toward flowering in early-maturing and greater effects on medium- and late-maturing chickpea varieties. These results would contribute significantly to enhance use of wild Cicer species for chickpea improvement through synchronization of flowering facilitating hybridization. Also, it would improve the regeneration efficiency of wild Cicer species by genebanks and\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["22"]}

Floating lag time (FLT), total floating time (TFT) and time required to release 50% of the drug (T 50) were selected as dependent variables. The dissolution data obtained were fitted to various release models and the floating profiles of the formulations analyzed.Results: HPMC K4M loading clearly enhanced floating properties while CP934P showed negative effect on floating properties but was helpful in controlling drug release. The quadratic mathematical model developed was used to predict optimum formulations. The computer optimization process, contour plots and response surface plots predicted the concentration of independent variables A and B to be 47.32 and 8.4 mg, respectively, for maximum TFT and T50 at the same time for least FLT. Predicted concentration of independent variables showed the same results experimentally, with-0.75-1.47 percentage errors.Conclusion: CCD demonstrated the role of the derived equations, contour plots and response surface plots in predicting the values of independent variables for the preparation and optimization of glipizide gastric floating matrix tablet.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["22"]}

Routing algorithms such as Dynamic Source Routing (DSR), Zone Routing Protocol (ZRP), Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm (TORA) and Ad Hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) etc are examples of basic algorithms for MANETs that has been developed by researchers and these basic algorithms are classified under three categories ie proactive, reactive and hybrid algorithms for MANETs. Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and Ad Hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) Routing are reactive algorithms setting up paths only when they are required. When data is required to be transferred over the wireless network in order to provide communication between two nodes, the sender node searches for a route by flooding the network with route request messages. Their propagation introduces some stoppage before data packets can be sent and reactive routing algorithms are inefficient when there is much continuous but irregular traffic in the network. On the contrary, Destination Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV) routing comes under the category of proactive routing algorithms. It maintain a fresh list of routes between all node pairs all the time by periodically broadcasting the routing information to keep the routing table up-to-date at each node. This approach requires a network to carry a lot of control traffic into a network.

{"title": "A new variant of subset-sum cryptosystem over RSA\n", "abstract": " RSA is an algorithm for public-key cryptography that is based on the presumed difficulty of factoring large integers, the factoring problem. RSA stands for Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard, who first publicly described it in 1978. A user of RSA creates and then publishes the product of two large prime numbers, along with an auxiliary value, as their public key. The prime factors must be kept secret. In RSA if one can factor modulus into its prime numbers then the private key is also detected and hence the security of the cryptosystem is broken. The Subset-Sum cryptosystem (Knapsack Cryptosystem) is also an asymmetric cryptographic technique. The Merkle-Hellman system is based on the subset sum problem (a special case of the knapsack problem): An instance of the Subset Sum problem is a pair (S, t), where S={x1, x2,..., xn} is a set of positive integers and t (the target) is a positive integer. The decision problem asks for a subset of S whose sum is as large as possible, but not larger than t. This problem is NP-complete. However, if the set of numbers (called the knapsack) is super increasing, that is, each element of the set is greater than the sum of all the numbers before it; the problem is easy and solvable in polynomial time with a simple greedy algorithm. So in this paper we present a new algorithm (Modified Subset-Sum cryptosystem over RSA) which is secure against Mathematical attack, Brute-force attack, Factorization attack and Chosen-cipher-text attack on RSA as well as Shamir attacks. This paper also presents comparison between Modified Subset-Sum Cryptosystem and RSA cryptosystems in respect of security and performance.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["22"]}

Further, experiments are also performed to calculate the capture efficiency of magnetic particles experimentally in a tube of diameter 6\u252c\u00e1mm under magnetic field. Iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles were synthesized via co-precipitation method and transported them in a tube with help of peristaltic pump. The value of capture efficiency, calculated through experimental data, is found to be 26 and 50%, which is slightly differ from its value (30 and 52%) calculated through mathematical model at 2 and 6 kOe magnetic field, respectively. Subsequently, the experimental results validate the mathematical model results.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["22"]}

Ultrasonography has been proposed for the noninvasive evaluation of omasal disease. The objectives of this study were to compare the in vitro and in vivo ultrasonographic appearance of the omasum and to compare omasal appearance, limits, and size in clinically healthy cows with those in cows having confirmed omasal impaction. A 3.5\u0393\u00c7\u00ebMHz curvilinear transducer was used to image and record the appearance of the omasum in vitro in a water bath, and its appearance, dorsal and ventral limits, and size in 10 healthy Indian Jersey/Red Sindhi crossbred cows. The results were compared with the ultrasonographic data collected from 5 cows with omasal impaction, as confirmed at necropsy. On moving the transducer dorsoventrally in each intercostal space and below the costal arch, the wall of omasum could be seen as an echogenic arc-like structure. The difference between mean dorsoventral extents of the normal and impacted omasums was statistically insignificant. These results suggest that ultrasonographic imaging may not be useful in the diagnosis of omasal impaction in Indian crossbred cows, however, additional studies may be warranted.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["22"]}

The areas extending caudally from the tuber-coxae, cranially up to the 11th intercostal space, dorsally from the lumbar transverse processes, and ventrally up to the midflank on both sides (left and right) were shaved. The transducer was placed in the right and left paralumbar fossae, the 3rd (between vertebrae L3 and L4) and the 4th (between vertebrae L4 and L5) lumbar spaces, respectively. For transrectal manoeuvring of the left kidney, the arm was inserted in to the rectum beyond the elbow to palpate and push the left kidney gently towards the right abdominal wall. The left kidney was imaged in its entirety from the right paralumbar fossa in all of the cows. However, it could not be imaged with clarity without a gentle transrectal push towards the right abdominal wall at the time of imaging. The left kidney was also imaged via the 3rd (between vertebrae L3 and L4) and the 4th (between vertebrae L4 and L5) lumbar spaces in only eight of 10 cows, but the quality of imaging was poor in comparison to the transflank imaging. Moreover, in four of ten cows, the right and left kidneys were imaged together in one ultrasonographic image. On the basis of our results we consider transcutaneous ultrasonography, simultaneously supported with transrectal manoeuvring, to be suitable for evaluation of the left kidney in cows.

Muscle growth effects are thought to result from beta-2 adrenoceptor activation. This study attempted to characterise muscle (gastrocnemius) tissue damage following the administration of isoproterenol.Methods: Adult male Balb-C mice were treated with a single oral dose of isoproterenol (100 mg/kg body weight) for 4, 8, 20, 48 and 72 hours. Control mice received equal doses of saline. The animals were killed at the respective stages, followed by the collection of gastrocnemius and blood. Serum was then separated from blood. Histopathology and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays were performed.Results: Beta-adrenoceptor activation-induced histological changes began with structural aberrations, and ultimately resulted in myonecrosis and extensive degeneration within hours of the administration of isoproterenol. The effects of beta-agonist administration on muscle myofibre organisation were visible within four hours and became most prominent at 20 and 48 hours. Augmentation of more than 20 percent in muscle LDH activity was observed at 4, 8 and 72 hour stages, and was accompanied by a significant decline of 19 and 27 percent at 20 and 48 hour time points, respectively. Serum corroborated the above results.Conclusion: Isoproterenol treatment produced considerable histopathological changes, including myonecrosis in mice gastrocnemius, resulting in a leaky sarcolemma and the release of marker enzyme, LDH into the serum (more evident after 20 and 48 hours).

{"title": "Characterization of Ficus carica fiber by scanning electron microscope in adsorption isotherm studies of dye removal from aqueous solution\n", "abstract": " The biosorbent extracted from bast of Ficus carica plant has significant potential for removal of toxic Methylene blue dye from aqueous solution by adsorption. The unbalance forces on the surface of the biosorbent (natural fiber) are responsible to attract the adsorbate (dye-molecules) from the waste water for purification purposes. In the present scenario natural Ficus carica fiber has been characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) before and after adsorption of Methylene blue (MB) dye. The scanning electron microscope is the basic tools to characterize the adsorbents at finer scale which is beyond the preview of other techniques. Equilibrium behavior of natural fiber was investigated by performing batch adsorption experiments. Adsorption isotherm models, Langmuir and Freundlich were used to reproduce the equilibrium data. The Langmuir equation was found to have the correlation coefficient value in good agreement. Also, it was found that Ficus carica fiber (FCF) has an elevated adsorption capacity for MB dye (57.61 mg/g) and separation factor (RL< 1) accounts for feasibility of adsorption system.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["22"]}

Inoculation of bioinoculants encouraged results; the fresh tuber weight (53.12 qha-1), number of tubers bunch-1 (13.19), tuber length (9.59 cm) and tuber diameter (6.68 mm) showed the highest with treatment T12 (F2+ both bioinoculants) followed by T9 (F1+ both bioinoculants), T11 (F2+ AM fungi) and F10 (F2+ A. chroococcum) as compared to T1 (control), T2-T4 (bioinoculants) and T5-T6 (F1 and F2 fertilizer levels). Growth parameters were non significant between F1 and F2 dose of chemical fertilizers when inoculated with dual microorganisms. The nitrogen uptake was increased in Azotobacter treated plants, while higher P and K uptake were attained in AM fungi inoculated plants. The survival count of inoculated bacteria improved gradually and the highest count was observed on 150 days of inoculation. Economic analysis revealed the net profit from tubers was the highest in T9 using dual inoculation of microorganisms with 80% of recommended dosage of fertilizer followed by T12 and T11.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["22"]}

This approach drastically improved main health indices including Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) in Iran. The experience has had two main impacts on the health situation of the country. Firstly community control of health burden of communicable diseases and secondly, bringing about opportunities to non-communicable diseases including genetic disorders to emerge. Past three decades have been also a determining era for profound progress in basic genetic knowledge and development of community tools for prevention and control of genetic and congenital disorders in the world. These advances will widen the gaps between developing countries that are already lacking of basic genetic knowledge and technologies and developed countries that own these capacities, unless there are clever designing to employ the opportunities to bridge the gaps. Iran has enjoyed its first experience of using community tools for control of one of its prevalent genetic health problem, thalassemia major, adopting primary health care approach.

We present our experience with this technique in malignant lesions. METHODS: RF tumor ablation was done using an RF generator (Berchtold; Germany) generating 35-50 RF watts of power output. The RF needle was placed in the tumor under image guidance (n= 22) or at open surgery (n= 1). Around 1500 watts/cm3 RF energy was delivered to the tumor. Over 21 months, 23 patients underwent the procedure for 73 lesions, including metastatic liver lesions (n= 21) and locally advanced inoperable carcinoma of pancreas (n= 2). RESULTS: All lesions less than 3 cm in size (n= 15) and 39% of lesions 3-4 cm in size (17/44) had complete necrosis. Residual tumor was seen in 27/44 lesions (61%) 3-4 cm in size and in all 14 lesions more than 4 cm in size. There was no mortality or major morbidity. There were two minor complications (ascites 1, pleural effusion 1). Of 21 patients treated for liver metastases, 10 are still alive (6-month survival 19/21 [90%] and 12-month survival 11/17 [64.7%]).

While the function of only two of these genes is known (the gene for SBMA is the androgen receptor, and the gene for SCA6 is a sodium channel), it is clear from the DNA and protein sequences that the genes are diverse and unrelated. Thus, an expanded polyglutamine stretch itself may somehow play a role in disease etiology.The study of the structure of polyglutamine has a long history. Apparently the\u252c\u00f3 rst to study the structure of polyglutamine were Krull et al. in 1965 [3].

{"title": "Phosphorus metabolism and regulation in symbiotic fungi\n", "abstract": " Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi (Zygomycotona: order Glomales) are ubiquitous soil fungi that participate in symbiotic associations with vascular flowering plants in order to develop and complete their life cycle. Their dependency on these associations is the result, at least in part, of a lack of saprotrophic abilities, and these obligate symbionts colonize the cortex of plant roots to obtain carbon from their photoautotrophic partner (Smith and Read 1997). AM fungi have a significant impact on the health and mineral nutrition of their plant symbiotic partner and, although the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown, it is clear that AM fungi can translocates phosphate from the soil to the plant root (Pearson and Jakobsen 1993). Consequently AM symbiosis is an important determinant of plant species composition in terrestrial ecosystems (Van der Heijden et al. 1998) and is an essential link for mineral nutrition in sustainable agriculture. At the morphological level, the process of development of the AM symbiosis has been well described (Fig. 1).

The genotypes comprised of six CMS lines, few advance breeding lines and other core collection of our institute. Significant variability was recorded for CUPRAC, FRAP and total phenolics content indicating the scope for improvement in these traits based on various breeding strategies. Phenotypic co-efficient of variation (PCV) was higher (43.01, 73.07 and 64.28) than genotypic co-efficient of variation (GCV)(41.34, 71.83 and 63.88) in all cases indicating the role of environment in expression of these traits. However improvement for these traits is possible through selection and heterosis breeding as broad sense heritability (92.44% to 98.75%) and genetic advance as percentage of mean (82.46% to 130.87%) was high for all the traits. Correlation coefficient analysis revealed that CUPRAC, FRAP and total phenolics had significant positive correlation among each other. However, none of them had any significant correlation with marketable yield. Fourty six genotypes were classified into 6 groups based on non-hierarchical cluster analysis and phenotypic divergence.

Rice yield increase and economic benefit to farmers depends on soil fertility. Soil fertility depends on the status of soil nutrients such as total amount of N, P, K and other nutrients and their capacity to produce these nutrients in the form for easily available to the crop (available nutrients), toxic substances, soil erosion, being washed out and other ways of lost. It is opined that continuous use of chemical fertilizers under intensive cropping decreases crop yields due to deteoration of soil health and extra removal of nutrients by crops takes place with heavy fertilization. Mineral fertilizer input is the dominant factor of the overall nutrient balance, but their use is often imbalanced and their use efficiency remains below optimum levels. Managing the variability in soil nutrient supply resulting from intensive rice\u0393\u00c7\u00f4rice cultivation is one of the major challenges to sustaining and increasing rice yields. Phosphorous is one of the major nutrients, which limits plant growth and yields, and its availability is highly correlated with organic and inorganic fractions of soil phosphorous. Changes in P fractions might be due to application of organic manures, inorganic fertilizers, cropping sequences, crop management and environmental conditions. Nutrient imbalance in soil with chemical fertilization is also a cause of excess removal of other nutrients from the soil (Bharadwaj et al. 1994).", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["22"]}

The systematic investigation of cycloaddition of both zigzag and armchair carbon nanotubes with: CX2 (where X= H, F, Cl, Br, I) has been undertaken. The models selected for zigzag and armchair CNT are (10, 0) and (6, 6), respectively, since they have comparative radii (~ 8 \u251c\u00e0).

On comparison of armchair carbon nanotubes with zigzag nanotubes, it is found that trends towards carbenic reactivity are the same in both the cases.The dependence of addition of carbenes on the diameter of the carbon nanotubes is also investigated. The models used for nanotubes in this study range from (3, 3) to (10, 10). Their reactions with: CH2 have been studied with first principles DFT calculations. An attempt to rationalize the diameter effects is made on the basis of the structures of the nanotubes. It seems that diameter dependence of the reactivity is because of different pyramidalization and \u2567\u00c7-orbital misalignment angles in different carbon nanotubes.

Aim: In this present study we intend to find out the impact of past and present tuberculosis on the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. Results: Out of 195 diagnosed cases of bronchogenic carcinoma, 79 (40%) were taking anti-tubercular therapy for at least 1 month duration (range 1 month-12 months). Fifty one (26%) patients had received ATT in past. Twenty six patients (12.5%) were found to have co-existent tuberculosis and lung cancer, only 18 patients were newly diagnosed and the remaining were relapse cases. Mean delay for diagnosis of lung cancer in patients who were taking ATT inadvertently, owing to wrong diagnosis, was 3.2 months (range 1 month to 12 months). Conclusion: We found that large numbers of the bronchogenic carcinoma patients were misdiagnosed as a case of tuberculosis, this leads to significant delay in diagnosis and progression of cancer and results in poor outcome and lower survival. We recommend an early search for malignancy in suspected tubercular patients having risk factors for bronchogenic carcinoma.

Six isolates of C. globosum and other species showed a band of 630bp using specific primers. Amplified cDNA product of C. globosum (Cg 1) cloned and sequenced showed 603bp open reading frame encoding 200 amino-acids. The protein sequence had a molecular mass of 22 kDa and was therefore, named Hsp22. BlastX analysis revealed that the gene codes for a protein homologous to previously characterized Hsp22.4 gene from C. globosum (AAR36902.1, XP 001229241.1) and shared 95% identity in amino acid sequence. It also showed varying degree of similarities with small Hsp protein from Neurospora spp. (60%), Myceliophthora sp. (59%), Glomerella sp. (50%), Hypocrea sp. (52%), and Fusarium spp. (51%). This gene was further cloned into pET28a (+) and transformed E. coli BL21 cells were induced by IPTG, and the expressed protein of 30 kDa was analyzed by SDS-PAGE.  The IPTG induced transformants displayed significantly greater resistance to NaCl and Na2CO3 stresses.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["22"]}

Ectopic dentition refers to a tooth or teeth located away from the normal position within the jaws or in the vicinity of odontogenic structures. In contrast, heterotopic dentition includes a tooth or teeth present distantly into a site of an organ or tissue it does not normally occupy, such as in the case of the ovaries, mediastenum, and so forth. The incidence of supernumerary teeth generally affects 0.1% to 1% of the population. The most common location is the upper incisor area, known as the mesiodens. The etiology of supernumerary teeth is not completely understood. One theory suggests that the supernumerary tooth is created either from a thin tooth bud that arises from the dental lamina near the permanent tooth bud, or from splitting of the permanent bud itself. Another theory is that its development is a reversion to the dentition of extinct primates, which had 3 pairs of incisors. The hyperactivity theory suggests that supernumeraries are formed because of local, independent, conditioned hyperactivity of the dental lamina.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["22"]}

Implementation of the recommended postexposure prophylaxis by vaccination and specific immunoglobulin therapy for rabies is largely hampered by its high cost and inadequate production. Therefore, the development and availability of an economic preparation of rabies immunoglobulin is a high priority for India, where rabies is a major cause of death. We studied the efficacy of four different adjuvants in raising antibodies to rabies antigen in older, discarded equines. Methods. Eleven equines, 23 26 years old, were divided into 4 groups to receive four different adjuvants in small amounts (1 2 ml) Freund complete adjuvant with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Freund complete adjuvant with M. butyricum, Freund incomplete adjuvant and bentonite along with purified chick embryo cell vaccine. The immunization schedule was spread over 105 days and the antibody titres were measured on days 56, 91 and 119.Results.

{"title": "Carbon gain, water conservation and, expression of CAM during leaf development of Senecio medley-woodii\n", "abstract": " CO2 gas exchange and transpiration of each of the eleven youngest leaves of Senecio medley-woodii were monitored separately. The youngest leaves exhibited a marked net CO2 release associated with a low transpiration. With increasing leaf age a typical C3 photosynthesis pattern was measured and the transpiration was on a high level. In older leaves a shift to the crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) occurred and the transpirational water loss for the 24h period decreased. As a consequence of the shift to CAM a substantial improvement of the water use efficiency resulted. A correlation could be established between leaf area on the one hand and nocturnal accumulation of malate and increase in osmolality on the other. The importance of minimizing water loss at early stages of leaf expansion is discussed in connection with the shift to CAM and the water economy of the whole plant.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["22"]}

{"title": "A graph based ranking strategy for automated text summarization\n", "abstract": " Text summarization is a process of capturing the idea and line of thought from an original text and inculcating the same into a short coherent text. Automated text summarization aims to meet this objective of retaining all the key ideas instilled in the text while skipping upon the redundant and repetitive bits of information. The reduced text thus compiled must be coherent in itself in order to meet the semantic and syntactic organization of the language. This work presents an extraction based automatic text summarization algorithm. The methodology proposed involves constructing of a directed weighted graph out of the original text wherein each sentences is taken to be a node. The weights for each of the edges are determined by using a suitable distortion measure which analyses the semantic relation between the two adjacent nodes/sentences. A ranking algorithm is used to compute the most important sentences in the text and that should be present in the summary based on the weighted graph. This technique has been employed on multiple data sets and has performed well on the evaluation parameters laid down for such applications.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["22"]}

All methods employed for phase quadrature involves couplers created using microstrip line. A branch line coupler produces two equal magnitude outputs\u252c\u259290 out of phase and could be used in combination with a\u252c\u2592180 or rat race hybrid which produces two equal magnitude outputs\u252c\u2592180 out of phase to produce the desired phase shift [3]. The top view of QHA is shown in fig. 2. The quadrifilar helix antenna can transmit and receive circular polarized signals over a large angular region. Its radiation characteristics are determined mainly by the shape of the helices, ie the number of turns, pitch angle, antenna height and antenna diameter, and for conical shaped helices also the cone angle. These are typically fixed in space by winding them on some substrate of dielectric material, or by etching them on a substrate which is then formed into a cylinder. Helical antennas offer many advantages over dipole structures. Helical antennas are compact because of its cylindrical geometry. The antenna's which offers good gain factor and can operate over wideband. The unique property of circular polarized radiation pattern makes them more suitable for satellite communication. A helical antenna can also be used as a feed for a parabolic dish for higher gains [4].", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["22"]}

{"title": "Pharmacogenetics of essential hypertension\n", "abstract": " Hypertension is one of the most common chronic illnesses effecting more than 1 billion people worldwide and is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke and renal failure. By the year 2025, the global prevalence of hypertension is projected to increase to 29.2% in adult population (Kearney et al., 2005). It is well established that reduction in blood pressure is associated with decreased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (Lewington, Clarke, Qizilbash, Peto, & Collins, 2002). Despite the availability of several antihypertensive drugs which include thiazide diuretics, beta blockers, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and calcium channel blockers, global estimates suggest that less than 35% of hypertensives are able to achieve their target systolic and diastolic blood pressure with these drugs (Thoenes et al., 2009). The current strategy of trial and error approach to the management of hypertension is suboptimal and alternative approaches for identifying the optimal antihypertensive regimen in a specific patient are needed. One potential approach for individualizing antihypertensive therapy is through the use of genetic information, or pharmacogenomics, to identify the most appropriate therapy for individual patients. Given the health burden associated with hypertension and the poor rates of BP control, hypertension pharmacogenomics holds great potential.

{"title": "Development and performance evaluation of a mat type nursery raising device\n", "abstract": " In the Tarai region the rice transplanting is accomplished mainly by the manual method. Manual transplanting is a labour intensive operation comprising of nursery raising, uprooting of the seedlings, transporting and transplanting them in the main field, with a total labour requirement of about 280-350 manh/ha. High labour demand during peak transplanting period adversely affects the timeliness of this operation, thereby reducing the crop yield. To correct the problem, mechanical transplanting could be considered as the most promising option. The major constraint in the adoption of mechanical transplanters is the complex and labour intensive technique of raising mat type nursery in frames on perforated plastic sheets. Another constraint is unevenness of plant population in the mats. With a view to reduce the drudgery in raising mat-type nursery, a mattype nursery raising device was developed and tested. The developed device performed satisfactorily and gave the desired density of 80-100 g seed per mat with three passes of the device at 1.03 mm sprout length. The thickness of the soil layer could be also maintained to 20 mm, as required in a single pass, through out the length of the mat. It saved both time and labour of 72.02 and 33.33 percent, respectively, over the manual method. The cost of raising mat type nursery for one hectare (400 mats) was Rs. 299.5, compared to Rs. 1,608.75 with manual method.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["22"]}

{"title": "Modelling and analysis of Indian outsourcing industry: A system dynamics approach\n", "abstract": " India is emerging as one of the biggest markets for offshore services. Business process outsourcing (BPO) is the delegation of one or more information technology (IT) intensive business processes to an external provider that, in turn, owns, administrates and manages the selected processes based upon defined and measurable performance metrics. Offshore outsourcing is an umbrella term covering a range of IT and business services delivered to companies in developed countries by personnel based in developing countries. Though Indian outsourcing industry is growing, the attrition rate is also rising in this sector. So is the backlash against outsourcing. In order to survive and grow in this scenario, Indian firms must ensure that their services are not only cost-effective but also qualitatively superior. The present study probes into these issues. The study aims to explore the structure of Indian outsourcing industry through the methodology of system dynamics. A system dynamics model has been developed, validated and simulated over time to understand the trends that characterize this industrial segment.

The key to the success in crop improvement depends on how effectively and efficiently the new genetic variation is introduced to broaden the genetic base of cultigens. The genus Arachis harbors considerable diversity for morpho-agronomic traits including resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses. Impressive progress have been made towards developing a large number of markers specific to peanut in addition to the technological breakthrough in developing high-throughput genotyping platforms for unlocking the genetic variation present in the germplasm collections. Using core and mini core collections and genomic tools, peanut researchers have identified a number of diverse germplasm possessing agronomically beneficial traits that are now being used in peanut breeding.

Often input data arrives in bits and pieces, in random order from multiple sensors. Conjecturing high-level patterns from such data is often referred to as information fusion. Blackboard-based algorithms have been used to automatically identify such patterns. However, when the volume of data is large and includes noise, a naive blackboard-based algorithm can be inefficient due to the large number of combinations of inputs that a knowledge source could be applied on. Here we present an approach to improve the performance of blackboard-based algorithms under the assumption that each knowledge source is `locally-selective'.

So it is desirable to know the extent of accuracy of the position co-ordinate required for a particular timing accuracy. In this paper, an analytical expression relating to the position error and the corresponding error in the Time of the GPS receiver has been derived. Time error of the GPS receiver caused by the error in position coordinates largely depends on the position of the satellite indicated by the respective elevation and azimuth of the satellite. To validate the derived formulation it is important to configure the experimental plan very judiciously. A special experiment has accordingly been conducted at National Physical Laboratory, New Delhi, India (NPLI).

We first propose a simple approach to obtain a rough estimate of the light source position from a single image using the shading information which does not use any calibration or initialization. We model the prior information for the scene structure as a separate Markov random field (MRF) with discontinuity preservation, and the blur function is modeled as Gaussian. A proper regularization approach is then used to estimate the light source position, scene structure, and blur parameter.

{"title": "Strontium ranelate\n", "abstract": " Postmenopausal osteoporosis is a major public health problem. The objective of treatment is to either follow anti-resorptive or bone forming strategies (1). Currently available medications, such as bisphosphonates, selective estrogen receptor modulators, and teriparatides, have shown their ability to reduce vertebral and/or nonvertebral fractures. But it remains sub-optimal. There is, therefore, an urgent need of new effective, safe, and user-friendly medications to optimize the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Among these recent advances strontium ranelate (Sr) has gained importance in the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis (2).The di-strontium salt strontium ranelate, a novel orally active agent consisting of two atoms of stable strontium and the organic moiety ranelic acid, has been developed for the treatment of osteoporosis (3, 4). Strontium ranelate is a new antiosteoporotic treatment with a dual mode of action, both increasing bone formation and decreasing bone resorption, which rebalances bone turnover in favour of bone formation and increases bone strength. It has been shown to enhance osteoblastic cell replication and increase collagen synthesis while it decreases preosteoclast differentiation and bone-resorbing activity of mature osteoclasts in vitro. Studies performed at preclinical level have shown that strontium ranelate not only increases bone mass at various skeletal sites but also improves mechanical properties of femoral, humeral and vertebral bones.(3, 4).", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["22"]}

It is in this context that thirty two UPASl and other tea clones were investigated with regard to comparative karyomorphology and meiotic pairing properties so as to ascertain the nature and extent of intra - and interclonal differentiation. Barring one clone (UPASI 3), all other investigated clones were diploid (2n = 2x = 30) in constitution. UPASl3 was triploid (2n = 3x = 45) in constitution. The chromosome complements in the diploid tea clones, wherever investigated, resolved into 15 median and submedian homomorphic pairs. Between clones, minor variation in the proportion of median and submedian chromosomes and (or) number and location of secondary constrictions was observed. lnspite of the fact that tea clones are considered to be highly heterozygous, the male meiosis in the diploid clones was perfectly normal resulting in regular 15 bivalents at diakinesislmetaphase I, and equal (1 5:15) distribution of chromosomes at anaphase I. The only feature which could indicate degree of cryptic hybridity was the occurrence of bivalents with localized chiasmata. The predominant occurrence of trivalents in the triploid UPASI 3 indicated either autopolyploid or segmental allopolyploid origin. The genomic constitution of tea clones is discussed in the light of present results.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["22"]}

{"title": "Human Resource Management and Trade Unions (HRMTU)\n", "abstract": " In this paper an attempt is being made to concentrate on the problem of managing human resource, mainly the outside interference in the affairs of trade unions. Questions regarding the politicization of trade unions and problems arising thereof are also discussed. Though the activities and operational methods of trade unions in India have always been affected by the political thoughts and preferences, today\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s trend is alarming. Trade Unions are now generally linked to political parties, hence now they can seldom take decisions entirely by themselves. A big factor that contributes to the politicization of trade unions is inadequate education and training. Many labour leaders cannot understand the technicalities and intricacies inherent in the system and it is not unnatural on their part to fall into the hands of crafty politicians. Hence providing proper education and training to the workers and their leaders is very necessary. Moves to restrict and reduce the proportion of outside leadership in trade unions may be another constructive measure. It is also pointed out that though the politicization of trade unions cannot be stopped completely, it can be considerably checked. Such a measure would not only ensure better labour-management relations, but would also facilitate healthier industrial relations.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["22"]}

A series of experiments were conducted on seasonal abundance and the influence of abiotic factors on the incidence of A. atkinsoni on wild and different cultivars of mango viz Dashehari, Langra, Malda and Amarpalli at Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Science and Technology Jammu, and, at a mango orchard at Nagbani. The mango hoppers (adults) started appearing with the panicle emergence during the months of February-March and reached its peak ranging from 9.6 to 14.2 in wild and all cultivars under study during May-June. After this the hopper population started declining, but showed another peak (6.6 to 9.8) during August-September which is comparatively lower than the previous one. This clearly indicates that the species breeds twice a year thus a bivoltine species. From September onwards, the hoppers went on declining and vanished by the end of December as they migrate to cracks and crevices of tree trunk and overwinter as adults. Abiotic factors such as maximum temperature (X 1), minimum temperature (X 2), morning relative humidity (X 3), evening relative humidity (X 4) and rainfall (X 5) had much impact on the growth of hopper population. The hopper population correlated negatively and significantly with morning relative humidity (r=-0.635 to-0.816) and evening relative humidity (r=-0.289 to-0.556) and showed a significant positive correlation with mean maximum temperature (r= 0.692 to 0.915) and minimum temperature (r= 0.590 to 0.881) in wild and all four cultivars, whereas rainfall remained fluctuating\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["22"]}

We empirically evaluate our framework with 5 path planning algorithms: an A\u0393\u00ef\u00e5 planner, an unconstrained cubic spline interpolation in both 2D-and 3D-spaces, the 2D-and 3D-ECAN planners, and a MILP-based dynamically feasible trajectory planner.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["22"]}

From a derived most significant correlation equation, it was concluded that a less hydrophobic 3-substituent and a less bulky 7-substituent in addition to a 3-aminoisopropyl and a 6-chloro substituent are advantageous to enhance the inhibitory action of a compound towards rat pancreatic islets. On the other hand, the more hydrophobic 6- and 7-substituents augment the contractile activity.

We then reconstruct the high resolution intensity map for each light source position using the high resolution surface gradients. Results of experimentation on synthetic and real data are presented. The advantage of the proposed approach is that its time complexity is much less as compared to the super-resolution approaches that use global optimization techniques such as simulated annealing.

Still it is one of difficult and challenging problem because there are no absolute clinical, radiographic or histological parameters that accurately predict the propensity of any single lesion to recur or metastasize. Eighty per cent of the GCT have a benign course, with a local recurrence rate of 10-50%; about 10% of GCT undergo malignant transformation through their recurrences. The main aim of the management of GCT is to eliminate the tumor and still save the joint function. We present our experience with long stem prosthetic total knee arthroplasty for juxta articular giant cell tumors around the knee.Methods: Fourteen patients of juxta articular giant cell tumor around the knee were treated in our institute during the period 2008 to 2014 underwent resection and replacement by long stem arthroplasty with mesh were analyzed in this study. Patients were evaluated depending upon pain (Visual analogue score), range of movement, infection, pathological fracture and recurrence of tumor.Results: Excellent results were obtained in all 12 patients (85.71%) and 2 patients had good (14.29%) results in case of TKR with mesh in this study.Conclusions: Total knee arthroplasty with mesh is effective in achieving the desired goals of reconstruction with good functional results, least complications in selected patients and no recurrence.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["22"]}

{"title": "Potential mechanisms of heavy metals induced nephrotoxicity\n", "abstract": " Due to higher pervasiveness of heavy metals in the environment, exposure to heavy metals is the common phenomenon for nephrotoxicity. This review summarizes the possible diverse mechanisms of nephrotoxicity induced by heavy metals. Various mechanisms depending upon the type of heavy metal and its exposure are oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, apoptosis, inhibition of antioxidant enzymes etc. The roles of molecular factors such as metalbinding proteins, inclusion bodies, and cell-specific receptor like proteins that appear to influence renal tubule cell expression, have attracted increased interest as determinants that modulate cell populations as special risk for toxicity and renal cancer. We also review the mechanisms of carcinogenesis caused by heavy metals emphasizing on the involvement of signalling pathways by metal-induced generation of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress generation in cancer progression.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["22"]}

These nodulating bacteria have great potential with these tree legumes which are usually exposed to arid or water stress environmental conditions. Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR) can have positive effects on vigor and productivity, especially under stress conditions. Methods: The effect of water stress on four selected strains of Rhizobium species isolated from Albizia lebbeck, Delbergia sissoo, Acacia catechu and rhizospheric soils of legume crops were studied on A. lebbeck and A. catechu seedlings growth. The water stress (0,-3,-5,-8 and-10 bars) were obtained using Polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG-6000) solutions. Results: A decrease in water potential produced a marked reduction in germination percentage, seedling germination and seed vigor index. Out of the four isolates tested, Rhizobium isolated from A. lebbeck and A. catechu performed better in respect of germination percentage, Seedling Vigor Index (SVI), root and shoot length, number of leaves, secondary root formation and total biomass yield, compared to other strains. Conclusion: Growth responses varied between the different strains, these differences in germination ability of A. lebbeck and A. catechu might be attributed to intraspecific interaction resulting from the effects of natural selection and selected strains could assist in the rehabilitation of agroforestry by overcoming the effect of water stress.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["22"]}

The problem has been formulated by employing the basic idea of the Shliomis theory to the equation of motion and magnetization equation for Nano-Ferrofluid flow due to a rotating disk. The system of nonlinear partial differential equations governing the unsteady flow is expressed in cylindrical coordinates taking z-axis as axis of rotation are further solved by Newton method in MATLAB by taking the initial guess with the help of Flex PDE. The nature of radial, tangential and axial velocities in the presence of low oscillating magnetic field with different values of effective magnetization parameter is discussed quantitatively and qualitatively.It has been found that the change in the axial velocity due to magneto-viscosity is dominant in comparison to the radial and tangential velocity. Further, the axial velocity component reaches the steady state region slower than the redial velocity component and much slower than the tangential velocity component because of the centrifugal effect. The effective magnetization parameter creates an additional resistance on the axial component of velocity provided the applied magnetic field and vorticity of the flow are not collinear, and reaches to a maximum when the applied magnetic field is perpendicular to the vorticity of the flow. Further, the axial velocity does not depend on the distance from the axis but on the distance from the plate.

DNA is a long stretch of linked nucleotides that consists of adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) or thymine (T). The DNA is composed of a double helix (strands of nucleotides). The two single strands are arranged antiparallel, and are linked with hydrogen bonding between complementary bases (A pairs with T and C with G). As the strands are complementary, it is sufficient to represent a DNA molecule by a single strand, with one end called 5 and other end called 3 [Alberts et al., 2002].

LC50 value of manganese after 96 hours was found to be 3.2 mg/l for Garra gotyla gotyla. Three replicates of 10 fishes were subjected to three sub-lethal concentrations of manganese ie 0.64 mg/l, 1.28 mg/l and 1.92 mg/l (20%, 40% and 60% respectively of LC50value of manganese) for 1, 5 & 9 weeks. Blood samples were isolated from the fish following the exposure to measure the levels of cortisol and compared to the control group. We observed significant increase (p< 0.01) in the levels of cortisol of three groups of fish after 1st week of exposure to three doses of manganese as well as significant decrease in the cortisol of three groups exposed for 5th & 9thweek. The rate of decrease in group III (exposed to1. 92 mg/l of Mn) was higher than that of group I & II (exposed to 0.64 mg/l of Mn and 1.28 mg/l of Mn).", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["22"]}
{"title": "A Preliminary Molecular Study on Protein Profile of Vital Organs: A New Direction for Post Mortem Interval Determination\n", "abstract": " Estimation of the postmortem interval (PMI) is one of the most important tasks in Forensic Medicine. Six autopsy organ tissues such as brain, lungs, heart, liver, pancreas and kidney were taken at the time of forensic autopsy. All the proteins present in the tissues were extracted and the protein profile was analyzed on the sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) starting from 0 day to 10th day after death. The protein profiles showed a consistent degradation pattern which was consistent and reproducible in all the samples with respect to the time interval. In conclusion, the protein profile of the vital body organs appears to be a useful method for estimating the post mortem interval up to 10th day. Advantage of this approach over others is that it can detect the post mortem interval over a long interval (0 -10 days) with an easily detectable pattern of protein profile.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["22"]}

It is a synthetic steroid with tissue selectivity that has progestogenic, some androgenic as well as estrogenic effects. It has been used as an alternative to estrogen replacement therapy in several European countries for almost 2 decades, primarily for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis and treatment of climacteric symptoms. Mechanism of action (2): Tibolone itself has no biological activity; its effects are the results of the activity of its metabolites on various tissues. After administration, tibolone is quickly metabolized into 3a-hydroxytibolone (3 \u251c\u0192 OH-tibolone) and 3 \u251c\u0192-OH-tibolone compounds, which are also present in an inactive, sulfated form. A third compound, the? 4-isomer, is formed from tibolone directly or from the 3 \u251c\u0192-OH-metabolites. Tibolone has estrogenic effects on bone and vaginal tissue. In endometrial tissue the? 4-isomer functions as a progestagen, whereas in the brain and liver it has androgenic effects. In breast tissue, the main actions of tibolone are strong inhibition of sulfatase activity and weak inhibition of 17 a-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity, which result in blocking the conversion of estrone sulfate to E2.

The specific activity of final pure extracellular and intracellular enzymes after gel filtration chromatography (25.1 units/mg; 11.2 units/mg, respectively) had increased by 46.48 and 40.17 fold, respectively in comparison to cell free supernatant. These purified extra and intracellular phospholipase A fractions were selected for further enzyme kinetic studies. The effect of various physical and chemical agents and variation in enzyme and substrate concentrations were studied using both enzyme fractions. Optimum activity of both enzyme fractions was at pH 7.0, temperature 40oC and after 120 min incubation. The effect of different substrate concentrations on enzyme kinetics revealed that Km values for extra and intracellular enzymes were 128 \u252c\u2561M and 370 \u252c\u2561M, respectively. The undiluted enzyme showed the maximum activity of both fractions and dilution gradually decreased the activity of enzyme fractions.

Daidzein, a major isoflavone found in soybean, is metabolized to equol by gut microflora, and the metabolite exhibits a stronger estrogenic activity than daidzein which may inhibit bone loss apparently without estrogenic activity in the reproductive organs. Thus, phytoestrogens in the form of soy-derived isoflavones and genistein may be protective against osteoporosis due to their ability to exert oestrogenic actions on bone cells in postmenopausal women and thus suppressing osteoclastic bone resorption and promoting bone formation (10, 11). CVS healthGenistein in vitro relaxes arteries by a nitric oxide dependent mechanism and enhances the dilator response to acetylcholine of atherosclerotic arteries. Genistein supplementation improves endothelial dysfunction and reduces infarct size in an experimental model of myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury. Furthermore, genistein in postmenopausal women increases plasma nitric oxide breakdown products, reduces endothelin-1 levels and improves endothelial dependent vasodilation in post-menopausal women.

The paper highlights occurrence of a high rate of blackouts in 6-7 GHz LOS paths running over built up areas. The fading analyses made in association with sodar returns show that hot-cold airmass fronts generate large fadings. The rain attenuation at 11 GHz shows sensitivity to dropsizes of 3.5 mm diameter and above and is generally higher than in the CCIR model.< >", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["22"]}

We assessed the predictive value of polymorphonuclear leukocyte counts (PMNs) and its association with mortality in hospitalized SBP patients.Methods: We examined 51 cirrhotic patients diagnosed with SBP in a prospective case-control study admitted to a Nepali tertiary care facility from February 2010 to November 2012. Serial paracentesis and ascitic fluid analysis were performed at admission, 24, and 48 hours. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, repeated measures analysis of variance, and logistic regression evaluated ascitic PMNs as predictors of mortality.Results: Deceased patients demonstrated significantly elevated mean circulating and ascitic PMNs. Ascitic PMNs in the non-survivors were significantly elevated upon admission and at 24 and 48 hours. These differences were significant based on absolute counts, relative differences and trends across time. ROC curves provided diagnostic thresholds (1600, 860, 500 cells/mm3) distinguishing the two groups upon presentation, at 24 and 48 hours respectively, with high sensitivities (100%), specificities (82.5-97.5%), and positive predictive values (52.4-84.6%). After adjusting for age and case severity, there was a 9.1-fold greater odds of mortality upon admission, for every increase of 500 ascitic PMNs.Conclusion: In this study of cirrhotic patients with SBP, in-hospital mortality was associated with persistently elevated ascitic PMNs\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["22"]}
{"title": "Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation: Clinical Challenges\n", "abstract": " Umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) is becoming a salvage treatment in lieu of bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in patients with hematological disorders who lack human leucocyte antigen (HLA) identical stem cell donor. Additionally, this procedure has demonstrated reduced recurrent acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease, reduced relapse rates, long-term immunological recovery and comparable overall survival when compared with other unrelated allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. UCBT is further elucidated by its easy procurement, expeditious availability and more tolerance for HLA mismatches. Discerningly, UCBT is followed by notable delays in the rates and kinetics of neutrophil and platelet engraftment and higher transplant related mortality. This is related in part to the inherently lessened number of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in UCB grafts. Several strategies have been assayed to overcome relatively limited number of stem cells, such as multiple UCB transplants and ex vivo expansion of HSCs. In this review, we have compiled the current clinical research investigations to provide reader with a brief glimpse into the remarkable potential UCB possess for transplantation.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["22"]}

Age of occurrence is generally between first and second decades of life. It is often mistaken for a den tigerous cyst due to presence of an impacted tooth. The diagnosis of AF usually occurs accidentally by routine radiographic examination for an impacted tooth. Histologically it consists of odontogenic ectomesenchyme resembling the dental papilla, epithelium resembling dental lamina and enamel organ without dental hard tissues. There is controversy in the literature as to whether the treatment should be conservative or a radical resection should be done. A conservative treatment strategy, such as enucleation and curettage, is usually sufficient.

Amorphous nature of sample was verified by XRD. Thin films of the present sample were prepared by vacuum thermal evaporation technique. For this, amorphous thin films are exposed to white light of intensity 15000 Lux at room temperature in the presence of vacuum (~ 10-2 Torr). TSC have been measured, before and after exposure of light in the temperature range 308 K to 378 K. From these measurements, the density of traps (Nt) has been calculated in exposed and unexposed samples. Results indicate that the density of traps increases with the increase of exposure time. The defect density increase with exposure time indicates that more and more defects are created as exposure time increases. Due to light soaking, number of dangling bonds may increase due to breaking of covalent bonds which increases the density of defect states.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["22"]}

{"title": "Systematic review of economic burden in symptomatic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients\n", "abstract": " OBJECTIVES: In pharmaceutical comparative effectiveness studies, patients frequently discontinue drug treatments soon after initiation, potentially biasing estimated costs attributed to treatments. A partitioned data structure may facilitate estimating costs in the presence of censoring. We compared health care utilization costs for two chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatments over a oneyear period using intent-to-treat (ITT) and as protocol (AP) approaches. METHODS: Claims data from two managed care health plans from July 2004 through September 2013 was used to compare annual health care costs for COPD patients treated with 1) inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) or long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)(non-triple) therapy, or 2) concurrent ICS/LABA+ LAMA (triple) therapy. Post-treatment costs were aggregated by 4-week periods. Costs were estimated for ITT and AP treatment groups, using actual and weighted cost methods. Patients were censored for health plan disenrollment (possible after 6 months postindex). In the AP analysis, patients were additionally censored for discontinuation of treatment. Weights were the inverse probability of remaining uncensored. RESULTS: Study subjects numbered 5,475; 484 triple, 4,991 non-triple. Few patients disenrolled (n= 139) by one-year post-index. ITT cost estimates were similar for actual and weighted cost methods. ITT actual mean total costs were significantly higher for triple therapy patients (P= 0.01): $20,013 (standard deviation [SD], $12,865) for triple, and $18,468 (SD, $11,619) for non-triple.

Insertion of slots on radiating patch and ground plane results in UWB characteristics. Parasitic effect is minimized by optimizing the slot\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s width and length, which results in uniform return loss in the entire UWB range. The simulated and modeled results show that return loss and voltage standing wave ratio are less than-25 dB and 2 respectively in the entire UWB range except for band notch. The effect of slot in ground structure results in band notching from 4.9 to 6.4 GHz. The result shows that slot in ground structure overcomes the signal interference WLAN (5.12-5.825 GHz) system and can be appropriately used for UWB application.

The stringent equilibrium between quiescence, self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation is maintained by the operational selectiveness of intrinsic factors and extrinsic cues provided by the specialized microenvironment called the \u0393\u00c7\u00a3niche\u0393\u00c7\u00a5 that provides homeness to hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The niche is defined by a heterogeneous identity involving the complex interaction of various other cells, cytokines, adhesion molecules, and extracellular matrix via several surface receptors and soluble factors, which work in paracrine coordination and protect stem cells from depletion while eliciting proliferation. The widespread investigations have shed light on the mechanistic underpinnings in niche, which coordinate the balance between relative hematopoietic quiescence and proliferation. In this paper, we discuss the recent findings concerning how these complex niche interactions facilitate the regulation of hematopoietic stem cells during homeostasis and further extend the discussion to their involvement in expansion and tumorigenesis, the two biological phenomena that are intimately associated with stem cells.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["22"]}

The use of non-volatile solvent causes improved wettability and ensures molecular dispersion of drug in the formulation and leads to enhance solubility. By using hydrophobic carriers (non-volatile solvents) one can modify release (sustained release) of drugs by this technique. Liquisolid system is characterized by flow behavior, wettability, powder bed hydrophilicity, saturation solubility, drug content, differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infra red spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, in-vitro release and in-vivo evaluation. The increased bioavailability is due to either increased surface area of drug available for release, an increased aqueous solubility of the drug, or improved wettability of the drug particles. According to the new formulation method of liqui-solid compacts, liquid medications such as solutions or suspensions of water insoluble drugs in suitable nonvolatile liquid vehicles can be converted into acceptably flowing and compressible powders by blending with selected powder excipients. It has been speculated that such systems exhibit enhanced release profiles. In this case, even though the drug is in a solid dosage form, it is held within the powder substratin solution or, in a solubilized, almost molecularly dispersed state, which contributes to the enhanced drug dissolution properties.

The other single data rate SRAMs are inefficient as they require idle cycles when they frequently switch between reading and writing to the memory. This controller is simulated on the Spartan 3 device. And the performance analysis is done on the basis of area, speed and power.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["22"]}

{"title": "BMP 7 regulates dormancy and recurrence of prostate cancer stem cell in bone via P38/NDRG1/P21 signaling axis.\n", "abstract": " Bone is the most common metastatic site of prostate cancer, which affects approximately 70% of patients with advanced disease. Although patients with localized lesions can be cured by radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy, more than 90% of cancer deaths are attributed to metastatic disease. Growth of the tumor cells in the bone is generally slow and they often become dormant until an appropriate microenvironment is established for their recurrence. However, how these metastatic tumor cells become dormant and how they recur at the target organs is virtually unknown. To address this critical question, we have studied an interaction of prostate cancer cells (PC3mm) and bone stromal cells (HS5).The conditioned medium of HS5 induced growth arrest and senescence to prostate cancer cells. Our results of Western blot, qRT-PCR and reporter assay showed that this effect was mediated by induction of p38 MAP\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["22"]}

{"title": "An integrated methodology to address complex faulting in static models: A case study from offshore sabah\n", "abstract": " Reservoir characterization of complex fault zones seen in seismic data and honoring them in static and dynamic models can be challenging. Nevertheless, understanding the fault relationships seen in seismic and other data sources, including well dip meter/image data and production data, is critical to capture the potential effect of complex structures on fluid flow within the reservoir. The problem is compounded when working in a brownfield with a stacked reservoir section of more than 2,000 ft [610 m]. There, the vertical fault relationship becomes as important as the lateral relationships, and standard pillar-grid-based methods are ineffective. A novel workflow is therefore proposed to characterize complex faults in such reservoirs using Ant Tracking, well and production data, fluid contact information, and honouring such data in static and dynamic models using new technology based on triangulated framework\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["22"]}

It is useful to discriminate among M. tuberculosis strains, investigate outbreaks and distinguish between reactivation and re-infection. We studied polymorphisms among M. tuberculosis isolates from northern India using RFLP to determine the presence of a correlation between IS6110 based fingerprints and drug resistance and to look for relapse and transmission among patients and their contacts. RFLP patterns of PvuII digested genomic DNA of 100 M. tuberculosis isolates were analyzed using southern blotting with a 245 bp IS6110 probe. Drug sensitivity testing (DST) was conducted for rifampicin (40 \u252c\u2561g/ml), isoniazid (1 \u252c\u2561g/ml), ethambutol (2 \u252c\u2561g/ml) and streptomycin (4 \u252c\u2561g/ml) using the proportion method. A high degree of polymorphism was seen among the M. tuberculosis isolates and the number of IS6110 copies varied from 0 to 14, with a predominance of isolates with 11 bands. Seventy-five isolates had a high number of bands, 9 had an intermediate number, 6 isolates had a low number and 10 isolates had no bands. No correlation between IS6110 band numbers and RFLP banding patterns was found with drug resistance or for any particular geographical area, although clustering was seen amongst MDR-TB cases.

Private sector banking in India has been mushrooming ever since the process of nationalization has started. But still the major drawback of these private sector banking is related to the growing concern of the increasing Non Performing Assets ie the irrecoverable part of the loan. The RBI has issued strict guidelines in this respect, and the banks are directed to follow this with special focus.

The LIBS technique will permit rapid active remote interrogation through dust layers and up to 1 mm into rocks (far deeper in soils) using an analysis spot size in the range of 300-600 \u252c\u2561m. In addition to the typical elements analyzable by other techniques (Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Cr, Fe, Ni, Zn) LIBS adds the capability for the light elements, H, Li, Be, B, C, N, and O, which are critical for understanding habitable soils, organic material, and ices. ChemCam\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s analysis range is 7 m, and the team expects to provide elemental compositions with\u252c\u259210% relative accuracies.Beginning with PIDDP funding in 2002 and an R&D100 award in 2003 this team has developed a combined Raman-LIBS instrument concept. Raman spectroscopy has long been viewed as highly useful for planetary science [eg, 5], as it provides information on mineralogy and organic molecule structure that is highly complementary to elemental compositions provided by LIBS. For remote analyses a combined instrument is feasible because both techniques require a pulsed laser, telescope, and spectrometer [6-10]. A further advantage of a combined Raman-LIBS instrument is that using the LIBS mode, the laser can remove dust and profile into the sample, providing access to the subsurface that would not be possible with only the Raman technique [6].

{"title": "Geochemical Speciation and Bioavailability of Arsenic in Chemically Variant Soils Amended with Sodium Arsenite: A Greenhouse Study\n", "abstract": " High residual level of arsenic at former agricultural lands is a critical environmental issue as soil arsenic may pose serious health risk through direct contact, ingestion or inhalation. A major factor governing the toxicity of arsenic in soil is its bioaccessibility that depends on its interaction with soil components. Little attention has been paid to investigate reactivity, distribution and stability patterns of arsenical pesticides in different soil types. To address the issue of soil variability on arsenic bioaccessibility, a greenhouse column study is being performed allowing for dynamic interactions between soils, water, plants and pesticide. Three agricultural soils (ie Eufaula, Millhopper and Orelia series) differing in their physicochemical properties were selected for these investigations. Selected soils were amended with sodium arsenite (a common pesticide prior to the nineties) at three rates (0, 45, and 450 mg/kg As) and were analyzed immediately after spiking (time 0) and after 4-month soil pesticide equilibration. Vetiver grass (Vetiveria zizanioides) was used as the test crop. Noticeable vetiver growth was observed in Orelia soils amended with 450 mg/Kg of As. However, no vetiver growth was observed in the other soils at the higher amendment rate. The majority of the arsenic was leached out from the Eufaula and Millhopper soils after the first leaching event. A sequential extraction scheme was employed to identify geochemical forms of arsenic in soils (soluble, exchangeable, organic, Fe/Al bound, Ca/Mg-bound, residual). Concentrations of these operationally-defined soil-As forms were correlated with the \u0393\u00c7\u00a3in-vitro\u0393\u00c7\u00a5 bioaccessible arsenic fractions.

The authors conclude that landiolol [0.1 mg\u252c\u2556 kg\u0393\u00c7\u00f41 (L1 group) and 0.3 mg\u252c\u2556 kg\u0393\u00c7\u00f41 (L3 group)] prevents tachycardia without affecting blood pressure. However, the results indicate that there was no difference in heart rate (HR) values between the control group and L1 group. We believe that this may be related to the anesthetic induction technique, which comprised propofol (2 mg\u252c\u2556 kg\u0393\u00c7\u00f41) and succinylcholine (1 mg\u252c\u2556 kg\u0393\u00c7\u00f41). It is well known that propofol2 as well as succinylcholine3 are associated with a decrease in HR. Further, it is unclear as to when vecuronium was administered during the induction-intubation sequence: as this may have presented an additional confounding factor.Thus, it appears that a dose of 0.1 mg\u252c\u2556 kg\u0393\u00c7\u00f41 of landiolol was unable to attenuate the tachycardia in response to tracheal intubation independently from the effects of the anesthetic agents.

{"title": "Perspective of irrigation in Madhya Pradesh\n", "abstract": " AMONG THE inputs essential for agricultural development water is one. Its use for irrigation is conditioned by several variables, while low rainfall and its variable nature necessitates the development of artificial means of moisture supply, the increasing employment of fertilisers and, to some extent, high yielding variety of seeds make timely supply of water as a prerequisite. On the other hand, availability of water resource, nature of terrain, and personal, social and economic characteristics of farmers affect the supply side. The present paper is an attempt to analyse the spatio-temporal variation in irrigated area in Madhya Pradesh in perspective of these variables. It can be hypothesised that the variation in proportion of irrigated area may be related with the variation in the need of irrigation, availability of water resources for irrigation and the capacity of the farmer to use it. The requirement of irrigation depends with other things, on account of rainfall and its variability, nature of crops and the extent of use of modern yield-raising technology. In normal conditions, extent of irrigation should increase with decreasing amount of rainfall and increasing its variability, while it should have direct correlation with the use of modern inputs.The primary source of water is precipitation, a good deal of which runs-off and is called,'surface water and a small amount soaks into the ground and is known as' ground water'. Thus local availability of water resource is the expression of the rainfall regime. But its feasibility depends on the structure, terrain and soil characteristics. The ground water storage varies with structure and nature of rocks. Further, the nature of terrain goes\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["22"]}

{"title": "Workload aware algorithms for heterogeneous platforms\n", "abstract": " Algorithms that aim to simultaneously run on a heterogeneous collection of devices on a commodity platform have been in recent research focus. On such platforms, individual devices can have very differing architectures, clock rates, and execution models. Hence, one of the fundamental challenges in designing and implementing such algorithms is to identify load balancing mechanisms that aim to apportion the right amount of work for each device.The state-of-the-art in load balancing of heterogeneous algorithms has several drawbacks. Static solutions that partition the work irrespective of the input instance cannot lead to wellbalanced load. On the other hand, analytical methods to identify the right work partition are available for only a few workloads or special cases of a few workloads. In this paper, we propose a light-weight, low overhead, and completely dynamic framework that addresses the load balancing\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["22"]}
