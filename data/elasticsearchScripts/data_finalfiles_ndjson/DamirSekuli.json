In this review we discuss research studies that have led to our current understanding of how the body functions during table tennis training and competition and how this is altered by training. Match and practice analysis of the table tennis game indicates that during intense practice and competition it is predominantly the anaerobic alactic system that is called into play, while the endurance system is relied on to recovery the anaerobic stores used during such effort. It is thus important for coaches to keep in mind that, while the anaerobic alactic system is the most energetic system used during periods of exertion in a table tennis game, a strong capacity for endurance is what helps a player recover quicker for the following match and the next day of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "106\n", "authors": ["1055"]}

The aim of this study was to evaluate relationship between anthropometric and motor indices with basketball-specific CODS and RA in male basketball players of high performance level. METHODS: We tested 88 high-level male basketball players (height: 194.62\u00b18.09 cm; body mass: 89.13\u00b110.81 kg; age: 21.12\u00b13.47 years). The sample was randomly divided into validation (N.= 44) and cross-validation (N.= 44) subsamples. The study variables included: broad-jump, countermovement-jump, reactive-strength-index, visual-reaction-time, body height, body mass, and body fat percentage (predictors); as well as basketball-specific CODS and RA (criteria). Univariate associations were assessed by Pearson's correlation coefficients. Multivariate relationships between the predictors and the criteria were assessed with multiple regression analysis for the validation subsample, which was then cross-validated.

Twenty-one women (age 39.3\u00b18.8 years, weight 62.8\u00b18.5 kg, height 169.5\u00b15.8 cm) who fulfilled the 1994 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for CFS were randomized in a double-blind, cross-over design, from 1 September 2014 through 31 May 2015, to receive either GAA (2.4 grams per day) or placebo (cellulose) by oral administration for three months, with a two-month wash-out period. No effects of intervention were found for the primary efficacy outcome (MFI score for general fatigue), and musculoskeletal pain at rest and during activity. After three months of intervention, participants receiving GAA significantly increased muscular creatine levels compared with the placebo group (36.3% vs. 2.4%; p< 0.01). Furthermore, changes from baseline in muscular strength and aerobic power were significantly greater in the GAA group compared with placebo (p< 0.05). Results from this study indicated that supplemental GAA can positively affect creatine metabolism and work capacity in women with CFS, yet GAA had no effect on main clinical outcomes, such as general fatigue and musculoskeletal soreness.

Material and Methods: The sample of variables included: body mass, body height, and 3 somatotype characteristics (mesomorph, ectomorph and endomorph) and data on injuries over the preceding year. Results: Dancers were mostly ectomorphic-mesomorph (endomorphy: 2.6\u00b10.54, mesomorphy: 3.99\u00b10.77, ectomorphy: 3.23\u00b10.54). The most commonly injured locations were the foot (17% of all injuries) and ankle (17%). Majority of the injuries occurred while practising but 37% of hip-injuries occurred while performing. Ankle-injuries resulted in longest absence from ballet. Endomorphy was related to ankle-injury (odds ratio (OR)= 1.9, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.4\u20132.3), ectomorphy to foot injury (OR= 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1\u20132.9), and body-mass to injury to the toes (OR= 1.7, 95% CI: 1.4\u20133.1). Conclusions: The results of this study allow for recognizing those dancers who are particularly vulnerable to injuries of certain body location.

The FT (n= 12; M age= 9.72\u00b10.41) and ST (n= 11; M age= 9.57\u00b10.41) soccer players were assessed using the Test of Gross Motor Development-2, standing long jump, sit and reach, diverse sprints, and the 20 m multistage fitness test (MSFT). The coach\u2019s subjective evaluation of players was obtained using a questionnaire. No significant differences existed between the FT and ST in any variables (p> 0.05). However, large and moderate effect sizes were present in favour of the FT group in locomotor skills (d= 0.82 (0.08, 1.51)), gross motor quotient (d= 0.73 (0.00, 1.41)), height (d= 0.61 (\u2212 0.12, 1.29)), MSFT (d= 0.58 (\u2212 0.14, 1.25)), and maximum oxygen uptake (VO 2max)(d= 0.55 (\u2212 0.17, 1.22)). Furthermore, the coach perceived the FT group as having greater technical and tactical qualities relative to ST players. This suggests that it might be more relevant for players of this age to develop good FMS connected to technical skills, before focusing on SCC. Therefore, it might be beneficial for soccer coaches to emphasize the development of FMSs due to their potential to identify talented young soccer players and because they underpin the technical soccer skills that are required for future soccer success.

Height and weight were used to calculate body mass index (BMI). Body fat percentage (BF%) and fat-free mass (FFM) were determined with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Each athlete performed the Pacer test, vertical jump, and t-test drill. Participants were predominantly normal weight (20.4\u00b12.7 kg\u00b7 m\u2212 2). The body composition results were 20.3\u00b14.9% for BF% and 46.5\u00b18.7 kg for FFM.

Body mass index was not associated with any performance measure (r= 0.02 to\u2212 0.21, all p> 0.05). Body fat percentage was associated with the Pacer, vertical jump, and t-test (r=\u2212 0.62,\u2212 0.57, 0.61, respectively; all p< 0.01) and remained after accounting for BMI. Fat-free mass was only significantly related to t-test (r=\u2212 0.43, p< 0.01). However, after controlling for BMI, FFM was related to all three performance tests. Body fat percentage and FFM are associated with performance in youth soccer players, with stronger relationships reported in the former metric.

A total of 25 synchronized swimmers (16-17 years; 166.2\u00b15.4 cm; and 58.4\u00b14.3 kg) volunteered for this study. The independent variables were body mass, body height, Body Mass Index (BMI), body fat percentage (BF%), lean body mass percentage, respiratory variables, and four SSTs (two specific power tests plus one aerobic-and one anaerobic-endurance test). The dependent variable was competitive achievement in the solo figure competition. The reliability analyses, Pearson's correlation coefficient and forward stepwise regression were calculated. The SSTs were reliable for testing fitness status among pubescent synchronized swimmers. The forward stepwise regression retained two SSTs, BF% and forced vital capacity (FVC, relative for age and stature) in a set of predictors of competitive achievement. Significant Beta coefficients are found for aerobic-endurance, SST and FVC. The sport-specific measure of aerobic endurance and FVC appropriately predicted competitive achievement with regard to the figures used in the competition when competitive results (the dependent variable) were obtained.

The match-running performance was measured by a global positioning system over a competitive half-season for a total of 82 match performances in professional players from Croatia (age: 23.76\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.64; body height: 181.62\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.09 cm; body mass: 77.01\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.34 kg) and clustered as central player (n\u00a0=\u00a057) and side player (n\u00a0=\u00a025) performance. No significant differences in aerobic performance were noted between central and side players. The anaerobic threshold was correlated with high-speed running (19.8\u201325.1\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1055"]}
{"title": "Evidencing the influence of pre-pandemic sports participation and substance misuse on physical activity during the COVID\u201119 lockdown: a prospective analysis among older adolescents\n", "abstract": " Objectives: The physical activity level (PAL) has significantly decreased as a result of the social distancing and lockdown related to the COVID\u201119 pandemic, but there is a lack of knowledge on the correlates of PAL during the pandemic. The aim of this research was to examine the influence of pre\u2011pandemic sports participation and substance use and misuse (SUM) on PAL during the COVID\u201119 pandemic. Material and Methods: The study included 661 high\u2011school students from Bosnia and Herzegovina (aged 15\u201318 years, 292 females). The investigation included 2 testing waves: before the COVID\u201119 pandemic (baseline, January 2020) and during the COVID\u201119 lockdown (follow\u2011up, April 2020). The variables included PAL as measured by the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents, sports factors, and SUM. Results: Sports factors at baseline were positively correlated with PALs at both baseline and follow\u2011up. Smoking tobacco negatively affected PALs at both baseline and follow\u2011up. Alcohol consumption was positively correlated with PAL at baseline but had no effect on PAL at follow\u2011up. Conclusions: This study confirmed the importance of sports participation in maintaining PAL during challenging situations, such as the COVID\u201119 lockdown. The substance\u2011specific influence of SUM on PAL before and during the lockdown points to evident social and cultural aspects of SUM behaviors in adolescents. Further studies evidencing the cumulative effects of PAL decline during the lockdown are warranted.

Six international competitions over the last five years were analysed retrospectively: Olympic Games, World Championships, and European Championships. The data corresponded to a total of 437 swimmers\u0315 competition histories (257 men, 180 women). A two-way analysis of variance (sex [2 levels: men, women], classification [3 levels: 1st to 3rd, 4th to 8th, 9th and below]) was performed for each split (0-2.5 km, 2.6-5.0 km, 5.1-7.5 km, and 7.6 to 10 km) and half (0-5 km, 5.1-10 km). The Bonferroni post-hoc test was used to compare means, and Pearson\u1fbf s simple correlation coefficient to determine correlations between the split times and the final performance (total time). In general, the medal winners and the seconde tier classified swimmers, both men and women, employed a negative pacing strategy (the first half of the race was swum slower than the second). Women, however, in proportional terms swam a faster first partial (0 to 2.5 km) than men. These results could help coaches convince their swimmers that the first split of the event should be swum as slowly as possible, while still ensuring that they are in the leading group.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1055"]}

Twenty-three female students, aged 18-20 years, experienced aerobic dancers, participated in both the HI-LO and STEP aerobics sessions. The heart rate (average HR per session) and lactic acid concentration values were measured during both classes. The obtained average values of the heart rate and blood lactate offered no evidence of differences between the HI-LO and STEP aerobics programmes in the observed parameters. Nevertheless, the results revealed a relative disproportion in the values of these two parameters, characterized by the relatively higher heart rate values than expected in relation to the blood lactate concentration values. This can be explained, as has been done in some previous research studies, by the exerted influence of the disturbed body hemodynamic balance (caused by the extensive overhead arm motions) and by emotional excitement. The results of the present research suggest the conclusion that both the HI-LO and STEP aerobics programmes were energetically equally demanding. Therefore, it could be recommended that participants should choose individually the programme they wish to be engaged in just according to their preferences, Further investigations are needed to determine any possible (anthropological) predictive values of load intensity of the respective aerobic programmes.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1055"]}

Subjects were divided into two age groups (seniors [> 18 years; n= 26] vs juniors [< 18 years of age; n= 18]). Players were tested for anthropometrics (body mass, body height and body fat percentage), jumping capacity (countermovement jump and standing broad jump), kicking speed (for dominant and non-dominant leg), sprinting capacity (5-and 10-meter sprints), 20-yard test, futsal-specific reactive agility, and futsal-specific change-of-direction speed tests. Results: No significant differences between age groups were apparent for anthropometrics.

Variables included anthropometrics (body height and mass, BMI, body fat percentage), generic tests of physiological capacities(5- and 10-meter sprints, CMJ, broadjump, 20-yard test, reactive strength index [RSI]), and futsal-specific fitness tests (kicking speed by dominant and nondominant leg, futsal-specific tests of change of direction speed, and reactive agility [FSRAG] involving/not involving dribbling the ball). Top-level players outperformed high-level players in RSI, broadjump, kicking speed, and FSRAG involving dribbling. Starters achieved better results than nonstarters in fewer variables, including kicking speed and RSI. Body fat percentage negatively influenced FSRAG involving dribbling, and RSI. FSRAG, RSI, and kicking speed were significantly correlated, indicating the similar physiological background of these capacities.

Additionally, the hexagonal barbell produces greater peak power compared to performance with traditional Olympic barbell. To optimally develop power and performance in explosive tasks in sport (such as jumps), training with the load that maximizes the power output is considered ideal. Therefore, the objective of this research is to investigate the relationship between jumps and power values during the deadlift exercise performed with a hexagonal barbell.Methods: 14 youth soccer players (16-18 years old) were tested on the Sargent jump test, broad jump test, one repetition maximum (1RM) using the PUSH 2.0 band that was used for displaying the power values at 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, and 95% of 1RM.

Participants were 126 dancers (21 males; 11\u201318 years), who were competitors in the urban dance, rock and roll, and standard/Latin dance genres. Predictors included sociodemographic factors, anthropometric/body build indices, sport (dance) factors, and dynamic balance. The outcome variable was injury status, and this was evaluated by the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Centre Overuse Injury Questionnaire (OSTRC). Predictors were evaluated at baseline, and outcomes were continuously monitored during the study period of 3 months. During the study course, 53% of dancers reported the occurrence of a musculoskeletal problem/injury, and dancers suffered from an average of 0.72 injuries over the study period (95% CI: 0.28\u20131.41), giving a yearly injury rate of 280%. Gender and dance styles were not significantly related to the occurrence of injury. Higher risk for injury was evidenced in older and more experienced dancers.
