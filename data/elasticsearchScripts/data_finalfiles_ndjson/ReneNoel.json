Empathy is a skill related to understanding the feelings of other people, which is an important element of social relationships. Currently in Chile there are no software applications that support the development of empathy in autistic children by taking advantage of the characteristics of multi-touch devices. For this reason, this study presents the development of such software. Due to the specific characteristics and needs of the target user, the User Centered Design methodology was used to guide the design process. This article presents the stages of the design process and describes the developed application. We also discuss the lessons learned during the process.", "num_citations": "51\n", "authors": ["1302"]}

One of the software engineering\u2019s approaches, highly used in new industries, is agile development. User stories are a commonly used notation to capture user requirements in agile development. Nevertheless, for the elaboration of user stories, a high level of collaboration with the client is necessary. This professional skill is rarely measured or evaluated in educational contexts. The present work approaches collaboration in software engineering students through multimodal learning analytics, modeling, and evaluating students\u2019 collaboration while they are writing user stories.

{"title": "Introducing low-cost sensors into the classroom settings: Improving the assessment in agile practices with multimodal learning analytics\n", "abstract": " Currently, the improvement of core skills appears as one of the most significant educational challenges of this century. However, assessing the development of such skills is still a challenge in real classroom environments. In this context, Multimodal Learning Analysis techniques appear as an attractive alternative to complement the development and evaluation of core skills. This article presents an exploratory study that analyzes the collaboration and communication of students in a Software Engineering course, who perform a learning activity simulating Scrum with Lego\u00ae bricks. Data from the Scrum process was captured, and multidirectional microphones were used in the retrospective ceremonies. Social network analysis techniques were applied, and a correlational analysis was carried out with all the registered information. The results obtained allowed the detection of important relationships and characteristics of the collaborative and Non-Collaborative groups, with productivity, effort, and predominant personality styles in the groups. From all the above, we can conclude that the Multimodal Learning Analysis techniques offer considerable feasibilities to support the process of skills development in students.

In this article, we introduce NAIRA, a Multimodal Learning Analytics platform that provides Real-Time Feedback to foster collaborative learning activities\u2019 efficiency. NAIRA provides real-time visualizations for students\u2019 verbal interactions when working in groups, allowing teachers to perform precise interventions to ensure learning activities\u2019 correct execution. We present a case study with 24 undergraduate subjects performing a remote collaborative learning activity based on the Jigsaw learning technique within the COVID-19 pandemic context. The main goals of the study are (1) to qualitatively describe how the teacher used NAIRA\u2019s visualizations to perform interventions and (2) to identify quantitative differences in the number and time between students\u2019 spoken interactions among two different stages of the activity, one of them supported by NAIRA\u2019s visualizations. The case study showed that NAIRA allowed the teacher to monitor and facilitate the learning activity\u2019s supervised stage execution, even in a remote learning context, with students working in separate virtual classrooms with their video cameras off. The quantitative comparison of spoken interactions suggests the existence of differences in the distribution between the monitored and unmonitored stages of the activity, with a more homogeneous speaking time distribution in the NAIRA supported stage.

Therefore, it is important to proper train and evaluate students in this kind of abilities so that they can better interact in their professional relationships, during the resolution of problems, negotiations and conflict management.

Four steps are proposed for the given framework: Data collection, Statistical Analysis, Clustering, and Sequential Pattern Mining. Data Collection step is responsible for the collection of students interactions during presentations and the arrangement of data for further analysis. Statistical Analysis provides a general understanding of the data collected by showing the differences and similarities of the presentations along the semester. The Clustering stage segments students into groups according to well-defined attributes helping to observe different corporal patterns of the students.
