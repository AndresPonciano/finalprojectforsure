{"title": "Model-based testing for software product lines\n", "abstract": " A Software Product Line (SPL), or family of systems, is a collection of applications that have so many features in common that it is worthwhile to study and analyze the common features as well as analyzing the features that differentiate these applications. Model-based design and development for SPLs extends modeling concepts for single applications to model the commonality and variability among the members of the SPL.", "num_citations": "32\n", "authors": ["2213"]}
{"title": "A perturbation-based testing strategy\n", "abstract": " Perturbation analysis involves changing the data state at a location in an executing program and determining the effect of that change on the program's remaining computation. This technique has been used to estimate propagation rates during fault sensitivity analysis, and also to compare test sets and testing strategies. This paper describes an error flow model that allows emphasis to be placed on propagation analysis, which is implemented using data state perturbation. A perturbation-adequate testing strategy is defined that is similar in concept to mutation testing, and some results are presented that support the coupling effect and the consistency of perturbation-adequate testing. Some observations are made that relate mutation to perturbation.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["2213"]}
