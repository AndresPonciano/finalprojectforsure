{"title": "On scoping stakeholders and artifacts in software process\n", "abstract": " Stakeholder and artifact are considered as two important elements in software engineering processes, but they are rarely systematically investigated in software process modeling and simulation. Inspired by the Workshop of Modeling Systems and Software Engineering Processes in 2008 at the University of Southern California and our previous studies on integrating stakeholders\u2019 perspectives into software process modeling, we undertook a study on the application of these entities in software engineering, through both a systematic review and a complementary web survey within software process research and practice communities. Our results reveal that the portion of studies on process stakeholders and process artifacts in software engineering is unexpectedly small, and there lacks consistent understanding of process stakeholder roles.

{"title": "Developing a SSE-CMM-based security risk assessment process for patient-centered healthcare systems\n", "abstract": " Information security and privacy are the major concerns in healthcare domain. However, there lacks a comprehensive framework for evaluating the security engineering practices for healthcare systems. Current transition from institution-centered to patient-centered healthcare introduces additional security and privacy problems. With the intensive human (especially the patient) interaction involved in the patient-centered health care systems, information security and privacy can be assured not only by technologies and infrastructure but also by process. This paper develops a mapping from SSE-CMM process areas to the patient-centered healthcare domain aiming at establishing a set of metrics to assess security risks for patient-centered healthcare systems. Based on the mapping, a security risk assessment process is then proposed to evaluate the PHR system (a typical patient-centered healthcare system).", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["395"]}
{"title": "Empirical Research in Software Process Modeling: A Systematic Literature Review\n", "abstract": " Recognized as one of the powerful technologies in software process engineering, Software Process Modeling (SPM) has received significant attention over the last three decades. Although empirical research plays a critical role in software engineering, the state-of-the-practice of empirical research in SPM has not been systematically reviewed. This paper serves as a status report of the assessment of empirical research in SPM by analyzing all refereed studies that were published in relevant venues from 1987 to 2008 using systematic review methodology. The primary findings indicate that in current SPM-related empirical studies, (1) software process management and improvement (SPI) was not yet the most popular primary research objectives, (2) exploratory empirical research methods, e.g., case study and action research, were dominantly used, (3) there were common issues in empirical research reports in\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["395"]}
{"title": "Hybrid modeling and simulation for trustworthy software process management: a stakeholder\u2010oriented approach\n", "abstract": " Process Management Model (PMM) and Process Simulation Model (PSM) are the critical infrastructural components of the Trustworthy Process Management Framework (TPMF), which involves a large and heterogeneous group of stakeholders in process modeling and simulation to improve process trustworthiness. Process Modeling Stakeholders (PMS) have different levels of dependency on various process modeling and simulation techniques. They may also possess different perspectives or concerns in modeling. To support trustworthy process management, this paper integrates the stakeholder\u2010oriented approach and hybrid simulation technique into software process modeling at three levels of abstraction (i.e., activity, sub\u2010process and system). The hybrid process simulation combines micro\u2010level discrete process models with the macro\u2010level continuous process models to capture process dynamics.

{"title": "GoPoMoSA: a goal-oriented process modeling and simulation advisor\n", "abstract": " This paper presents GoPoMoSA, a Goal-oriented Process Modeling and Simulation Advisor that semi-automatically discovers suitable Software Process Modeling and Simulation (SPMS) techniques for (inexperienced) process modelers to achieve their process modeling goals. GoPoMoSA takes the goal-oriented modeling approach that captures the associations among Process Modeling Stakeholder goals and existing SPMS techniques via Relevant Process Elements modeled in the knowledge graphs. We evaluated the accuracy and feasibility of GoPoMoSA with data collected from 212 published SPMS literatures and a real-world process modeling and simulation case on requirements traceability. Our results show that GoPoMoSA (1) was able to find suitable SPMS techniques based on stakeholder goals with an average of 85.38% accuracy;(2) helped novice process modelers effectively and efficiently\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["395"]}
{"title": "Incremental process modeling through stakeholder-based hybrid process simulation\n", "abstract": " Both the process modeling and process simulation are necessary components of process automation. A Process Modeling Language (PML) is a set of description tools that define processes attributes and constrains in a specific domain. Process modeling stakeholders may have different levels of dependencies on different types of PMLs. They also have various perspectives for modeling a process. Discrete and continuous PMLs are complimentary in modeling the process at different levels of abstraction and to address different stakeholders\u2019 perspectives. The hybrid process simulation combines micro-level discrete process models with the macro-level continuous process models to capture process dynamics and deploy process optimization. This paper proposes an incremental approach based on the hybrid simulation in modeling a software process at different levels of abstraction in order to address\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["395"]}
