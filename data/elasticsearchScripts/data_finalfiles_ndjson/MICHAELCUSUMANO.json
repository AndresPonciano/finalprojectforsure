InThinking Beyond Lean, Cusumano and Nobeoka show that single-project management can produce isolated hit products and\" fat\" designs that contain few common components and many unnecessary parts and features. As a result, in this era of slowing growth and falling profits, leading companies are maximizing their investment by utilizing a groundbreaking concept the authors call\" multi-project management.\" Drawing on a data base of 210 automobile products and detailed case studies from Toyota, Ford, GM, Chrysler, Nissan, Honda, Mazda, Renault, and Fiat, the authors demonstrate how product development teams can share engineers and key common components but retain separate designers to maintain distinctive product features.

In the $600 billion software industry it is the business, not the technology, that determines success or failure. This fact--one that thousands of once glamorous start-ups have unhappily discovered for themselves--is the well-documented conclusion of this enormously readable and revealing new book by Michael Cusumano, based on nearly twenty years of research and consulting with software producers around the world. Cusumano builds on dozens of personal experiences and case studies to show how issues of strategy and organization are irrevocably linked with those of managing the technology and demonstrates that a thorough understanding of these issues is vital to success. At the heart of the book Cusumano poses seven questions that underpin a three-pronged management framework. He argues that companies must adopt one of three basic business models: become a products company at one end of the strategic spectrum, a services company at the other end, or a hybrid solutions company in between. The author describes the characteristics of the different models, evaluates their strengths and weaknesses, and shows how each is more or less appropriate for different stages in the evolution of a business as well as in good versus bad economic times.

If we look deeply enough, he contends, we can see the ideas that underpin the management practices that make for great companies, and drive their strategic evolution and innovation capabilities. From his deep knowledge of these organizations, Cusumano distils six enduring principles that he believes have been-in various combinations-crucial to their strategy, innovation management practices, and ability to deal with change and uncertainty. The first two principles-platforms (not just products), and services, for product firms-are relatively new and broader ways of thinking about strategy and business models, based on Cusumano's latest research.

The relationships between software development firms and service companies shaped the product software landscape into software ecosystems, where suppliers and buyers of software products, components and technologies collaboratively create competitive value.

INTRODUCTION Much has been written about flexibility in recent years as this has become of critical concern to managers, academic researchers, and policy makers concerned with the evolution of production and design technology as well as firm and industry competitiveness. Yet there is little agreement on how to define flexibility, how to achieve flexibility, or what the costs and benefits of more or less flexibility actually are, if any. For example, some researchers have viewed flexibility primarily in terms of programmable machines and capabilities for mixing models in production (Jaikumar 1986, Fine and Pappu 1988). Others have viewed this in terms of the versatility of people and skills (Piore and Sabel 1984). Some researchers have discussed flexibility as a strategic variable that has to be consistent with the overall competitive strategy of a firm, but do not provide a conceptual framework for defining flexibility types and lin king these with strategic options. Overall, the literatureon the topic is fragmented and does not provide answers to basic questions that managers need to address: Under which conditions would a firm be likely to need a given typeof flexibility? How can firms implement different kinds of flexibility? What is the impact of different kinds of flexibility on productivity, quality and competitive position? This article attempts to answer these and other questions by providing a framework to analyze flexibility in terms of the strategic objectives of a firm as well as its impact on business performance. The central argument is that flexibility comes in various forms, each of which can be implemented in different ways and with different costs, but\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "125\n", "authors": ["47"]}

Second, companies have extended factory-like tools and techniques backward toward design operations, gradually bringing more discipline, automation, and thus efficiency into the realm of engineering work, including the relatively new field of computer programming. The result, in both manufacturing and design, has been a shift from simple scale economies, as in conventional mass production, to scope economies - efficiencies gained in the design and production of\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "99\n", "authors": ["47"]}

Microsoft builds operating systems such as MS-DOS, Windows, and Windows NT; applications such as Microsoft Excel and Word (now usually packaged together in Microsoft Office); and new multimedia products and on-line systems such as the Microsoft Network. Inherent in our analysis of this company is a comparison to older software producers that have built operating systems and applications for mainframes, minicomputers, and workstations. Many of these older organizations have followed what has been called a sequential\" waterfall\" type of development process, which has both advantages (it can be relatively structured) and disadvantages (it is not very flexible to accommodate specification and design changes during a project). The objective for doing this comparison was to examine the effects on Microsoft of developing large-scale software products for the rapidly evolving PC software market. This challenge might have prompted Microsoft to become less unstructured or\" hacker-like\" and more like older software producers; on the other hand, it might also have prompted Microsoft to seek yet another development process that is structured but departs from waterfall-like practices in order to introduce more flexibility.

Over the past three decades, the field of strategy has made enormous progress in delivering rigorous, analytical frameworks, usually rooted in academic disciplines such as microeconomics, game theory, and sociology. While we provide students with numerous tools, we rarely talk about how great strategists think, learn, and put ideas together with actions. There is a deep hole in our understanding about what makes a truly great strategist. Academics frequently study companies and their leaders, but they rarely study in depth the individuals themselves, along with the decisions that define their careers and the organizations they build. When we began this project, we made several important assumptions. One was that managers and entrepreneurs could learn a great deal from Bill Gates, Andy Grove, and Steve Jobs, despite their uniqueness and larger-than-life personalities. There was never any question in our minds that these three individuals were not your typical CEOs or entrepreneurs in terms of personal abilities or achievements. They were titans of industry, to say the least. At the same time, we concluded that their approaches could help managers and entrepreneurs think more systematically about strategy, as well as execution, because they tackled key problems in similar ways. A second assumption was that, even though all three of our subjects were from the world of high technology, their experience can give us great insight into the role and importance of strategy and execution for many types of businesses.

{"title": "An analysis of the cloud computing platform\n", "abstract": " A slew of articles have been written about the fact that computing will eventually go in the direction of electricity. Just as most software users these days also own the hardware that runs the software, electricity users in the days of yore used to generate their own power. However, over time with standardization in voltage and frequency of generated power and better distribution mechanisms the generation of electricity was consolidated amongst fewer utility providers. The same is being forecast for computing infrastructure. Its is being touted that more and more users will rent computing infrastructure from a utility or \"cloud\" provider instead of maintaining their own hardware. This phenomenon or technology is being referred to Cloud Computing or Utility Computing. Cloud computing has been in existence in some form or the other since the beginning of computing. However, the advent of vastly improved software, hardware and communication technologies has given special meaning to the term cloud computing and opened up a world of possibilities. It is possible today to start an ecommerce or related company without investing in datacenters. This has turned out to be very beneficial to startups and smaller companies that want to test the efficacy of their idea before making any investment in expensive hardware. Corporations like Amazon, SalesForce.com, Google, IBM, Sun Microsystems, and many more are offering or planning to offer these infrastructure services in one form or another.", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["47"]}

While scholars have begun researching innovation in service companies, the field of service innovation remains undeveloped and relatively immature. This paper begins with a summary of the various differences that distinguish services and products-building a key framework for analyzing services proposed by Bitran and Lojo (1993). Case studies of three service companies then present detailed information regarding seven specific innovation decisions.

{"title": "Knowledge transfer across generations: the impact on product development performance in the automobile industry\n", "abstract": " Large manufacturing companies often have a range of product lines, and successively introduce new products over time. To adapt to changing customer needs, they may replace existing products at regular intervals and add new product lines. In most cases, these new products are not\" completely\" new for a company, both in terms of technologies and market concepts. A technology developed for one product may subsequently be used in a range of products. Knowledge about existing customers can also serve as a useful basis for interpreting current customer needs and translating them into technical parameters and physical products. Especially, due to intensive competitive pressures, a fast product development cycle has also become a critical source of competitiveness in industries such as automobile manufacturing. Under such circumstances, retaining and quickly utilizing knowledge across generations of projects, and learning from past development activities, may become particularly important both for avoiding redundant problem solving and for finding new solutions to problems in new product development. Few studies to date, however, have systematically dealt with this issue of knowledge retention and utilization. This dissertation addresses the issue of the transfer and retention of knowledge as an essential element in product improvement. Drawing on examples from the Japanese automobile industry, this study investigates how companies retain product\u0393\u00c7\u00f6related knowledge across multiple generations of products, and how differences in the ability to accumulate such knowledge, which we call retention capabilities, affect performance\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "23\n", "authors": ["47"]}
{"title": "An analysis of service oriented architectures\n", "abstract": " Introduction: Corporations all across the globe and of various sizes rely on their IT systems for business processes, reduction of process lifecycle and management of resources. These systems house several applications for internal sales, purchasing, finance, HR and so on. In any such typical organization, IT systems are a heterogeneous mix of hardware, operating systems and applications. Many of these applications run on different operating systems like Windows systems, Linux and Unix systems, etc. Oftentimes there is a need to consolidate data or access data from several such systems. The diversity among systems and applications makes these tasks difficult, time consuming and tedious. Furthermore, there is also a need for synchronization of data across systems and applications to ensure that the data is accurate and up-to-date. The heterogeneous nature of systems and applications lead to high levels of redundancy of data, making data maintenance a huge overhead for organizations. Today's organizations must also adapt to changes in environments both external and internal to them. Such changes could be changing market conditions, reorganization, change in business strategies within a company, addition or changing suppliers, partnerships, mergers and acquisitions and so on. There is also a growing need for integration across enterprise boundaries to facilitate fast and seamless collaboration between partners, customers and suppliers. All such needs entail changes to existing IT systems within an organization in a timely manner. There is thus a growing need for integration of such systems for consolidated decision making\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["47"]}
{"title": "Competing on Internet time: lessons from Netscape and its battle with Microsoft\n", "abstract": " Competing on Internet time means competitive advantage can be won and lost overnight. In this penetrating analysis of strategy-making and product innovation in the dynamic markets of commercial cyberspace, bestselling Microsoft Secrets co-author Michael Cusumano and top competitive strategy expert David Yoffie draw vital lessons from Netscape, the first pure Internet company, and how it has employed the techniques of\" judo strategy\" in its pitched battle with Microsoft, the world's largest software producer. From on-site observation and more than 50 in-depth interviews at Netscape and other companies, Cusumano and Yoffie construct a blueprint meticulously detailing how the fastest-growing software company in history has competed on Internet time by moving rapidly to new products and markets, staying flexible, and exploiting leverage that uses the weight of its giant rival Microsoft against it. The main source of Netscape's leverage, they argue, has been its skill in designing products that run on multiple operating systems. Microsoft has responded with judo techniques in kind. Managers in every high-tech industry will discover a wealth of new ideas on how to create and scale-up a new company quickly; how to compete in fast-paced, unpredictable industries; and how to design products for rapidly evolving markets. The lessons that Cusumano and Yoffie derive from Netscape's contest with Microsoft go far beyond start-ups and Internet software. Small companies in any industry and powerful, established firms alike will welcome the principles the authors formulate from this David-and-Goliath-like struggle.

{"title": "Multi-project strategy and market-share growth: the benefits of rapid design transfer in new product development\n", "abstract": " In automobiles and other industries most large manufacturers have several product lines and constantly develop new products to replace existing products or to add completely new product lines. Managing the way different projects relate to each other technologically is extremely important in helping a firm leverage its engineering and financial resources, as well as existing technologies and designs, across multiple projects. Nonetheless, there has been little research that explores multi-project management. The purpose of this paper is to explore product-development strategies used in the management of multiple automotive projects. An underlying hypothesis is that differences in multi-project strategy should influence the effectiveness of an entire firm in new product development. This paper proposes a typology of multi-project strategies, which categorizes new product development projects into four types: new design, rapid design transfer, sequential design transfer, and design modification. Based on this typology, this paper examines the potential influence of different types of multi-project strategies on market competitiveness. Using data on 210 new products introduced by 17 worldwide auto manufacturers between 1980 and 1991, this paper argues that high performers (measured by market share growth) more often utilized a\" rapid design transfer\" strategy. Under the rapid design transfer strategy, new technologies and designs developed as part of one project are quickly transferred to other projects within the firm.", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["47"]}
{"title": "Social TV: the future of television in the Internet Age\n", "abstract": " Television's influence on culture and society has been widely acknowledged for many years. On the other hand, with the diffusion of the web and of social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, used in concert with television, the TV experience has become much more interactive and it is now impossible not to acknowledge that television has also become a driving force for social interaction. Furthermore, the parallel diffusion of internet videos and user generated content, fostered by YouTube in particular, has provided the population with a different approach to media and television in particular: consumers have also become producers. This work analyzes how the different technological improvements have changed the definition of television. Special attention is given to how Facebook and Twitter have influenced some of TV's fundamental properties such as liveness, character-centric storylines and flow and to what the YouTube phenomena means for television. The thesis concludes with a forecast about television's future, which confirms the main argument of this thesis: television is increasingly social.", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["47"]}

{"title": "What we have learned and have yet to learn from manufacturer-supplier relations in the auto industry\n", "abstract": " Interorganizational relations is among the most important areas in the study of modem industrial society. In the division of labor, which defines the modern industrial society, where to set the boundary between what work takes place inside versus outside a company, and what kind of relations to build between organizations are key elements. Concern with these key elements has increased in significance since the 1980s when a newly conceptualized mode of economic organization began to attract growing attention. This new mode is typified by cooperative, interdependent and long-term relations among independent organizations and contrasts with other modes: markets and hierarchies. It has been discussed in different domains of academic research with various names, including\" hybrid mode\"(Williamson, 1991) and\" quasi integration\"(Aoki, 1990) in economics,\" quasi-firm\"(Eccles, 1981) and\" network form of organization\"(Powell, 1990) in organizational theories,\" dynamic networks\"(Miles and Snow, 1984) and\" strategic networks\"(Jarillo, 1988) in strategic management,\" flexible specialization\"(Piore and Sabel, 1984) in industrial development, and\" network-based industrial system\"(Saxenian, 1994) in regional studies, to name a few. Despite the breadth of domains of research, these studies have in common that they addressed advantages or possibilities of the new mode.Evidence supporting these arguments have been found in matured to high technology industries in the US, Europe, and Japan.

{"title": "Multi-project management: inter-project interdependency and organizational coordination in new product development\n", "abstract": " In many industries where product development is an expensive and time-consuming process, such when designing an automobile, the effective management of concurrent multiple projects that share components has become a critical issue. Firms need to coordinate engineers in different projects in order to leverage their design work and technical knowledge across more than one product. However, existing studies on product development have mostly focused on the management of one single project at a time, presumably operating in isolation. In contrast, this study explores the influence of inter-project interdependencies on organizational coordination requirements.-A questionnaire survey of 256 component engineers in the US and Japanese automobile firms provides evidence that the organizational coordination required to manage component design--with and without inter-project interdependencies--differs significantly. For example, in projects with no dependencies on other projects, only cross-functional coordination has a significant influence on schedule and cost performance. But in projects with dependencies on other projects, both intra-functional coordination and cross-functional coordination have a strong impact on performance in component design. We conclude that, in order to manage inter-project interdependencies effectively, firms need a new type of organization aimed at achieving both cross-functional coordination and intra-functional coordination simultaneously through the active coordination of multiple projects. This means that neither traditional project-oriented nor function-oriented organizations is appropriate for\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["47"]}

{"title": "Alternative designs for product component integration\n", "abstract": " Managers and researchers have increasingly recognized product development as a core capability in organizations. While research in product development enjoys a long and illustrious history (Brown and Eisenhardt April 1995), recent trends are challenging firms' abilities to perform this central activity. Technologies are simultaneously becoming more complex and advancing at an ever increasing rate, while projects are becoming more distributed across geographic and functional boundaries. And all of this is taking place in the context of more rapid and fierce global competition.Improved coordination appears as a common thread in the literature on how firms should respond to such challenges (Lawrence and Lorsch 1967; Allen 1977; lansiti and Clark 1994). Thus, for example, we see numerous studies on integration processes across functions (Dougherty May 1992), projects (Cusumano and Nobeoka 1992; Meyer and Lehnerd 1997) and time (Gersick 1988). Other researchers stress the influence of team and/or product size and structure on coordination costs. The focus on the role of modularization in system construction is a recent example (Von Hippel 1990). Optimal strategies for system testing and integration (Koushik and Mookerjee 1995) and development environments and tools are also topics of current study (Boehm January 1984). Particularly popular in this line of research are concepts related to concurrent or simultaneous engineering. These concepts emphasize a multifunctional team structure with close working relationships among representatives of product design, marketing, manufacturing, etc., fostered by, for example\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["47"]}

{"title": "A theory of services in product industries\n", "abstract": " Even though services have become increasingly important for firms in many product industries, there lacks theory to explain under what conditions services should be important to product firms. We propose that services embody the product and market-related knowledge that transfer between the producer and customer in activities associated with selling, financing, using, maintaining, and repairing products. Building on the knowledge management and innovation literatures, we propose that the level and type of services provided within a product industry are associated with uncertainty, complexity, and competitive dynamics. Finally, we explore the implications for research in resource capabilities, industry verticalization, and technological change.In many product-oriented industries, services have become increasingly important. In the case of automobiles, General Motors, Ford, and many other automakers generate the vast majority of their profits from a service activity closely tied to their product offerings\u0393\u00c7\u00f4loans and leasing. In the case of software products, companies often begin by emphasizing packaged product sales but, as the industry has matured, many now derive more revenues from maintenance (product patches, product updates, and routine technical support) and other types of services (such as consulting, product customization, and training) rather than from new product sales. Other technology product firms, such as IBM, Cisco, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems, Dell, and EMC, have also seen large increases in maintenance and other services as a percentage of their total revenues as their product lines mature.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["47"]}
{"title": "How open should an open system be?: essays on mobile computing\n", "abstract": " \"Systems\" goods-such as computers, telecom networks, and automobiles-are made up of multiple components. This dissertation comprises three essays that study the decisions of system innovators in mobile computing to \"open\" development of their systems to outside suppliers and the implications of doing so. The first essay considers this issue from the perspective of which components are retained under the control of the original innovator to act as a \"platform\" in the system. Based on detailed review of leading systems in this industry in data spanning 1984-2004, I find that platform boundaries expand and contract over time as a means for platform suppliers to promote the adoption of the platform (by end-customers, downstream manufacturers, and suppliers of complements) and simultaneously to ensure the continuing innovation of the system. The second essay provides a systematic empirical investigation of how the extent of openness chosen by the platform supplier affected the rate of innovation of mobile computing devices. I measure openness in relation to both the boundaries of the platform and the extent to which actions were taken by platform suppliers to promote entry by hardware device manufacturers.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["47"]}

This study specifically focuses on describing the objectives and outcomes of changes in product development organization implemented at Toyota in 1992 and 1993. This reorganization is the most fundamental change in product development organization that Toyota has implemented since it established the Shusa (product manager) organization around 1965. The new organization is aimed at multi-project management. It has three vehicle development centers in which multiple projects are grouped together, in contrast to either traditional single-project-oriented or function-oriented organizations.Toyota has often been considered as a leader in adopting new organizational structures and managerial processes in both manufacturing and product development. For example, the Toyota production system, symbolized by its JIT and Kanban systems, has been targeted as one of the best practices in manufacturing by many firms, not only in automobiles but also in other industries. With respect to product development organization, Toyota led in establishing a project-based management system, which aimed at coordinating activities in different functional areas into a well-integrated new product. Clark and Fujimoto (1991) have described this as an organization featuring\" heavyweight\" product managers, who facilitate quick completion of a project by integrating different functions such as design engineering, manufacturing engineering, and marketing.

In developed economies like the United States, the penetration rate has reached over 85%. Even though the subscriber numbers are reaching saturation levels, the revenues of mobile operators continue to grow at a double-digit rate. This is primarily because of an increase in data usage over cellular networks. Mobile handsets have become increasingly powerful and rival the capabilities of personal computers from just a few years ago. These devices can be used to run a variety of applications and are fast becoming the medium of choice for accessing the Internet. Cellular networks are also becoming increasingly powerful in their ability to carry large amounts of data. This evolution in capabilities has attracted a variety of new players to the wireless ecosystem changing the nature of interaction within the ecosystem. The central role played by the wireless operators is increasingly challenged by these new entrants creating both new opportunities and new threats for all the participants in the ecosystem. This thesis will explore the structure of the wireless ecosystem as it exists today and analyze how competition between various layers and within each layer has played out. Further, it will look at the new ways in which the participants are competing with each other and how this results in emergent opportunities and threats.

{"title": "Considering the customer: Determinants and impact of using technology on industry evolution\n", "abstract": " This dissertation raises two questions: How do customers come to understand and use a technology? What is the influence of customers using a technology on industry evolution and competition? I use two historical cases to answer these questions. The first considers how insurance firms came to initially understand and use the computer in the 1940s and 50s (in collaboration with JoAnne Yates). We argue that the understanding of a new product category is related to which comparisons are actually made and why. Insurance firms made multiple comparisons that collectively helped distinguish the computer from any given pre-existing category. The second case analyzes the history of how U.S. manufacturers used manufacturing planning software from its inception in 1954 through its first significant technological change in the 1990s. Manufacturers significantly changed how they used the software primarily through learning by using the software. Market intermediaries, such as consultants, played an important role in diffusing these uses and in developing a collective understanding of the technology - what I call a dominant use. Using additional entry/exit data from the software industry, I argue that how customers use a technology helps explain the industry's population dynamics. I argue that the emergence of a new dominant use, even without a corresponding technological change, can lead to significant new market entry. In addition, established firms are less likely to fail when customers use a new technology in similar ways to how they used the old technology.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["47"]}

{"title": "The China advantage: a competitive analysis of Chinese high-tech industries\n", "abstract": " The emergence of China as a rising economic power has surprised many pundits and commentators around the world. It first gained its status as one of the largest manufacturing centers in the world, creating companies from toy makers to networking gear manufacturers, which successfully used their low cost advantage to compete against firms based in developed countries. As western countries including the U.S. started to attribute China's success to the abundance of low cost labor, a few Chinese firms rose up to challenge the dominance of multinational corporations. In the high-tech industries, in particular, some firms have started to combine their low wage advantage with sophisticated end-to-end strategies by ramping up competencies in important areas in the value chain, including research and development, manufacturing and supply chain management, marketing, and strategy. This thesis examines the competitive advantage and disadvantage of Chinese high-tech industries by studying a number of firms in the information technology sectors.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["47"]}

The basic objective is to compare the approach of\" classic\" producers that have been associated with best-practice software engineering and even a\" factory-like\" approach to software development, with some newer companies in the industry from the personal computer (PC) field. The companies chosen to represent the classic producers are the world's two largest mainframe producers, IBM (International Business Machines) and Fujitsu, who are also major producers of minicomputers, as well as Hewlett-Packard (HP), a major producer of minicomputers and engineering work stations. The two firms chosen to represent PC software producers are the two leading firms in this segment, Microsoft and Lotus. In a general sense, the PC software producers, as their systems grow larger and more complex, are moving closer to the approaches used by the classic producers.

The defining characteristics of web-based enterprise software are: a fully web-based user interface, hosted application deployment, a SaaS-based business model, and the use of a service-oriented architecture for integration. This study analyzes a sample of 108 companies currently offering SaaS-based products. In total, 35 different application types and 20 different combinations of revenue models were counted. Apparently, the market is still in an experimental phase, and truly dominant designs haven't emerged yet. Gross margins for SaaS-oriented companies are lower than for traditional software product companies, but still attractive at around 85%. The entrepreneurial activity in the sector is significant. More than 50% of the companies in the sample were founded in or after 2002, and almost 30% in the last two years.

The efficient management of the heterogeneous and complex aggregation of these systems is becoming one of the major challenges to IT customers. At the same time, hardware is becoming commoditized, and the industry is looking towards software for additional revenue generation. This document examines proprietary as well as open-standards attempts at solving the interoperability problem. The first attempt was made by EMC when it developed WideSky, a middleware software layer that would be able to manage third party hardware. It is shown that the aim was to eventually transform this middleware into a de facto standard and with that establish platform leadership in the industry. The WideSky effort failed, and the analysis of this failure attributes it to a lack of industry support and inability at establishing a sustainable value chain. Meanwhile, the industry players rallied around the SNIA body and adopted the SMI specification (SMI-S) as a standard. SMI-S adoption is on the rise, but although it has the formal backing of most of the storage industry firms, it has not yet fulfilled its promise of enabling centralized management of heterogeneous systems. This is partially because of the fact that the functionality that it provides is still lagging behind the functionality that native APIs provide. Moreover, client adoption and the availability of client products that can be directly used by IT customers are still very limited.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["47"]}

The first-generation firms appeared in the mid- and late 1980s, competing in computer-related areas such as Chinese-language processing software and hardware products, personal computers, and financial software products. The second-generation startups, namely Internet-related companies, emerged in the mid-1990s. The thesis presents case studies, which form the primary evidence for analysis, on major domestic players Legend, Founder, Great Wall, Sohu, Sina, and Netease. A framework was built based on a theoretical distinction between external resources and organizational capabilities. Case studies show that external resources are important, but richer resources do not always guarantee a startup's success if they fail to help build organizational capabilities. External resources might even become a hurdle in sustaining a competitive edge. The case studies indicate that organizational capabilities that were built during a startup's development, rather than just richer or \"better\" external resources alone, make significant contributions to success. Another observation is that in many cases resource constraints trigger startups to search for needed capabilities.

The research sought information on the number of suppliers used for particular components, supplier selection criteria, supplier involvement in product development, pricing practices and changes over time, as well as reported levels of defects and changes in defect rates over time. The data support observations that Japanese and US practices tend to differ in key areas and Japanese suppliers perform better in dimensions such as quality (defects) and prices (meeting targets, reducing prices over time); and that Japanese-managed auto plants established in the United States have, in general, adopted Japanese practices and receive extremely high levels of quality from Japanese as well as US suppliers. These findings provide evidence that Japanese practices and performance levels are transferable outside Japan and suggest that considerable improvements are possible for US suppliers supplying US auto plants. In addition, the survey indicates that US firms have adopted at least some practices traditionally associated with Japanese firms, apparently reflecting some convergence toward Japanese practices and higher performance levels in supplier management.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["47"]}

In general, companies havepursued factory approaches as a means of moving beyond customization of single products for single customers, to the point where they can capture economies of various sorts, especially those related to scale of output and operations. These have enabledfirms to offer customers products with standardized features but at low prices. By usual criteria, much of software development seems inappropriate for conventional factory practices, and reported resistance to factory practices by programmers can be explained in terms of this incongruence. The next two sections discuss flexible design and manufacturing techniques as well as different product-process and organizational options that seek a better combination of efficiency and flexibility, with the flexible factory emphasizing semi-customization and economies of scope as much or more than scale. The software factory is also introduced as a type of flexible design and production organization contrasting with traditional job-shop or craft approaches to software development.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["47"]}

{"title": "Web 2.0 Wiki technology: enabling technologies, community behaviors, and successful business techniques and models\n", "abstract": " Many technologies fall under the umbrella of what is commonly known as \"Web 2.0,\" including the Wiki, a software product which allows multiple users to review and edit documents online. Like all Web 2.0 technologies, Wikis are characterized by collaboration; without an active community, they can rapidly become stale and of little use. Businesses based on collaborative web sites must effectively manage a large circle of what are essentially non-employees with perhaps no or little interest in the company other than the benefit they derive from the information offered through the site. The company must provide this benefit to them and give them a desire to keep the site running in order to do its best to ensure itself with a sustainable revenue model. This thesis seeks to discover how a business can create visibility, maintain an eager-to-contribute user base, and generate revenue from users' effort. It will examine the evolution of technology which has created the collaborative Web 2.0 tools, specifically the Wiki. It will then move into looking at the social networks that must be created to sustain the Wiki. Lastly, it will examine the business models and techniques that can enable a savvy company to earn a profit from the use of these technologies.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["47"]}

Introduction Since the management of new product development lias become a central issue in global competition, numerous academic researcliers in recent years have undertaken studies of how effective and efficient projects have been in various industries. Most of the empirical research has focused on the innovation process and on managerial or organizational approaches as well as performance measures for individualprojects (Imai et al., 1985; Henderson, 1990; Clark and Fujimoto, 1991; Cusumano, 1991). At the same time, there arevarious reportsthat leading Japanese manufacturers tend to develop new products much more frequently than US or European competitors and that this has been one of the major reasons, along with manufacturing skills, for their strong growthperformance in global markets (Abegglen and Stalk, 1985; Dertouzos et al., 1988; Womack et al., 1990). At the same time, even Japanese manufacturers became more concerned with efficiency. In recent years they have faced severe profitability problems related at least in part to the highcosts of developing and manufacturing so many new products and product variations in markets, such as automobiles and consumer electronics, where demand has slowed or even declined, while the cost of money in Japan has increased due to rising interest rates and drops in the stock market and real estate values (Business week, 1992). An essential missing area in research on product development that relate directly to the issue of how to produce multiple products and variations more efficiently is the management of multiple new-product development efforts over time at the\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["47"]}

These diverse literatures have all treated a basic managerial dilemma resulting from two opposing demands: the desire of consumers for variety in product offerings; and the desire of managers responsible for engineering and production for standardization and control over processes, tools, and components as a way to reduce complexity and costs in product development and manufacturing, as well as in testing and customer service. Laboratory or\" job-shop\" organizations have traditionally been used to construct new, highly complex, or\" one-of-a-kind\" products, but at high expense, due to the absence of economies of scale and scope. It has also been asserted that some product technologies\" mature\" stabilize oyer time, creating opportunities for firms to move toward more efficient means of engineering and production.

If, during the later stages of product development (ex: coding), the company came across new information or the user needs changed then these changes would be incorporated into the next version of the product otherwise risk shipping the product late. Rapid innovation in the technological areas and the Internet has created very dynamic environment in all walks of life. In this environment, the user needs are changing very rapidly resulting in new challenges for the companies and its product development managers. They have to respond to the changing needs of the users very quickly either with rapid product releases and/or incorporating the changes into product under development. To achieve this, companies need a product development strategy that allows them to incorporate changes at any stage in the product development without affecting their time-to-market.

{"title": "Analysis of Japanese software business\n", "abstract": " Today, our society is surrounded by information system, computers, and software. It is no exaggeration to say that our daily life depends on software and its function. Accordingly, the business of software has made miraculous growth in the last two decades and is playing a significant role in various industries. In accordance with the growing business needs for effective software and information systems, various firms in various countries have entered the business of software seeking for prosperity. Some have succeeded, some have failed. What distinguishes these firms is its ability to manage and deliver quality products on demand, on time, at a low cost. To achieve such goal, software firms have thought out different methods and tools striving to establish its practice. Nevertheless, many software firms around the globe are struggling to satisfy its clients to achieve business success. With no exception, Japanese software firms are facing difficulties of managing software projects. While its ability to deliver high quality product is well acknowledged among software industry, its high cost structure and schedule delays are thought of as serious problems. Moreover, some of the transitions in the industry are forcing Japanese software firms to seek new opportunities. Therefore, it is important for Japanese software firms to establish more productive ways of developing software products and effective business strategies. Primal objective of this paper is to analyze the present conditions of Japanese software firms and to derive some recommendations which could enhance its current situation.

In 2008, total logistics costs accounted for 18.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) in China, which was almost twice that of the United States. Increasing logistics efficiency can save an enormous amount of money, hence is worthy of study. Since the U.S. is similar to China in many areas and its logistics efficiency is high, I study the U.S. and compare with China, then draw lessons from the comparison. Five aspects of logistics in both countries are analyzed: 1) logistics history, 2) transportation infrastructure, 3) logistics structure, 4) logistics IS/IT, and 5) logistics governance. Lessons from the comparison conclude: 1) railways should receive a higher priority for infrastructure investment, 2) logistics market is too fragmented, consolidation among logistics operators should be encouraged, and 3PL market needs government support to grow, 3) I/IT application in logistics is still in its infancy stage. Standardization of IS/IT in logistics and public information platform should be supported, and 4) logistics governance plays an important role in eliminating local government protectionism and easing imbalance between inland and coastal regions in China.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["47"]}

{"title": "Service Oriented Architecture as a strategy for business improvement in the enterprise\n", "abstract": " The service concepts found in Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) have been used in software design for many years, with ever-improving tools and a growing understanding of where and how SOA should be applied. Applications built utilizing SOA concepts promote principles such as modularity, distribution, encapsulation and clear interfaces, all core concepts of object-oriented and component-based software development. Despite the clear design advantages of the service concept, most SOA implementations have failed to address many of the issues facing corporations today, including the need for corporate agility, the gap between IT and business, IT project failures and shortcomings in the measurement of business performance.This paper explores the complementary nature of SOA and the core principles of business process management. When combined, these methodologies can help an organization shift to thinking about business processes, map processes to business goals and expose processes as services within the SOA framework. This strategy, when coupled with the abstraction of business flows and rules away from individual applications and infrastructure, has the capability to make the organization more agile, closely aligns IT and the business and enables business performance to be measured and improved. The potential externalization of these business processes can help the organization focus on the needs of customers and partners and promotes the benefits of a virtual organization.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["47"]}
{"title": "A platform based approach for embedded systems software development\n", "abstract": " A platform based approach for product development allows companies to eliminate redundancies, efficiently utilize its resources and provide products for a wider market. The basic idea is to develop and share key components and to introduce new technologies in as many products as possible. The automobile industry has for long used the concept of product platforms and has successfully achieved savings in development costs and seen a growth in sales and market share. By creating a common software platform, this concept can be applied to software development for embedded systems where software modules and applications can be shared across products within a product family. This provides better code reuse and increases standardizations across products. This thesis will examine how the concept of platforms can be applied to software development from the viewpoint of the telecommunications industry. By using the power of a common software platform, telecommunication equipment makers can accelerate product delivery and introduce new technologies to a wider range of customers. With the right strategy, they can also make their products into platforms that serve as a foundation on which other companies can develop products and offer their services.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["47"]}

The main objective of this thesis work is to observe the trends among various revenue prospects such as product sales, maintenance sales, service sales and service maintenance sales revenue. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses are pursued to achieve the research objectives. The software industry has gone through several transformations from its debut. Initially, it started as service-oriented industry and then transitioned into a product-oriented industry and is currently transforming into a hybrid of both product and service industries. Just as the industry has undergone from a service to a product to a service (more like a hybrid) oriented industry, so too has the product licensing and maintenance licensing scenario been changing. Perpetual licensing has established its strong presence from the very beginning. While both single user and concurrent user licensing models were standard license offerings, concurrent licensing has been eliminated from the enterprise application segment. A usage-based licensing model is gaining popularity but perpetual licensing continues to be the preferred one. Software firms sell a lot of products early on and fail to keep up the same rate of new sales to new customers. From the regression model, it was observed that the product sales as a percent of total sales decreased by 2.6% each year.

In the birthplace of venture capital (VC), venture investment has been the fuel of high technology entrepreneurship development, which transformed US economy from a manufacturing- to a knowledge-based economy. By examining the formation and operation of China's venture capital (VC) industry, this study attempts to discover the role of different types of venture capital in China's technology entrepreneurship development. Four categories of venture capital operations, government funds, government leveraged funds, State Owned Enterprise (SOE) funds, and foreign funds, are identified by their sources of funding. Four venture capital operations, NewMargin, Business Incubator of Zhongguancun Haidian Science Park, Legend Capital, and IDG Technology Venture are examined as the base of analysis. The cases are chosen because they are the leading firms in their respective categories. Case studies show that the government is not only the regulator but also an active participant in China's venture capital industry. The active involvement of the government has both positive and negative impacts on the industry, venture capital funds, and entrepreneurial firms. The government's early involvement provided seeds for China's venture capital industry, but its regulations on financial market that are skewed towards the reform of state owned enterprises suffocate the growth of the venture capital industry.

These products now consist of hundreds of thousands and even millions of lines of source code, and require hundreds of people to build and test over periods of one or more years. As the world's largest producer of PC software, with approximately 18,000 employees, 200 products, and annual revenues of $6 billion (fiscal year ending June 1995), Microsoft has probably tackled more PC software projects than any other PC software company.

{"title": "Service platform strategy: social networking and mobile service platform perspectives\n", "abstract": " The significance of the service platform is increasing, while studies on this phenomenon remain scarce and insufficient. Most of the researches focus on products, market segmentation and how platform triggers innovation and there's a lack of researches that focus on services, the fast growing industry nowadays. In analyzing the service platform, it is important to understand the interactions between different players, such as application developers, content providers, network operators, and users. For that purpose, a value network analysis which analyzes the interactions for creating value between the key players is more suitable than the common value chain analysis which is one-directional and sequential. This thesis adopts the value network approach in an attempt to analyze the two different types of service platform, that is, social networking platform and mobile service platform. The Social Networking Service (SNS) is evolving beyond the bounds of a simple personal network and is gradually transforming into a social networking platform where SNS information is used to develop various new services. This thesis examines the positioning and interaction of the key players for the social networking platform and the values that the key players can gain and capture. The mobile service platform is becoming more important, as 3G mobile technologies are mature and widespread and the smartphone market is growing rapidly. For the mobile service platform, the market players are engaged in a severe competition to control the market through various strategies. The biggest current issue in the mobile market is the movement to open platform strategy\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["47"]}

{"title": "The Changing Software Business: From Products to Services and Other New Business Models Paper 236\n", "abstract": " Over the past several years, the software business has been undergoing dramatic changes, with important implications both for users as well as producers of software products and services. Perhaps the most significant change is the decline of traditional product sales or license fees and the shift in product company revenues to services. 1 Services include annual maintenance payments (usually about 20 percent of the retail product price), which entitle the user to patches, minor upgrades, and often some basic technical support. This shift has been especially pronounced among vendors of enterprise software. We can clearly see this in the case of Siebel, whose product sales fell dramatically before it was acquired by Oracle. Even Oracle experienced the \u0393\u00c7\u00a3crisscross\u0393\u00c7\u00a5(service and maintenance revenues crossing over to exceed product revenues) as long ago as 1997.

{"title": "Globalization at NTT DoCoMo: implementing global business management strategies\n", "abstract": " Global business management has become one of the most important issues facing companies today, and global economic dynamics provide companies with both tremendous opportunities and formidable challenges. Countries are increasingly tied to each other through deregulation and liberalization for economic exchanges. Global competition is a necessity rather than a matter of direction for many companies. Global business management is more complex than doing business in a single country because of differences in source and nature between the home country and a target country. There are more managerial items that require modification with the passage of time. To be a successful multinational corporation, companies must recognize the whole picture of global business management and pursue best practices continuously. NTT DoCoMo, the largest Japanese mobile network operator, has achieved great success in the domestic market by leveraging its technological superiority since it was established in 1992. As the signs of market saturation began to emerge in Japan, NTT DoCoMo advanced its plans for globalization aggressively. For NTT DoCoMo, which does not own real products and production facilities, this represents a new challenge a Japanese company, namely, that NTT DoCoMo needs to enhance its global management system more than other Japanese manufacturing MNCs. This thesis introduces the key elements and appropriate procedures for decision making in global business from top management's point of view.

{"title": "Benefits and pitfalls of international strategic technology alliances\n", "abstract": " This paper explores some of the differences between international technologybased alliances and other collaborations. We begin with a review of recent articles and books and examine how they define inter-firm interaction. From there, a detailed review of the alliance and cooperative R&D literature reveals the motivations and pitfalls of collaboration. We use those to draw conclusions about differences between technologybased and non-technology-based alliances. The differences are summarized in a model of the R&D process involving several stages-from the collaboration decision to the conduct of R&D through to the marketing of a new product. We find that traditional prescriptions for the success of strategic technology alliances center around changing either the level of inter-firm learning and spillovers or the level of competition between partners. We discuss how having international partners also affects these two key areas. We propose that the main features of international collaboration are the relative unfamiliarity of partners' home markets and\" barriers\" to communication, such as different languages and cultures brought together in the venture.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["47"]}

Factory-like approaches have tended to emphasize standardization of development methods and tools, systematic reuse of program components or designs, some divisions of labor and functional departments, and disciplined project management as well as product quality control. Many firms, led by IBM in the United States, have introduced these and other concepts for large-scale programming operations, but in varying degrees. This discussion focuses on the specific origins of the term\" factory\" as used in software and the histories of several-companies that have explicitly used this term to describe their approaches to managing software development: System Development Corporation (DC) in the United States, and then Hitachi, Toshiba, NEC, and Fujitsu in Japan.'", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["47"]}
{"title": "A quantitative analysis of US and Japanese software-engineering practice and performance\n", "abstract": " Since the early 1980s, there has been a mounting debate in industry literature and in US government-sponsored reports over the relative performance of software developers in Japan versus those in the United States. This literature is divided between assertions of Japanese or US superiority in this technology. However, both sides of the debate have offered evidence that, to date, has been primarily qualitative or based on one or two cases. This paper contributes to the debate in two ways. First, it offers a comprehensive literature review that analyzes existing comparisons of Japanese and US firms in software development and summarizes the major proposed differences in performance. Second, it presents the first set of quantitative data collected from a statistically comparable sample of 24 US and 16 Japanese software-development projects, and uses these data to test propositions from the literature. The analyses indicate that Japanese programmers perform at least as well as their US counterparts in basic measures of productivity, quality (defects), and reuse of software code. The data also make it possible to offer models that explain some of the differences in productivity and quality.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["47"]}

Nevertheless, prompted by false accusations of rigged elections and other fake news, the leading digital platforms in social media recently began tagging some posts as unreliable or untrue and removing some videos. Following the January 6th insurrection attempt, Twitter and Facebook also banned Trump from using their platforms because promotion of violence and criminal acts violates their terms of service.

{"title": "Municipal wireless mesh networks as a competitive broadband delivery platform\n", "abstract": " Recently there has been a growing interest in deploying Wireless Mesh Networks by municipalities. This interest stems from the desire to provide broadband connectivity to users lacking access to broadband alternatives. The ubiquity of these networks will create more opportunities for new wireless-based applications and services that will generate revenue to the local businesses. The current plan is primarily focusing on the use of the WiFi, which was originally designed for indoor LAN applications operating in unlicensed spectrum. Also, the Municipalities claim that their main targets are Public Safety and the low-income neighborhood that cannot afford DSL or Cable broadband. There is a doubt, however, that the current plan will deliver on its promises in terms of coverage as well as cost. In this research, the goal is to first study the current business model for the current Municipal Wireless Mesh networks under deployment. As such, we will attempt to examine the networks under development in Brookline, Boston, Cambridge, and other cities in the US. We will also examine the technical limitations of these networks. This will lead us to suggest modifications to both the business model and a new system design. The goal for these modifications is to enhance the chance of these networks to succeed in the market place.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["47"]}

As a result, the demand for automotive electronics is increasing. Meanwhile, due to strict requirements for demanding specifications, as well as low volume commitment offered by car manufacturers as compared with consumer electronics products, many electronics manufacturers have so far avoided entering this business. However, as the requirement for high technology grow, the technology of the electronics companies becomes indispensable for the car manufacturers. Currently, there are some electronics companies who provide automotive parts, mostly on the components level and not on the solution level, but only few of them are truly successful. The automotive electronics business requires various types of components as well as demanding specifications for safety and operating conditions.

{"title": "Multimedia platform framework for the automobile: architectural analysis and proposal evaluation\n", "abstract": " The automobile industry is at a critical point in the development of in-vehicle entertainment and information features. The consumer electronics industry is changing dramatically in the areas of entertainment through audio and video playback, personal efficiency tools, and wireless communications. Equally as significant is the rapid development and feature migration that is occurring between four of the major mobile device categories; mobile phones, smart phones, PDA's, and media players. With this convergence occurring, automakers are finding it more difficult to satisfy the needs of consumers with respect to these new capabilities.In order for the automakers to establish a solution, a new framework needs to be established. The automakers are unable to satisfy this market desire through traditional technology delivery strategies, especially given the fast changing and complex interface that currently exists in this market space.This thesis establishes the framework used to identify and critically evaluate an external platform strategy for the purpose of satisfying the above need. The thesis draws upon leading literature to provide key attributes of successful external platform implementations. The first aspect of the framework established involves ensuring the need for an external platform through complexity and development clockspeed incompatibilities. The second section of the framework involves the evaluation of the architectural attributes that lead to external platform success. Finally, the stakeholders are identified and roles are established.The next phase of the analysis involves the evaluation of two prominent solution proposals using the\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["47"]}

We analyze the information technology services industry and propose a framework to determine the drivers of performance of information technology services firms. The framework is applied to a database of 831 information technology services firms from 1990 to 2004. Chapter II provides an insight into the dynamics of the information technology industry. Chapter III then focuses on the specificities, characteristics and structure of the information technology services firms. In Chapter IV, the business model of services firms is contrasted with that of products firms. Inter-relations between the two business models are proposed.

{"title": "Designing supportability into software\n", "abstract": " Background: Despite the identification of a \"software crisis\" in the 1960s, large software projects are full of defects even today [19]. These defects cause the software to behave unexpectedly. The cause generally is attributed to the inherent property of software to possess arbitrary complexity [20]. Additionally, computer software is becoming all pervading. There is literally an explosion of software automating things that were considered impossible to automate only a few years ago. Essentially, software is growing to encompass anything and everything with such speed that we don't have the time to reflect on 'what happens when the software does something that it was not intended to do?' In other words, the software encounters an anomaly or a defect something customers encounter everyday. In any case, whenever customers encounter problems caused by defects they need help to solve these problems. They generally seek such help at a software vendor's product support services. With software getting more and more complex it is getting extremely difficult to support customers in a timely and cost effective manner. There is a constant struggle to ensure high Quality of Service (QoS) with low Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), which in turn affects Return on Investment; in such a scenario considering nearly 80% of the costs associated with software occur after it is shipped to the customer. Currently, there are two solutions to such problems caused by defects: First, if the source of the problem itself is found to be a defect in the software then the software vendor generally fixes the problem by modifying their code.

While reuse may seem to be primarily a technological problem, this article illustrates how reusability also needs to be seen as a managerial and organizational problem. This is because the recycling of specifications, detailed designs, and actual code, as well as development tools, engineering methods, and test cases, can either be systematic--occurring as frequently as possible due to management planning as well as provision of s pport technologies and incentives--or accidental--occurring infrequently and in an ad hoc manner due to the lack of formal planning, support, or personnel incentives.

{"title": "The factory approach to software development: a strategic overview\n", "abstract": " Writing software--instructions (and data) required to operate programmable computers, first introduced commercially during the 1950s--has plagued engineers, managers, and customers since the beginning of the industry. The development process consists of requirements analysis, system design, detailed program design, coding, testing, and installation, as well as redesign or repairs referred to as maintenance. Yet these phases are usually more iterative than sequential, and often unpredictable in time and costs. The productivity of individual programmers tends to vary enormously and depend on elements difficult for management to control, such as personal talent and experience with particular applications.Software producers thus encounter budget and schedule overruns as the rule rather than the exception, especially when attempting to build large complex systems with many components for the first time. The sheer difficulty of software design and programming, exacerbated by a demand for programs rising faster than the supply of software engineers, led to a situation referred to as the\" software crisis\" as long ago as 1969.1 Despite years of advances in tools (specialized programs and databases that aid in the production of other software), design and programming techniques, and products themselves, software has remained a most vexing challenge to all concerned, with many problems that plagued pioneers still persisting through the 1980s.

Open source software has a number of architectural advantages over traditionally developed closed-source software including modularity, a frequent release pattern and a strong culture of reuse. As there has been a shift away from developing software that runs locally to a model where service based computing and web services are some of the most important software used on a daily basis by people, there has been a shift away from developing such software as open source. This thesis looks at a comparison between open source and web services and shows how they compare on some of the aspects which are the most important architectural advantages of open source. This examination is based on a look at literature and specific web services. Through this examination, it shows that many of the benefits of open source can be found as a result of other architectural characteristics of web services.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["47"]}
{"title": "A study of the foundry industry dynamics\n", "abstract": " In the process of industrial evolution, it is a general tendency that companies which specialize in a specific value chain have emerged. These companies should construct a business eco-system based on their own platform to compete successfully with vertically integrated companies and other specialized companies. They continue to sustain their competitive advantage only when they share their ability to create value with other eco-system partners. The thesis analyzes the dynamics of the foundry industry. Through the top-down approach (how the semiconductor industry trends have influenced the foundry industry), the foundry market size is expected to grow continuously as the semiconductor industry becomes more horizontal due to exponential increase in IC manufacturing/design cost and focusing strategy on design or manufacturing capabilities. In addition, the bottom-up approach (how companies in the foundry industry compete with each other) indicated that previous key success factors such as time to market, economies of scale and learning curve effect are not necessary conditions any more in this industry. Rather, the success of a foundry company is mainly driven by successful management of eco-system partners based on leading process platform. However, sustainability of platform leadership in the foundry industry can always be threaten by continuous innovation in a technology driven industry, hold-up problem with eco-system partners and change of regulations. These factors are expected to make the foundry industry extremely dynamic despite first mover advantages.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["47"]}

As hardware becomes less and less expensive and open source software is being offered for free, the traditional business model of selling packaged software is being threatened. This disruption in the software industry is forcing software vendors to consider other business models such as advertising-based, transaction-based, software-as-a-service or appliance-based models in order to create additional value for customers. Most of these models have existed in variants for decades but are now gaining in popularity due to factors such as changing cost structures or the Internet as a delivery channel. This thesis analyzes the economic drivers and barriers for the appliance model for both the consumer and enterprise software industry segments. Important drivers of the appliance model for both of these sectors are hardware commoditization, open source software and vertical integration in order to capture margins. In the enterprise software segment the complexity of traditional software integration and operation including unpredictability of total cost of ownership, rising IT personnel cost and maintenance fees are driving the adoption of the appliance model.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["47"]}

{"title": "Designing security into software\n", "abstract": " When people talk about software security, they usually refer to security applications such as antivirus software, firewalls and intrusion detection systems. There is little emphasis on the security in the software itself. Therefore the thesis sets out to investigate if we can develop secure software in the first place. It first starts with a survey of the software security field, including the definition of software security, its current state and the research having been carried out in this aspect. Then the development processes of two products known for their security: Microsoft IIS 6.0 and Apache HTTP Web Server are examined. Although their approaches to tackle security are seemingly quite different, the analysis and comparisons identify they share a common framework to address the software security problem - designing security early into the software development lifecycle. In the end the thesis gives recommendations as to how to design security into software development process based upon the principles from the research and the actual practices from the two cases. Finally it describes other remaining open issues in this field.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["47"]}
{"title": "Securing against fraud in mobile communications: system design and development in 3G mobile networks\n", "abstract": " Network security ensures the consistency, integrity, and reliability of telecommunications systems. Authorized network access prevents fraudulent communications and maintains the availability of the systems. However, limited development time, cost reduction pressure and requirement for high reliability in software development have forced mobile carriers to implement the insufficient and inflexible authentication mechanisms. Technical specifications including network architecture, network protocols, and security algorithm are widely available to the public. In addition, both secured and unsecured networks are interconnected by global roaming services. The inadequate system design will make the mobile systems vulnerable to unauthorized access to mobile communications. Compared with GSM mobile systems, 3G mobile systems are equipped with more robust and flexible security mechanisms. The official position taken by mobile carriers, such as NTT DoCoMo, KDDI, and Vodafone, is that fraudulent communications, usually in the form of cloned mobile phones, are impossible with their 3G mobile systems. Examining the NTT DoCoMo's case, however, we find that this statement is based on weak security assumptions.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["47"]}
{"title": "The business strategy of Japanese Slers\n", "abstract": " The fundamental role of the System Integrators (Slers) is to provide customized IT systems or services that satisfy the unique requirements of each customer by integrating the various products and services that many IT companies produce. Originally, the IT companies in the different business segments such as the consulting business, hardware business, and software product business have complemented each other, and Slers played the roles of coordinators between these various IT companies and the customers. However, the business model of IT companies is rapidly changing. The firewalls separating business segments in the industry are becoming obsolete, and the Japanese Slers are now getting involved in the intense new competition. This thesis identifies key elements that influence the future business of Japanese Slers. It also proposes sound strategies that will enable Japanese Slers to grow solidly from the viewpoint of top management. From the technological viewpoint, my research finds that the commoditization and openness of technologies have made hardware and software product companies shift their business focuses from products to services. On the other hand, from the market viewpoint, customers are implementing the strategies that select and focus on core businesses.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["47"]}
{"title": "The paradigm shift in wireless platforms: from traffic business to transaction business\n", "abstract": " The mobile communication industry in Japan is facing a constructive revolution that will be the industry to next-generation services. Most communication companies have competed aggressively to develop and offer e-mail or Web applications to their users in order to increase operating revenue. One approach was the introduction of flat rate plans, used primarily to acquire new customers; however, the profits achieved by relying on communication fees are diminishing. Nevertheless, mobile phones continue to be the point of contact closest to the customer. In recent years, mobile phones have evolved from tools used primarily for talking to a tool that transmits and receives e-mail. But these are changes that alter the quality of communication rather than make a substantial change. To heighten its competitive position, in June 2004, NTT DoCoMo developed a new type of cellular phone that contains a built-in noncontact IC card called \"FeliCa,\" which represents the next remarkable stage of progress. This thesis first analyzes the structural transformation of the mobile phone business, and then discusses how it is influencing the financial and authentication businesses. First I present an overview of the mobile communication industry, showing its progress from a rapid growth to a mature market. Next, I show how wireless carriers are building a new wireless value chain by implementing the IC card function in mobile phone terminals. Then I describe the new wireless value chain and offer examples that illustrate the kinds of change that have been created in the industry structure. I conclude by describing a business strategy that utilizes the new platform\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["47"]}

In order to avoid potential pitfalls in outsourcing, companies must carefully select who to outsource to. Although general guidelines exist for those companies to consult, they are not customizable to the unique needs of each company and project. By assessing the type of a company's outsourceable project and its in-house capabilities regarding the project, the main outsourcing goal of the company is first determined.

{"title": "Changing dynamics of the Chinese automotive industry: the impact of foreign investment, technology transfer, and WTO membership\n", "abstract": " The Chinese automotive industry was established 50 years ago with the technology transfer of a truck production system from the Soviet Union. Since then, it developed into a decentralized and fragmented truck industry layout due to the self-reliant and defensive policies set forth by the central government. Over the past two decades, China has obtained substantial and modern passenger car production systems with a large sum of foreign direct investment (FDI) and comprehensive technology transfer from global carmakers in Europe, the U.S., and Japan. This research studies the 50- year development history of the Chinese automotive industry and seeks to understand the role of the Chinese protectionist automotive industry policies and the impact of FDI and technology transfer. China officially entered the World Trade Organization (WTO) in November 2001 and committed to end the 50 years of protectionism. The WTO membership is expected to inject fierce market competition into the Chinese automotive industry and ultimately propel the industry to a new level. My research attempts to forecast what might happen in the coming years. My research included site visits and personal interviews with seven senior executives from Chinese automotive firms located in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, as well as three academic experts on the Chinese automotive industry at the Tsinghua University. This research finds that China has benefited significantly from foreign investment and technology transfers. China was able to leapfrog from 1950s-level automotive production systems into 1990s-level advanced technologies, and the gap with world\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["47"]}

And we insist that banks should take account of technology trend as one of heavy IT users and switch long-term-strategy and IT-migration-strategy appropriately in order to make the best of IT. First of all, we show some back grounds of Japanese banking industry and IT revolution. Next, we show three case studies of a Japanese bank. We will find that, over the last ten years, Japanese banks have been struggling with deregulation, the IT revolution and the long resection of the Japanese economy. These external changes have made corporate strategies and traditional information systems are obsolete and inefficient. After then, we analyze IT investment allocation issues in the banking industry. As summary of our analysis, we show some key success factors and recommendation to a Japanese bank. Finally, Japanese banks should always consider Long-Term Strategy with a long-time viewpoint; during the period of IT migration, they should find a path in which they should follow based on IT Migration Strategy.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["47"]}

{"title": "The Pac-Man strategy: roll-up patterns and processes in three industries.\n", "abstract": " The history of some U.S. service industries includes a period of rapid consolidation through the acquisition of many firms by one or a few competitors. This is often referred to as a \"roll-up\", with the designation used both as a verb in referring to the process and as a noun in referring to the company doing the acquiring. Roll-ups have become a well-known phenomenon since at least 1971, when Waste Management Corporation commenced an aggressive roll-up of the North American solid waste industry. In this paper, we look at the roll-up phenomenon closely and identify some of the patterns that characterize the process. We examine the history of three U.S. service industries -- solid waste, funeral homes, and landscape maintenance -each of which has experienced (or is experiencing) rapid consolidation through the roll-up process. In our investigation, we identify common characteristics as well as key differences among the three, and investigate the background of the industry, the market forces that appeared to be driving the industry dynamics at the time the consolidation efforts began, the pattern and processes of consolidation, and the results of the consolidation effort. In doing so, we identify potential industry characteristics and elements of the roll-up process that may have been contributing factors in determining the outcomes. The analysis employs several concepts and frameworks from the corporate strategy literature. Chief among these is Porter's five forces model of industry structure (Porter 1980). Additional concepts used to compare and contrast the three industries and the consolidation of each include minimum efficient scale\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["47"]}

It has a market share of around 90 percent in operating systems (Windows and Windows NT), and this has provided the company with an enormous revenue stream for many years. But Microsoft has also learned how to develop applications programs, and builds more than 200 software products.

This exploratory study aims to explain that\" Simplicity\" contributes similarly to the impressive gains in market share of these companies.Two measures of product complexity,\" Variant Complexity \u0393\u00c7\u00a3and\" Underskin Complexity\", in both fundamental and peripheral aspects, allow to evaluate a car's manufacturability as a function of product policy. within a continuum ranging from the\" basic car with add-on features\" to the\" fully equipped car\" this thesis examines how producers cope with increasing product complexity and its impact on production performance and quality.

{"title": "Factory concepts and practices in software development: an historical overview\n", "abstract": " This paper reviews the introduction of factory concepts and practices, based on tools and methods from the evolving field of softwaro engineering, at major software producers, in particular those that explicitly adopted thefactory label to describe their software facilities or approach to software development: Hitachi, Toshiba, NEC, and Fujitsu in Japan, as well as System Development Corporation in the US The other US firm discussed in detail is IBM, which, without adopting the factory label, introduced numerous measures to organize and control software development, especially basic software. The paper emphasizes that the difficultyof the technology, shor-tsges of skilled engineers, and large-scale projects have encouraged producers to become more systematic or factory-like in managing a series of projects, evm though some characteristics of the technologyand the industry havp maHe software seem difficult to control and more suitable to a loosely structured project-centered or craft approach to development.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["47"]}
{"title": "Software technology--management issues in product and process development\n", "abstract": " INTRODUCTION Software consists of programs, or instructions, that guide computer hardware through a series of tasks. Because there are so many different tasks and machines that require programming to operate, software is not a single type of product or market, nor should there be a single\" best\" approach for product development, construction, and marketing. Process notions, as discussed in Chapter One, such as customization versus reusability and standardization, or product innovation and functionality versus development costs, thus need to consider the specific characteristics of applications and markets in which the software appears, and the different competitive strategies, corporate cultures, and organizational structures of the software producers. This chapter centers on the set of problems that have consistently recurred in large-scale software development efforts since the 1960s, and some of the major solutions generated in the field of software engineering. The recurrence of particular problems, mainly in design and project management, appear to relate to the still unsettled state of hardware and software technology, and user requirements. In addition, companies that have tried to\" rationalize\" the process of software development have also faced obstacles more of a management, organizational, or cultural nature, such as an inability to", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["47"]}

{"title": "The Software Factory: An Interpretation\n", "abstract": " For example, a 1983 survey found approximately 200 enterprises in the US alone that had more than 1000 software personnel in centralized locations, with many utilizing standardized designs and reusable code components, centralized tool development, formal testing and quality assurance departments, productivity measurement and improvement efforts, and research on the development process. Though there was no mention in this study of how systematic US firms were, centralization, standardization, reusability, and management control were\" factory-like\" concepts, even though no US firm used the term factory describe its facility. This raises the question of whether the Japanese or software factories in general were truly emphasizing different approaches, or merely labeling their facilities differently, and suggests a more fundamental question: What degree of integration or standardization among tools, methods, controls, and skills might distinguish a\" factory\" mode of operation from simply a large group of people working more or less independently in the same facility? This article attempts to provide some answers.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["47"]}
