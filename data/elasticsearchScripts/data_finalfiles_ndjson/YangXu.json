{"title": "Linguistic values based intelligent information processing: theory, methods, and applications\n", "abstract": " Humans employ mostly natural languages in describing and representing problems, c- puting and reasoning, arriving at ?nal conclusions described similarly as words in a natural language or as the form of mental perceptions. To make machines imitate humans\u2019 mental activities, the key point in terms of machine intelligence is to process uncertain information by means of natural languages with vague and imprecise concepts. Zadeh (1996a) proposed a concept of Computing with Words (CWW) to model and c- pute with linguistic descriptions that are propositions drawn from a natural language. CWW, followed the concept of linguistic variables (Zadeh, 1975a,b) and fuzzy sets (Zadeh, 1965), has been developed intensively and opened several new vast research ?elds as well as applied in various areas, particularly in the area of arti?cial intelligence. Zadeh (1997, 2005) emphasized that the core conceptions in CWW are linguistic variables and fuzzy logic (or approximate reasoning). In a linguistic variable, each linguistic value is explained by a fuzzy set (also called semantics of the linguistic value), its membership function is de?ned on the universe of discourse of the linguistic variable. By fuzzy sets, linguistic information or statements are quanti?ed by membership functions, and infor- tion propagation is performed by approximate reasoning. The use of linguistic variables implies processes of CWW such as their fusion, aggregation, and comparison. Different computational approaches in the literature addressed those processes (Wang, 2001; Zadeh and Kacprzyk, 1999a, b).

In this paper, information systems are called fuzzy information systems, and formalized by (objects; attributes; f), in which f is a fuzzy set and expresses some uncertainty between an object and its attribute values. To interpret and extract fuzzy decision rules from fuzzy information systems, the meta-theory based on modal logic proposed by Resconi et al. is modified. The modified meta-theory not only expresses uncertainty between objects and their attributes, but also uncertainty in the process of recognizing fuzzy information systems.

This contradiction separation based dynamic multi-clause synergized automated deduction theory is then proved to be sound and complete. The development of this new extension is motivated not only by our view to show that such a new rule of inference can be generic, but also by our\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["1797"]}

An open reading frame of 2,070\u00a0bp was found to encode a putative 689 amino acid protein. The deduced amino acid sequence shares 82% and 60% identity with GBE genes from Aedes aegypti and Homo sapiens. Transcript expression of GBE was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction in deltamethrin-susceptible and deltamethrin-resistant strains of the Culex mosquito. The results demonstrated that this gene has 19.7-fold higher expression in deltamethrin-resistant strain. Unexpectedly, the following study showed that cell proliferation decreased obviously in the GBE overexpression group compared to the empty vector control or the unrelated gene when treated by deltamethrin in the mosquito C6/36 cells whose mechanism is still unexplained.

The motivation of the combined prover C S E _ E 1.0 is to (1) evaluate the capability, applicability and generality of C S E _ E, and (2) take advantage of novel multi-clause S-CS dynamic deduction of CSE and mature equality handling of E to solve more and harder problems. In contrast to other improvements of E, C S E _ E 1.0 optimizes E mainly from the inference mechanism aspect. The focus of the present work is given to the description of C S E _ E including its S-CS rule, heuristic strategies, and the S-CS dynamic deduction algorithm for implementation. In terms of combination, in order not to lose the capability of E and use C S E _ E to solve some hard problems which are unsolved by E, C S E _ E 1.0 schedules the running of the two provers in time. It runs plain E first, and if E does not find a proof, it runs plain CSE, then if it does not find a proof, some clauses inferred in the CSE run as lemmas are added to the original clause set and the combined clause set handed back to E for further proof search.

In order to effectively manage learnt clauses, avoid the geometrical growth of learnt clauses, reduce the memory footprint of the redundant learnt clauses and improve the efficiency of the SAT solver eventually, learnt clauses need to be evaluated properly. The commonly used evaluation methods are based on the length of learnt clause, while short clauses are kept according to these methods. One of the current mainstream practices is the variable state independent decaying sum (VSIDS) evaluation method, the other is based on the evaluation of the literals blocks distance (LBD). There have been also some attempts to combine these two methods. The present work is focused on the hybrid evaluation algorithm by combining the trend intensity and the LBD. Based on the analysis of the frequency of learnt clauses, the trend of learnt clause being used is taken as an evaluation method which is then mixed with the LBD evaluation algorithm. The hybrid algorithm not only reflects the distribution of learnt clauses in conflict analysis, but also makes full use of literals information. The experimental comparison shows that the hybrid evaluation algorithm has advantages over the LBD evaluation algorithm in both the serial version and the parallel version of SAT solver, and the number of problems solved has significantly increased.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1797"]}

{"title": "A kind of resolution based on neural network\n", "abstract": " Resolution principle is a single rule of inference for a test of unsatisfiability. It is based on conjunctive normal form (in shortly CNF), also called as clause set (atomic formulae or their negations is called a literal, disjunction of literal is called a clause, conjunction of clause is consider as a clause set). Many modified resolution method have been raised, such as semantic resolution, ordered linear resolution, binary resolution, locking restriction resolution, the generalized resolution and fuzzy resolution, etc. They are based on this ideal: beginning with a clause, then use continually result of resolution, at last, get a conclusion of inference. If the conclusion is an empty clause, then the clause set is unsatisfiable; if the conclusion is not an empty clause, then the clause set is satisfiable. Soft computing is coined by Lotfi A. Zadeh. It includes fuzzy logic, neural network, evolution computing, etc. In general, the strong points of neural networks are their learning capabilities and their distributed structure that allows for highly parallel software or hardware implementations. Currently, soft computing is especially concerned with combinations of these methodologies. Such as fuzzy-neural network is the most visible approach to such combinations. It has the advantage of expression of human language, learning algorithms and parallel computing. In this paper, we will consider the following ideal: one hand, we discuss the classical resolution, and point out that a DNF equal a neural network (a DNF is transformed from a CNF by using distributive law of\u2228 to\u2227). On the other hand, once a clause set S be transformed a neural network, we can construct algorithm, and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1797"]}

However, as shown in the latest benchmark library of the ATP system, there are still many practical problems that have not been resolved or cannot be effectively resolved. Recently, in order to overcome the limitations of ATP based on binary resolution inference rules, a novel multi-clause dynamic standard contradiction separation (S-CS) inference rule and its automated deduction theory have been proposed. Based on this theory, this paper first clarifies the generality of this S-CS rule by comparing it with some well-known variants of the binary resolution rule, and then focuses on how to design a specific and effective algorithm along with search strategies to realize the S-CS based deductive theory with its implementation.

Computer based approaches are good at handling quantitative data, while it is still challenging on how to well structure qualitative knowledge and incorporate them as part of decision analytics. This paper develops a logical reasoning based decision-making framework for handling qualitative human knowledge. In this framework, an algebraic structure is adopted for modelling qualitative human knowledge in a systematic way, and a logic based approximate reasoning method is then proposed for inferring the final decision based on the structured qualitative knowledge.

Recently, an interesting probability distribution (PD) strategy for variable selection was proposed and has been successfully used to improve SLS algorithms, resulting in state-of-the-art solvers. However, most solvers based on the PD strategy only use polynomial function (PoF) to handle the exponential decay and are still unsatisfactory in dealing with medium and huge k-SAT instances at and near the phase transition. The present paper is focused on handling all k-SAT instances with long clauses. Firstly, an extensive empirical study of one state-of-the-art FRW solver WalkSATlm on a wide range of SAT problems is presented with the focus given on fitting the distribution of the break value of variable selected in each step, which turns out to be a Boltzmann\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1797"]}

In this work, we introduce a new metric between terms which is an extension of the metric based on substitutions proposed by Alan Hutchinson. Our approach breaks the limitation of Alan Hutchinson's metric which is only suitable for ground terms and enhances the power of reflecting the dissimilarity in ground terms. In fact, both function symbols and variable symbols are the source of difference between terms. As a consequence, the new metric considers difference caused the two factors as J.
