{"title": "Dealing with REST services in model-driven web engineering methods\n", "abstract": " A demanded industry requirement is how to integrate the functionality from Web 2.0 applications into their Information Systems (IS). In recent years, Web Engineering has faced this issue defining a set of conceptual models that abstract the communication with external SOAP Web Services. However, Web 2.0 applications usually expose their functionality by means of REST Services. Since this type of services lacks of a formal specification, the integration issues must be manually addressed. The main purpose of this work is to introduce a Model-driven approach for the integration of Web 2.0 functionality implemented as REST Services. To achieve this goal, this works presents a REST Metamodel for specifying these REST Services as conceptual models. It also introduces how the models created using this metamodel, can be used within Model-driven Web Engineering methods.", "num_citations": "62\n", "authors": ["613"]}

This paper explains the evolution of a Conceptual Schema of the Human Genome (CSHG), which seeks to provide a clear and precise understanding of the human genome. We want to highlighting all the advantages of the application of CM in a complex domain such as Genomic Information Systems (GeIS). We show how over time this model has evolved, thus we have discovered better forms of representation. As we advanced in exploring the domain, we understood that we should be extending and incorporating the new concepts detected into our model. Here we present and discuss the evolution to reach the current version (CSHG v2).

This improvement is a consequence of the evolution from HTML User Interfaces (UI) to more usable and richer UI. The most popular Web 2.0 applications have selected the Rich Internet Application (RIA) paradigm to achieve this goal. However, the current Web Engineering methods do not provide the expressivity required to produce RIA interfaces. This work presents a RIA Metamodel to deal with the new technological challenges that have arisen with Web 2.0 development. This metamodel supports two main perspectives: 1) the definition of the UI as a combination of widgets from a selected RIA technology; and 2) the specification of the UI interaction as a consequence of the events produced by the user. In order to illustrate how this RIA Metamodel can be used in a Model-driven Engineering (MDE) method, this\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "40\n", "authors": ["613"]}

The main contribution of this work is an Interaction Model to specify the new semantics to deal with the Model-Driven RIA development. This model is made up of Interaction Patterns that describe, from a conceptual point of view, a generic solution for a common user-system interaction. Following the HCI principles, this model has two views: 1) an Abstract view made up of Abstract Interaction Patterns that describe the interaction without taking into account technological details and, 2) a Concrete view made up of RIA Interaction Patterns which specify the new interaction and interface requirements. Applying this Interaction Model within a Model-Driven software process, a functional RIA can be obtained.

{"title": "Improving automatic UML2 profile generation for MDA industrial development\n", "abstract": " In the context of MDA-oriented solutions, a modeling language with a precise semantics is a mandatory requirement. Even though MDA encourages the use of UML, there are several MDA approaches that define their own Domain Specific Modeling Languages (DSML) in order to obtain the needed semantic precision. However, the high acceptance of UML in the software industry has led different MDA-approaches to integrate their DSMLs semantics into UML by means of UML profiles. Certain approaches provide alternatives to elaborate a UML profile from the DSML metamodel, but generally speaking, the resultant profile does not include all the semantic expressiveness of the original DSML. This paper provides a solution that is focused on the MDA industrial development. This solution is based on a systematic approach to generate a DSML metamodel that is used to automatically obtain a UML profile\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["613"]}

This process is based on a set of model-to-model and model-to-code transformations. Several industrial tools have applied this approach in order to generate the UI. However, these model transformations are mainly fixed and are not always the best solution for a specific UI. In this work, the notion of Transformation Profile is introduced to better specify the model-to-model transformations.

{"title": "An Abstract Interaction Model for a MDA Software Production Method.\n", "abstract": " Currently, most well-known model-based software production methods focus on defining the system functionality (business logic and persistence). However, the interaction between users and the system is too often not accurately described. Frequently an interface must be generated for multiple technological platforms (Desktop, Web, Mobile devices etc.) from the same model. The key issue is the model that was designed for describing a specific platform interface. When this model is used in other platforms, the final user interfaces have usability problems due to a lack of expressiveness at conceptual level. An interesting approach is to solve this problem from a MDA point of view. Two abstraction levels are defined in order to model interaction: a PIM (Platform Independent Model) or abstract level to describe interaction without taking into account technological issues and a PSM (Platform Specific Model) or concrete level to deal with platform concrete requirements. This paper explains in detail how the PIM level is defined in order to produce multiplatform user interfaces. This Abstract Interaction Model is made up of two models: an User Model that defines different types of users and an Abstract Interface Model to define the user interface. The final goal is to introduce these new models into OO-Method, an MDA-based software production method to produce software systems. As a result, a user interface which can be used as a prototype is automatically generated.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["613"]}

With this aim, Domain-specific Languages (DSL) were proposed for abstracting the programming complexity of a domain and to provide an understandable tool for end-users.

As a solution, we propose a DSL development process for involving end-users; concretely, in this paper, we focus on their involvement during the design of the DSL syntax. For achieving this goal, we identify the decisions that developers must address to design the syntax, and we discuss how end-users can participate in those decisions.

In this context, the definition of sound interoperability mechanisms to reuse knowledge and share ideas among existing conceptual models, and also apply them into concrete development processes, is an important challenge to be faced. Thus, different modeling approaches, tools, and standards can be integrated and coordinated to reduce the implementation and learning time of development processes as well as to improve the quality of the final software products. However, there is a lack of approaches to support automatic interoperability among modeling approaches.

Nowadays, the study and comprehension of the human genome is a major challenge due to its high level of complexity. The constant evolution in the genomic domain contributes to the generation of ever larger amounts of new data, which means that if we do not manage it correctly data quality could be compromised (ie, problems related with heterogeneity and inconsistent data). In this paper, we propose the use of a Conceptual Schema of the Human Genome (CSHG), designed to understand and improve our ontological commitment to the domain and also extend (enrich) this schema with the integration of a novel concept: Haplotypes. Our focus is on improving the understanding of the relationship between genotype and phenotype, since new findings show that this question is more complex than was originally thought. Here we present the first steps in our data management approach with haplotypes (variations, frequencies and populations) and discuss the database evolution to support this data. Each new version in our conceptual schema (CS) introduces changes to the underlying database structure that has essential and practical implications for better understanding and managing the relevant information.
