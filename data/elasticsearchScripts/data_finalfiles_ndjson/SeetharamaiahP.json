Retinal implants are being developed around the world in hopes of restoring useful vision for patients suffering from certain types of diseases like Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP). In these diseases the photoreceptor cells slowly degenerated, leading to blindness. However, many of the inner retinal neurons that transmit signals from the photoreceptors to the brain are preserved to a large extent for a prolonged period of time. The Retinal Prosthesis aims to provide partial vision by electrically activating the remaining cells of the retina. The Epi retinal prosthesis system is composed of two units, extra ocular unit and intraocular implant. The two units are connected by a telemetric inductive link. The Extraocular unit consists of a CCD camera, an image processor, an encoder, and a transmitter built on the eyeglass. High-resolution image from a CCD camera is reduced to lower resolution matching the array of electrodes by image processor, which is then encoded into bit stream. Each electrode in an implant corresponds to one pixel in an image. The bit stream is modulated on a 22 MHz carrier and then transmitted wirelessly to the inside implant.

For generating the English script, the VDP is used in its text mode, while for the other two scripts in the Graphics II mode. Due to the limitation of the VDP with 192 rows of 256 pixels, the number of displayed characters is very less (i.e. 24 lines of 40 characters in English Text). A standard RS-232 C interface has been provided in the design for interfacing with the host computers.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1485"]}
{"title": "Component safety assessment using three-state Markov model\n", "abstract": " Safety assessment for critical-computer systems is based on the safety assessment of components. In this Paper we discuss the safety assessment of components by using three-state Markov chain modeling and introduce a stepwise solution to model both design faults and physical faults through a three-state homogenous Markov model that is used to solve three-state non homogeneous Markov chain for the component modeling. Four parameters are used in the modeling of the three-state Markov chain model. By using the parameterized three-state Markov model Component safety assessment is conducted by the assumption that component does not utilize redundancy.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1485"]}
{"title": "A Neuro-Fuzzy Approach Based Voting Scheme for Fault Tolerant Systems Using Artificial Bee Colony Training\n", "abstract": " Voting algorithms are extensively used to make decisions in fault tolerant systems where each redundant module gives inconsistent outputs. Popular voting algorithms include majority voting, weighted voting, and inexact majority voters. Each of these techniques suffers from scenarios where agreements do not exist for the given voter inputs. This has been successfully overcome in literature using fuzzy theory. Our previous work concentrated on a neuro-fuzzy algorithm where training using the neuro system substantially improved the prediction result of the voting system. Weight training of Neural Network is sub-optimal. This study proposes to optimize the weights of the Neural Network using Artificial Bee Colony algorithm. Experimental results show the proposed system improves the decision making of the voting algorithms.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1485"]}
{"title": "An embedded computer controlled four fingered robot hand\n", "abstract": " When people interact with intelligent agents, they likely rely upon a wide range of existing knowledge about machines, minds, and intelligence. This knowledge not only guides these interactions, but it can be challenged and potentially changed by interaction experiences. The science of computation has systematically abstracted away the physical world. Embedded software systems, however engage the physical world. Human beings interact physically with environment using their hands. Robotic hand systems can be used in hazardous environments such as those encountered in nuclear, military, chemical, underwater, and space applications. Robots have the potential to play a large role in our world. However, as the potential use for robots grows, so does their need to interact with objects in their environment. An embedded computer controlled four fingered robotic hand is designed and developed with a simple\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1485"]}
{"title": "An Improvement in History Based Weighted Voting Algorithm for Safety Critical Systems\n", "abstract": " Fault masking is a widely used strategy for increasing the safety and reliability of computer control systems. Voting algorithms are used to arbitrate between the results of redundant modules in fault-tolerant systems. Inexact majority and weighted average voters have been used in many applications, although both have problems associated with them. Inexact majority voters require an application-speci6c\u2019voter threshold\u2019value to be specified, whereas weighted average voters are unable to produce a benign output when no agreement exists between the voter inputs. The approach uses some form of voting to arbitrate between the results of hardware or software redundant modules for masking faults. Several voting algorithms have been used in fault tolerant control systems; each has different features, which makes it more applicable to some system types than others. Fault masking is one of the primary approaches to improve or maintain the normal behavior of a range of safety-critical systems. Some industrial sectors which employ such systems include process control, Transportation, nuclear power station and military applications Majority and weighted average voters have been widely used in these applications to provide error/fault-masking capability. Safety critical systems are the systems which may lead to hazards, loss of lives and great damage to the property if they fail due to errors which may lead to faults. NModular Redundancy or N-Version Programming along with the voter is used in the safety critical systems to mask the faults. This paper introduces a novel voting scheme based on fuzzy set theory. The voter assigns a fuzzy difference\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1485"]}
{"title": "A practical approach to speech processor for auditory prosthesis using DSP and FPGA\n", "abstract": " Auditory prosthesis (AP) is a widely used electronic device for patients suffering with severe hearing loss by electrically stimulating the auditory nerve using an electrode array surgically placed inside the inner ear. The AP also known as cochlear implant (CI) mainly contains external Body worn Speech Processor (BWSP) and internal Implantable Receiver Stimulator (IRS). BWSP receives an external sound or speech and generates encoded speech data bits for transmission to IRS via Radio Frequency transcutaneous link for excitation of electrode array placed in the inner ear. Development of BWSP and IRS involves normally the use of either standard microprocessor or microcontroller or digital signal processor (DSP) or FPGA or ASIC devices. Sometimes the performance of the AP system using the standard processors cannot meet the requirement of the intended application.
