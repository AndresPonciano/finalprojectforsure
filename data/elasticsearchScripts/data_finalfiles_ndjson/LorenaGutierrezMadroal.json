{"title": "Test event generation for a fall-detection IoT system\n", "abstract": " The Internet of Things (IoT) is a popular paradigm which has been applied to different areas, such as smart cities, medicine, or business processes. One of the main drawbacks of an IoT system is the amount of information it has to manage and to monitor. This information arrives as events that need to be processed in real-time in order to make correct decisions. The event processing languages (EPLs) were designed to handle this information by defining event patterns which describe relevant situations to be detected and filter the information. In the majority of the relevant situations to detect, the events have a specific behavior which must be analyzed not only to define the event patterns but also to simulate them to test the IoT system. Moreover, in several situations it is quite difficult to obtain test events with specific values: adverse environment conditions, rise or fall in blood pressure, heart attack, falls, among others\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["2037"]}
{"title": "Evolutionary mutation testing for IoT with recorded and generated events\n", "abstract": " Mutation testing is a testing technique that has been applied successfully to several programming languages. Despite its benefits for software testing, the high computational cost of mutation testing has kept it from being widely used. Several refinements have been proposed to reduce its cost by reducing the number of generated mutants; one of those is evolutionary mutation testing (EMT). Evolutionary mutation testing aims at generating a reduced set of mutants with an evolutionary algorithm, which searches for potentially equivalent and difficult to kill mutants that help improve the test suite. Evolutionary mutation testing has been evaluated in two contexts so far, ie, web service compositions and object\u2010oriented C++ programmes. This study explores its performance when applied to event processing language queries of various domains. This study also considers the impact of the test data, since a lack of events or\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["2037"]}
{"title": "IoT\u2013TEG: Test event generator system\n", "abstract": " Internet of Things (IoT) has been paid increasingly attention by the government, academe and industry all over the world. One of the main drawbacks of the IoT systems is the amount of information they have to handle. This information arrives as events that need to be processed in real time in order to make correct decisions. Given that processing the data is crucial, testing the IoT systems that will manage that information is required. In order to test IoT systems, it is necessary to generate a huge number of events with specific structures and values to test the functionalities required by these systems. As this task is very hard and very prone to error if done by hand, this paper addresses the automated generation of appropriate events for testing. For this purpose, a general specification to define event types and its representation are proposed and an event generator is developed based on this definition.

{"title": "Mutation testing of event processing queries\n", "abstract": " Event processing queries are intended to process continuous event streams. These queries are partially similar to traditional SQL queries, but provide the facilities to express rich features (e.g., pattern expression, sliding window of length and time). An error while implementing a query may result in abnormal program behaviors and lost business opportunities. Moreover, queries can be generated with unsanitized inputs and the structure of intended queries might be altered. Thus, a tester needs to test the behavior of queries in presence of malicious inputs. Mutation testing has been found to be effective to assess test suites quality and generating new test cases. Unfortunately, there is no effort to perform mutation testing of event processing queries. In this work, we propose mutation-based testing of event processing queries.

To provide rapid assistance, a portable fall detection system has been developed that is capable of detecting fall situations and, if necessary, alerting emergency services without any user interaction. The prototype is designed to facilitate reliable fall detection and to classify several fall types and human activities. This solution represents a life-saving service for every person that will significantly improve assistance in the case of fall events, which are a part of daily life. Additionally, this approach facilitates independent system operation, since the system does not depend on sensor or network units located within a building structure.

In fact, it has been applied to many languages. Unfortunately there is no research work which focuses its attention on detect deficiencies in the mutation testing studies already done. Moreover, the mutation operators classification has not been tackled at all. When has a mutation testing study an enough grade of maturity? It has not been found an study which determines the grade of maturity of a mutation testing study. We propose a classification of mutation operators which lets us know if it is necessary to define more mutation operators, and also lets us determine if the mutation operators are good enough to consider mature the mutation testing study. The evaluation results show the benefits of the proposed classification. This classification lets the developer do a good evaluation of the programming language under mutation testing, as well as its defined mutation operators. The mutation testing process described in this paper and the mutation operators classification have been developed and analyzed with real cases. New mutation operators for Event Processing Language have been defined and used as examples to understand the proposed mutation operators classification.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["2037"]}

{"title": "Combining Evolutionary Mutation Testing with Random Selection\n", "abstract": " Mutation testing is a well-known fault-based technique that has been applied to different domains as new technologies have appeared. Evolutionary Mutation Testing (EMT) finds mutants that are useful to produce new test cases. It uses evolutionary algorithms to reduce the number of mutants that are generated, keeping as many difficult to kill and stubborn mutants (strong mutants) as possible in the reduced set. Given the popularity of real-time systems, the MuEPL mutation system was developed for the Esper Event Processing Language (EPL), a query language aimed at the Internet of Things (IoT). In past work, EMT was integrated into MuEPL, and it reduced the cost of finding strong mutants in some EPL queries but not in others. This study takes a step forward by proposing and evaluating two metaheuristics for EMT that combine EMT and random selection: one which bootstraps the hall of fame with a random\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2037"]}
