In this context, organizations have to continually change their business strategy in order to be able to use the market opportunities and cope with the pressure of an uncertain business environment. As a result, Business Process Management (BPM), Case Management, and other instruments and solutions have been adapted/built in order to respond to the current demands of the organizations in the field of modelling of collaborative processes.As a response to the complex interactions between partners, integration of knowledge and business processes represents an important step in improving the agility of the organization. For intensive knowledge based processes Case Management may be used, which provides a real time image on the current events and generates a rapid response to the organization\u2019s internal and external events. Business Intelligence (BI) is used at the present for performance management within business processes, helping the organization to automatically detect the problems/opportunities and to initiate corrective actions and/or change business rules in order to optimise processes.

{"title": "Security Solutions for Privacy Preserving Improved Data Mining.\n", "abstract": " Approaches of data analysis in the context of Business Intelligence solutions are presented, when the data is scarce with respect to the needs of performing an analysis. Several scenarios are presented: usage of an initial dataset obtained from primary data as a reference for the quality of the results, enriching the dataset through decoration with derived attributes and enriching the dataset with external data. Each type of dataset decoration is used to improve the quality of the analysis\u2019 results. After being subject to improvement using the presented methods, the improved dataset contains a large number of attributes regarding a subject. As some attributes refer to sensitive information or imply sensitive information about the subject, therefore dataset storage needs to prevent unwanted analysis that could reveal such information. A method for dataset partitioning is presented with respect to the predictive capacity of a set of attributes over a sensitive attribute. The proposed partitioning includes also means to hide the link between the real subject and stored data.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2236"]}
{"title": "E-learning solutions based on service-oriented technologies\n", "abstract": " Considering the current stage of development, where the nature of work is changing and moving towards virtual organization of activities, the educational process also undergoes deep changes. The effect of these changes is widely known as e-learning. The importance and marginal utility of e-learning become obvious against the background of world crisis. These are only a few reasons behind the unsurprising adoption of e-learning on global scale. Yet, the simple implementation of e-learning solutions is not enough to guarantee the success of this modern education technology. A successful solution will have to combine the human resource with the modern service-oriented technology. In this paper we will present the most important aspects of implementing a successful e-learning solution. They are: the current stage of implementing e-learning solutions in Romania and worldwide, modern technologies for e\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2236"]}
{"title": "Designing Flexible E-Business Workflow Systems.\n", "abstract": " In today's business environment organizations must cope with complex interactions between actors adapt fast to frequent market changes and be innovative. In this context, integrating knowledge with processes and Business Intelligence is a major step towards improving organization agility. Therefore, traditional environments for workflow design have been adapted to answer the new business models and current requirements in the field of collaborative processes. This paper approaches the design of flexible and dynamic workflow management systems for electronic businesses that can lead to agility.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2236"]}

E-procurement applications consolidate the paper-based catalogs of multiple vendors by digitizing product information into a single, one-stop shopping source for direct and indirect goods and services. The most common e-procurement model involves a host or intermediary service provider linking buyers and sellers in an interconnected supply chain using a web based e-procurement application. This paper analyzes how the Romanian electronic public acquisition system meets the requirements of the informational society and the European integration.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2236"]}
