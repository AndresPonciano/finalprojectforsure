As the applications for 3D printed parts continue to grow in diversity (e.g., gears, propellers, and bearings), the loading conditions applied to printed parts have become more complex, and the need for thorough characterization is now paramount for increased adoption of 3D printing. To broaden the understanding of torsional properties, this study focused on the shear strength of specimens to observe the impact from additive manufacturing. A full factorial (42) design of experiments was used, considering the orientation and the raster angle as factors. XYZ, YXZ, ZXY, and XZY levels were considered for the orientation parameter, as well as 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, and 45\u00b0/45\u00b0 for the raster angle parameter. Ultimate shear strength, 0.2% yield strength, shear modulus, and fracture strain were used as response variables to identify the most optimal build parameters. Additionally, stress-strain diagrams are presented to contrast elastic and plastic regions with traditional injection molding. Results demonstrated an interaction of factors in all mechanical measured variables whenever an orientation and a raster angle were applied. Compared to injection molding, FDM specimens were similar for all measured torsion variables except for the fracture strain; this led to the conclusion that the FDM process can fabricate components with similar elastic properties but with less ductility than injection molding.

In this research study, the authors present a novel method of embedding Internet of Things (IoT) sensors to monitor real-time melt flow velocity in sand molds during metal casting. Cavities are incorporated in sand molds to position the sensors with precise registration. Capacitive and magnetic sensors are embedded in the cavities where melt flow velocity is calculated by using an oscillator, the frequency of which is sensitive to changes in the close field permittivity, and change in magnetic flux, respectively. Their efficiency is investigated by integrating the sensors into 3D sand-printing (3DSP) molds for conical-helix and straight sprue configurations to measure flow velocities for aluminum alloy 319. Experimental melt flow velocities are within 5% of estimations from computational simulations. A major benefit of 3DSP is the geometrical freedom for complex gating systems necessary to reduce turbulence and access to mold volume for sensor integration during 3DSP processing. Findings from this study establish the opportunity of embedding IoT sensors in sand molds to monitor metal velocity in order to validate simulation results (2\u20135% error), compare gating systems performance, and improve foundry practice of manual pouring as a quality control system.

FMLs are structures constituting an alternating arrangement of metal and composite materials that are used in the aerospace sector due to their unique mechanical performance. 3D printing technology in FMLs could allow the production of structures with customized configuration and performance. A series of continuous carbon fiber reinforced composites were printed on a Markforged system and placed between layers of aluminum alloy to manufacture a novel breed of FMLs in this study.

The results show that the tensile strength of the FMLs falls between the strength of their constituent materials, while the low and high velocity impact performance of the FMLs is superior to those observed for the plain aluminum and the composite material. This mechanism is related to the energy absorption process displayed by the plastic deformation, and interfacial delamination within the laminates.

Beyond the challenges of translating signals between such disparate voltages, another concern is the increased sensitivity to radiation that results from the weakened drivers in the traditional level shifter feedback structure. This paper presents a novel rad-hard ultra-low-power level shifter that 1) is Single Event Upset (SEU) immune over a wide range of supply voltages due to a Dual Interlocked Storage Cell (DICE) feedback and 2) is optimized for translating signals from\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["842"]}
{"title": "Print-and-play: a new paradigm for the nearly-instant aerospace system\n", "abstract": " Nanosatellites, in particular the sub-class of CubeSATs, will provide an ability to place multiple small satellites in space more efficiently than larger satellites, with the eventual expectation that they will compete against some of the roles played by traditional large satellites that are expensive to launch. In order to do this, it is necessary to decrease the weight and volume without decreasing the capabilities. At the same time, it is desirable to create systems extremely rapidly, less than a week from concept to orbit. The Air Force has been working on a concept termed \"CubeFlow\" which will be a web-based design flow for rapidly constructible CubeSAT systems. In CubeFlow, distributed suppliers create offerings (modules, software functions, for satellite bus and payloads) meeting standard size and interface specifications, which are registered as a living catalog to a design community within the web-based CubeFlow\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["842"]}
{"title": "Optimized Charge Pumps for Subthreshold Operation\n", "abstract": " Over the last decade, the use of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) has grown from the design verification of digital systems to a wide variety of commercial and space applications for which low power consumption and re-programmability are paramount. To address the issue of low power, researchers have reported FPGAs incorporating a variety of design techniques to improve energy efficiency. However, to date no work has focused on the combination of reconfigurable circuits with ultra-low voltage subthreshold logic. Powered at a voltage that is less than the threshold of the transistor\u2013far below conventional levels-subthreshold circuits provide significant energy savings. Although subthreshold operation results in performance degradation of several orders of magnitude, some applications in which energy efficiency is prioritized can tolerate the reduced performance. The marriage of subthreshold logic and FPGAs is inevitable and therefore deserves investigation. Given the importance of boosted internal voltages in FPGAs for improved performance in the switching fabric as well as programmability of non-volatile configuration memory, this report describes a comprehensive comparison of existing charge pumps in the context of subthreshold operation and proposes a novel charge pump optimized for ultra-low voltage operation.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["842"]}

{"title": "Productivity enhancement of laser powder bed fusion using compensated shelled geometries and hot isostatic pressing\n", "abstract": " In laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF), the mechanical performance and especially fatigue properties of fabricated parts are significantly improved by hot isostatic pressing (HIP) as the density increases (pores are closed) and the microstructure improves. HIP ensures consistent and defect-free material, and consequently, this high temperature and high pressure process is often a requirement for safety-critical aerospace applications. The use of HIP to directly consolidate intentionally-unmelted interior powder in a L-PBF part was recently demonstrated. By confining the laser melting to only the outer shell (contour) of the structure, L-PBF production times can be dramatically reduced. A subsequent HIP cycle, which may be mandatory for reliability reasons, and therefore does not add additional costs, is then used to densify the entire structure. Production rates and energy efficiencies can therefore be improved in this way\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["842"]}

{"title": "Production of low coefficient of thermal expansion composite tooling manufactured via 3D printing\n", "abstract": " Additive manufacturing enables the ability to produce composite tooling molds in a rapidly and cost effective manner. This work has produced low coefficient of thermal expansion composite tooling based on Invar, ceramics and metal-ceramic composites that are functional in the temperature range of 180 C. Here, four main approaches have been considered. The first approach consisted on using a binder jetting technology to 3D print sand molds to cast molten Invar to produce tooling. The second approach consisted on printing a mold based on both silica and zirconia sand and infiltrating them with a polymer to yield a robust tooling. The third approach was based on transforming a SLA printed ceramic mold into a metal-composite system. The fourth technology was based on a Direct Energy Deposition System for attaching Invar upon a steel molding structure. This last approach could represent a promising technology for producing low cost composite tooling since only a small layer of Invar would be added to a nonexpensive substrate. The results have shown that the aforementioned processes have successfully resulted on low CTE tooling molds and successful composite materials.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["842"]}

Traditionally, NDT is used to identify defects for a pass/reject decision, either for manufactured parts or for large industrial parts in use (e.g., pipelines, boilers, etc.). It is also used to inspect parts in use for service-related damage such as fatigue, corrosion, wear, etc. Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) has less defects than most additive manufacturing technologies but is also prone to possible defects associated with processing parameters or a range of errors which may occur during manufacturing.
