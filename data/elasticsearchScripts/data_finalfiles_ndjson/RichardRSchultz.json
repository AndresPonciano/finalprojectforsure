{"title": "CFD Analysis of Core Bypass Phenomena\n", "abstract": " The US Department of Energy is exploring the potential for the VHTR which will be either of a prismatic or a pebble-bed type. One important design consideration for the reactor core of a prismatic VHTR is coolant bypass flow which occurs in the interstitial regions between fuel blocks. Such gaps are an inherent presence in the reactor core because of tolerances in manufacturing the blocks and the inexact nature of their installation. Furthermore, the geometry of the graphite blocks changes over the lifetime of the reactor because of thermal expansion and irradiation damage. The existence of the gaps induces a flow bias in the fuel blocks and results in unexpected increase of maximum fuel temperature. Traditionally, simplified methods such as flow network calculations employing experimental correlations are used to estimate flow and temperature distributions in the core design. However, the distribution of temperature in the fuel pins and graphite blocks as well as coolant outlet temperatures are strongly coupled with the local heat generation rate within fuel blocks which is not uniformly distributed in the core. Hence, it is crucial to establish mechanistic based methods which can be applied to the reactor core thermal hydraulic design and safety analysis.

However, goals established by the Generation IV program, especially the desire to increase efficiency, has lead to an increase in operating temperatures for the reactors. This increase pushes reactor materials to operate towards their upper temperature limits relative to structural integrity. Because there will be some finite variation of the power density in the reactor core, there will be a potential for local hot spots to occur in the reactor vessel. Hence, it has become apparent that detailed analysis will be required to ensure that local \u2018hot spots\u2019 do not exceed safety limits.

{"title": "Implications of Air Ingress Induced by Density-Difference Driven Stratified Flow\n", "abstract": " One of the design basis accidents for the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP), a high temperature gas-cooled reactor, is air ingress subsequent to a pipe break. Following a postulated double-ended guillotine break in the hot duct, and the subsequent depressurization to nearly reactor cavity pressure levels, air present in the reactor cavity will enter the reactor vessel via density-gradient-driven-stratified flow. Because of the significantly higher molecular weight and lower initial temperature of the reactor cavity air-helium mixture, in contrast to the helium in the reactor vessel, the air-helium mixture in the cavity always has a larger density than the helium discharging from the reactor vessel through the break into the reactor cavity. In the later stages of the helium blowdown, the momentum of the helium flow decreases sufficiently for the heavier cavity air-helium mixture to intrude into the reactor vessel lower plenum through the lower portion of the break. Once it has entered, the heavier gas will pool at the bottom of the lower plenum. From there it will move upwards into the core via diffusion and density-gradient effects that stem from heating the air-helium mixture and from the pressure differences between the reactor cavity and the reactor vessel. This scenario (considering density-gradient-driven stratified flow) is considerably different from the heretofore commonly used scenario that attributes movement of air into the reactor vessel and from thence to the core region via diffusion.

For the steady state at 100% primary mass inventory, TRAC was in excellent agreement with the natural-circulation flow rate, the temperature distribution in the steam-generator tubes, and the temperature drop from the hot leg to the steam-generator inlet plenum. TRAC also predicted reverse flow in the long tubes. At reduced primary mass inventories, TRAC predicted the three natural-circulation flow regimes: single phase, two phase, and reflux condensation. TRAC did not predict the cyclic fill-and-dump phenomenon seen briefly in the test. TRAC overpredicted the two-phase natural-circulation flow rate. Since the core is well cooled at this time, the result is conservative. An important result of the analysis is that TRAC was able to predict the core dryout and heatup at approximately the same primary mass inventory as in the test. 4 refs., 8 figs., 2 tabs.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1406"]}

The oxidation process of graphite has known to be affected by various factors, including temperature, pressure, oxygen concentration, types of graphite, graphite shape and size, flow distribution, etc. However, our recent study reveals that the internal pore characteristics play very important roles in the overall graphite oxidation rate.One of the main issues regarding graphite oxidation is the potential core collapse problem that may occur following the degradation of graphite mechanical strength. In analyzing this phenomenon, it is very important to understand the relationship between the degree of oxidization and strength degradation. In addition, the change of oxidation rate by graphite oxidation degree characterization by burn-off (ratio of the oxidized graphite density to the original density) should be quantified because graphite strength degradation is followed by graphite density decrease, which highly affects oxidation rates and patterns. Because the density change is proportional to the internal pore surface area, they should be quantified in advance.

The test results show that the core was uncovered briefly and that the rods overheated at certain core locations. Liquid holdup on the upflow side of the steam generator tubes was observed. When the loop seal cleared, the core refilled and the rods cooled. The TRAC results are in reasonable agreement with the test data, meaning that TRAC correctly predicted the major trends and phenomena. TRAC predicted the core uncovery, the resulting rod heatup, and the liquid holdup on the upflow side of the steam generator tubes correctly. The clearing of the loop seal allowed core recovery and cooled the overheated rods just as it had in the data, but TRAC predicted its occurrence 20 s late. The experimental and TRAC analysis results of run SB-CL-05 are similar to those for Semiscale Run S-UT-8. In both runs there was core uncovery, rod overheating, and steam generator liquid holdup. These results confirm scaling of these phenomena from Semiscale (1/1650) to LSTF (1/48).", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1406"]}

Using the Browns Ferry (BF) Unit-1 plant as a basis of study, the station blackout sequence was investigated by the Severe Accident Sequence Analysis (SASA) Program in support of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Unresolved Safety Issue A-44: Station Blackout. A station blackout transient occurs when the plant's AC power from a comemrcial power grid is lost and cannot be restored by the diesel generators. Under normal operating conditions, fa loss of offsite power (LOSP) occurs [ie, a complete severance of the BF plants from the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) power grid], the eight diesel generators at the three BF units would quickly start and power the emergency AC buses. Of the eight diesel generators, only six are needed to safely shut down all three units. Examination of BF-specific data show that LOSP frequency is low at Unit 1. The station blackout frequency is even lower (5.7 x 10-4 events per year) and hinges on whether the diesel generators start.

For such a configuration in normal operation, the helium coolant flow proceeds from the upper plenum to the lower plenum principally through the core coolant channels and the interstitial gaps (bypass flow) that separate the prismatic blocks from one another. Only the core prismatic blocks have coolant channels. The interstitial gaps are present throughout the core, the inner reflector region, and the out reflector region. The bypass flows in a prismatic gas-cooled reactor (GCR) are of potential concern because they reduce the desired flow rates in the coolant channels and, thereby, can increase outlet gas temperatures and maximum fuel temperatures. Consequently, it is appropriate to account for bypass flows in reactor thermal gas dynamic analyses. The objectives of this project include the following: fundamentally understand bypass flow and heat transfer at scaled, undistorted conditions and with geometry distortions; develop improved estimates of associated loss coefficients, surface friction and heat transfer for systems and network codes; and obtain related data for validation of CFD (computational fluid dynamic) or system (eg, RELAP5) codes which can be employed in predictions for a more\u00bb", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1406"]}

A key phenomenon that may lead to localized hot spots in the reactor is the degradation of heat transfer effects in the bypass flow due to geometric distortions. Geometry distortions are the result of the graphite blocks being irradiated with energetic neutrons as well as thermal expansion effects due to temperature changes. Experimental data gathered from this project will be used to benchmark numerical codes used in the design and safety analysis of the MHTGR.Flow visualization and pressure loss experiments were conducted in order to characterize flow patterns approaching and within bypass channels and to quantify wall friction and pressure loss coefficients.

However, goals established by the Generation IV program, especially the desire to increase efficiency, has lead to an increase in operating temperatures for the reactors. This increase pushes reactor materials to operate towards their upper temperature limits relative to structural integrity. Because there will be some finite variation of the power density in the reactor core, there will be a potential for local hot spots to occur in the reactor vessel. Hence, it has become apparent that detailed analysis will be required to ensure that local''hot spots''do not exceed safety limits. It is generally accepted that computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes are intrinsically capable of simulating fluid dynamics and heat transport locally because they are based on''first principles''. Indeed, CFD analysis has reached a fairly mature level of development, including the commercial level. However, CFD experts are aware that even though commercial codes are capable of simulating local fluid and thermal physics, great care must be taken in their application to avoid errors caused by such things as inappropriate grid meshing, low-order discretization schemes, lack of iterative convergence and inaccurate time-stepping.

The functioning of the rod is based solely on inexorable physical laws. The operation of the rod in its emergency function does not require the intervention of a human operator, nor does it rely on any signal from a monitoring or safety system. Although the concept could be applicable to a variety of reactors (provided a normal temperature range is specified), in this paper, the concept is applied to the emergency shutdown of a pebble-bed reactor. The preliminary study presented here demonstrates that the proposed Electro-Magnetic Optimally Scramming Control Rod (EM-OSCR) naturally operates when needed. The rod is held out of the core region by the force of an electromagnet. The force is generated by a current carried by a conductor, a portion of which passes near or through the reactor core region. When the temperature in the conductor increases because of an increase in temperature in the reactor, the conductor resistivity increases. This, in turn, leads to a current decrease. When the current decreases below the level necessary to hold the rod up, the rod is released and it falls into the core under the effect of gravity.

The analysis makes use of data and information from several sources, including later, similar LOFT Experiments in which fuel centerline temperature measurements were made, experiments in other facilities, and results from a detailed FRAP-T6 model of the LOFT fuel rod. The analysis shows that there can be a significant difference (referred to as bias) between the surface-mounted thermocouple reading and the actual cladding temperature, and that the magnitude of this bias depends on the rate of heat transfer between the fuel rod cladding and coolant.

Core liquid level depression and subsequent core heatups are investigated using subscale data from the ROSA-IV Program's 1/48-scale Large Scale Test Facility (LSTF) and the 1/1705-scale Semiscale facility. Both facilities are Westinghouse-type, four-loop, pressurized water reactor simulators. The depression phenomena and factors which influence the minimum core level are described and illustrated using examples from the data. Analyses of the subject experiments, conducted using the TRAC-PF1/MOD1 (Version 12.7) thermal-hydraulic code, are also described and summarized. Finally, the response of a typical Westinghouse four-loop plant (RESAR-3S) was calculated to qualitatively study coal liquid level depression in a full-scale system. 31 refs., 37 figs., 6 tabs", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1406"]}

The LSTF is a 1/48 scale simulator of a W type four loop PWR with full scale component elevation differences. TMI-2 scenario simulation analyses were conducted to establish a pretest prediction data base for RELAP5 code evaluation purposes and to furnish a means of evaluating the LSTF's capability to simulate the reference PWR. The basis for such RELAP5 calculations and the similarities between the LSTF and reference PWR thermal-hydraulic behavior during a TMI-2 scenario are presented.(orig./HP)", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1406"]}
