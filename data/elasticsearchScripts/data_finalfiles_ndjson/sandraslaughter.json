{"title": "Effects of process maturity on quality, cycle time, and effort in software product development\n", "abstract": " The information technology (IT) industry is characterized by rapid innovation and intense competition. To survive, IT firms must develop high quality software products on time and at low cost. A key issue is whether high levels of quality can be achieved without adversely impacting cycle time and effort. Conventional beliefs hold that processes to improve software quality can be implemented only at the expense of longer cycle times and greater development effort. However, an alternate view is that quality improvement, faster cycle time, and effort reduction can be simultaneously attained by reducing defects and rework. In this study, we empirically investigate the relationship between process maturity, quality, cycle time, and effort for the development of 30 software products by a major IT firm. We find that higher levels of process maturity as assessed by the Software Engineering Institute's Capability Maturity Model\u2122\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "688\n", "authors": ["883"]}

In this environment, the role of careful empirical studies as the basis for improving software maintenance processes, methods, and tools is highlighted.

Software evolution refers to the dynamic behaviour of software systems as they are maintained and enhanced over their lifetimes. Software evolution is particularly important as systems in organizations become longer-lived. However, evolution is challenging to study due to the longitudinal nature of the phenomenon in addition to the usual difficulties in collecting empirical data.

{"title": "Identifying the prototypical career paths of IT professionals: A sequence and cluster analysis\n", "abstract": " This study seeks to understand whether there are prototypical career paths in IT. We use sequence analysis to analyze actual work history of individuals who had held jobs in the IT profession. Our findings suggest that, contrary to the traditional view of a dual career path of IT professionals, IT professionals' careers actually follow one of three career paths: technical; managerial; or protean. We also find that individuals in the IT technical career path have significantly more IT technical experience compared to those in other career paths. We conclude this paper by discussing these results and identifying the implications for research and practice. This study makes a key contribution to the literature on IT professionals as being one of the first to analyze empirically the actual career paths of IT.", "num_citations": "29\n", "authors": ["883"]}

This view ignores potential efficiency gains which may arise from proactive renovation strategies such as batching similar maintenance requests into larger projects. In this study, we explore the relationship between project size and productivity for software maintenance projects at a major national mass merchandising retailer. Using a non-parametric methodology called Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for estimating the functional relationship between maintenance inputs and outputs, we determine the most productive scale size for a set of maintenance projects at this organization. In addition, we also employ DEA-based heuristics to test for the existence of returns to scale for the projects. Our results indicate the presence of significant scale economies in these software maintenance projects. The most productive scale size is larger than 90% of the projects included in our sample. These results imply that there may be potential to increase productivity in software maintenance at this organization by grouping smaller modification projects into larger planned releases.1.

For these foundations to develop, clients initially need to exert high amounts of formal and clan controls to enforce learning activities against barriers to knowledge sharing.

Our investigation of group processes, influence and IT use by a virtual team responsible for forecasting ozone levels reveals several important findings. First, we find the heterogeneity of pre-discussion individual decisions and greater task uncertainty increase group polarization through a greater relative use of informational influence. Second, surprisingly, we find that the relative use of informational influence and the use of IT for persuasion are substitutive not complementary in their effects on group polarization.

In this study we analyze detailed performance data from a large service provider that has implemented a process improvement framework for services outsourcing. We evaluate the extent to which process standardization influences service delivery performance, and how the effect of standardization differs based on task variability and the length of experience with the new processes. The results indicate that for non-variable tasks, performance improves significantly in the immediate period after the implementation of the framework. Performance also improves at a faster rate over time after standardized processes are introduced. In contrast, for variable tasks there is an immediate decline in performance after process standardization occurs. However, performance on variable tasks after process standardization also increases at a faster rate over time than performance on non-variable tasks.

We test our hypotheses using data from a rare three-year longitudinal panel dataset. When applications are modified less frequently, the technology-based approach results in fewer errors, whereas the experience-and skill-based approaches are more effective when applications are frequently modified. Unpredictable modifications enhance the effectiveness of skill-based approaches, and larger modifications enhance the effectiveness of technology-and skill-based approaches.

{"title": "How development decisions affect product volatility: a longitudinal study of software change histories\n", "abstract": " Research on product development often focuses on activities prior to product launch. However, for long-lived, adaptable products like software, post-launch updates can account for the major portion of life cycle benefits and costs. Thus, it is important to understand how development decisions can influence the dynamics of product evolution. In this study we develop a model that relates strategic, organizational, and tactical product development decisions to the volatility of software products over their life cycles. We empirically evaluate this model by analyzing longitudinal data on more than 28,000 changes made over twenty years to software products in a major merchandising firm. In this firm a 1% increase in volatility is associated with a 1.9% increase in life cycle costs for the software products. Specific results indicate that, controlling for the domain, complexity, size and age of the products, an increase in the use of shared product platforms and work automation tools, in team instability, and in the intensity of updates to a product\u2019s components increases a product\u2019s future volatility. Analysis of curvilinear effects indicates that these volatility increases occur at a declining rate. These effects on volatility can be at least partially offset by using a standard, rather than custom, design over a product\u2019s life cycle. Finally, we find significant interactive effects among pairs of individual development choices such that the total volatility impact can be amplified or moderated with the joint use of some development practices.

However, few studies have attempted to quantify the business value of these externalities. As a result, relatively little is known about the economic impact of externalities on firms that adopt network technologies. In this study, we investigate the value of an electronic inter-bank payment network in terms of its effect on the reserve management performance of commercial banks. Performance is measured by the opportunity and penalty costs generated by balances on the reserve account that commercial banks hold at the central bank. We propose that the electronic inter-bank payment network enhances banks\u2019 reserve management performance (ie, reducing opportunity and penalty costs) by providing more timely information on deposits and withdrawals affecting the banks\u2019 reserve accounts. Technology impact is characterized as an initial stand-alone effect and a network externalities effect as more banks join the network. To evaluate the economic value of the technology impact, we analyze data from the implementation of an electronic inter-bank payment network adopted by all Mexican commercial banks. We find that early adopters of the electronic network, with a low ratio of electronic to overall operations, experience increasing opportunity and penalty costs. However, as additional banks join the network, the ratio of electronic operations increases, and costs decrease. After all banks have adopted the electronic network, we observe a reduction equivalent to 9.9% of each bank\u2019s opportunity and penalty costs.

{"title": "Efficiency of Complexity Allocation in Software Design: An Empirical Evaluation\n", "abstract": " Design is an important phase in software engineering. Inefficiencies in software design can result in complexity that is costly in software maintenance. The total complexity of a software design is determined by the nature of the information processing that must be accomplished. Software engineers must allocate this total design complexity into either data complexity or structural complexity. Data (intramodule) complexity can be deferred to another software module but at the cost of increasing structural (intermodule) complexity. In this study, we examine the efficiency of economic tradeoffs between data complexity and structural complexity in software design. We posit that the volatility of the information processing implemented in the design influences the relative maintenance cost of data and structural complexity. There is a downstream cost advantage to higher structure for applications that will be subject to frequent modification. Thus, efficient allocation of complexity requires a higher level of structure for applications whose information processing is likely to be frequently enhanced. However, software engineers may not optimize complexity allocation due to an inability to forecast the implications of their design decisions for software maintenance and to a possible absence of appropriate individual incentives. We evaluate software design decisions for the business systems of a major mass merchandiser and a large commercial bank.

Such strategic adjustments are aimed at configuring\" leanandmean\" operations in response to the increasingly dynamic, competitive and uncertain business climate (ScottMorton, 1991). A direct consequence of these radical changes to business operations is the revolutionary change in the traditional employer employee working relationship. Pfeffer and Baron (1988) suggest that there is a trend toward\" taking the workers back out\", in which organizations externalize a buffer of temporary workers against the core or permanent workforce. This externalization involves the use of contingent workforce where workers are physically transported out of the organization's boundaries to perform their work; where the duration of employment becomes shorter and more flexible; and where workers are detached administratively with organizations reducing their internal control of workers. Recent literature suggests that externalization of the workforce has been particularly pronounced in information systems (IS). Many internal IS organizations have been undergoing continual downsizing of their traditional permanent workforce since the late 1980's by outsourcing and contracting (Niederman and Trower, 1993; Korzeniowski, 1990). Molloy (1991) highlighted an increasing number of temporary executive IS jobs while Ryan (1991) observed that jobless IS workers are turning to contract work to tide over their midcareer crisis.
