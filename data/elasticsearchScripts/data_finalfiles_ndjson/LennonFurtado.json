{"title": "A teaching method for software measurement process based on gamification\n", "abstract": " The value of an effective measurement program lies in the ability to control and predict what can be measured. Thus, the measurement program has the capacity to provide a basis in decision-making to support the interests of an organization. This means it is only possible to run an effective measurement program with a team of software engineers who are well trained in this area. However, as the literature shows, there are few computer science courses that include the teaching of software process measurement in their program. Even these, generally only discuss the basic theoretical concepts of this process with little or no measurement in practice, which discourages the students from\u2019s learning the measurement process. In this context, according to some experts in software process improvement, one of the most widely used approaches to maintaining the motivation and commitment to improving the program, is the use of gamification. In light of this, the aim of this paper is to set out a proposal for teaching the gamification measurement process. This seeks to improve student motivation and performance in carrying out tasks related to software measurement, by incorporating elements from games into the measurement process, and thus making it more attractive for learning.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["2017"]}
{"title": "IVOrpheus 2.0-A Proposal for Interaction by Voice Command-Control in Three Dimensional Environments of Information Visualization\n", "abstract": " Several studies point out the importance of interaction in Information Visualization (InfoVis) field to the success of good data visualization. The interaction researches in InfoVis have encouraged the use of non-conventional interfaces, besides the traditional keyboard and mouse, such as voice commands, gesture controls, among others. This work aims to present aspects of design, development and evaluation of an interface for voice commands to interact in InfoVis 3D applications. The InfoVis technique used as usage scenario is the 3D Scatterplot. In addition, for speech recognition is used Coruja Software, to support Brazilian Portuguese. Finally, usability tests will be presented for a first evaluation of the interface and interaction proposal. The tests used the approach of user tasks to evaluate InfoVis sub-tasks. And as qualitative measurement is used NASA Task Load-Index methodology, which identifies\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["2017"]}
{"title": "IVOrpheus-a proposal for interaction by voice commands in three-dimensional environments of information visualization\n", "abstract": " IVOrpheus is an information visualization tool for three-dimensional data that allows user's interaction by voice commands, mouse and keyboard input. The visualization technique used was the scatterplot 3D, which was implemented using Jmathplot API, and the speech recognition in Brazilian Portuguese was performed by Coruja software. IVOrpheus was developed in Java following the architectural pattern MVC, design patterns and open technologies. In voice interaction, some usability guidelines have been set in interface building process, making it more intuitive and contributing to lower the user cognitive effort. In addition, initial usability tests with users were performed to evaluate the application interface with and without interaction by voice. The tasks with and without voice interaction have shown similar results of time and completeness. The speech recognizer achieved a word error rate of approximately 17%.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["2017"]}
