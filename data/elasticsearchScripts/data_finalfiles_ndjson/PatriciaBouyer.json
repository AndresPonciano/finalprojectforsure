{"title": "Forward analysis of updatable timed automata\n", "abstract": " Timed automata are a widely studied model. Its decidability has been proved using the so-called region automaton construction. This construction provides a correct abstraction for the behaviours of timed automata, but it suffers from a state explosion and is thus not used in practice. Instead, algorithms based on the notion of zones are implemented using adapted data structures like DBMs. When we focus on forward analysis algorithms, the exact computation of all the successors of the initial configurations does not always terminate. Thus, some abstractions are often used to ensure termination, among which, a widening operator on zones.               In this paper, we study in detail this widening operator and the corresponding forward analysis algorithm. This algorithm is most used and implemented in tools like KRONOS and UPPAAL.

In the context of discrete event systems this problem has been well-studied, but much less work has been done in the timed framework. In this paper, we consider the problem of diagnosing faults in behaviours of timed plants. We focus on the problem of synthesizing fault diagnosers which are realizable as deterministic timed automata, with the motivation that such diagnosers would function as efficient online fault detectors. We study two classes of such mechanisms, the class of deterministic timed automata (DTA) and the class of event-recording timed automata (ERA). We show that the problem of synthesizing diagnosers in each of these classes is decidable, provided we are given a bound on the resources available to the diagnoser.

Depending on the specification, optimal strategies might be simple or quite complex, for example having to use (possibly infinite) memory. Hence, research strives to understand which settings allow for simple strategies. In 2005, Gimbert and Zielonka provided a complete characterization of preference relations (a formal framework to model specifications and game objectives) that admit memoryless optimal strategies for both players. In the last fifteen years however, practical applications have driven the community toward games with complex or multiple objectives, where memory -- finite or infinite -- is almost always required. Despite much effort, the exact frontiers of the class of preference relations that admit finite-memory optimal strategies still elude us. In this work, we establish a complete characterization of preference relations that admit optimal strategies using arena-independent finite memory, generalizing the work of Gimbert and Zielonka to the finite-memory case. We also prove an equivalent to their celebrated corollary of great practical interest: if both players have optimal (arena-independent-)finite-memory strategies in all one-player games, then it is also the case in all two-player games. Finally, we pinpoint the boundaries of our results with regard to the literature: our work completely\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1635"]}
{"title": "When are stochastic transition systems tameable?\n", "abstract": " A decade ago, Abdulla, Ben Henda and Mayr introduced the elegant concept of decisiveness for denumerable Markov chains [1]. Roughly speaking, decisiveness allows one to lift most good properties from finite Markov chains to denumerable ones, and therefore to adapt existing verification algorithms to infinite-state models. Decisive Markov chains however do not encompass stochastic real-time systems, and general stochastic transition systems (STSs for short) are needed. In this article, we provide a framework to perform both the qualitative and the quantitative analysis of STSs. First, we define various notions of decisiveness (inherited from [1]), notions of fairness and of attractors for STSs, and make explicit the relationships between them. Then, we define a notion of abstraction, together with natural concepts of soundness and completeness, and we give general transfer properties, which will be central to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1635"]}

Their parameterized verification aims at proving a property holds for any number of nodes, under any communication topology, and on all possible executions. We focus on the coverability problem which dually asks whether there exists an execution that visits a configuration exhibiting some given state of the broadcast protocol. Coverability is known to be undecidable for static networks, i.e. when the number of nodes and communication topology is fixed along executions. In contrast, it is decidable in PTIME when the communication topology may change arbitrarily along executions, that is for reconfigurable networks. Surprisingly, no lower nor upper bounds on the minimal number of nodes, or the minimal length of covering execution in reconfigurable networks, appear in the literature. In this paper we show tight bounds for cutoff and length, which happen to be linear and quadratic, respectively, in the number of states of the protocol. We also introduce an intermediary model with static communication topology and non-deterministic message losses upon sending. We show that the same tight bounds apply to lossy networks, although, reconfigurable executions may be linearly more succinct than lossy executions. Finally, we show NP-completeness for the natural optimisation problem associated with the cutoff.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1635"]}

In this paper, we extend the concept of decisiveness to more general stochastic processes. This extension is non trivial as we consider stochastic processes with a potentially continuous set of states and uncountable branching (common features of real-time stochastic processes).

In this setting, an important question is the one of strategy complexity: what kinds of strategies are sufficient or required to play optimally (e.g., randomization or memory requirements)? Our contributions further the understanding of arena-independent finite-memory (AIFM) determinacy, i.e., the study of objectives for which memory is needed, but in a way that only depends on limited parameters of the game graphs. First, we show that objectives for which pure AIFM strategies suffice to play optimally also admit pure AIFM subgame perfect strategies. Second, we show that we can reduce the study of objectives for which pure AIFM strategies suffice in two-player stochastic games to the easier study of one-player stochastic games (i.e., Markov decision processes). Third, we characterize the sufficiency of AIFM strategies through two intuitive properties of objectives.

{"title": "Concurrent parameterized games\n", "abstract": " Traditional concurrent games on graphs involve a fixed number of players, who take decisions simultaneously, determining the next state of the game. In this paper, we introduce a parameterized variant of concurrent games on graphs, where the parameter is precisely the number of players. Parameterized concurrent games are described by finite graphs, in which the transitions bear regular languages to describe the possible move combinations that lead from one vertex to another. We consider the problem of determining whether the first player, say Eve, has a strategy to ensure a reachability objective against any strategy profile of her opponents as a coalition. In particular Eve's strategy should be independent of the number of opponents she actually has. Technically, this paper focuses on an a priori simpler setting where the languages labeling transitions only constrain the number of opponents (but not their precise action choices). These constraints are described as semilinear sets, finite unions of intervals, or intervals. We establish the precise complexities of the parameterized reachability game problem, ranging from PTIME-complete to PSPACE-complete, in a variety of situations depending on the contraints (semilinear predicates, unions of intervals, or intervals) and on the presence or not of non-determinism.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1635"]}

Said extension lets us define new functions on the set of nodes by means of a so-called partial fixpoint operator.

Classical models (finite automata, Petri nets, etc...) can not express such real-time constraints. Since their introduction by Rajeev Alur and David Dill in [AD90, AD94], timed automata are one of the most studied models for real-time systems: in those systems, quantitative properties of delays between events can easily be expressed. Numerous works have been devoted to the \u201ctheoretical\u201d comprehension of timed automata: determinization [AFH94], minimization [ACD+92], power of clocks [ACH94, HKWT95], power of \u03b5-transitions [BDGP98], extensions of the model [DZ98, HRS98, CG00, BFH+01], logical characterizations [Wil94, HRS98], etc... have in particular been investigated. Practical aspects of the model have also been considered and several model-checkers are now available (HYTECH [HHWT97], KRO-NOS [DOTY96], UPPAAL [LPY97]). These model-checkers have been used to verify many industrial case studies (see the web pages of the tools, given page 23).One of the major properties of timed automata is probably that reachability properties are decidable [AD94], though timed automata have an infinite number of configurations. The core of this result is the construction of the so-called region automaton, which finitely abstract behaviours of timed automata in such a way that checking reachability in a timed automaton reduces to checking reachability in a (somewhat larger) finite automaton.

We introduce a class of concurrent games that are determined in a much stronger sense, and in a way, it is the larger class with this property. To this end, we introduce the notion of \\emph{local interaction} at a state of a graph game: it is a \\emph{game form} whose outcomes (i.e. a table whose entries) are the next states, which depend on the concurrent actions of the players. By definition, a game form is \\emph{determined} iff it always yields games that are determined via deterministic strategies when used as a local interaction in a Nature-free, one-shot reachability game. We show that if all the local interactions of a graph game with Borel objective are determined game forms, the game itself is determined: if Nature does not play, one player has a winning strategy; if Nature plays, both players have deterministic strategies that maximize the probability to win. This constitutes a clear-cut separation: either a game form behaves poorly already when used alone with basic objectives, or it behaves well even when used together with other well-behaved game forms and complex objectives. Existing results for positional and finite-memory determinacy in turn-based games are extended this way to concurrent games with determined local interactions (CG-DLI).", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1635"]}

But this theoretical result does not support a natural implementation, which is not surprising since, even for classical timed automata, the region automaton algorithm is not the algorithm used in tools like UPPAAL or KRONOS.
