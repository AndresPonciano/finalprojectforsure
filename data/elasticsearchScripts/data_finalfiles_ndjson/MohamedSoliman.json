In another embodiment of the present invention, the fracture volume, leak-off volume and efficiency are determined by integrating the fracture closure rate over time, and then iterating with a fluid volume equation. Still another embodiment of the present invention determines the fracture volume, leak-off volume and efficiency by extrapolating the apparent system volume back to the moment when injection is stopped.", "num_citations": "34\n", "authors": ["1040"]}
{"title": "Analysis of fracturing Pressure data in heterogeneous shale formations\n", "abstract": " Existing techniques for the interpretation of real-time fracturing data assumes that fracture propagation is a continuous power function of time, and that fractures propagate smoothly over time. This assumption implies that the formation is homogeneous. However, this assumption is not always accurate, as heterogeneities such as natural fractures exist, especially in shale. The presence of natural fractures is a vital factor in the productivity of shale oil and gas formations. When a hydraulic fracture intercepts a natural fracture, we believe one of two situations may take place depending on stress field, net pressure, orientation and the type of natural fracture: \u2022  The hydraulic fracture may cross the natural fracture and essentially continue to propagate, thus a smooth fracture propagation would be reflected in the real-time pressure data. \u2022  The natural fracture may dilate, allowing the fracturing fluid to enter the natural fracture. In this case, the propagation of the hydraulic fracture will cease in favor of the dilation of the natural fracture. Once the natural fracture is sufficiently dilated, the hydraulic fracture will resume propagation from the tip of the natural fracture(s). This paper presents a new real-time analysis technique of fracture propagation data that accounts for this intermittent hydraulic propagation in shale formations. This technique is an expansion of the existing technique originally developed by Nolte and Smith (1981). A few examples from shale formations are also presented, in which a horizontal well was fractured using a multi-stage fracturing technique. The analyzed data clearly shows the opening and dilation of the natural fractures", "num_citations": "33\n", "authors": ["1040"]}
{"title": "Improving hydraulic fracturing of shale formations by acidizing\n", "abstract": " Acidizing as a stimulation technique does not always yield the desired sustainable conductivity especially compared to hydraulic fracturing. In addition to that, hydraulic fracturing provides a great contact with shale formations due to its deeper developed conductivity that is sustained by the existence of proppant. However, hydraulic fracture conductivity declines because of a variety of reasons: increasing effective stress, proppant fatigue due to stress cycling, and digenesis. Here, we studied the potential of combining the benefits of propped hydraulic fracturing and acidizing by introducing low concentrations of acid slugs in the hydraulic fracture treatment of shale formations. The acid slugs intended to improve the micro-fracture conductivity deep in the formation and near the wellbore.

It is used for designing well and fracture placements. The current industry trend is to place wells in a uniform manner and to also place the fractures in an equally spaced distribution along the wellbore.A new Fracturability Index based on geomechanical principles has been developed to optimize the placement of fractures along horizontal and deviated wells in unconventional reservoirs. A developed algorithm based on the index prioritizes the brittle and high in-situ stress zones along the well path, then suggests the order of possible fracture locations for future resource development in a single or multiple wells.

In these cases, the success of the conformance treatment has been totally dependent upon an accurate description of the reservoir. Obviously, without a proper determination of the reservoir conditions, the underlying reasons for the water and/or gas problems cannot be assessed, and the most appropriate treatment cannot be applied. It has now been shown that a conformance treatment can be even more effective if it is applied early in the life of the reservoir. In other words, a preventive or a proactive conformance treatment may be more successful and less costly to apply than a reactive treatment if analysis determines that the reservoir conditions are such that water and gas production are likely to occur as the field matures.", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["1040"]}

Converting real time and space solution to Laplace space is often done in the petroleum industry and provides the vehicle to develop numerous new solutions.

Typically, a Laplace space equation can be manipulated by use of simple algebra to accomplish other desired ends, such as incorporating additional transformed equations to solve other aspects of the engineering problem. Once the transformed equation is complete, it is then necessary to convert to real time and space. This conversion is accomplished analytically by what is referred to as inverting the Laplace transform with sets of formulas and relationships between real and transformed space and time. In many cases, this inversion is not easy or cannot be done by conventional analytic means. In those situation, an engineer requires a program that numerically inverts the transform.

Infill wells are horizontal wells that are commonly drilled parallel to current producing (legacy) wells to ensure production from intact parts of the unconventional reservoirs. Production from legacy wells reduces the magnitude and changes the direction of the principal stresses in the depleted zone because of the poroelastic relationship between pore pressure and stress. The local stress redistribution has a significant impact on the topology of the hydraulic fracture that is created in infill wells. As a result of this redistribution, the child fracture asymmetrically propagates toward the depleted side of the infill well and might intersect the pre-existing hydraulic fractures or the legacy well.

Pore pressure depletion in the vicinity of old fractures directly affects the state of stress and eventually the propagation of newly created hydraulic fractures. Thus, a poroelastic analysis is required to identify guidelines for the refracturing process, in particular to understand the extension of the pore pressure depletion, and eventually, the orientation of new as well as old fractures.

In recent years, fracture geometry and its effect on well spacing design have become an integral part of shale oil and shale gas field development. In North America, operators have been reducing the well spacing down to 40 acres or less to exploit the challenging onshore assets. This translates to only 350 ft. well spacing. Under these conditions, production interference between closely placed fractures influences the total production and reservoir economics. Thus, understanding fracture propagation and the possible risk of fracture interference is vital to design of a multi-stage multi-well pad.In this study, fracture propagation from adjacent wells is investigated. Propagation is modeled in a dynamic fashion using a newly developed numerical model that considers the variation of the mechanical properties of the formation. The developed numerical model is based on a displacement discontinuity approach and is capable of simulating multiple fractures that may re-orient in space based on changing stress shadowing. The model was calibrated against laboratory experiments. The match against laboratory experiments where fracture propagated from inclined perforations was excellent. In such cases the fracture will reorient its path to eventually become perpendicular to the minimum principal stress. The results also show that the developed numerical model is capable to, at least qualitatively, simulate natural phenomena such as fractures tending to move towards one another.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1040"]}

On the other hand, if many of the above items are neglected, one worries about the validity of recovery predictions made from such a model. It appeared that the solution to this dilemma was to attempt to correlate field results.

First, it develops a method that uses the Composite Layering Effect (CLE) Equation to predict the behavior of potential fractures in conventional and unconventional reservoirs from core samples. The second goal of this study is to determine how different mineralogical and elemental components affect the behavior of fractures predicted using the CLE equation. After the samples are fractured, X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD) and X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) techniques are executed to measure the mineralogical and elemental compositions of the core samples respectively. In this method, core samples are first obtained from the formation. Next, X-Ray Computed Tomography (CT) is used to determine if core samples have preexisting fractures. The samples are then fractured slightly using Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS), in which a compressive-strength machine initiates fractures by applying uniaxial load and stopping automatically upon reaching a predetermined load. CT then confirms the existence of the new fractures, and Image J interprets the height\u2013length ratio of each fracture. These results are used in calculating the CLE. The results of these experiments revealed the relationship between the mineral and elemental compositions of the rocks and the crack dimensions. It was seen that the presence of quartz and clay minerals had the strongest influence on the CLE value due to the brittle behavior of the quartz and ductile behavior of the clay minerals (nacrite).

On the other hand, if the production period was more than 50 days, then it will operate for shorter periods after recovered from workover operation. In this case, well needs to start another cycle of steam injection instead of continuing production since sand production (especially for long production periods) is an essential indicator for the next steam cycle timing.

Fracture propagation and closure in a pressure sensitive material is important to many engineering disciplines, including the structural, geotechnical, mining, and petroleum industries. Central to these studies has been the use of sophisticated material models. One of these material models, referred to as the Extended-Sandler-Rubin (ESR) cap model, includes a non-linear shear failure surface and a second yield surface (cap) to account for inelastic compaction at stress state lower than those required to induce shear failure.In numerical analysis schemes involving inelastic rock behavior, loads are applied incrementally.

Among these, steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) is widely used, and surface mining is considered the best approach in very shallow depths. However, deposits exist that are too shallow for SAGD but too deep for mining, requiring special techniques to recover the hydrocarbon economically. In addition, significant reserves are left behind as stranded reserves, as well as reserves that are usually characterized with weak caprock integrity and without enough pay thickness for SAGD to be economically viable. This paper focuses on a new technology that involves creating several mechanically induced inclusions in a single well. The production process is similar to a single-well SAGD.

Shale plays are the new frontier for drilling and development. When the oil price was high, it was economical to drill and produce from shale formation. Now that the price of oil is relatively low, drilling and producing from shale formation might not be that lucrative.

{"title": "Sequencing and Determination of Horizontal Wells and Fractures in Shale Plays: Building a Combined Targeted Treatment Scheme\n", "abstract": " This paper introduces a new design and validation of a new integrated combined Fracturability index correlation. Ultra-low formation permeability has dictated the creation of a large number of fractures from a single horizontal well. It is not uncommon to design a horizontal well with more than one hundred hydraulic fractures transversely intersecting the horizontal well. The large number of fractures is driven by the short exploitation distance resulting from the nano-darcy formation. Fracturing horizontal wells results in creating of a larger volume of improved reservoir quality. The term SRV is used to describe this improved volume. Mayerhofer et al. discussed the concept of SRV in a recent publication. Methods to manipulate fracturing sequence to enhance fracture complexity and consequently enlarge and enhance the stimulated reservoir volume have been developed by several authors (East et al 2010). Discussion on the background is found in papers by Soliman, et al.(2008), Soliman et al.(2010), and Roussel and Sharma (2011).

{"title": "Potential of Combining Propane (LPG) Hydraulic Fracturing and Chemical Flooding in Thin Heavy-Oil Reservoirs\n", "abstract": " Waterflooding in a viscous heavy-oil reservoir results in a very poor sweep efficiency because of an unfavorable mobility ratio. However, thickened waterflooding by polymer or gel might not be economic because of high concentrations of chemicals that must be added to achieve a favorable mobility ratio. Moreover, it is understood that thermal recovery cannot be used in thin heavy-oil reservoirs because of major heat loss to overburdened and underburned formations. In cases where an oil reservoir is under permafrost, thermal recovery methods might not be applicable because the injected heat could possibly cause permafrost to thaw. In this paper, it is proposed to inject chemicals (alkaline/surfactant) into a producer immediately after hydraulic fracturing with liquefied propane gas (LPG).

Often such jumps to resonance, are purely deterministic in that there is always restabilization onto the large amplitude attractor which lies on the resonant branch of the response curve.
