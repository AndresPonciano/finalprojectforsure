{"title": "Optimal search engine marketing strategy\n", "abstract": " Buyers using search engines to look for information tend to trust and follow links displayed in the editorial section of the search-results page. Most on-line sellers, however, do not invest in search engine optimization (SEO) to get higher search-results rankings for their listings, but instead prefer paid placements. They explain that SEO is more expensive than paid placements, produces results that do not justify its cost, and does not consistently lead to high search-results rankings. This implies that sellers would invest in SEO if it were less expensive and its rankings were more consistent. However, even if SEO and paid placement cost the same, and SEO always produced high rankings, paid placement would still be the search engine marketing (SEM) strategy of choice for most on-line sellers. Interestingly, no optimal SEM strategy includes SEO. These findings are especially significant for advertising professionals\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "261\n", "authors": ["917"]}

We find that restrictive OSS licenses have an adverse impact on OSS success. On further analysis, restrictive OSS license is found to be negatively associated with developer interest, but is positively associated with the interest of non-developer users and project administrators. We also show that developer and non-developer interest in the OSS project and the project activity levels in any time period significantly affect the project success measures in subsequent time period.

{"title": "A strategic analysis of competition between open source and proprietary software\n", "abstract": " This paper analyzes a software market consisting of a freely available open source software (OSS), the commercial version of this OSS (OSS-SS), and the competing commercial proprietary software (PS). We find that in software markets characterized by low direct network benefits, the PS vendor is better off in the presence of competition from OSS-SS. Furthermore, the OSS-SS vendor in these markets is better off by having lower usability than PS. Therefore, the PS vendor has little incentive to improve the usability of their software in these markets. On the other hand, in software markets characterized by high network benefits, a PS vendor is threatened by the presence of OSS-SS and can survive only if the PS is more usable than the competing OSS-SS.", "num_citations": "130\n", "authors": ["917"]}
{"title": "Impact of web-based e-commerce on channel strategy in retailing\n", "abstract": " Web-based channels are fast becoming an integral part of the channel strategy of traditional off-line retailers. This paper uses a game-theoretic approach to study the impact of Web-based e-commerce on retailers' choices of distribution channel strategies. At present most firms adopt a multi-channel strategy that includes both Web-based channels and pre-existing off-line channels. The analysis identifies this trend as an equilibrium of the game resulting from competitive pressure by other retailers, but shows that it is not the only possible short-run outcome. Other possible outcomes are: all sellers continue to sell via traditional off-line channels; some sellers adopt a coordinated dual-channel strategy (i.e., both on-line and off-line) when faced with competition from Web-based entrants; off-line sellers continue to sell via off-line channels when faced with purely on-line competition.

Despite the importance of the license type and developers to OSS projects, there is little understanding in open source literature of the license choice from a developer's perspective. The results from our empirical study of OSS developers reveal that the intrinsic motivation of challenge (problem solving) is associated with the developers' preference for licenses with moderate restrictions, while the extrinsic motivation of status (through peer recognition) is associated with developers' preference for licenses with least restrictions. We also find that when choosing an OSS license, a developer's attitude toward the software redistribution rights conflicts with his or her attitude toward preserving the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "117\n", "authors": ["917"]}
{"title": "Buyers' choice of online search strategy and its managerial implications\n", "abstract": " The Internet offers several tools such as shopping bots and search engines that help potential buyers search for lower prices. This paper defines buyers' online search strategy as using one or more of these tools to search for lower prices, and empirically investigates the validity of economics of information search theory in explaining buyers' choice of a particular online search strategy. We find that buyers' attitudes toward the price offered by their preferred online seller, their perception of online price dispersion, and their awareness of shopping agents have a significant effect on their choice of online search strategy. An understanding of buyers' choice of online search strategies can help an online seller to estimate its expected probability of making an online sale, optimize its online pricing, and improve its online promotional and advertising activities.", "num_citations": "83\n", "authors": ["917"]}

One important issue concerns the measures of OSS project success and its determinants. In this paper, we empirically study the determinants of OSS success as measured by the number of subscribers and developers working on an OSS project. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our model forecasts these success measures more accurately as compared to a naive model.We find that OSS projects that develop software to work on Windows/UNIX/Linux operating systems, and developed using C or its derivative languages experience larger increase in subscribers and attract more developers than projects that do not have these characteristics. OSS projects with semi-restrictive licenses have fewer subscribers and attract fewer developers.

{"title": "Revisit the Debate on Intermediation, Disintermediation and Reintermediation due to E-commerce\n", "abstract": " The existing literature opposing disintermediation adopts a very realistic but broad definition of intermediary functions, making the outcome of their arguments obvious, i.e. intermediation will always exist in one form or another. Supporters of disintermediation take a more focused definition of an intermediary, i.e. an economic player that buys from the seller and sells to the buyer and reduces their transaction costs of trading by doing so. It is difficult to reconcile the debate from these opposite ends because of the lack of a common definition of intermediaries. In this paper we have used the definition adopted by supporters of disintermediation to show that disintermediation due to web-based e-commerce is never a possibility.

{"title": "Pricing paid placements on search engines.\n", "abstract": " The objective of this research is to identify the optimal pricing strategy for paid placements on search engines\u2019\u201csearch-results\u201d listings. To accomplish this we develop a mathematical model incorporating a constellation of parameters that describe buyers\u2019 online search intensity, competition among online sellers, and co-opetition between the online sellers and search engine. This model allows us to analyze three pricing strategies, namely pay-perpurchase (PPP), pay-per-click (PPC), and flat-fee (FF), for paid placement services. The paper then compares these pricing strategies in terms of their revenue potential for a search engine and identifies conditions when one pricing strategy is preferred over the other. Our analysis shows that PPC, the most popular pricing strategy, is not the optimal strategy to use when the proportion of buyers, who search online and end up buying online, is high. Instead the search engines would be better off by using PPP strategy. Another finding is that it is not always optimal to price paid-placements in proportion to their rank in the search results\u2019 listings. For instance, our analysis shows that when the proportion of buyers with low search intensity is high and a search engine is following a PPC pricing strategy, then it is better off charging a higher price for a lower-ranked listing.", "num_citations": "40\n", "authors": ["917"]}

In this paper, we model the relationship between an OSS developer's utility, the effort that goes into developing an OSS, his attitude towards the freedom to choose an OSS license, and the choice of OSS license. We find that the larger the effort to develop OSS, the more is the likelihood that the OSS license would be free from restrictions. Interestingly, the result holds even when all OSS developers prefer restrictive licenses or less-restrictive license. The results suggest that least-restrictive or non-copyleft license will dominate other types of OSS license when a large effort is required to develop derivative software. On the other hand, most-restrictive or strong-copyleft licenses will be the dominant license when minimal effort is required to develop the original OSS\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "39\n", "authors": ["917"]}

Two major limitations of the existing work are the focus on a single economic measure (ie, transaction cost minimization) and the examination of channel-structure decisions from only a single perspective (the seller\u2019s). This paper introduces transactional value theory in the context of channel-structure research and integrates it with transaction cost theory to generate a trade value framework. The trade value framework considers channel-structure decisions from the perspectives of both buyers and sellers and is used to analyze the impact of web-based e-commerce on intermediated channel-structures. The proposed framework suggests that intermediaries function best in a channel-structure if they can reduce trade-inhibiting factors and improve trade-enhancing factors\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["917"]}

Immediate disclosure (before a patch becomes available) could result in exploits with subsequent harm to installed systems. Therefore, it is important to understand the determinants of this timing. In this study, we investigate the impacts of (i) the perception of the vulnerability discoverer about the software producer, (ii) the type of vulnerable software, and (iii) the severity of the vulnerability, on a vulnerability discoverer's choice of disclosure timing. We collect data from three different sources and control for the vulnerability discoverer's motivations and beliefs. Our results indicate that those who perceive a software producer to be timely in its patch release, reward it by delaying the disclosure.

{"title": "Application of survival model to understand open source software release\n", "abstract": " One of the recurrent themes in open source software research is to understand the impacts of various project characteristics on its success. Open source software (OSS) projects rely on voluntary participation of developers and tend to be continually in development. Hence, an important measure of success is the time it takes for an OSS project to release a stable version to its users. However, there is little research on this success measure and how the OSS characteristics enable or delay the progress towards stable release. In this study, we use survival analysis technique on open source project data to explore the impacts of OSS characteristics on the time it takes to release stable software versions. We find that when compared to the interest of developers in the project, interest of end-users has a greater positive effect on an OSS project progress towards stable release. Our findings also suggest that the use of C and C-like programming languages or a Weak-Copyleft license for the open source project negatively impact the project\u2019s time to reach stable status. In OSS projects less than 8 months since becoming public, the use of a Strong-Copyleft license positively affects the project\u2019s progress. One of the implications of our findings is that OSS project administrators should control software change requests or form smaller developer groups to better control the delays due to higher developer interest in their projects.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["917"]}

{"title": "A qualitative analysis of the role of users, vendors, and governments in the standards development process\n", "abstract": " Existing literature on IT standards focuses on the role of technical factors such as network effects and competitive behavior on the creation of standards. However, the role of users and vendors in initiating the standards definition and ratification process is less well understood. Given the advantages associated with standards, all users and vendors of IT products would be expected to be glad to participate in the standards definition and ratification process. However, if that were the case, many fewer proprietary technologies would compete. This paper explains qualitatively why users, vendors, and government bodies choose (or don't choose) to participate in the standards definition and ratification process. A better understanding of their motivations for participating or not in the process should help to attract more participants to the process. The paper concludes by analyzing strategies to recover the cost of standards definition and ratification process, and their impact on the standards adoption rate.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["917"]}
