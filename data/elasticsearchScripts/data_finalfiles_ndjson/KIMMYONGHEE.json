{"title": "On the levy-walk nature of human mobility\n", "abstract": " We report that human walk patterns contain statistically similar features observed in Levy walks. These features include heavy-tail flight and pause-time distributions and the super-diffusive nature of mobility. Human walks are not random walks, but it is surprising that the patterns of human walks and Levy walks contain some statistical similarity. Our study is based on 226 daily GPS traces collected from 101 volunteers in five different outdoor sites. The heavy-tail flight distribution of human mobility induces the super-diffusivity of travel, but up to 30 min to 1 h due to the boundary effect of people's daily movement, which is caused by the tendency of people to move within a predefined (also confined) area of daily activities. These tendencies are not captured in common mobility models such as random way point (RWP). To evaluate the impact of these tendencies on the performance of mobile networks, we construct a\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1494\n", "authors": ["4"]}

{"title": "Slaw: A new mobility model for human walks\n", "abstract": " Simulating human mobility is important in mobile networks because many mobile devices are either attached to or controlled by humans and it is very hard to deploy real mobile networks whose size is controllably scalable for performance evaluation. Lately various measurement studies of human walk traces have discovered several significant statistical patterns of human mobility. Namely these include truncated power-law distributions of flights, pause-times and inter-contact times, fractal way-points, and heterogeneously defined areas of individual mobility. Unfortunately, none of existing mobility models effectively captures all of these features. This paper presents a new mobility model called SLAW (self-similar least action walk) that can produce synthetic walk traces containing all these features. This is by far the first such model.

This paper reports two additional such features: a) The destinations of people (or we say waypoints) are dispersed in a self-similar manner; and b) people are more likely to choose a destination closer to its current waypoint. These features are known to be influential to the performance of human-assisted mobility networks.

{"title": "Adenosine nucleotide biosynthesis and AMPK regulate adult life span and mediate the longevity benefit of caloric restriction in flies\n", "abstract": " A common thread among conserved life span regulators lies within intertwined roles in metabolism and energy homeostasis. We show that heterozygous mutations of AMP biosynthetic enzymes extend Drosophila life span.

Transgenic expression of AMPK in adult fat body or adult muscle, key metabolic tissues, extended life span, while AMPK RNAi reduced life span.

We have recently shown that concomitant intracellular signaling from both the P2TAC and P2Y1 receptors is essential for ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Previous studies have tested whether ADP causes a decrease in the basal cAMP level and this reduction promotes platelet aggregation, but did not study the effect of decreased cAMP levels when the Gq pathway is selectively activated. Since we are now aware that platelet aggregation requires activation of two receptors, we investigated whether the function of P2TAC receptor activation, leading to inhibition of platelet adenylyl cyclase, could be replaced by direct inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, when Gq pathway is also activated, a possibility that has not been addressed to\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "151\n", "authors": ["4"]}

After molar evacuation, four patients from the treated group (10.3%) and ten patients from the untreated group (31.3%) developed persistent trophoblastic disease. The time interval from evacuation of the mole to diagnosis of persistent trophoblastic disease was longer in the treated group than in the untreated group (9.5+/-2.4 weeks versus 5.1+/-1.6 weeks, P less than. 05). Among high-risk patients, there was a lower incidence of persistent trophoblastic disease in the treated group than in the untreated group (14.3 versus 47.4%, P less than. 05). Among low-risk patients there was no difference between the groups (5.6 versus 7.7%, P greater than. 05).

More courses of chemotherapy were required until complete remission in the treated group than in the untreated group (2.5+/-0.5 versus 1.4+/-0.5, P less than. 005). These findings suggest that even though chemoprophylaxis reduces the incidence of persistent trophoblastic disease in patients at high risk, it increases tumor resistance and morbidity.

The mechanism of transcriptional silencing has been explained on the basis of either an indirect model, in which densely methylated DNA is recognized by proteins that may displace crucial transcription factors, or a direct model, in which binding of a single transcription protein is prevented by the presence of a methylated CpG dinucleotide localized in a sensitive region of a DNA motif. In this study, we have determined that methylation of the core CpG dinucleotide located within the NF-kappa B repeated motifs of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat can inhibit the binding of the NF-kappa B protein complex from crude nuclear extracts or from purified bovine spleen and specifically inhibit the binding of recombinant p50 protein.

{"title": "DASC: Dense adaptive self-correlation descriptor for multi-modal and multi-spectral correspondence\n", "abstract": " Establishing dense visual correspondence between multiple images is a fundamental task in many applications of computer vision and computational photography. Classical approaches, which aim to estimate dense stereo and optical flow fields for images adjacent in viewpoint or in time, have been dramatically advanced in recent studies. However, finding reliable visual correspondence in multi-modal or multi-spectral images still remains unsolved. In this paper, we propose a new dense matching descriptor, called dense adaptive self-correlation (DASC), to effectively address this kind of matching scenarios. Based on the observation that a self-similarity existing within images is less sensitive to modality variations, we define a novel descriptor with a series of an adaptive self-correlation similarity for patches within a local support window. To further improve the matching quality and runtime efficiency, we propose a patch-wise receptive field pooling, in which a sampling pattern is optimized with a discriminative learning. Moreover, the computational redundancy that arises when computing densely sampled descriptor over an entire image is dramatically reduced by applying fast edge-aware filtering. Experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of the DASC descriptor in many cases of multi-modal and multi-spectral correspondence.", "num_citations": "82\n", "authors": ["4"]}

PCR was used for specific detection of Trichomonas vaginalis by primers based on the repetitive sequence cloned from T. vaginalis (TV-E650). Between June 1996 and August 1997, 426 patients visited the department of obstetrics and gynecology, Hanyang University Kuri Hospital and were examined for trichomoniasis using wet mount examination, Papanicolaou (Pap) smear, culture and PCR. One hundred and seventy-seven patients (group A) visited with the symptoms of vaginal discharge and 249 patients (group B) visited for regular cervical Pap smear with no vaginal symptoms. From group A (n= 177), 3 infections (2.0%) were detected by wet mount, 6 infections (3.3%) by Pap smear and culture, and 17 infections (10.4%) by PCR. From group B (n= 249), 4 patients (1.6%) were found to have T. vaginalis by culture and 6 infections (2.4%) were detected by PCR. Therefore, in both groups, PCR for T. vaginalis showed a higher detection rate compared with conventional wet mount, Pap smear or culture. The detection by PCR was specific for T. vaginalis since no amplification was detected with DNAs from other protozoa and Candida albicans. The sensitivity and specificity of PCR were 100%. This method could detect T. vaginalis in vaginal discharge at a concentration as low as 1 cell per PCR mixture.

However, the COX-2 effects have been demonstrated indirectly by the use of a selective inhibitor, NS-398, and the molecular mechanisms by which COX-2 inhibits apoptosis have not been identified. In the present study, we demonstrated that COX-2 inhibits genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis by using an adenoviral COX-2 overexpression system. In addition, we found that COX-2 regulates the transcription function of p53 as evidenced by suppression of p53 target gene induction by COX-2 cotransfection. Furthermore, COX-2 interacted with p53 in vitro and in vivo, which was inhibited by the treatment with NS-398.

The discovery of\" gastric mucosal barrier\" or\" the presence of defense system\" might be the answers to these questions. The first level of gastric mucosal barrier consists of the factors secreted into the lumen including bicarbonates, mucus, immunoglobulins, other antibacterial substances including lactoferrin, and surface active phospholipids. The second level of defense system is the gastric epithelia, which are remarkably resistant to acids or irritants and forms relatively tight barrier to passive diffusion. In addition, the epithelium is capable of undergoing extremely rapid repair and restitution if its continuity is disrupted. The third level of gastric mucosal barrier is the mucosal microcirculation in concert with sensory afferent nerves within the mucosa and submucosa. Back diffusion of acid or toxin into the mucosa results in neural system-mediated elevations of calcitonin gene related peptide, which contribute to enhancing mucosal blood flows that are very critical for limiting damage and facilitating repair.

However, it is difficult to find cracks by a visual check for the extremely large structures. So, the development of crack detecting systems has been a significant issue. Final objective of this research is to develop an automatic crack detection system that can analyze the concrete surface and visualize the cracks efficiently. The algorithm is composed of two parts; image processing and image classification. In the first step, cracks are distinguished from background image easily using the filtering, the improved subtraction method, and the morphological operation. The particular data such as the number of pixel and the ratio of the major axis to minor axis for connected pixels area are also extracted. In the second step, the existence of cracks are identified.

To cause apoptotic cell death, mNPCs were pretreated with astaxanthin for 8 h and followed by treatment of 0.3 mM . Pretreatment of mNPCs with astaxanthin significantly inhibited -mediated apoptosis and induced cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. In Western blot analysis, astaxanthin-pretreated cells showed the activation of p-Akt, p-MEK, p-ERK, and Bcl-2, and the reduction of p-P38, p-SAPK/JNK, Bax, p-GSK3b, cytochrome c, caspase-3, and PARP. Because  triggers caspases activation, this study examined whether astaxanthin can inhibit caspases activation in -treated mNPCs. After  treatment, caspases activities were prominently increased, but astaxanthin pretreatment significantly inhibited -mediated caspases activation. Astaxanthin pretreatment also significantly recovered the ATP production ability of -treated cells. These findings indicate that astaxanthin inhibits -mediated apoptotic features in mNPCs.

In the present study, we report that the FeoA protein interacts with the FeoB Fe(II) transporter, which is required for FeoB-mediated Fe(II) uptake in Salmonella enterica. Iron uptake assay revealed that in the absence of FeoA, FeoB import of Fe(II) is impaired. Bacterial two-hybrid assay determined that the FeoA protein directly and specifically binds to the FeoB transporter in vivo. This FeoA-FeoB interaction appeared necessary for FeoB-mediated Fe(II) uptake because Salmonella expressing the mutant FeoA that cannot interact with FeoB failed to uptake Fe(II) via the FeoB transporter.

As humans are often carriers of mobile communication devices, studying the patterns of human mobility is an essential tool to understand the performance of DTN protocols. From measurement studies of human contact behaviors, we find that their distributions closely resemble a form of power-law distributions called truncated Pareto. Human walk traces has a dichotomy distribution pattern of ICT; it has a power-law tendency up to some time, and decays exponentially after that time. Truncated Pareto distributions offer a simple yet cohesive mathematical model to express this dichotomy in the measured data.

Using gastric cancer cell lines, we performed functional and target gene analyses. miRNA-135a expression was down-regulated in 33.9% of patients. These patients showed a significantly more advanced stage (TNM stage\u0393\u00eb\u00d1IB, 35.0% vs. 12.8%, p = 0.045) and higher rate of LN metastasis (30.0% vs. 5.1%, p = 0.014) than those with up-regulation of miRNA-135a expression.

The present study aimed to evaluate the correlation between PRS and changes in pain determined by the visual analogue scale (VAS) and numerical rating scale (NRS), to confirm the evidence supporting the use of PRS. Sixty patients with chronic spinal pain that had a VAS and NRS recorded during an initial examination were enrolled in the study. One week later, the patients received an epidural nerve block, then VAS, NRS, and PRS assessments were performed. Differences between VAS and NRS were compared to the PRS and scatter plots and correlation coefficient were generated. The differences and magnitude of decrease in the VAS and NRS raw data were converted to percentile values, and compared to the PRS. Both VAS and NRS values exhibited strong correlations (> 0.8) with PRS. Further, the differences between the VAS-PRS R (0.859) and NRS-PRS R (0.915) were statistically significant,(P= 0.0259). Compared to PRS, the VAS and NRS percentile scores exhibited higher correlation coefficients than scores based on the raw data differences. Furthermore, even when converted to a percentile, the NRS%-PRS R (0.968) was higher than the VAS%-PRS R (0.904), P= 0.0001. The results indicated that using the PRS together with NRS in pain assessment increased the objectivity of the assessment compared to using only VAS or NRS, and may have offset the limitations of VAS or NRS alone.", "num_citations": "65\n", "authors": ["4"]}

In the presence of shikonin, inactivation of Akt caused apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) dephosphorylation at Ser83, which is associated with ASK1 activation. Shikonin-induced apoptosis was enhanced by inhibition of Akt, whereas overexpression of constitutively active Akt prevented apoptosis through modulating ASK1 phosphorylation.

{"title": "Investigation on health effects of an abandoned metal mine\n", "abstract": " To investigate potential health risks associated with exposure to metals from an abandoned metal mine, the authors studied people living near an abandoned mine (n= 102) and control groups (n= 149). Levels of cadmium, copper, arsenic, lead, and zinc were measured in the air, soil, drinking water, and agricultural products. To assess individual exposure, biomarkers of each metal in blood and urine were measured. \u256c\u2593 2-microglobulin, \u256c\u2592 1-microglobulin, and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase and bone mineral density were measured. Surface soil in the study area showed 2-10 times higher levels of metals compared to that of the control area. Metal concentrations in the groundwater and air did not show any notable differences between groups. Mean concentrations of cadmium and copper in rice and barley from the study area were significantly higher than those of the control area (p< 0.05). Geometric means of blood and urine cadmium in the study area were 2.9 \u252c\u2561g/L and 1.5 \u252c\u2561g/g Cr, respectively, significantly higher than those in the control area (p< 0.05). There were no differences in the levels of urinary markers of early kidney dysfunction and bone mineral density. The authors conclude that the residents near the abandoned mine were exposed to higher levels of metals through various routes.", "num_citations": "63\n", "authors": ["4"]}

{"title": "A fiber-optic cocaine biosensor\n", "abstract": " A fiber-optic biosensor was developed for detection of cocaine, its metabolites, and other coca alkaloids, using a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against a derivatized benzoylecgonine (BE). The mAb was immobilized noncovalently on quartz fibers and a flow fluorometer was used to detect changes in evanescent wave fluorescence. A fluorescein (FL) conjugate of BE bound to the mAb specifically in a saturable manner and with high affinity (Kd = 7.6 nM). Cocaine or other test compounds competed with FL-BE for binding to the mAb in a concentration-dependent manner, thereby reducing the initial rate or steady-state fluorescence. Addition of cocaine to the flow buffer after reaching steady-state fluorescence enhanced the dissociation of bound FL-BE, and cocaine removal allowed fiber regeneration for multiple measurements. The detection limits for cocaine, cocaethylene, norcocaine, and BE were 5, 5, 29, and 30 ng\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "62\n", "authors": ["4"]}

The expression of Treg surface markers including CTLA-4, CCR4, CXCR4, and glucocorticoid-induced TNFR was significantly suppressed upon methyl gallate treatment. Furthermore, forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) expression was also significantly decreased by methyl gallate, suggesting that the suppressive effects of methyl gallate on Treg were medicated by decrease of Treg-specific transcription factor Foxp3.

Thus, novel agents that can downregulate CXCR4 expression have therapeutic potential in repressing cancer metastasis. Among ED and its derivatives, it is found that ED downregulated the expression of both CXCR4 and HER2 without affecting cell viability in tumor cells.

{"title": "Mechanistic evidence and efficiency of the Cr (VI) reduction in water by different sources of zerovalent irons\n", "abstract": " The objective of this research was to assess the mechanism and effectiveness of the zerovalent iron (ZVI) to remediate the Cr(VI) contaminated water. The mechanism of Cr(VI) reduction by ZVI was evaluated by characterising surface properties and chemical compositions of Fe and Cr products using SEM-EDS, XRD and XPS analyses. The effectiveness of ZVI in Cr(VI) reduction was assessed by the luminescent bacteria (Photobacterium Phosphoreum). The Cr(VI) was reduced to Cr(III), when the reactive Fe0 was oxidised to Fe(II,III), showing the presence of Fe2O3, (Fe-Cr)2O3 and FeOOH.

We investigated the role of MMPs in neurological worsening of acute lacunar infarction. Forty-nine consecutive patients with an acute lacunar infarction (as defined by clinical and MRI criteria within 48 h after stroke onset) were evaluated. Clinical, biochemical, rheological, inflammatory and other parameters were compared between progressive and nonprogressive groups. Among the variables, only inflammatory parameters, including MMP-9 and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, were associated with neurological worsening of acute lacunar infarction (p < 0.05). These results suggest that the inflammatory process could play an important role in early neurological worsening of acute lacunar\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "57\n", "authors": ["4"]}

The deoxyribose assay system showed that acteoside has a high redox potential as electron donor, which generates hydroxyl radicals in an Fe3+-dependent manner similar to ascorbic acid. However, the antioxidant properties of acteoside differ from those of ascorbic acid in that the superoxide anion-mediated reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium was actively inhibited by acteoside but not by ascorbic acid. Acteoside protected cells against glucose oxidase-mediated cytotoxicity and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, acteoside had immune stimulating effects, as shown by the acteoside-mediated increase in the level of DNA synthesis, viability, and cytokine secretion in mouse splenocytes.

The grain boundaries between some grains in contact migrate to the direction of the smaller grains, and the rate is expected to be determined by the movement of the grooves formed at the junctions of die grains and the matrix, which is in turn dependent on solution-reprecipitation through the matrix.

CCP-capable bacteria, two Bacillus strains (JH3 and JH7) and one Sporosarcina strain (HYO08), were isolated from two samples of concrete and characterized phylogenetically. Calcium carbonate crystals precipitated by the three strains were morphologically distinct according to field emission scanning electron microscopy. Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry mapping confirmed biomineralization via extracellular calcium carbonate production. The three strains differed in their physiological characteristics: growth at alkali pH and high NaCl concentrations, and urease activity. Sporosarcina sp. HYO08 and Bacillus sp.

Analysis of the community from the same concrete samples using barcoded pyrosequencing revealed that the relative abundance of Bacillus and Sporosarcina species was low, which indicated low culturability of other dominant bacteria.

A heavy-tailed distribution of flights is a signature feature of Levy walks. The data analysis based on GPS traces of human walks reveals that the sizes of a few extremely large hot spots are dominating the mean size of hot spots and they cause the bursty (ie, long-range dependent) dispersion of visit points where people make a stop. Bursty visit points cause the characteristic distance among visit points to have a heavy-tail distribution. On top of bursty visit points, humans perform a distance-optimizing algorithm to plan their trips much like a heuristic to the traveling salesman problem. These factors in combination make human walks to have a heavy-tailed flight distribution. The above findings enable the construction of a simple human mobility model that taking as input the degree of burstiness in visit point dispersion, can naturally emulate hot spots as well as a heavy-tail flight distribution, both known to be important in measuring the realistic performance of mobile networks.", "num_citations": "50\n", "authors": ["4"]}

The relaxation process is characterized by the two dynamic exponents z and z\u0393\u00c7\u2593 which describe the time dependence of the height reduction \u256c\u00f6h (t)\u0393\u00eb\u00ea t z and the total relaxation time T (L)\u0393\u00eb\u00ea L z\u0393\u00c7\u2593. While the governing equation is nonlinear, we find numerically that z= z\u0393\u00c7\u2593= 1, which is robust against perturbations and independent of the initial void distributions. We then show that the existence of a steady state traveling wave solution is responsible for such a linear behavior. Next, we examine the case where each void is able to maintain its overall topology as a round object that can subject itself to compression.

{"title": "Melatonin suppresses the expression of 45S preribosomal RNA and upstream binding factor and enhances the antitumor activity of puromycin in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells\n", "abstract": " Since the dysregulation of ribosome biogenesis is closely associated with tumor progression, in the current study, the critical role of ribosome biogenesis related signaling was investigated in melatonin and/or puromycin induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Despite its weak cytotoxicity, melatonin from 3 mM attenuated the expression of 45S pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA), UBF as a nucleolar transcription factor, and fibrillarin at mRNA level and consistently downregulated nucleolar proteins such as UBF and fibrillarin at protein level in MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, immunofluorescence assay revealed that UBF was also degraded by melatonin in MDA-MB-231 cells. In contrast, melatonin attenuated the expression of survival genes such as Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, cyclinD1, and cyclin E, suppressed the phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR, and STAT3, and cleaved PARP and activated caspase 3 only at a high concentration of 12\u0393\u00c7\u00ebmM. However, combined treatment of melatonin (3\u0393\u00c7\u00ebmM) and puromycin (1\u0393\u00c7\u00eb                M) synergistically inhibited viability, attenuated the expression of 45S pre-rRNA and UBF, and consistently downregulated UBF, XPO1 and IPO7, procaspase 3, and Bcl-xL in MDA-MB 231 cells. Overall, these findings suggest that melatonin can be a cancer preventive agent by combination with puromycin via the inhibition of 45S pre-rRNA and UBF in MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells.", "num_citations": "47\n", "authors": ["4"]}

We adopted the artificial neural network to recognize a quick-nodding pattern of the disabled person as the gyro-mouse click. The performance of our gyro-mouse was evaluated by three indices that include'click recognition rate','error in cursor position control', and'click rate per minute'on a target box appearing at random positions. Although it turned out that the average error in cursor positioning control was 1.4-1.5 times larger than that of optical mouse control, and the average click rate per minute was 40% of the optical mouse, the overall click recognition rate was 93%. Moreover, the click rate per minute increased from 35.2% to 44% with repetitive trials. Hence, our suggested gyro-mouse system can be used to provide a new user interface tool especially for those persons who do not have full use of their upper extremities.", "num_citations": "47\n", "authors": ["4"]}

Due to a short lifespan of DCs, however, clinical application of current DC vaccines has been limited. Recently, activation of AKT/protein kinase B (PKB), a major effector of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), has been reported as a critical factor in both activation and survival of DCs. We here improved the potency of a DC vaccine with a small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), which is known to be a central negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT signal transduction cascade. Down-regulation of PTEN in DCs resulted in AKT dependent maturation, which in turn caused a significant up-regulation of surface expression in co-stimulatory molecules and the chemokine receptor, CCR7, leading to an increase of in vitro T cell activation activity\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "46\n", "authors": ["4"]}

In order to analyze the strain states during roll-cladding, the evolution of crystallographic textures at different through-thickness positions in the roll-clad composites was investigated. The finite element method (FEM) was employed to simulate the co-deformation of the different sheets and to determine the stresses and strains acting in the five-ply composites during roll-cladding. The strain states derived from the FEM simulations were used to model the texture evolution in the individual sheets of the roll-clad composites.

However, there have been only two case reports demonstrating the absence of proton pump in renal tissues of the patients with Sj\u251c\u2562gren's syndrome. This study presents two cases of classic dRTA in which the absence of intact H (+)-ATPase was shown in their renal biopsy tissues by immunohistochemistry using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the 70 kDa catalytic subunit of H (+)-ATPase from bovine brain clathrin-coated vesicles; one of the cases is diagnosed as subclinical Sj\u251c\u2562gren's syndrome and the other is idiopathic dRTA. A normal human kidney (NC) and the renal biopsy tissues from a patient with chronic tubulointerstitial nephritus whose proton secretory capacity was intact (DC) were compared as controls. The first patient, a 26-year-old woman, presented with quadriparesis. Her serologic tests revealed positive autoantibodies (ANA, SSA; SSB & RF), and a lower lip biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of Sj\u251c\u2562gren's syndrome. The second patient, a 43-year-old woman, who initially presented with a pathologic fracture of both femoral necks was referred for an evaluation for hypokalemia by the Department of Orthopedic Surgery.

Constitutive alleles of MAL23 and MAL43 vary considerably from inducible alleles in their C-terminal domain, with many of the alterations clustered and common to both alleles.

Here we show that AK2 negatively regulates tumour cell growth. AK2 forms a complex with dual-specificity phosphatase 26 (DUSP26) phosphatase and stimulates DUSP26 activity independently of its AK activity. AK2/DUSP26 phosphatase protein complex dephosphorylates fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) and regulates cell growth. AK2 deficiency enhances cell proliferation and induces tumour formation in a xenograft assay. This anti-growth function of AK2 is associated with its DUSP26-stimulating activity. Downregulation of AK2 is frequently found in tumour cells and human cancer tissues showing high levels of phospho-FADD Ser194.

Of these Feo proteins, FeoB is an inner membrane Fe(II) transporter that is aided by the small protein FeoA. However, the role of another small protein, FeoC, has remained unknown. Here we report that the FeoC protein is necessary for FeoB protein-mediated Fe(II) uptake in Salmonella experiencing low levels of oxygen and iron. The FeoC protein was found to directly bind to the FeoB transporter, leading to high cellular levels of FeoB. Depletion of the FtsH protease enabled high levels of FeoB in the absence of FeoC, suggesting that the FeoC protein protects the FeoB transporter from FtsH-mediated proteolysis.

The flat band voltage (VFB) of the MOS (metal-oxide-semiconductor) capacitor structure can be controlled within the range bounded by metal A and metal B individually, as demonstrated with various stacked bi-metal layers. For continuous thin layers, we speculate that the work function tunability may be due to the drastic change of the electron density in the thin continuous metal layer in direct contact with a bulk metal. This drastic change of electron density results in a larger junction depth than that expected for a bulk metal. Non-uniform thin layers also appear effective for work function tuning as well, and the observed VFB shift is attributed to the metal island formation at the dielectric/metal A interface.", "num_citations": "40\n", "authors": ["4"]}

However, the potential protective value of KOK for the treatment of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is largely unknown. We investigated whether pre-administration (daily from 2 hours before PCOS induction) and post-administration (daily after induction of PCOS) of KOK (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 g/kg/day, p.o.) could have a protective effect in a dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA, s.c.)-induced PCOS rat model. Pre-administration of KOK significantly decreased the elevated body weight and ovary weight, elevated size and number of follicular cysts, elevated level of serum glucose, and estradiol after DHEA injection. KOK reduced the elevated percentage of CD8 (+) T lymphocytes in lymph nodes, the elevated mRNA expression of CD11b and CD3 in ovaries, and infiltration of macrophages in ovarian tissue with PCOS. KOK diminished the increased mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u256c\u2593, IL-6, TNF-\u256c\u2592), chemokines (IL-8, MCP-1), and iNOS in the ovaries, and increased the reduced mRNA expression of growth factors (EGF, TGF-\u256c\u2593) by DHEA injection.

During the high temperature sintering, increase of the sintering time caused the oxidation of the Ti substrate to result in the increase of oxide weight of the electrode and the solid diffusion of the generated to the electrode\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "39\n", "authors": ["4"]}

{"title": "Benchmarking Java application using JNI and native C application on Android\n", "abstract": " Android is one of the most widely spread mobile platform. Many people are using Android mobile devices and many developers are creating Android applications at this moment. When developing applications, the differences in performance between Java and C/C++ are a well-known issue. Because this is also true in Android, many Android application developers prefer to use the Android NDK along with Java compared to using only Java language. However, there are certain performance gaps in not only using different programming languages but also in using glibc of a native cross-compiler and bionic libc of the Android NDK. In this paper, we show the difference in performance between Android applications compiled by using a native cross-compiler for ARM and a native shared library through the JNI of the Android NDK.

Due to the possible occurrence of periodontal disease at an early age, it is critical to begin correct toothbrushing patterns as early as possible. With this aim, we proposed a novel toothbrush monitoring and training system to interactively educate on toothbrushing behavior in terms of the correct brushing motion and grip axis orientation. Our intelligent toothbrush monitoring system first senses a user's brushing pattern by analyzing the waveforms acquired from a built-in accelerometer and magnetic sensor. To discern the inappropriate toothbrushing style, a real-time interactive three dimensional display system, based on an OpenGL 3D surface rendering scheme, is applied to visualize a subject's brushing patterns and subsequently advise on the correct brushing method.", "num_citations": "38\n", "authors": ["4"]}

It is shown that the Mahalanobis distance between the color itself and the average color is preserved under affine transformation. The MDCC converts pixels within each support window into the Mahalanobis distance transform (MDT) space. The similarity between MDT pairs is then computed using the cross-correlation with an asymmetric weight function based on the Mahalanobis distance. The MDCC considers correlation on cross-color channels, thus providing robustness to affine illumination variation. Experimental results show that the MDCC outperforms state-of-the-art similarity measures in terms of stereo matching for image pairs taken under different illumination conditions.", "num_citations": "36\n", "authors": ["4"]}

Since C. acutatum showed less sensitivity to benomyl, it was analyzed whether the less sensitivity was given by the same mechanism for the fungicide resistance of C. gloeosporioides. The isolates of C. acutatum were less sensitive to the three benzimidazole fungicides tested, benomyl, carbendazim, and thiophanate-methyl. However, the of C. acutatum isolates were different from the resistant isolates of C. gloeosporioides in their response to diethofencarb, one of N-phenyl-carbamates; the former was still less sensitive to diethofencarb than the latter. The differences in the resistance mechanisms in two species were conspicuous in sequence analysis of the tub2 genes. The genes from C. acutatum did not show any non-synonymous base substitutions at the regions known to be correlated with the benzimidazole-resistance.

Applying the retimed reference clocks does not only reduce a dynamic power in its delay chain, but simplify a fractional phase-error correction.

{"title": "Model studies of epidermal permeability.\n", "abstract": " An in vitro physical model approach for describing and predicting transport of molecules and ions across skin is examined. The proposed model is represented by two transport-resistant layers in series: the stratum corneum and the epidermis plus dermis. The stratum corneum is regarded as the principal barrier to transport and is composed of two parallel pathways: the lipoidal pathway and the pore pathway. The epidermis-dermis is treated as a porous membrane. The model predicts three regimes for the transport behavior of permeants, and these predictions have been compared with experimental permeability coefficient data obtained with hairless mouse skin in a two-chamber (aqueous) diffusion cell. The model predicts (1) that extremely lipophilic molecules are rate-limited by the epidermis-dermis and have a limiting permeability coefficient value;(2) that extremely polar permeants are rate-limited by the pore pathway of the stratum corneum with its limiting permeability coefficient; and (3) that permeants with intermediate polarity are transported via the lipoidal pathway and exhibit a lipophilicity-dependent permeability coefficient. Experimental data involving a large number of permeants are found to be consistent with these model predictions. The model approach also has been applied in the study of the mechanism (s) of skin transport enhancement induced by short-chain alkanols in aqueous media. A possible mode of enhancing the lipoidal pathway at low concentrations of the alkanols may involve the polar head region of the lipid bilayer or the region slightly below the polar head plane, or both; alkanols may solvate the lipid-water interface\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "34\n", "authors": ["4"]}

However, since the financial crisis of late 1997, the importance of the service sector has been increasingly recognized, and comprehensive reforms in the service sector were recommended in order to restore the crisis-ridden economy to its previous growth path (Mc-Kinsey 1998).The liberalization of services can bring potential gains in productivity in service sectors that are subject to technology transfers and economies of scale. These are similar to the productivity effects of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the manufacturing sector, because a significant portion of service supplies occurs through FDI. Various studies show positive evidence of the productivity spillovers of FDI (Caves 1974; Globerman 1979; Blomstrom and Persson 1983\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "33\n", "authors": ["4"]}

However, its function and mode of action within the nervous system remain largely unclear. To gain insight into this area, we have attempted to determine the effects of secretin on neuronal differentiation. Here, we report that secretin induces the generation of neurite outgrowth in pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. The expressions of Tau and \u256c\u2593-tubulin, neuronal differentiation markers, are increased upon secretin stimulation. In addition, secretin induces sustained mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation and also stimulates the cAMP secretion. Moreover, the neurite outgrowth elicited by secretin is suppressed to a marked degree in the presence of either PD98059, a specific MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor, or H89, a specific protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that secretin induces\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "33\n", "authors": ["4"]}

To precisely map tumor-suppressor loci on chromosome 4q for further positional cloning efforts, we tested 15 primary SCLCs. Forty two polymorphic microsatellite markers located on chromosome 4q were used in the microsatellite analysis. We found that 12 (80%) of the 15 tumors exhibited loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in at least one of the tested microsatellite markers, and that 3 (25%) of these 12 tumors exhibited a larger area of deletion on chromosome 4q. Frequent LOH, defined as occurring in more than 50% of the tumors, was observed in five commonly deleted regions on 4q, namely 4q24, 4q27-28.3, 4q33, 4q34. 1, and 4q34. 3-35.2. Of these 5, LOH at 4q33 was the most frequent (61.5%). Six (40%) of the 15 tumors exhibited shifted bands in at least one of the tested microsatellite markers. Shifted bands occurred in 3.7%(23 of 630) of the loci tested.

Anti-Pv200 antibody levels in 20 vivax malaria patients (optical density +/- standard deviation [OD +/- SD] values 1.85 +/- 0.29 of IgG isotype and 1.33 +/- 1.33 of IgM isotype) were markedly higher than those of uninfected, malaria-naive controls (0.08 +/- 0.16 of IgG isotype and 0.04 +/- 0.04 of IgM isotype). Antibody levels for 7 out of 8 soldiers with a recent malaria infection were sustained above the cut-off values for 4 months after successful treatment. Analysis of serum collected from 40 healthy, asymptomatic soldiers who had a P. vivax malaria attack within 3 months after our sampling, revealed 11 antibody-positive samples (27.5%), compared to 5 positive samples (12.5%) collected from a random selection of 40 soldiers.

Ag nanowire network under compression showed excellent reliability showing only a 6.0% increase in fractional resistance at 400,000 cycles, which is superior in comparison to that under tensile strain. The Ag nanowire network under compression was shown to cause buckling of the Ag nanowires, which then relaxed the elastic strain imposed on the Ag nanowire that led to enhanced reliability.

CB-PIC significantly exerted cytotoxicity, increased sub-G1 accumulation, and cleaved PARP with apoptotic features, while it enhanced the phosphorylation of AMPK alpha and ACC as well as activated the ERK in hypoxic SW620 cells. Furthermore, CB-PIC suppressed the expression of HIF1 alpha, Akt, and mTOR and activated the AMPK phosphorylation in hypoxic SW620 cells. Conversely, silencing of AMPK\u256c\u2592 blocked PARP cleavage and ERK activation induced by CB-PIC, while ERK inhibitor PD 98059 attenuated the phosphorylation of AMPK\u256c\u2592 in hypoxic SW620 cells, implying cross-talk between ERK and AMPK\u256c\u2592. Furthermore, cotreatment of CB-PIC and metformin enhanced the inhibition of HIF1\u256c\u2592 and Akt/mTOR and the activation of AMPK\u256c\u2592 and pACC in hypoxic SW620 cells.

Interestingly, CP-PIC showed better antitumor activity in SW620 colon cancer cells under hypoxia than under normoxia, since it may be applied to chemoresistance.

We find that members of the self-governance group perceive the management system as having had a positive impact on four out of the eight criteria we tested: stock recovery, curtailed fishing effort, reduced disputes among fishermen and declining incidents of illegal fishing.

Interestingly, when we screened for MFN2 mutations in 34 patients diagnosed with mitochondrial diseases, but no causative mtDNA mutation, we found that a family with an ischemic stroke, but no peripheral neuropathy, carried a novel cosegregating MFN2 mutation.Recently, it was suggested that mitochondrial fission occurs in ischemic stroke in a mouse model prior to neuronal demise, and that MFN2 protects cerebellar granule neurons against injury induced cell death. 6, 7 In the event of brain ischemia and the activation of apoptosis, MFN2 might play an important role in neuronal tissue protection.

The 4WM efficiency increases with the increase of the coupling coefficient when it is small, then saturates, and finally decreases at high coupling coefficient due to both pump depletion and phase-modulation effects. A maximum output efficiency of about 50% in our case is predicted. In order to get the maximum output, the two pump beams should have equal amplitude and the probe beam should be as small as possible.

{"title": "Cyclooxygenase-2 functionally inactivates p53 through a physical interaction with p53\n", "abstract": " Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein, has been known to promote tumorigenesis, but the exact mechanisms involved have not been identified. We have previously reported that COX-2 physically interacts with the tumor suppressor p53 and regulates its function. However, it remains to be elucidated how COX-2 can interact with p53 residing in different compartments and whether their interaction is involved in the regulation of p53 function. We here demonstrated that upon genotoxic stress, COX-2 and p53 accumulate in the nucleus, where they physically interact with one another. We also showed that an amino-terminal region (amino acids 1\u0393\u00c7\u00f4126) of COX-2 interacts with the DNA-binding domain of p53. The p53-interacting region was critical for COX-2-mediated inhibition of p53 DNA-binding and transcriptional activity as well as p53- and genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis.

Vitamin D is considered for the first-line therapy managing SHP in hemodialysis (HD) patients and has a beneficial effect in the chronic inflammation and development of cardiovascular disease. The soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE) may be protective by binding AGE in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic vascular complications, whereas extracellular RAGE-binding protein (EN-RAGE) represents pro-inflammatory ligands for RAGE. We have hypothesized that vitamin D treatment may alter the levels of sRAGE and EN-RAGE in HD patients. Therefore, this prospective observational study was performed in 51 HD patients with SHP who had low serum 1, 25 dihydroxyvitamin D 3 (1, 25D) levels and elevated intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. We evaluated the changes in the values of sRAGE, EN-RAGE, and other inflammatory marker, interleukin-6 (IL-6), before and at the end of the 8-week calcitriol treatment. After calcitriol treatment, the serum levels of 1, 25D were increased, whereas the serum intact PTH levels were decreased. In addition, the sRAGE levels were increased, whereas those of IL-6 were decreased after calcitriol treatment.

However, studies on effect of 3D visual fatigue on autonomic nervous system have not less been conducted. Thus, this study was to identify and determine the effect that might have a negative influence on sympathetic nervous system, parasympathetic nervous system, and cardiovascular system. Fifteen undergraduates (female: 9, mean age: ) participated and were sat on a comfortable chair, viewing a 3D content during about 1 hour. Cardiac responses like SDNN (standard deviation of RR intervals), RMS-SD (root mean squared successive difference), and HF/LF ratios extracted from the measured PPG (Photo-PlethysmoGram) before viewing 3D were compared to those after viewing 3D. The results showed that after subjects watched the 3D, responses in sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system were activated and deactivated, respectively relative to those before watching the 3D. The results showed that HF/LF ratio, Ln (LF), and Ln (HF) after viewing 3D were significantly reduced relative to those before viewing 3D. No significant effects were observed in SDNN and RMS-SD. Results obtained in this study showed that visual fatigue induced by watching 3D adversely influenced autonomic nervous system, and thereby reduced heart rate variability causing sympathetic nervous acceleration.", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["4"]}

{"title": "The design and testing of a cooling system using mixed solid cryogen for a portable superconducting magnetic energy storage system\n", "abstract": " A cooling system that uses solid nitrogen (SN2) as an effective heat capacity enhancer was recently introduced to enhance the thermal stability of the HTS SMES. Since SN2 has a large enthalpy with minimal weight, it enables a portable system by increasing the recooling to recooling time period (RRTP). However, contact between the SN2 and HTS SMES magnet can be broken by repeated thermal disturbances (thermal'dry-out'phenomena). Therefore, it is essential to improve thermal contact to allow full use of the heat capacity of SN2. This study evaluated the effect of using a mixture containing SN2 and a small amount of a liquid cryogen as a cooling system in the HTS SMES system. The performance of the cooling system was evaluated using the mixed cryogen and compared with that of SN2 alone. In addition, the role of liquid neon (Ne) as a heat exchanger between SN2 and the HTS SMES magnet is discussed.", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["4"]}

Effects of template size and content on microstructure, porosity, and flexural and compressive strengths were investigated in the processing of the macroporous zirconia ceramics. Three different sizes of microbeads (8, 20, and ) were used as a template for fabricating the macroporous ceramics. The porosity increased with increasing the template size at the same template content. The flexural and compressive strengths were primarily influenced by the porosity rather than the template size. However, the strengths increased with decreasing the template size at the same porosity. By controlling the template size and content, it was possible to produce macroporous zirconia ceramics with porosities ranging from 58% to 75%.

It has been suggested that abnormal DNA methylation contributes to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and congenital anomalies. The previous findings regarding the genetic relationship between MTHFR and schizophrenia are controversial. This study investigated the association of the two functional polymorphisms of MTHFR, C677T and A1298C, with the risk for schizophrenia. Furthermore, we conducted an updated meta-analysis on the two polymorphisms. In addition, we investigated the relationship between the polymorphisms and minor physical anomaly (MPA), which may represent neurodevelopmental aberrations in 201 schizophrenia patients and 350 normal control subjects. There was no significant association between either of the two polymorphisms and the risk of schizophrenia (chi-square= 0.001, df= 1, P= 0.971 for C677T; chi-square= 1.319, df= 1, P= 0.251 for A1298C). However, in meta-analysis, the C677T polymorphism showed a significant association in the combined and Asian populations (OR= 1.13, P= 0.005; OR= 1.21, P= 0.011, respectively) but not in the Korean and Caucasian populations alone. Neither polymorphism was associated with MPAs measured by the Waldrop scale (chi-square= 2.513, df= 2, P= 0.285).

Moreover, KLF6-positive cells were also detected in the radial migratory stream (RMS) and subventricular zone. Immunofluorescent double-labeling revealed that KLF6-immunoreactive cells were co-localized with neuronal nuclei or platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1, a mature neuronal and endothelial marker, respectively, in most forebrain\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["4"]}
{"title": "Dynamic hard fractional frequency reuse for mobile WiMAX\n", "abstract": " Fractional frequency reuse (FFR) is gaining much attention in WiMAX standardization bodies to mitigate the inter-cell interference and reduce the throughput outage at the cell edges. A hard FFR pattern based on a time division of the available total bandwidth between inner and outer cell users is recommended in the IEEE 802.16e standard. The DL subframe is configured so that users close to the base station operate on the zone with all subchannels available, while for the edge users, each cell operates on the zone with a fraction of all subchannels available. In this paper, we propose a hard FFR scheme that dynamically adjusts the size of each zone according to the system load. Our approach is based on either a partial or a full coordination between the base stations. The effectiveness of our scheme is particularly proved when a non-uniform distribution of the users in the cell is considered.", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["4"]}
{"title": "Factors influencing residual pleural opacity in tuberculous pleural effusion\n", "abstract": " Tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE) leads to residual pleural opacity (RPO) in a significant proportion of cases. The aim of this study was to investigate which TPE patients would have RPO following the treatment. This study was performed prospectively for a total of 60 TPE patients, who underwent pleural fluid analysis on the initial visit and chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans before and after the administration of antituberculous medication. At the end of antituberculous medication, the incidence of RPO was 68.3%(41/60) on CT with a range of 2-50 mm. Compared with the non-RPO group, the RPO group had a longer symptom duration and lower pleural fluid glucose level. On initial CT, loculation, extrapleural fat proliferation, increased attenuation of extrapleural fat, and pleura-adjacent atelectasis were more frequent, and parietal pleura was thicker in the RPO group compared with the non-RPO group. By multivariate analysis, extrapleural fat proliferation, loculated effusion, and symptom duration were found to be predictors of RPO in TPE. In conclusion, RPO in TPE may be predicted by the clinico-radiologic parameters related to the chronicity of the effusion, such as symptom duration and extrapleural fat proliferation and loculated effusion on CT.", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["4"]}

{"title": "Analysis of sediment yields at watershed scale using area/slope-based sediment delivery ratio in SATEEC\n", "abstract": " The Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) has been used in over 100 countries to estimate potential long-term soil erosion from the field. However, the USLE estimated soil erosion cannot be used to estimate the sediment delivered to the stream networks. For an effective erosion control, it is necessary to compute sediment delivery ratio (SDR) for watershed and sediment yield at watershed outlet. Thus, the Sediment Assessment Tool for Effective Erosion Control (SATEEC) was developed to compute the sediment yield at any point in watershed. In this study, the SATEEC was applied to the Sudong watershed, Chuncheon Gangwon to compare the sediment yield using area-based sediment delivery ratio (SDRA) and slope-based sediment delivery ratio (SDRS) at watershed outlet. The sediment yield using the SDRA by Vanoni, SYA and the sediment yield using the SDRS by Willams and Berndt, SYS were compared for the same sized watersheds. The 19 subwatersheds was 2.19 ha in size, the soil loss and sediment yield were estimated for each subwatershed. Average slope of main stream was about 0.86~ 3.17%. Soil loss and sediment yield using SDRA and SDRS were distinguished depending on topography, especially in steep and flat areas. The SDRA for all subwatersheds was 0.762, however the SDRS were estimated in the range of 0.553~ 0.999. The difference between SYA and SYS was-79.74~ 27.45%. Thus site specific slope-based SDR is more effective in sediment yield estimation than area-based SDR. However it is recommended that watershed characteristic need to be considered in estimating yield behaviors.", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["4"]}

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is one of the most debilitating complications of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, and its histopathology is characterized by neuronal small fiber degeneration, demyelination, and atrophy 3-5). Hyperglycemia, a metabolic disruption known to increase oxidative stress in the peripheral nerves, is an important factor in the pathogenesis of DPN 6). In patients with diabetes, as well as those with local nerve compression that needs to be treated to prevent or repair permanent nerve damage, treatment of the underlying cause might result in partial or full pain relief 7).Nerve growth factor (NGF) itself has been considered as an option for the treatment of DPN.

Unfortunately, a recently concluded phase III trial failed to demonstrate the efficacy of NGF administration 11). The reasons for this failure include its limited delivery to the nervous system and an unwanted apoptotic effect elicited through the interaction with the p75NTR receptor 11-13). Additionally, the effectiveness of NGF application as a therapeutic intervention to treat brain injury is limited by the numerous unwanted side effects observed in both animals and patients, reflecting the diversity of cell types that react to NGF, both centrally and peripherally 14-16).

Effluent clarity was affected largely by flow rate and only slightly by the diameter of the ring dam. Effluent clarity was also affected by the differential speed, although this affect was more dramatic at higher flow rates than at lower flow rates. Moisture content was largely unaffected by flow rate. A decrease in moisture content was evident as differential speed decreased.", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["4"]}

{"title": "Surgical correction of cryptotia using Medpor.\n", "abstract": " Cryptotia is a congenital auricular anomaly found more commonly in Orientals than whites. The characteristics of cryptotia are the invagination of the upper part of the auricle under the temporal skin and the deformity of the auricular cartilage. The goals of the repair of cryptotia are to release the upper ear from the side of the head to restore the retroauricular groove, to correct the malposition, and to correct the cartilaginous deformity. To lengthen the skin between the superior portion of the auricle and the scalp, the authors used both the modified Z-plasty and the temporal advancement flap. We partially detached the abnormal insertion of the superior auricular muscle at the upper part of the helix to make it weak. After complete exposure of the posterior aspect of the upper auricular cartilage, the constricted intrinsic transverse and oblique muscles were cut, and everting horizontal mattress sutures were inserted on the antihelix to expand the constricted body and crus of the antihelix. Thereafter, an ultrathin Medpor sheet (0.85-mm thickness) was fixed with 6-0 nylon sutures to the posterior aspect of the corrected antihelical cartilage for lengthening and splinting the relatively shortened upper pole of the deformed cartilage. This operative method is thought to be useful in maintaining the lengthened auricular height and shape, and in preventing the relapse of ear cartilage deformities.", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["4"]}

In a gate-to-source/drain nonoverlap structure with a nonextended O/N/O layer under the gate spacer, the impact ionization region is steered out from the gate, which is located under the spacer. In the 1T-DRAM mode of URAM, the programming biases are selected so that impact ionization can occur under the gate spacer, thereby alleviating the soft program.

The aim of this study was to compare the two solutions for colonoscopy, PEG and NaP, through crossover design with regard to patients' compliance, cleansing ability and side effects. METHODS: Thirty patients underwent two separate colonoscopies for colonic polyp (s) with PEG and NaP, respectively. Before and after bowel preparation, blood pressure, body weight, and serum biochemical parameters were measured in all patients. In addition, a detailed questionnaire was used to assess side effects and the patients' preference. The presence of bubbles, types of residual stool, and overall quality of colon cleansing were assessed by one endoscopist blinded to the type of preparation used. In each colonoscopy, two biopsy specimens were taken at rectum. RESULTS: In the NaP group, but not in the PEG group, there were significant changes in several biochemical parameters including sodium (+ 3.0+/-3.0 mEq/L), potassium (-0.3+/-0.3 mEq/L), calcium (-0.5+/-0.5 mg/dL), phosphorus (+ 3.9+/-2.2 mg/dL) and osmolarity (+ 10.1+/-9.3 mOsm/kg) after bowel preparation. In addition, the degree of body weight change was greater with NaP (-2.2+/-2.3 kg) than with PEG (-1.2+/-2.0 kg)(p= 0.06) and the formation of bubbles that disturb luminal observation was more frequently found in the NaP group (p< 0.01).

Here, we employed an in vitro chemosensitivity assay to evaluate the biological efficacy of conventional monotherapies and combination chemotherapy with targeted drugs.MethodsThe chemosensitivities of 12 CRC cell lines to the established regimens FOLFOX (5-fluorouracil [5-FU]+ leucovorin+ oxaliplatin) and FOLFIRI (5-FU+ leucovorin+ irinotecan) and to therapy with these regimens in combination with the biologically targeted drugs bevacizumab or cetuximab were comparatively evaluated for their effects on apoptotic and autophagic cell death processes, angiogenesis, and invasion.ResultsEach of the chemotherapeutic regimens promoted apoptotic cell death and invasion. All drug regimens caused significantly greater apoptotic cell death with activation of caspase-3 in SW480 cells compared to other cells, effects that were associated with a remarkable reduction in matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity. The FOLFOX regimen more effectively promoted apoptotic cell death, angiogenesis, and invasion than the FOLFIRI regimen.

The IORS is almost equidistant from South Korea, China, and Japan and, therefore, it is an ideal place to observe Asian outflows without local emission effects. The seasonal variation of ozone was distinct, with a minimum in August (37 ppbv) and two peaks in April and October (62 ppbv), and was largely affected by the seasonal wind pattern over east Asia. At IORS, six types of air masses were distinguished with different levels of O3 concentrations by the cluster analysis of backward trajectories. Marine air masses from the Pacific Ocean represent a relatively clean background air with a lowest ozone level of 32 ppbv, which was most frequently observed in summer (July\u0393\u00c7\u00f4August). In spring (March\u0393\u00c7\u00f4April) and winter (December\u0393\u00c7\u00f4February), the influence of Chinese outflows was dominant with higher ozone concentrations of 62 and 49 ppbv, respectively.

Recently, CueP was determined to be a periplasmic copper-binding protein and has been implicated in the transfer of copper ions to SodCII in the periplasm. In this study, the crystal structure of CueP has been determined, revealing a V-shaped dimeric structure. The conserved cysteine and histidine residues are clustered on the surface of one side of the C-terminal domain, suggesting that this cysteine- and histidine-rich region is related to the function of CueP. LC-MS/MS analysis established the presence of a disulfide bond between Cys96 and Cys176 under aerobic conditions. Subsequent biophysical analyses showed that the CueP protein binds copper and zinc, and the mutation of Cys104 to serine (C104S) dramatically reduced the binding\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["4"]}

In this paper, we propose a new method for berthing ships automatically by using bow and stern thrusters. Specifically, a steering motion model of a ship is considered, and parameters in the equation are evaluated by the system identification technique. An optimal controller based on observations was designed from the linearization of the non-linear ship motion in the horizontal plane. It is used to reduce the uncertainty about the ship's dynamics and reduce measurement requirements. The performance of the controller was also analyzed for its robustness relative to avoiding disturbing the environment due to winds, currents, and wave-drift forces. Experiments were conducted to estimate the potential for identifying result and the design of the controller. Specifically, in this paper, the system modeling and tracking control approach are discussed based on a two-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) servo-system design.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["4"]}

Thus, seagrasses may play a significant role in carbon and nutrient cycling in the coastal and estuarine ecosystems. To examine growth dynamics of Zostera marina L. environmental factors such as underwater irradiance, water temperature, and salinity, and biological parameters such as shoot density, biomass, shoot morphology, and leaf productivity were measured in two bay systems (Jindong Bay and Gamak Bay) on the southern coast of Korea. While underwater irradiance did not show distinct seasonal trend, water temperature at both sites exhibited clear seasonal trend throughout the experimental period. Shoot density increased dramatically during winter due to the increased seedlings through germination of seeds in Jindong Bay and due to the increased lateral shoots in Gamak Bay. Eelgrass biomass increased during winter and decreased during summer. Maximum biomass in Jindong Bay and Gamak Bay was 250.2 and 232.3 g dry weight m\u0393\u00c7\u00f4a2, respectively.

{"title": "Acoustic tests on atmospheric condition in a liquid rocket engine chamber\n", "abstract": " Acoustic characteristics of unbaffled and baffled combustion chamber are experimentally investigated under atmospheric condition to preliminarily determine baffle for mitigation of combustion instability. To investigate the effect of the baffle which has several configurations such as radial baffles and hub/blade baffle, resonant-frequency shift and damping factors of the chamber were analyzed and compared quantitatively with those of the unbaffled combustion chamber. From a view of acoustic characteristics, radial baffles with several configurations have not much difference in resonant-frequency shift and damping factor ratio with each other. On the other hand, hub and blade baffle is very effective to suppress the first tangential mode which was found to be the most harmful acoustic mode in KSR (Korean Sounding Rocket)-III engine. But more study on design parameters such as hub size and axial length should be done for complete optimization of hub and blade baffle. The present study based on linear acoustic analysis is expected to be a useful confirming tool to predict acoustic field and design a passive control devices such as baffle and acoustic cavity.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["4"]}

Moreover, with multi-rooted teeth, extracting without root fracture is difficult. Safe extraction that is free of coronal or root fracture is important, but little information is known as to a concrete, safe way of extraction. There are a few considerations for safe extraction. First, a tooth with orthodontic extrusion force is easier for extraction due to its increased mobility; it increases the amount of the periodontal ligament, which is essential for re-attachment. As a safe way of extraction, the use of physics forceps has been introduced recently; it minimizes damage to the gingiva and alveolar hone.

The construction of Seosan A and B sea dikes from 1983 to 1985 might continuously change sedimentary environments in the northern part of the bay. In order to investigate sedimentary environment, surface and core sediments were sampled at the Hwangdo tidal flat and adjacent sea in June and October 2003. The surface sediments consisted of five sedimentary facies. Generally, the surface sediments in October were changed coarser on the tidal flat and little changed in the subtidal area compared to those in June 2003. Sedimentary facies analysis of three core sediments suggested that wave and tidal current were relatively strong in the tidal flat near Hwangdo, whereas the energy was relatively low in the tidal flat near channel. Sediment accumulation rates in the Hwangdo tidal flat during 11 months indicated that sediments deposited in the central part, whereas eroded in eastern and western sides of the tidal flat.

Measurements performed after irradiation showed a dose-related increases in MN frequency in each of the donors of human, cattle, goat, pig and rabbit. The relative sensitivity of cattle, goat, pig and rabbit in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) compared with human PBLs was estimated by best fitting linear-quadratic model based on the radiation-induced MN data over the range from 0 cGy to 400 cGy. In the case of MN frequency with 0.2, the relative sensitivities of cattle, goat, pig and rabbit PBLs were 0.86, 0.98, 0.41 and 0.39, respectively. These data indicate that the induction of MN in CB cells following irradiation is similar in human, cattle and goat PBLs, while PBLs from pig and rabbit were much less sensitive to the MN induction effects of gamma-radiation than those from human. The micronucleus counts failed to show any evidence of radiation damage in the cells from chicken and fish. Measurements performed after irradiation showed a dose-related decrease in the formation of binucleated cells. We concluded that the use of CB cell from fish and chicken for detecting the results of radiation exposure was highly questionable.

A nonlinear relationship between multi-spectral image pairs makes conventional descriptors be sensitive to spectral deformation. To alleviate this problem, the LSSF employs a weighted correlation surface reducing the discrepancy between mul-tispectral images. Furthermore, the LSSF provides a rotation invariance exploiting the frequency response of maximal values on logpolar bins based on the fact that a cyclic shift on the log-polar representation leads only a phase shift in a frequency domain.

Most isolates were susceptible to 10 antibiotics, but they were highly resistant to penicillin (100%), ampicillin (100%), oxacillin (94.9%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (95.6%), cefazolin (78.2%), and rifampicin (58.0%). These results indicate that food-borne outbreak caused by B. cereus might lead to diarrhea and emetic syndromes.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["4"]}

In six patients, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of amblyopic eye improved more than two lines within 2\u0393\u00c7\u00e0weeks of full-time spectacle wear. The remaining patients were assigned to perform part-time patching during out-of-school hours. Long-term results were assessed in patients who were observed over 1\u0393\u00c7\u00e0year after the end of the treatment.Results Among 35 patients, four dropped out, refusing further treatment, and one changed to atropine penalisation. The part-time patching schedule was completed in 30 patients. 90% of patients (27/30) complied well. Mean BCVA in the amblyopic eye improved significantly (p<0.001), and 96.7% of patients (29/30) achieved the final BCVA of 0.1 logMAR or\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["4"]}
{"title": "Prevalence of Hepatic Parasites in Korean Wild Rats (Rattus norvegicus) and Their Association With Pulmonary Arteriolar Medial Hypertrophy\n", "abstract": " C hepatica, an important zoonotic parasite, and C fasciolaris are common parasites in rodents. In rodent livers, C hepatica causes sequential morphologic changes that are designated as early, intermediate, or late phase, and C fasciolaris forms cysts surrounded by fibroplasia and granulomatous inflammation. The present study describes the prevalence of these parasites and associated liver and lung lesions in wild rats (Rattus norvegicus) living around pig farms in South Korea. Selected parenchymal organs, including liver and lung, of 89 wild rats were examined. Of 89 rats, 28 (31.5%) were infected with either C hepatica or C fasciolaris or with both parasites. Severe medial hypertrophy of small arterioles was observed in the lungs of 11 of the 28 parasite-infected rats (P < .01). The pulmonary arteriolar hypertrophy in the rats infected with C hepatica was strongly associated with early and/or intermediate phases\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["4"]}

{"title": "Sequential occurrence of life-threatening hypokalemia and rebound hyperkalemia associated with barbiturate coma therapy.\n", "abstract": " OBJECTIVE: To report a sequential occurrence of life-threatening hypokalemia and rebound hyperkalemia following barbiturate coma therapy. CASE HISTORY: A 53-year-old man was admitted to the division of nephrology due to sudden development of severe hypokalemia. The patient had been treated following a clinical diagnosis of traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage and subdural hematoma. Barbiturate coma therapy had been performed on this patient. He developed fatal hypokalemia 10 hours after the start of thiopental administration which did not respond to potassium supplementation. The lowest potassium level following barbiturate coma therapy was 1.0 mmol/l. Severe bradycardia and cardiac arrest developed, which necessitated cardiac massage and treatment with epinephrine and atropine. He recovered from cardiac arrest. When thiopental infusion was suddenly stopped, the potassium level increased to 8.9 mmol/l, which required quick administration of calcium gluconate and infusion of glucose solution mixed with regular insulin. Despite such management, he developed asystole. After direct current cardioversion and emergency hemodialysis, he recovered from cardiac arrest and his serum potassium level was stabilized. CONCLUSION: We recommend that clinicians must be aware of the potential occurrence of severe hypokalemia, which is rare but fatal, following barbiturate coma therapy. Rebound hyperkalemia, which is fatal, may also occur following cessation of thiopental infusion. Clinicians should also be aware of this potential complication. Further studies are needed to elucidate the precise mechanism of this clinical\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["4"]}

All samples were collected before and after a standard work shift at the APC, while perilla leaves were also collected after each step in the APC. In addition, the workers and their surroundings were sampled by swabbing. The total plate count (TPC) and coliform count in the water samples increased significantly (p< 0.05) to 3.36 and 1.73 log CFU/mL after work, respectively. However, no Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes were detected. The bacterial populations of the workers and their surroundings did not differ significantly (p 0.05) before and after work. However, Staphylococcus aureus (< 1.66 log CFU) was detected at a high rate (13-50%) in the basket, packing table, gloves and cloth. Although perilla leaves passed through the washing steps, the TPC and coliform bacterial populations on the final products were higher (p 0.05) than those of unwashed perilla leaves, which indicates that the washing system was not functioning properly. Accordingly, a GAP system with a better washing system should be employed at this facility.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["4"]}

In order to compensate the voltage sag problem, power compensation devices have widely been developed. In the case of voltage sag, it needs an energy source to overcome the energy caused by voltage sag. According as the SMES device is characterized by its very high response time of charge and discharge, it has widely been researched and developed for more than 20 years. However, before the installation of SMES into utility, the system analysis has to be carried out with a certain simulation tool. This paper presents a real-time simulation algorithm for the SMES system by using the miniaturized SMES model coil whose properties are same as those of real size SMES coil. With this method, researchers can easily analyse the performance of SMES connected into utility network by abstracting the properties from the\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["4"]}

The Pt/IZO Schottky diodes showed a rectifying ratio of 105, however, the electrical properties were degraded with aging. An increase in defect and carrier concentrations was observed from capacitance-voltage analysis and photoluminescence in the aged Pt/IZO Schottky diode. The degradation of the rectifying properties of the aged diodes originates possibly from the electron tunneling due to the increased defect concentrations.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["4"]}

In order to do that, we measure the performance of IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN (WLAN) in real environments that produce unexpected interference from neighbor access points or electronic devices. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for the link adaptation technique in WLAN MAC. The new strategy provides two decisions to estimate the link condition and to manage both the transmission rate and power.

{"title": "Substrate effects on the characteristics of (In 2O 3) 1-x (ZnO) x films\n", "abstract": " The electrical and the optical properties of (In 2 O 3) 1-x,(ZnO) x (IZO) films deposited by the rf magnetron sputtering on plastic substrates, such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and poly carbonate (PC), were investigated. The results are compared with those of IZO films deposited on a conventional coring glass (CG) substrate. The average transmittance of the IZO films deposited on plastic substrates is over 80%, irrespective of the substrate, which is comparable to that of IZO films deposited on CG substrates. IZO films deposited on PC or PET substrates show larger resistivities than those deposited on CG substrates. This may be attributed to the fact that compositions, such as H 2 O or the organic solvent contained in the plastic substrates, are adsorbed into the IZO layer during sputtering. The surface resistance of the IZO films is nearly independent of the substrate and decreases with increasing deposition time. Compared to the IZO films deposited on PET substrates without hard coatings, those deposited on PET substrates with hard coatings show superior electrical stability for thermal environments.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["4"]}

Among these II\u0393\u00c7\u00f4VI/III\u0393\u00c7\u00f4V mixed heterostructures, ZnSe/GaAs heterostructures have been particularly interesting due to their promising applications for the fabrication of laser diodes and light-emitting diodes operating in the blue-green region of the spectrum [6\u0393\u00c7\u00f410]. However, relatively little work has been performed on II\u0393\u00c7\u00f4VI/III\u0393\u00c7\u00f4V heterostructures in comparison with III\u0393\u00c7\u00f4V/III\u0393\u00c7\u00f4V heterostructures due to cross-doping problems resulting from interdiffusion or intermixing during growth and fabrication [11].

Therefore, studies of the annealing effects on the surface, the structural, and the optical properties play a very important role in enhancing device efficiency.

For attaining the purpose, an investigation was made of 449 third-grade students in the department of dental hygiene at seven educational institutes in Seoul and Kyoung-gi province. 246 instructors in charge of the clinical practice of the students at dental hospital or clinics were also examined. The findings of this study were as follows: 1. The instructors and students had different opinions on the number of trainees, training time, beginning of training, and assessment (p< 0.05). The instructors thought that a trainee was appropriate for an instructor (59.8%), and that training time was not sufficient (30.8%). They considered it proper for students to start practice during the summer vacation of second year (21.5%), and responded that assessment should be done by the dentist, dental hygienist or professor in charge (44.7%). However, the students had an idea that an instructor should take charge of 2 or 3 trainees (47.4%), and that there was a lot of training time (55.7%). They considered it appropriate to start practice in the first term of second grade (l9A%), and thought the assessment should be made by the dentist and dental hygienist in charge (44.8%). 2. The students' satisfaction was clinical practice was affected (p< 0.05) by their own selection of training institutes (28.1%), the absence of trainee from other colleges (29.4%), ample practice\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["4"]}

This study aimed to examine how the news media encompasses a wide array of content regarding cancer risk factors and related cancer sites, and investigate whether news coverage of cancer risk factors is congruent with the actual prevalence of the disease. Materials and Methods: A content analysis was conducted on 1,138 news stories covered during a 5-year period between 2008 and 2012. The news stories were selected from nationally representative media in Korea. Information was collected about cancer risk factors and cancer sites. Results: Of various cancer risk factors, occupational and environmental exposures appeared most frequently in the news. Breast cancer was mentioned the most in relation to cancer sites. Breast, cervical, prostate, and skin cancer were overrepresented in the media in comparison to incidence and mortality cases, whereas lung, thyroid, liver, and stomach cancer were underrepresented. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this research is the first investigation dealing with news coverage about cancer risk factors in Korea. The study findings show occupational and environmental exposures are emphasized more than personal lifestyle factors; further, more prevalent cancers in developed countries have greater media coverage, not reflecting the realities of the disease. The findings may help health journalists and other health storytellers to develop effective ways to communicate cancer risk factors.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["4"]}

We therefore decided to evaluate whether SUVmax and MTD on 2-[fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) would affect the survival outcome in primary extranodal DLBCL.MethodsFrom October 2005 to November 2010, 76 primary extranodal DLBCL patients receiving R-CHOP therapy were analyzed. All patients had undergone an initial 18-FDG PET/CT and conventional computed tomography (CT) of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis for staging.

{"title": "A study on signal processing of ballistic missile warhead discrimination using ESPRIT in millimeter-wave (Ka-band) seeker\n", "abstract": " This paper introduces a signal processing technique for discrimination of ballistic missile's warhead. An interceptor missile to destroy the enemy's ballistic missile requires an information on the location of missile's warhead. In order to detect and locate the missile's warhead, a seeker radar in the interceptor missile makes use of chirp waveform to generate high resolution range profiles (HRRPs). We applied one of the well known spectral estimation technique called ESPRIT (Estimation of Signal Parameters by Rotational Invariance Technique) to these HRRPs to estimate scattering centers on the target. Using the information on the one-dimensional (1-D) scattering centers, we can find the location of the warhead by estimating the length of the missile, Simulation results show that the proposed signal processing technique is efficient in discriminating the warhead of an ballistic missile.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["4"]}

A variety of characterization techniques, including cell performance tests, were applied to examine the effects of CNT support on the degradation of Pt catalysts: transmission electron microscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. During the RP cycle tests, most degradation by carbon corrosion occurred at the outlet region of membrane electrode assembly (MEA) where hydrogen starvation seriously occurred. By using the CNT as the support of Pt catalysts in the MEA cathode, carbon corrosion was reduced and growth of Pt particles by agglomeration and sintering significantly decreased.

{"title": "Clinical and genetic analyses of three Korean families with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia\n", "abstract": " Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal-dominant vascular disorder, characterized by recurrent epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectases, and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in various visceral organs. Endoglin (ENG) and activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ACVRL1; ALK1), receptors for transforming growth factor-\u256c\u2593 (TGF-\u256c\u2593) superfamily, have been identified as the principal HHT-causing genes. Three unrelated Korean HHT patients and their asymptomatic as well as symptomatic family members were genetically diagnosed by sequencing whole exons and their flanking regions of ENG and ACVRL1. Functionality of an aberrant translation start codon, which is created by a substitution mutation at the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of ENG found in a HHT family, was tested by transient in vitro transfection assay. Decay of the mutant transcripts was also assessed by allele-specific expression analysis. Two ENG and one ACVRL1 mutations were identified: a known ENG mutation (c.360+1G > A; p.Gly74_Tyr120del); a novel ENG mutation (c.1-127C > T); and a novel ACVRL1 mutation (c.252_253insC; p.Val85fsX168). We further validated that the 5'-UTR ENG mutation prevents translation of ENG from the biological translation initiation site of the mutant allele, and leads to degradation of the mutant transcripts. This is the first experimental demonstration that a 5'-UTR mutation can prevent translation of ENG among HHT patients, and further supports the previous notion that haploinsufficiency is the primary mechanism of HHT1. Our data also underscore the importance of including exons encoding 5' UTR for HHT mutation screening.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["4"]}

From this point of view, this article has attempted to discuss the limits of orthodontic tooth movement. A relatively wider range of tooth movement is expected after Class III surgical-orthodontics than after conventional orthodontic treatment in general. The purposes of this Paper were: first, to evaluate the reliability of teeth position measuring gauge; and second, to elucidate the limits of orthodontic tooth movement. Dental casts of fifty-fine subjects were analyzed by using Set-up model checker (InVisitec Co., Korea) before and aster the Class III surgical-orthodontic treatment. The changes of maxillary and mandibular dental arch widths were also measured from the canines to the second molars. To test the inter-examiner reliability, randomly selected casts were measured by another examiner. Descriptive statistics and paired t tests were used to explain the tooth movement during treatment. The results showed a relatively good reliability of measuring instruments and a very diverse range of tooth movement. Collective changes by the orthodontic tooth movement evaluated in Class III surgical-orthodontics allowed for a suggestive interpretation of specific treatment patterns. Arch width changes during the inter-arch coordination were mainly the result of tipping in both buccal segments. Based on the results of this study, the possibility of a change in dentition as a result of orthodontic treatment should be understood in order to launch a well-organized plan of treatment.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["4"]}
{"title": "The need for child hospice care in families of children with cancer\n", "abstract": " Purpose: The purpose of this study was to analyze the need for child hospice care programs in families of children with cancer. Methods: The survey of 104 families who were taking care of children with cancer was conducted. This survey was conducted from February 2004 to July 2004 at two general hospitals in Seoul. The data were collected through a self-reporting questionnaire of 22 items. The items were classified into five areas by factor analysis to identify the construct validity. The reliability of the tool was established by Cronbach's alpha as. 94 and the data collected were analyzed by descriptive statistics, t-test and ANOVA. Results: 1) The degree of need for hospice care of the subjects showed a high average of 3.40 (). The need for'emotional care of children'showed the highest mean (M= 3.55),'management of terminal physical symptoms'(M= 3.49),'control of secondary physical problems'(M= 3.41),'acceptance of the family's difficulty'(M= 3.20),'spiritual care for preparing for death'(M= 3.17), respectively. 2) With respect to the demographic characteristics of the subjects, there were statistically significant differences in hospice care needs, according to the child's mother's age (F== 4.980, P=. 009), whether or not there were cancer patients among their siblings or relatives (t= 2.423, P=. 017). Conclusion: The family of children with cancer have a heavy burden of ambivalence, especially in relieving the anxiety and fear of their children, communicating about death, and managing physical symptoms.

The evaluated results of the ACF passive sampler were compared with those of a 3M (Model 3500) passive sampler. At low-humidity condition (8\u252c\u25923% RH), the sampling rates of the ACF passive sampler for volatile organic vapors were within the range of\u252c\u259225% from the results of a charcoal tube, which was the reference method recommended by NIOSH. However, at high humidity condition (90\u252c\u25925% RH), even though the sampling rates for toluene, MIBK, and PCE were within the range of\u252c\u259225%, the sampling rates of the ACF sampler for n-hexane and MEK decreased steeply with time after being high at the beginning of the exposure time. Under this condition, the sampling rate of the 3M passive sampler for MEK was also high at the beginning of the exposure time. In case of the ACF passive sampler, the sampling rates of the relatively strong adsorbates such as toluene, MIBK, and PCE were much less affected by humidity than those of n-hexane and MEK which were weak adsorbates.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["4"]}

{"title": "Estimating membership functions in a fuzzy network model for part-of-speech tagging\n", "abstract": " Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is a process of assigning a POS to each word in a sentence. Because many words are often ambiguous in their POSs, POS tagging must be able to select the most proper POS sequence for a given sentence. Recently, probabilistic approaches have shown very promising results to solve such ambiguity problems. Probabilistic approaches, however, usually require lots of training data to get reliable probabilities. To alleviate such restriction, we use fuzzy membership functions instead of probability distributions. Such a POS tagging model is called a fuzzy network POS tagging model. The membership functions are automatically estimated by using probabilities and neural networks with a learning algorithm. Experiments show that the performance of the fuzzy network POS tagging model is much better than that of a hidden Markov model under a limited amount of training data.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["4"]}

But the net growth rate of each grain appears to increase with its size. The flatness of the liquid film boundaries and their small thickness relative to the cross-sections of bulk liquid at the grain edges and corners indicate that the grain growth is limited by the migration of liquid pockets at the four grain corners, which occurs by solution and reprecipitation between the grain surfaces surrounding them.

However, all lentiviral vector systems derived from HIV-1 must have a viral packaging signal sequence, Psi (\u256c\u00bf), which is placed downstream of 5\u0393\u00c7\u2593 long terminal repeat in a transgene plasmid to effectively package and deliver transgene mRNA. In this study, we examined feasible regions or sequences around Psi that could be manipulated to further modify the packaging sequence. Surprisingly, we found that the sequences immediately upstream of the Psi are highly refractory to any modification and resulted in transgene vectors with very poor gene transduction efficiency. Analysis around the Psi region revealed that there are a few sites that can be used for manipulation of the Psi sequence without disturbing the virus production as well as the efficiency of transgene RNA packaging and gene transduction. By exploiting this new vector system, we investigated the requirement of each of four individual stem-loops of the Psi sequence by deletion mapping analysis and found that all stem-loops, including the SL4 region, are needed for efficient transgene RNA packaging and gene delivery. These results suggest a possible frame of the lentiviral vector that might be useful for further modifying the region/sequence around the packaging sequence as well as directly on the Psi sequence without destroying transduction efficiency.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["4"]}

This study aimed to examine the association of dietary vitamin intakes with plasma pro inflammatory cytokine levels in Korean heart failure patients. Stable outpatients with heart failure were recruited and finally 91 patients were included. Dietary intakes were estimated by a developed semi quantitative food frequency questionnaire. The simultaneous measurement of 17 cytokines was performed along with analysis of plasma C reactive protein. Plasma C reactive protein levels significantly correlated with dietary intakes of vitamin C (r=\u0393\u00ea\u00c6 0.30, p< 0.005), \u256c\u2593 carotene (r=\u0393\u00ea\u00c6 0.23, p< 0.05), and folate (r=\u0393\u00ea\u00c6 0.31, p< 0.005).

{"title": "Identification of novel SNPs in bovine insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP3) gene\n", "abstract": " The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), their receptors, and their binding proteins play key roles in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP3, OMIM# 146732) is one of the proteins that bind to the IGFs. IGFBP3 is a modulator of IGF bioactivity, and direct growth inhibitor in the extravascular tissue compartment. We identified twenty-two novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IGFBP3 gene in Korean cattle (Hanwoo, Bos taurus coreanae) by direct sequencing of full gene including-1,500 bp promoter region. Among the identified SNPs, five common SNPs were screened in 650 Korean cattle; one SNP in promoter (IGFBP3 G-854C), one in 5'UTR region (IGFBP3 G-100A), two in intron 1 (IGFBP3 G+ 421T, IGFBP3 T+ 1636A), and one in intron 2 (IGFBP3 C+ 3863A). The frequencies of each SNP were 0.357 (IGFBP3 G-854C), 0.472 (IGFBP3 G-100A), 0.418 (IGFBP3 G+ 421T), 0.363 (IGFBP3 T+ 1636A) and 0.226 (IGFBP3 C+ 3863A), respectively. Haplotypes and their frequencies were estimated by EM algorithm. Six haplotypes were constructed with five SNPs and linkage disequilibrium coefficients (| D'|) between SNP pairs were also calculated.

{"title": "Tracking control of a robot manipulator using sliding mode controller with fast and accurate performance\n", "abstract": " In a variable structure control algorithm, sliding mode makes the closed loop system insensitive to modelling uncertainties and external disturbances. However due to imperfections in switching, the system trajectory chatters, which is very undesirable, and the insensitivity property of a sliding mode controller is present only when the system is in the sliding mode. To overcome this shortcoming, a sliding mode control algorithm using time-varying sliding surface and PID-like structure is proposed. This controller guarantees robustness during the whole period of control and removes chattering and also reduces steady state error of the system. To demonstrate its performance, the proposed control algorithm is applied to a two link robot manipulator.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["4"]}

By using the ATLAS, a high quality integral effect test database has been established for major design basis accidents of the APR1400. A Domestic Standard Problem (DSP) exercise using the ATLAS database was promoted in order to transfer the database to domestic nuclear industries and to contribute to improving safety analysis methodology for PWRs. This 2nd ATLAS DSP exercise was led by KAERI in collaboration with KINS since the successful completion of the 1st ATLAS DSP in 2009. This exercise aims at effective utilization of integral effect database obtained from the ATLAS, establishment of cooperation framework among the domestic nuclear industry, better understanding of thermal hydraulic phenomena, and investigation of the possible limitation of the existing best estimate safety analysis codes. A small break loss of coolant accident of 6 inch break at the cold leg was determined as a target scenario by considering its technical importance and by incorporating with interests from participants. Twelve domestic organizations joined this DSP 02 exercise. Finally, eleven out of the joined organizations submitted their calculation results, including universities, government, and nuclear industries. This DSP exercise was performed in an open calculation environment where the integral effect test data was open to participants prior to code calculations.

The maximum temperature of the first adiabatic reactor in series adiabatic reaction system raised to 800. From the these results, carbon dioxide in product gas as compared to other systems was increased more than that expected due to water gas shift reaction (WGSR) and the maximum  concentration in SNG was 90.1%. In series adiabatic reaction system with the recirculation as a way to decrease the temperature in catalyst bed, the maximum  concentration in SNG was 96.3%. In cooling wall type reaction system, the reaction heat is absorbed by boiling water in the shell and the reaction temperature is controlled by controlling the amount of flow rate and pressure of feed water. The maximum  concentration in SNG for cooling wall type reaction system was 97.9%. The main advantage of the cooling wall type reaction system over adiabatic systems is that potentially it can be achieve almost complete methanation in one reactor.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["4"]}

Generally, there are three types of SMES-solenoid, multiple solenoid, and toroid. Among these types, toroid type seems to require more wires than solenoid type and multiple solenoid type at the same operating current. However toroid type reduces normal field in the wire and stray field dramatically because magnetic field is confined inside the coil. So, the total length of wire in the toroid type can be reduced in comparison with that in the solenoid type by increasing operating current.In this paper, a 2.5\u252c\u00e1MJ class SMES with HTS magnets of single solenoid, multiple solenoid and modular toroid type were optimized using a recently developed multi-modal optimization technique named multi-grouped particle swarm\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["4"]}

Quadrat samples were taken at three sites: cooling water intake, outfall and Chukbyon. The degree of wave exposure increased from intake, outfall to Chukbyon. Percent cover and biomass were response variables. All sites were, by numbers red algae, followed by brown and green algae. Over the year, the maximum species diversity was also found at the Chukbyon (2.39), but the minimal one (1.67) was observed at the outfall. Seasonally, generally among algal form-functional groups, filamentous and coarsely branched algae were most abundant throughout the year at the three sites. The number of species in the jointed calcareous groups increased remarkably at the outfall. Based on these results, species richness appears to be strongly affected by wave exposure and thermal stress. The higher proportion of calcareous form groups at the outfall sites indicates that these species are better adapted morphologically to thermal stress such as high temperatures.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["4"]}

By applying retort pouch technique to waxycorn storage, the quality of waxycorn could be maintained and the storage expense could be saved during storage. Water activities (Aw) of retort waxycorn were below 0.80 except blanching treatment, and it is known that microbial propagation is subdued below 0.80. Commercial value of waxy corn was deteriorated when it was frozen quickly at  before treating Retort due to obscurity of chromatocity, while the color change was not noticeable when it was treated with Retort at  for 10min. For all treatments, very small amounts of free sugar were detected, however, there were no significant differences between treatments. As storage period was longer, shelf lifes of waxy corn in control and waxy corn treated with blanching were more shortened when waxy corn was stored at  before Retort, while waxy corn with boiling treatment was not significantly different compared with that in storage in freezer.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["4"]}
{"title": "Active principles of the methanol extract of Korean mistletoe responsible for the inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human tumor cell lines\n", "abstract": " A bioassay-guided fractionation of the whole extract of Viscum album var. coloratum Ohwi (Loranthaceae) led to the isolation of two triterpenoidal components; oleanolic acid (1) and  acetate (2), and a flavonoid, homoflavoyadorinin B (3) as well as large quantity of free fatty acid mixtures as active ingredients of the extract responsible for the antitumoral property. The EtOAc soluble fraction and BuOH soluble fraction of the extract demonstrated a significant inhibition on the proliferation of cultured human tumor cells such as A549 (non small cell lung), SK-OV-3 (ovary), SK-MEL-2 (melanoma), XF498 (central nerve system), and HCT-15 (colon) in vitro, whereas the remaining water soluble fraction exhibited a poor inhibition. The intensive phytochemical investigation of the EtOAc soluble fraction and BuOH soluble fraction of the extract indicated that the oleanolic acid (1) and large amounts of free fatty acid mixtures might be attributed to the in vitro antitumoral property of the whole extract of Viscum album var. coloratum.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["4"]}

The aim of this study was to test the accuracy of the assay using pANCA and ASCA in diagnosing pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Sera were collected from 25 patients with IBD (17 with CD, 8 with UC) and 32 healthy controls. The levels of pANCA and ASCA were determined by using a standard indirect immunofluorescence technique on ethanol-fixed granulocytes and an ELISA assay, respectively. In patients with UC, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of the pANCA test were 38%, 88%, and 60%, respectively. Such values were not changed significantly in the case of positive pANCA and negative ASCA. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of ASCA test in diagnosing CD were 71%, 88%, and 92%, respectively. The combination of pANCA negative and ASCA positive was not significant. ASCA and pANCA assays are highly disease specific for CD and UC, respectively. These serological tests can assist clinicians in diagnosing and categorizing patients with IBD and may be useful in making therapeutic decisions.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["4"]}

{"title": "Molecular bases of coronary heart disease in Koreans\n", "abstract": " Coronary heart disease (CHD) has been considered as a multifactorial disorder with the involvement of both environmental and genetic factors. The advent of tools to investigate individual variability of DNA has allowed us to perform the association studies of candidate genes. However, an association between genetic trait and phenotypic variations is not easy to demonstrate and several reported association between genetic markers and risk factors or overt CHD have gone unconfirmed. It should not be assumed that for a given genetic trait, the impact on risk will be similar in all populations. In particular, most studies of the molecular bases of CHD have involved Caucasian subjects, so much more work with the Korean population is needed before genetic testing for susceptibility to CHD can be offered to Koreans as a clinical service. In this review, we discuss two aspects of the molecular bases of CHD: i) Molecular bases of the candidate gene related to lipoprotein metabolism including apolipoprotein AI-CIII-AIV gene duster, apolipoprotein B, apolipoprotein E-CI-CII gene cluster, apolipoprotein (a), LDL receptors, lipoprotein lipase, cholesteryl ester transfer protein, and apo B editing protein; ii) Molecular bases of the candidate gene related to thrombotic and other factors including fibrinogen, factor VII, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, homocysteine, stromelysin, paraoxonase, and angiotensin converting enzyme.

To investigate the presence HI-j strains of S. typhi isolates in Korea, where typhoid fever is still a common infectious problem, we used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a pair of oligonucleotides primers that specifically amplified the flagellin gene of S. typhi. Of 375 isolates of S. typhi tested, only one was shown to possess the HI-j antigen, which was shown by the presence of a 1,269-basepair fragment on agarose gel electrophoresis after the PCR. The isolate with the HI-j antigen was cultured from a Korean-Indonesian man who was already symptomatic in Indonesia and was thought to be an Indonesian strain.

Methods: This study included 2,189 myocardial infarction patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the independent risk factors. We used receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves to compare the ratios of contrast volume (CV) to eGFR with and without BSA normalization in predicting CI-AKI.

Although the etiology of vitiligo is still unknown, several theories have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of vitiligo including autoimmune, neural, self-destruction, oxidative stress, and genetic theories. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G is a nonclassic, major histocompatibility complex class I molecule that plays an important role in suppression of the immune response. Several recent studies have provided evidence that a 14\u252c\u00e1bp insertion (INS)/deletion (DEL) polymorphism in the HLA-G gene might be associated with autoimmune disease. Our aim in this study was to determine whether the 14\u252c\u00e1bp INS/DEL polymorphism in the HLA-G gene contributes to the risk of developing non-segmental vitiligo (NSV) in the Korean population.

Two surveys were conducted. The first survey was conducted at an academic conference, and the second was via post. The conference participants were 200 dental hygienists, and 156 questionnaires were returned. Another 200 dental hygienists received the questionnaire via mail, and 123 returned the questionnaires. There were 279 questionnaires returned in total; however, only 269 questionnaires were included in the analysis. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS 12.0.ResultsJob performance was classified into oral health education, prevention treatment, and dental assisting. Competency was classified into achievement and behavior, personal leverage, and recognition specialty. All competency of dental hygienists was similarly taken, but the factors influencing each competency differed from the contents of job performance. Thus, appropriate education and training programs are needed by dental hygienists. Factors such as recognition specialty competency, age, and core self-evaluation influenced oral health education. Recognition specialty competency and core self-evaluation influenced prevention treatment. Moreover, academic ability and core self-evaluation influenced concertation of treatment.ConclusionsThese results indicate that the dental hygienists who have a more positive attitude have better job performance.

Reversible coating of Prussian blue nanoparticles on the submicrospheres of platinum (II) complexes\n", "abstract": " The submicrospherical morphology is conveniently formed by a reaction of platinum(II) species in water with new pyridyl ligand in acetone, and followed by evaporation of acetone. The amphiphilic properties of ionic platinum(II) complex containing a long aliphatic chain allow to form a monodisperse submicrosphere morphology without any template or additive. A reversible coating of Prussian blue nanoparticles on the submicrospheres has been carried out. Furthermore, the submicrospheres form a unique monolayer on a micro cotton thread or a glass fiber. The ionic and amphiphilic properties of the surface appear to be primarily associated with the easy formation of coating and arrays of monolayer.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["4"]}
{"title": "Comparison of laparoscopic versus open gastrectomy for gastric cancer: a phase III trial (KLASS trial): Interim reports on morbidity and mortality\n", "abstract": " 4641              Background: Recently, in technical aspects, almost all kinds of open gastric cancer surgeries can be reproduced laparoscopically. However, many controversies exist due to no evidence and no long-term results. There was no prospective multi-center large- scale randomized controlled trial in the world on the long-term outcome of laparoscopic gastric cancer surgery. Korean Laparoscopic Gastrointestinal Surgery Study Group, therefore, proposed a multi-institutional prospective randomized trial on comparing laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) versus open distal gastrectomy (ODG) for gastric cancer (KLASS Trial) after the feasibility and validity of these procedures had been evaluated by analyzing retrospective multi-center large series. Methods: Patient eligible criteria are as follows; pathologically proven gastric adenocarcinoma, age: 20 \u0393\u00ea\u255d 80 years, preoperative stage: cT1N0M0\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["4"]}
{"title": "Effects of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine from egg yolk on thermal oxidation of canola oil\n", "abstract": " The principal objective of this study was to assess the effects of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) extracted from egg yolk on the oxidation of tocopherol-stripped canola oil and its browning, as well as their content changes during 12 hr of heating at . PC and/or PE contents in the oil were measured at 200, 500, 1,000, or 2,000 ppm. PL contents in the oil and oil browning were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and spectrophotometry, respectively. The oil oxidation was evaluated by the combination of fatty acid composition, conjugated dienoic acid content, and p-anisidine value. PC was degraded at a slower rate than PE during heating and the co-presence of PE reduced its rate of degradation. PE increased oil browning more profoundly than PC did. PC significantly reduced oil oxidation during heating; however, we noted a possible antagonism between PE and PC in reducing the oil oxidation. Egg yolk PC was a better antioxidant in oil oxidation during heating.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["4"]}

{"title": "Evaluation of dietary manganese intake in Korean men and women over 20 years old\n", "abstract": " This study was peformed to estimate manganese intake and the major food source of manganese in Korean adults. The 354 subjects aged over 20 years were measured anthropometrics and dietary intake using 24-hour recall method. Daily intake and the major food sources of manganese were calculated using manganese database of food composition tables in Korea, USA and Japan. The average age, height, weight and BMI were 54.6 years, 165.7 cm, 67.2 kg and  for men and 53.8 years, 153.7 cm, 59.1 kg and  for women, respectively. The daily energy and manganese intake of men were significantly higher than those of women (1740.9 kcal vs. 1432.6 kcal; p< 0.001, 3.7 mg vs. 3.2 mg; p< 0.01). However, daily manganese intake per 1000kcal between men and women was not significantly different (2.2 mg/1000kcal vs. 2.3 mg/1000kcal). Daily manganese intakes from each food group were 1.9 mg from cereals, 0.5 mg from vegetables, 0.4 mg from pulses and 0.2 mg from seasonings. The 20 major food sources of dietary manganese were rice, soybean, sorghum, Kimchi, tobu, wheat flour, red pepper powder, small red bean, glutinous millet, soybean paste, potato, Ramyeon, green pepper, noodle, buckwheat Naengmyeon, soybean sprout, laver, watermelon, perilla seeds powder and soy sauce. Manganese intake from these 20 foods was 74.0% of the total dietary manganese intake. In conclusion, daily manganese intake of the subject was 3.4 mg (2.2 mg/1000 kcal) and met adequate intake of manganese. The mai or food sources of manganese were cereals, pulses, and vegetables such as rice, soybean, sorghum\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["4"]}

The average size of InAs QDs on the AHC GaAs surface is 29nm, which is larger than 22nm for the conventionally grown InAs QDs on GaAs. The integrated photoluminescence intensity of the InAs QDs on the AHC GaAs measured at room temperature is larger than that of the reference sample by two orders, even though the cleaned GaAs surface directly faced the base of the InAs QDs. The decrease in the interface states between the wetting layer and AHC GaAs was confirmed by Franz\u0393\u00c7\u00f4Keldysh oscillations of the photoreflectance spectra.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["4"]}

The proposed framework plays a key role in implementing HackSim a pen-testing tool that remotely exploits known buffer-overflow vulnerabilities. Implementing our enhanced version of HackSim for Solaris and Windows systems, we show the advantages of our sanitized pen-testing tool in terms of safety compared with existing pen-testing tools and exploit frameworks. This work is stepping toward a systematic approach for substituting difficult parts of the labor-intensive pen-testing process.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["4"]}
{"title": "The effect of repurchase intention on baker shop customer's service quality satisfaction\n", "abstract": " The purpose of this study was to understand the effect of customers' repurchase intention, extract important factors, systematically analyze them and suggest the direction of bakery industry through studying the customers' satisfaction with bakeries. The researcher modified the questionnaire developed by Park, CH (1998), Lee, JH (2000), Yoon, YC (2000), and Kim SE (2002). In order to assess the level of customers' satisfaction with bakeries, a five point Likert scale was used. The used statistical methods for the data analysis were frequency analysis, reliability analysis, t-test factor analysis, ANOVA, multiple regression analysis. For all analyses of the research question, an alpha level of. 05 was used. The major findings obtained from this study were as fellows. First on the factors of reliability and service ability, there was a high difference between males and females, and singles and the married. Second, on the factors of accessibility using convenience, service ability, and service response, there was a high difference among using frequence. Third, on the reliability factors, there was a high difference among average using amount per month. Forth, on the factors of accessibility using convenience, and service response, there was a high difference among types of customers' residing styles. Fifth, on the factors of income level, there was statistically no difference.

{"title": "Characteristics of ballistic tansport in short-channel MOSFETs\n", "abstract": " In a long channel MOSFET whose transport is based on a drift-diffusion model, charge carriers (electrons and holes) experience many scattering events when they are moving in the channel. It is well studied that these scattering events deteriorate transport characteristics resulting in a decrease of the drain current [1]. Recently, due to the remarkable development of semiconductor device fabrication technology, the MOSFET channel length has become shorter and comparable to a carrier scattering length (\u256c\u2557); as a result, the carriers can encounter less scattering events [2\u0393\u00c7\u00f45]. On such a channel length scale, an interesting phenomenon termed\u0393\u00c7\u00d6ballistic transport\u0393\u00c7\u00d6occurs, which implies that the carriers can travel from source to drain like a shooting bullet. From a practical viewpoint, it seems to be impossible to make an ideal ballistic MOSFET within a couple of decades. Thus, it is very informative to investigate a quasi-ballistic MOSFET whose characteristics are between classical drift-diffusion and ideal ballistic transport. In this study, in order to quantify the quasi-ballistic transport, a one-dimensional (1-D) potential profile along the channel is calculated as a function of gate and drain voltages, doping concentration in the source region, channel length, and temperature. The basic structural parameters of a MOSFET used here are as follows: Nd= 1025m\u0393\u00ea\u00c6 3 for source Na= 1.5\u251c\u00f9 1023m\u0393\u00ea\u00c6 3 for substrate, and channel length (L) ranges between 40 nm and 80 nm.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["4"]}

Without the presence of an electric field, the ER fluid exhibits Newtonian fluid behavior. However, when an electric field is applied to an ER fluid, its rheological response demonstrates Bingham characteristics.

One hundred and twenty-two LYD (Landrace  Yorkshire  Duroc) pigs were sampled from an industrial population. Seventy-four pigs (32 gilts and 42 barrows) were administered 3 ml of dietary supplementation of CAFC per day from 25 to 70 days of age, while the remaining 48 pigs (20 gilts and 28 barrows) were fed the same commercial feeding regime without the supplementation. For assessing the dietary effects on pH, objective meat color, cooking loss, water-holding capacity (WHC), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), volatile basic nitrogen (VBN) and fatty acid composition during ageing, 20 barrows (10 of each treatment) were randomly sampled, and aged for 3, 7, 12, 16, 20 and 25 days in a  chiller. The results showed that CAFC-fed pigs required approximately 10 fewer feeding days than the control group. Furthermore, the treatment resulted in greatly higher carcass grade whereby the grade A was increased by approximately 35% and 7% for gilts and barrows, respectively. The treatment had no significant effect (p> 0.05) on pH, meat color and WHC during ageing. On the other hand, the CAFC-fed pigs showed significantly (p< 0.05) lower TBARS values from 20 days of storage. In addition, the sum of unsaturated fatty acids for the treated group was significantly (p< 0.05) higher than that for the control group after the storage time.

A stripe structure of TLCP phase was observed in the blown film, which evidently showed unequal biaxial deformation of the dispersed phase. The compatibilizer helped to deform the dispersed phase in the hoop direction as well as in the flow direction. It was evident that the amount of compatibilizer played a very important role in the dispersion and the deformation of the TLCP phase. It was found that 0.6\u252c\u00e1wt% of the compatibilizer was the optimum amount when 10\u252c\u00e1wt% TLCP was included.

{"title": "Corrosion behavior of metals in supercritical water solutions in the presence of salts\n", "abstract": " The corrosion behavior of constituent metals (Fe, Cr, Mo) of iron-base and nickel-base alloys has been examined in 5 mass% NaCI at temperatures of 300-450 C and at a constant pressure of 30 MPa. The mass changes of pure Cr are very small in the range of 300 to 450 C and their magnitude is close to the limit of detection, whereas pure Fe and Mo show significant mass losses at temperatures of 300 to 450 C. The mass loss of pure Fe is higher than that of pure Mo at 300-350 C, but is lower at 400-450 C. The oxide films on pure Fe, Cr, and Mo consist of Fe304 and 7-Fe203, Cr203, and MoO2 and MOO3, respectively. The surfaces of pure Cr were homogenous and blue in color, but no trace of corrosion. The surfaces of pure Fe were covered with a thick oxide film by the treatment at temperatures of 300 to 450 C. Pure Mo grew up to be uniform oxide layer with a needle-like shape with increasing temperature.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["4"]}

{"title": "Evaluation of mechanical integrity for water cooled generator stator windings in power plants\n", "abstract": " One of the critical points, when the reliable operation of water-cooled generator is concerned, is the mechanical integrity of stator windings. The resonance of stator winding will occur when the intrinsic frequency of each stator winding equals or closes to excitation frequency, 120 Hz, due to an electromagnetic force which occurs always during the normal operation. This resonance may cause the leak of cooling water and/or the life reduction of generator stator due to the high cycle fatigue crack. This paper describes the modeling of generator stator end windings for analysis of the winding vibration behaviors. The result of the analysis has a good agreement with that of field test. A mechanical diagnostic method is also suggested and applied to 500 MW water-cooled generator stator in order to evaluate the mechanical integrity of stator end windings in power plant.

{"title": "Poisoning of the Ni/MgO catalyst by alkali carbonates in a DIR-MCFC\n", "abstract": " The properties of the catalyst for a direct internal reforming type molten carbonate fuel cell were examined by ICP, BET, CHN, EDS, and  chemisorption. Potassium and lithium, the components of carbonate electrolyte, were transported to the catalyst during the operation of fuel cell, and the amounts of the deposited alkali elements were reduced in the order of inlet, outlet, and the middle. From the direct correlation between the amount of alkali and the physical properties such as BET surface area and Ni dispersion, and from the observation of the lump of the alkali species on the poisoned catalyst, it was confirmed that the physical blocking of the catalyst by alkali deposition was the main reason for the deactivation. Although the amount of alkali species was greater at the inlet than at the oulet, the catalyst sampled from the outlet had lower activity. This was caused by the chemical interaction between the alkali species and the catalyst at the outlet where temperature was highest in the cell body, which was detected by FT-IR analyses.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["4"]}
{"title": "Relationship of Renal Implantation Biopsies and Acute Rejection during Immediate Posttransplantation Period\n", "abstract": " Many factors can be recognized for the acute rejection such as: degree of HLA mismatching, cytokine gene expression, ischemic time, etc. Some authors have suggested the importance of early routine biopsy of renal allograft to predict acute rejection. This prospective study on renal implantation biopsies was performed to evaluate the relationship between the implantation biopsies and the acute rejection during the immediate post-transplantation period. From December 1996 to February 1998 implantation biopsies were performed on 46 renal allografts within 40~ 60 minutes after vascular anastomosis using tru-cut needle (18G). Two samples were obtained from transplanted kidney in each patient. Serial sections were stained for the light microscopic examination. The slides were evaluated for histologic features such as interstitial cellular infiltration, nephrosclerosis, tubular damage, glomerular neutrophil count (GL-PMN), and peritubular neutrophil count (PTC-PMN). Forty six biopsies were grouped into acute rejection group (R group, n= 10) and non-rejection group (N group, n= 36) during immediate posttransplantation period (1 month). Acute rejections were confirmed by ultrasonography guided biopsy. Histologic findings were classified according to Banff schema. The statistical analysis was performed by using Chi-Square Test and Spearman Rank Sum Test. During the immediate post-transplantation period, acute rejection developed in 10 cases (21.7%) of which 9 cases were the biopsy-proven rejection. The male to female ratio was 21: 25.

{"title": "An experimental study of electrostatic precipitator plate rapping and reentrainment\n", "abstract": " An electrostatic precipitator is useful for the removal of the particulate emissions from industrial power plants. However, few research papers related to the rapping process to separate fly ash from the collecting plates have been published. In this research, the physical, chemical and electrical characteristics of fly ash generated from coal fired power plants were analysed using a particle counter, a filter sampler, a scanning electric microscope, and a resistivity meter. The evaluation of the rapping process and reentrainment in a laboratory scale electrostatic precipitator is performed using a plate rapping system, an ash feeder, and a power supply. The principal ingredients of fly ash used at present in the coal fired power plant were SiO{sub 2}(65.5%), Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}(24.0%), and Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3}(5.0%). The mass median diameter was measured about 20-30{mu}m. Fly ash resistivity at 150{degree}C was measured over 10{degree} Ohm cm and it was expected that the collection efficiency might decrease due to back-corona phenomena. The rapping efficiency was found to increase with increasing the thickness of ash layer and rapping acceleration. Also the rapping efficiency at power-off in a discharger was higher than that at power-on. The ash size of reentrainment at rapping were smaller than that of the fly ash supplied. The optimal rapping condition was found to be 3.5 mm thick in fly ash layer deposited in the collection plates. Therefore, collection efficiency, rapping efficiency, and reentrainment to design the high efficiency electrostatic precipitator should be considered. 7 refs., 7 figs., 1 tab.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["4"]}

The electrical characteristics of Si NC LED were significantly improved, which was attributed to an enhancement in the current spreading property due to densely interconnecting ITO NWs. In addition, light output power and wall-plug efficiency from the Si NC LED were enhanced by 45% and 38%, respectively. This was originated from an enhancement in the escape probability of the photons generated in the Si NCs due to multiple scatterings at the surface of ITO NWs acting as a light waveguide. We show here that the use of the ITO NWs can be very useful for realizing a highly efficient Si NC LED.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["4"]}

To better quantify sulfur release from the ocean, analysis of the production and distribution of organic sulfur in the ocean is necessary. This report describes a wet-based method for accurate analysis of particulate organic sulfur (POS) in the marine environment. The proposed method overcomes the considerable loss of sulfur (up to 80%) that occurs during analysis using conventional methods involving drying. Use of the wet-based POS extraction procedure in conjunction with a sensitive sulfur analyzer enabled accurate measurements of cellular POS. Data obtained using this method will enable accurate assessment of how rapidly sulfur can transfer among pools.

In a three-dimensional collagen-based culture system, the transduction of COMP-Ang1 into islets significantly increased angiogenesis compared with the bacterial-\u256c\u2593-galactosidase (LacZ)-transduced controls and an intact, nontransduced islet negative control\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["4"]}

Thus, pharmacokinetics of LQ and its two conjugated glucuronide metabolites: 4\u0393\u00c7\u2593-O-glucuronide (M1) and 7-O-glucuronide (M2), in rats with acute hepatitis induced by d-galactosamine/lipopolysaccharide (GalN/LPS) rats or carbon tetrachloride-treated (CCl4-treated) rats were evaluated. LQ was administered intravenously (20 mg kg\u0393\u00ea\u00c6 1) and orally (50 mg kg\u0393\u00ea\u00c6 1) to control GalN/LPS and CCl4-treated rats. Expression of uridine 5\u0393\u00c7\u2593-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases 1A (UGT1A) and in vitro metabolism of LQ in hepatic and intestinal microsomes were also measured. After intravenous administration of LQ, area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of LQ in GalN/LPS rats was significantly smaller than that in controls due to faster non-renal clearance, as a\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["4"]}
{"title": "Fabrication of single-phase titanium carbide layers from MWCNTs using high DC pulse\n", "abstract": " Single-phase layered titanium carbide (TiC) was successfully synthesized by reacting carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and titanium dioxide (TiO 2) under a high direct current (DC) pulse. Single-phase TiC layer fabrication is confirmed as the transformation of multi-layered graphene from MWCNTs. Therefore its thickness and width is almost identical to those of transformed graphene layers. This is the first report on the formation of single-phase layered nano-TiC. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) were used for the characteristic analysis of single-phase layered TiC structures.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["4"]}
{"title": "Estimation of vehicle kilometers travelled and air pollution emission from motorcycles\n", "abstract": " Recently it has reported that the motorcycle is a major source of air pollution in urban area by many studies. But the air pollution emission from motorcycle has been high uncertainty due investigation of a lack of activity data and emission factors in Korea. So in this study, the population of moped and VKT (Vehicle kilometers travelled) of motorcycle are investigated for calculation of the emission from this source categories. As the results, the population of moped is estimated as about 400, 000 and corresponded as 23% of registrated motorcycle which is larger than 50 cc in engine displacement. And it is found that the VKT of moped and motorcycle are investigated as 19.1 km/day and 32.3 km/day. Annual air pollution emission from motorcycle and moped are estimated by investigated VKT and updated emission factors. The nationwide emissions of PM_ {10}, CO, , VOC are calculated as 910 ton/yr, 208, 198 ton/yr, 3, 032 ton/yr and 25, 575 ton/yr in 2008. The contribution ratio of CO, VOC emission from these sources are estimated as 29%, 24% in on-road transport sector and it is confirmed that motorcycle and moped are major air pollution sources in urban area.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["4"]}

{"title": "Effect of the addition of nitrogen gas and annealing on the electrical properties of DLC films deposited by radio frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (RF-PECVD)\n", "abstract": " Nitrogenated diamond-like carbon films (aC: H: N) were deposited on Si-wafers by a rf-PECVD method with the addition of nitrogen to the gas mixture of methane and hydrogen. The effect of the additive nitrogen gas and annealing was investigated in the relationship between the bonding structure and electrical properties of the deposited films. As the flow rate of nitrogen gas and annealing temperature were increased, the film thickness decreased. The electrical conductivity of films increased with an increase in the flow rate of nitrogen up to 10 sccm. However a further increase in the flow rate decreased the electrical conductivity rapidly. Also as the annealing temperature was increased, the electrical conductivity of films increased. The structural analysis results show that an increase of the flow rate of nitrogen and annealing temperature favor the formation of sp 2 bonding in the films. Therefore, It has been confirmed that the increase of the electrical conductivity is due to a structural change by graphitization of the films.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["4"]}

A two-fluid three-field model is used for the two-phase flows. The three fields represent a continuous liquid, an entrained liquid, and a vapour field. An unstructured grid is adopted for realistic simulations of the flows in a complicated geometry. The semi-implicit ICE (Implicit Continuous-fluid Eulerian) numerical scheme has been applied to the unstructured non-staggered grid.

{"title": "NOx Reduction of a Medium Speed Diesel Engine Using a Charge Air Moisturizer System\n", "abstract": " It is well known that water can be used to prevent NOx formation during a combustion process. It is based on the principle by decreasing flame temperature with increasing the specific heat capacity of combustion air by adding water to a combustion chamber. Introducing water into a charge air enables much more water addition into a combustion chamber than other methods, which can reduce NOx emission to lower level than the others. The method has also the advantage of low installation cost. In a general water injection system for a charge air only hot water is sprayed into the charge air and vaporized, but more effective means to introduce water into the charge air is needed because only small amount of water is evaporated in hot water injection system. In this study, steam and hot moisturizing water are injected simultaneously.

This implementation permits the switch to operate at the lower link rate, which can be at 150 Mbit/s, while having the ability to support a virtual circuit at a higher rate (up to 2.4\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["4"]}
{"title": "Validity and reliability of FACES 3 When applied to the one of the family members.\n", "abstract": " Background: Validity and reliability of FACES \u0393\u00e0\u00f3 have been proven by the scores from father-mother-child triad. To date, many studies using the FACES \u0393\u00e0\u00f3 in Korea have been applied to the only one of the family members, and have been conducted without proving their validity and reliability. Therefore, it is required to test validity and reliability of FACES \u0393\u00e0\u00f3 when applied to the one of the family member.Methods: This cross-sectional study was based on FACES \u0393\u00e0\u00f3 self-report inventory reponse of the 227 subjects, who were selected by convenient sampling method in outpatient clinic setting.Results: The Cronbach's alpha coefficient for internal consistency reliability were 0.67 for cohesion, 0.66 for adaptability and 0.78 for total items. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient between cohesion and adaptability was 0.52 (P< 0.001), which did not support the construct validity. Correlation between total score and the sub-categorical items showed, however, content-related validity except item of'role'concept.Conclusion: The validity of FACES \u0393\u00e0\u00f3 applied to the one of the family members seemed not to be proven. Therefore, when applied to one of the family members FACES \u0393\u00e0\u00f3 should be used for careful evaluation of family function type.\u221e\u2524\u00ea\u03b4\u00ed\u00a5\u221e\u00f9\u2591\u03a9\u2561\u00bc\u03b4\u2591\u2591\u03a9\u2593\u255c: \u03a9\u2591\u00c7\u221e\u00ed\u2592\u03a9\u2555\u2591\u03b4\u00e8\u00d1\u221e\u00a5\u00e4 \u221e\u00a3\u00e1\u221e\u00dc\u2310\u03c6\u00f2\u00ff\u03a9\u2593\u00ee \u03b4\u2562\u00e4\u03b4\u00d1\u00ff\u03c6\u00f2\u00e1 \u221e\u00ea\u00ff \u221e\u20a7\u00ea\u03b4\u00ef\u00f1\u03a9\u2502\u00e1 \u221e\u00f2\u00ee\u03b4\u00e1\u00f1\u221e\u00ba\u00e4 FACES III \u03b4\u00e8\u00f6 \u03a9\u2555\u2591\u221e\u00ed\u2524\u221e\u00a5\u00ff \u03c6\u00e2\u00c7\u03b4\u00ef\u2563\u03b4\u00c5\u00e4 \u03b4\u2591\u00c5 \u221e\u00ef\u00e1\u03b4\u00f3\u2591\u03b4\u00c5\u00e4 \u221e\u00ed\u2591\u221e\u00e9\u00bc\u221e\u00f9\u00c9\u221e\u00e4\u00a3 \u03a9\u2591\u00c7\u221e\u00ed\u2592 3 \u221e\u00a5\u2555\u221e\u00a5\u00ff \u221e\u00a5\u00e6\u03b4\u00ef\u2561\u221e\u00a5\u00e4 \u03c6\u00c5\u00eb\u03a9\u2556\u00e1\u03c6\u00f2\u00ff\u221e\u00f9\u00bc \u03a9\u2593\u2591\u03b4\u00ed\u00e1\u221e\u00a5\u00e4 \u03b4\u00c5\u00e4\u221e\u2562\u00a3\u03c6\u00f2\u00ff\u03a9\u2502\u00e1 \u221e\u20a7\u00ea\u03b4\u00ef\u00f1. \u03a9\u2556\u2555\u03b4\u0192\u00bc\u03b4\u00e9\u00ff, \u221e\u00ef\u00f1\u221e\u00e1\u00a3 \u03b4\u00ba\u00c4\u221e\u00a5\u00c7 \u221e\u00f9\u2591\u03a9\u2561\u00bc\u221e\u00f9\u00c9\u221e\u00e4\u00a3\u03b4\u00e8\u00f6 \u03a9\u2591\u00c7\u221e\u00ed\u2592\u03a9\u2561\u00bc\u221e\u00e4\u2592\u221e\u00a2\u00c9 1 \u221e\u00a5\u2555\u221e\u00a5\u00ff \u221e\u00a5\u00e6\u03b4\u00ef\u2561\u03b4\u00ba\u00ee\u221e\u00a3\u255d\u03b4\u00ed\u00a3 \u03a9\u2591\u00c7\u221e\u00ed\u2592\u03a9\u2555\u2591\u03b4\u00e8\u00d1\u221e\u00a5\u00ff \u221e\u00a3\u00e1\u03c6\u00ff\u00f2\u221e\u00a5\u00e4 \u03b4\u2562\u00e4\u03b4\u00d1\u00ff\u03c6\u00f2\u00ff\u221e\u00f9\u00bc \u03b4\u2562\u00e4\u221e\u00e4\u00a5\u03c6\u00f2\u00ff\u03a9\u2502\u00e1 \u221e\u20a7\u00ea\u221e\u00fb\u2524, \u03a9\u2591\u00c7\u221e\u00ed\u2592\u03a9\u2561\u00bc\u221e\u00e4\u2592\u221e\u00a2\u00c9 1 \u221e\u00a5\u2555\u221e\u00a5\u00ff \u221e\u00a5\u00e6\u03b4\u00ef\u2561\u221e\u00a3\u255d\u03b4\u00ed\u00a3 \u221e\u00e1\u00fc\u221e\u00a5\u00e6\u03b4\u00e1\u00d1\u03a9\u2502\u255d \u03a9\u2593\u2591\u221e\u00e5\u00ec\u03b4\u00e1\u00d1\u221e\u00a5\u00e4 \u03a9\u2561\u00bc\u03c6\u00f2\u00e1 \u03a9\u2593\u255c\u221e\u00dc\u2591\u221e\u00a5\u00ff \u03c6\u00e2\u00c7\u03b4\u00ef\u2563\u03b4\u00c5\u00e4\u221e\u00d6\u00c7 \u221e\u00ef\u00e1\u03b4\u00f3\u2591\u03b4\u00c5\u00e4\u03b4\u00d1\u255d \u221e\u00f2\u00ee\u221e\u00f2\u00e4\u03b4\u2502\u2524\u03a9\u2502\u00e1\u221e\u20a7\u00c9 \u03c6\u00f2\u00ff\u221e\u00ff\u00c7\u03b4\u00ef\u00f1.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["4"]}

Using geometrical relationships between the factors, measured values of the flatness and the profile were evaluated and theoretical correlation between the steepness values and the change in crown ratios were confirmed experimentally. As for coil build-up, it was established that a very small trace of a high spot in the hot-coil profile gave rise to a wavy shape in the uncoiled strip. Although the crown ratio of the cold strip became larger than that of the hot strip as the measurement point approached the strip edge, the influence of the profile of the mother strip remained even to a point 15 mm from the edge.

{"title": "Comparison of horizontal and vertical resolvable resolution between repetitive multi-beam surveys using different kinematic GNSS methods\n", "abstract": " Ellipsoid referenced surveying is quickly becoming the standard in hydrographic surveying. Traditionally tidal measurements were used to reduce soundings down to the survey datum. With Kinematic Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) techniques currently providing sub-decimeter level precision, in-situ tide measurements are no longer required for vertical referencing. This places a heavy dependence on GNSS techniques to consistently provide accurate positioning in the horizontal and vertical with low uncertainty. Hydrographers need to know which GNSS technique yields the best solution and if that method works in all conditions. The development of Real Time Networks (RTN) allow for a triangulated Virtual Reference Station (VRS) to be established anywhere in the survey area, eliminating the need for a physical base station set up over a benchmark. This project compares the differences in accuracy and uncertainty between RTN based VRS corrections, Post Processed Kinematic (PPK), Precise Point Positioning (PPP), and Real Time Kinematic (RTK) solutions.

This study involved 897 patients with BMs who underwent radiotherapy between April 2003 and December 2009. Among the clinical parameters, multivariate analysis showed that age, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), combined primary tumor and ECM status, number of BMs, and treatment group were significant prognostic factors for OS (P< 0.05). To compare the discriminatory ability of 5 prognostic indices, ie, recursive partitioning analysis (RPA), basic score for BMs (BSBM), score index for radiosurgery (SIR), graded prognostic assessment (GPA), and modified GPA including the combined primary tumor and ECM status (mGPA), the Akaike information criteria (AIC) were calculated. The mGPA showed the lowest AIC value, followed by RPA, GPA, SIR, and BSBM, in that order.

{"title": "Opioid-induced hyperalgesia is a paradox for perioperative physician\n", "abstract": " Hyperalgesia is defined as\" increased pain from a stimulus that normally provokes pain\" by the International Association of the Study of Pain. Therefore, perioperative opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) could be defined as\" increased perception of pain after opioid-based anesthesia and surgery\". OIH have been identified mainly after remifentanil-based anesthesia in surgical patients. The cumulative, high dose of remifentanil and rapid withdrawal may be factors in remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia.Although OIH is a curious concept, the mechanisms of OIH are not clearly understood. The links between opioid tolerance and OIH are also obscure, though some tried to adapt their mechanical discrimination recently to their clinical reports [1, 2]. The mechanisms of OIH have been postulated in two ways [3]. One is the cellular-level adaptation in desensitization, internalization, downregulation and heterodimerization. The others are the system-level adaptations in descending facilitation, upregulation of spinal dynorphins, neuroplasticity in the rostral ventromedial medulla and dorsolateral funiculus of the spinal cord, downregulation of glutamate transporters and activation of N-methyl--aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Multifactorial mechanisms demonstrate that multimodal efforts to attenuate OIH may be necessary to handle this issue in clinical setting. Multimodal efforts to prevent OIH has been reported, including ketamine [4], nitrous oxide [5], magnesium [6], and pregabalin [7-9]. Moreover, the opioids that are not only \u256c\u255d opioid receptor-mediated but also another mechanismmediated, such as methadone and buprenorphine, seldom demonstrate OIH\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["4"]}

A series of simulations were conducted considering input variables such as the elastic pad thickness, the thickness of plate, and the objective curvature radius. Then, at sampling points in the longitudinal-direction, the shape errors between formed and objective shapes could be calculated from the FE simulations as an output variable. These shape errors were expressed to a representative error value by the root mean square error (RMSE).

In this article, red dyes of phosphorescent materials are used to improve the performance of bulk heterojunction organic solar cells based on MDMO-PPV and PCBM. Solar cell devices doped with different red dyes showed higher performances in terms of current, voltage and conversion efficiency than those without red dyes. The efficiency was maximized in the devices with a 10% concentration of red dye 2, which was attributed to the longer exciton lifetimes that were induced by the triplet spin state of the red dyes allowing them to reach the p\u0393\u00c7\u00f4n junction and thereby generate more photocurrent.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["4"]}

It has been reported that E. sakazakii was isolated from PIF and sunsik ingredients produced in Korea. Some infants have been fed sunsik as a weaning diet. Therefore, it is necessary that this organism should be inactivated on preparing PIF and sunsik at homes and in hospitals.

{"title": "The effects of adipose derived stem cells on neurogenic differentiation and induction of nerve regeneration\n", "abstract": " Using adipose derived stem cells (ASCs), neurogenic differentiation was induced in a mono layered culture medium containing neuronal induction agents. Cells differentiated to the neuronal cells were observed with a inverted microscope and immunofluorecent study. We made a 15 mm long defect in the sciatic nerve of 14 rats and connected a silicone tube to the defect. Then, we mixed neuronal progenitor cells differentiated from ASCs with collagen gel and grafted them to a group of rats (experimental group) and grafted only collagen gel into another group (control group). In 4 and 8 weeks after the graft, histological observation was made. According to the result, the number and diameter of myelinated axons were significantly increased in the experimental group. In addition, the nerve conduction velocity was improved more in the experimental group and neovascularity also increased. Moreover, reaction with S100 and p75 was observed in regenerated nerves in the experimental group, suggesting that the grafted cells were differentiated into supportive cells such as Schwann's cells. In conclusion, this research proved that ASCs can multiply and differentiate into neuronal cells. If they are grafted into nerve defects, the grafted cells are differ entiated into supportive cells such as Schwann's cells and thus contribute to nerve regeneration. Accordingly, the use of adipose tissue obtained easily without the limitation of donor site can be greatly helpful in treating peripheral nerve defects.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["4"]}

In an attempt to reduce screw loosening, dry lubricant coatings such as pure gold or tefron have been applied to the abutment screw. However, under repeated tightening and loosening procedures, low wear resistance and adhesion strength of coating material produced free particles on the surface of abutment screw and increased frictional resistance resulting in screw tightening problems. Purpose. The aim of this study was to compare friction coefficient, adhesion strength, vickers hardness and evaluate coating surface of titanium alloy specimens coated with TiN (titanium nitride), ZrN (zirconium nitride) and WC (tungsten carbide).

Oxalate-supported 45Ca2+ uptake into the SR, a function of the SR SERCA2a activity, was lower in the infant group than in the adult groups. Similarly, [3H]PN200-110 binding, an index of dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) density, was lower in the infant group.

However, the central kitchen type dietitans in cities spent 3 hours more compared to the others. The data from the dietitians' work schedule sheets showed that the 5 parts of dietitian's duties set in the school foodservice laws were not well performed. In the central kitchen type they spent more time for food production whereas in the conventional they spent more time for menu formation and hygiene control. It was found that fatigue levels of school foodservice dietitians were chronic with no difference among foodservice systems or among school locations. Our results indicated that nutrition education in primary schools was almost neglected.

In this paper, we consider load-balancing process allocation for fault-tolerant systems that balances the load before as well as after faults start to degrade the performance of the system. We show two schemes to tolerate multiple faults in the passive replica process model. The rst scheme is running multiple backup processes for each process. The second scheme is running only one backup process for each process, but re-generate backup processes for processes that do not have a backup process after a fault occurrence to keep the primarybackup process pair available. In both schemes, we propose heuristic process allocation methods for balancing loads inspite of the occurrence of a fault. Simulation is used to compare the performance of both schemes. In each scheme, we are able to keep the load balanced reasonably among nodes after a fault occurrence. But, the single backup scheme is more suitable for tolerating multiple faults than the multiple backup scheme since the former has less overhead and better performance.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["4"]}

Virulence and virulence factors, such as the production of cellulase, xylanase, and extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) and swarming motility were significantly decreased in the  mutant. Moreover, the mutation caused the strain to be more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and to over-produce siderophores. Complementation of the mutant restored the mutation-related phenotypes. Expression of , assessed by reverse-transcription realtime PCR and clp promoter activity, was significantly reduced in the rpfB, rpfF, rpfC, and rpfG mutants.

{"title": "Identification of symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in Korean ginseng roots by 18S rDNA sequence\n", "abstract": " Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are ubiquitous in terrestrial ecosystem, forming symbiotic association with roots from the majority of plant species (Smith and Read, 1997a). In exchange for carbon from plant hosts, these fungi can facilitate plant uptake and transport of less mobile soil nutrients (such as phosphorus)(Bolan, 1991; Thingstrup et al., 2000; Jakobsen et al., 2001), enhance drought tolerance (Davies et al., 1993; Ruiz\u0393\u00c7\u00f4Lozano et al., 2001; Kaya et al., 2003) and reduce pathogenic infections (Newsham et al., 1995; Abdalla and Abdel\u0393\u00c7\u00f4Fattah, 2000). Although mycorrhizal fungi are traditionally believed to be non\u0393\u00c7\u00f4host specific in their ability to infect plants, the benefit to each partner in any given interaction between AM fungus and host plant may depend on the particular species involved (Burrows and Pfleger, 2002a; Johnson et al., 2004). It has been well documented that plant species is important as far as impacting individual fungal species or fungal assemblages (Bever et al., 1996; Eom et al., 1994; Eom et al., 2000; Lovelock et al., 2003). Since the root exudates of various plant species may affect the growth and colonization of specific mycorrhizal fungal species differently (Douds et al., 1996; Vierheilig et al., 1998), the co\u0393\u00c7\u00f4existence of more than one plant species might alter mycorrhizal fungal growth, infection activity, spore production and species composition. Since higher plant diversity also likely enhances plant biomass (Tilman et al., 1996; Hector et al., 1999) resulting in a higher density of root material in the soil, coexistence of diverse plant species may better support mycorrhizal fungal growth and increase spore production\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["4"]}

When the deposition potential was varied from 0.35 V to 0.75 V with a fixed frequency of 2 kHz, the reduction current densities for all cases showed asymptotically decaying behaviors after having reached their maximum value. In these potential ranges, single phase Mn  O  films with orthorhombic structures were grown on ITO substrates. From X-ray diffraction measurements, at lower potential, the (200) plane was found to grow preferentially on ITO substrates. However, with increasing potential, the diffraction for (200) decreased, but that for (040) increased linearly. These Mn  O  films consist of lamella-shaped sheets with a mean size of about 1 m.

The inclusion selectivity for isomeric mixtures of trimethylbenzenes and tetramethylbenzene guests by these host frameworks has been examined. The organic residues of the MDS and TMBDS pillars mimic the isomeric trimethylbenzenes and tetramethylbenzenes, respectively, suggesting an avenue to a separations protocol based on molecular recognition during inclusion and subsequent crystallization. Pairwise competition experiments, in which inclusion compounds are crystallized from solutions containing a mixture of two molecular isomers, map the inclusion selectivity of a particular host as a function of guest content in solution. The single crystal structures suggest that guest inclusion selectivity is governed by the ability of a host to achieve efficient packing with the guest molecules and its ability to allow efficient guest-guest packing in the one-dimensional channels. Consequently, the more compliant G2MDS host exhibits higher selectivities for guest inclusion. Overall, the selectivity patterns appear to reflect size and shape compatibility between the host and guest, suggesting opportunities for separations of isomers based on straightforward crystallization processes.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["4"]}

Therefore, we retrospectively compared the effects of anesthetic choice on in-hospital major adverse events (MAEs) and one-year major adverse cardiovascular and cerebral events (MACCEs) in patients undergoing OPCAB. Electronic medical records were reviewed in 192 patients who received propofol-remifenanil total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and propensity score-matched 662 patients who received isoflurane anesthesia. The primary endpoints were in-hospital MAEs and one-year MACCEs. The components of in-hospital MAEs were in-hospital death, myocardial infarction (MI), coronary revascularization, stroke, renal failure, prolonged mechanical ventilation longer than 72 h, and postoperative new cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment. One-year MACCEs was defined as a composite of all-cause mortality, MI, coronary revascularization, and stroke. There was no significant difference in risk of in-hospital MAEs (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 0.88\u0393\u00c7\u00f41.88, P = 0.20) or one-year MACCEs (OR = 0.81; 95% CI = 0.46\u0393\u00c7\u00f41.42, P = 0.46) between the groups. The risk of postoperative new arrhythmia including new atrial fibrillation significantly increased in the TIVA group compared to the isoflurane anesthesia group (OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.12\u0393\u00c7\u00f42.63, P = 0.01).

We assume that the MBMSs are considered for video services such as mobile TV. In order to efficiently serve the users with heterogeneous channel conditions, we employed channel-adaptive video streams by using scalable video coding (SVC), where a realistic multicast configuration is considered for multicasting the SVC streams. Therefore, we designed the cellular system to serve constant and flexible bit rates for the regular services and the MBMSs, respectively. Thus, we consider three objectives when allocating the bandwidth resources, where total transmit power is regulated. First, the bit rate of each regular service has to be guaranteed. Second, the minimum bit rate of each MBMS for achieving the minimum video quality has to be guaranteed. Third, the average video quality of the users requesting MBMSs has to be maximized. In order to achieve the objectives, we propose to quantify the service quality of each service, and then find the resource allocation that maximizes the total service quality. By using the computer simulation results, we could verify that the three objectives can efficiently be achieved. Also, we could verify that the performance of the proposed algorithm is superior to that of the previous algorithm designed to maximize the total bit rate while guaranteeing the minimum bit rates.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["4"]}

Automatically controlling the position and attitude of a ship aims to prevent maritime accidents due to human error. Our goal is to measure the relative distance between a ship and an onshore or offshore target for berthing. Therefore, the distance should be continuously measured while tracking a fixed point on a target. To this end, we developed a stereo camerabased distance measurement system that satisfied these requirements. This paper describes the structure and principle of the measurement system. We validate the distance error for target incline due to the relative position and attitude between a camera and a target in miniature scale. In addition, the findings of an experiment in an outdoor environment demonstrate that the proposed measurement system has accuracy within 1 m at a range of 20-100 m which is the acceptable accuracy for automatic berthing.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["4"]}

{"title": "Cross-current contribution: a study on East Asian influence on modern architecture in Europe\n", "abstract": " This research started from the premise that East Asia-China, Korea and Japan-played a remarkable role in the development of modern architecture. In this study, attention is paid to the lack of a synthetic research about the influence of East Asia on European modernism as a counterpart to its influence on American modernism. Thus, the intention of this paper is to construct an integrated discourse on the East Asian contribution to European modern architecture. By analyzing recently published/presented articles on the related subjects, this study suggests how European modernists encountered the East, what attracted them to the East, and how they applied East Asian aesthetics in their designs. While a number of architects adopted East Asian formal elements directly, at times superficially, others extracted the underlying principles. As a whole, this analysis offers insights at several levels. First, it provides a balance to the view of the East Asian influence on modern architecture by providing an investigation into its influence on European modernism as a counterpart to its influence on American modernism. Second, the multi-faceted nature of modern architecture is further illuminated in this study. Third, an important example of\" positive-Orientalism\" is provided, which contrasts with the rather negative image implied by E. Said's' Orientalism'. In conclusion, this paper provides a critical assessment of the fundamental motive of European modernists' adoption of East Asian aesthetics.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["4"]}

PURPOSE: This study was performed to define attachment and growth behavior of osteoblast-like cells cultured on grooved surfaces of zirconium oxide and evaluate the genetic effect of zirconium oxide surfaces using the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). MATERIAL AND METHODS: MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured on (1) commercially pure titanium discs with smooth surface (T group),(2) yttrium-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystal (Y-TZP) with machined surface (ZS group), and (3) Y-TZP with  grooves (ZG group). Cell proliferation activity was evaluated through MTT assay and cell morphology was examined by SEM. The mRNA expression of Runx2, alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, TGF-, IGF-1, G3PDH in E1 cells were evaluated by RT-PCR. RESULTS: From the MTT assay, after 48 hours of adhesion of MC3T3-E1 cells, the mean optical density value of T group and ZG group significantly increased compared to the ZS group. SEM images of osteoblast-like cells showed that significantly more cells were observed to attach to the grooves and appeared to follow the direction of the grooves. After 24 hours of cell adhesion, more spreading and flattening of cells with active filopodia formation occurred.

{"title": "Comparison of insulin resistance and serum hsCRP levels according to the fasting blood glucose and blood pressure in nondiabetic and normotensive range\n", "abstract": " BACKGROUNDInsulin resistance is a strong contributor to cardiovascular diseases. The increasing prevalence of diabetes and the subsequent complications confers a great importance to the early detection and intervention of diabetes. However, the exact roles of blood glucose and blood pressure in nondiabetic and normotensive range to vascular complications are not precisely defined. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels have consistently been associated with various cardiovascular endpoints in a number of studies. The aim of this study was to find out whether the insulin resistance and hsCRP, a non-traditional cardiovascular risk factor, increase according to the fasting glucose and blood pressure levels in nondiabetic and normotensive individuals.METHODSIn 7,979 participants (4,847 males, 3,132 females, mean age 46 yrs) undergoing medical checkup program in Kangbuk Samsung Hospital, blood pressures, body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, lipid batteries and hsCRP levels were checked. All participants were subdivided into 5 groups according to fasting glucose level and into 4 groups according to the blood pressures. Homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) were calculated.RESULTSHOMA-IR and QUICKI increased according to the increment in fasting glucose and blood pressure in nondiabetic and normotensive range (p< 0.01). Log (hsCRP) level significantly increased in proportion to the increment in fasting glucose and blood pressure in nondiabetic and normotensive range (p< 0.01).CONCLUSIONInsulin\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["4"]}

{"title": "Forming Limit Prediction in Tube Hydroforming Processes by Using the FEM and FLSD\n", "abstract": " Among the failure modes which can occur in tube hydroforming such as wrinkling, bursting or buckling, the bursting by local instability under excessive tensile stresses is irrecoverable phenomenon. Thus, the accurate prediction of bursting condition plays an important role in producing the successfully hydroformed part without any defects. As the classical forming limit criteria, strain-based forming limit diagram (FLD) has widely used to predict the failure in sheet metal forming. However, it is known that the FLD is extremely dependant on strain path throughout the forming process. Furthermore, The application of FLD to hydroforming process, where strain path is no longer linear throughout forming process, may lead to misunderstanding for fracture initiation. In this work, stress-based forming limit diagram (FLSD), which is strain path-independent and more general, was applied to prediction of forming limit in tube hydroforming. Combined with the analytical FLSD determined from plastic instability theory, finite element analyses were carried out to find out the state of stresses during hydroforming operation, and then FLSD is utilized as forming limit criterion. In addition, the approach is verified by a series of bulge tests in view of bursting pressure and shows a good agreement. Consequently, it is shown that the approach proposed in this paper will provide a feasible method to satisfy the increasing practical demands for judging the forming severity in hydroforming processes.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["4"]}

For character-based retrieval in TV programs, face detection and recognition are necessary. To be applicable to real character retrieval service, these face detection and recognition methods should provide the accuracy as well as real-time execution. For this, we have already proposed a fast face recognition method that uses DCT/LDA method.

{"title": "Effects of cyclocreatine in rat hepatocarcinogenesis model.\n", "abstract": " Cyclocreatine (CCr), a substrate analogue of creatine kinase (CK: EC 2.7. 3.2.), exhibits anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo. We examined the effects of CCr on the hepatocarcinogenesis of F344 rats caused by treatment with diethylnitrosamine (DEN), partial hepatectomy (PH) or 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF). The rats were given a single intraperitoneal injection of 200 mg of DEN per kg in 0.85% NaCl solution at four weeks of age. Two weeks later they were divided into two groups. One group was continuously fed a commercial powder diet containing 0.02% 2-AAF for 12 weeks and the other was continuously fed a commercial powder diet containing 1% CCr plus 0.02% 2-AAF for 12 weeks. A third group of rats as a control was given only a normal powder diet for 12 weeks. All the groups were subjected to a two-thirds partial hepatectomy (PH) at 3 weeks under avertin anesthesia. To elucidate the inhibitory effect of CCr on chemical induced hepatocarcinogenesis, we examined not only the distribution of glutathione-S-transferase placental form (GST-P) a marker used for tumorigenesis, but also the inhibition of the degree of apoptosis. The number (No./cm2) and area (mm2/cm2) of GST-P positive liver foci were significantly lower in the 2-AAF+ CCr treated when compared to the group treated with 2-AAF only. Our data suggest that CCr inhibits the degrees of GST-P-positive cells and apoptosis and is active against hepatocarcinogenesis in rat models.

{"title": "Functions of the prefrontal cortex in the human brain\n", "abstract": " The prefrontal cortex of the human brain is affected by various pathological conditions, and for the apparent theoretical gains and clinical benefits, brain scientists and clinicians alike have for decades endeavored to understand the precise role of this region of the brain. Recent findings in electrophysiological and functional neuroimaging studies provide a better insight into the neuronal activities during various cognitive processes performed by the prefrontal cortex. Nevertheless, some of these findings are at odds with others, and the theorized roles of the prefrontal cortex remain largely under dispute. On the clinical side, a longer history of research provides a wealth of symptom descriptions on the multifaceted prefrontal dysfunction. In the midst of this abundance, however, there still exists a need for coherent categorization of these seemingly disparate symptoms. This task could be done based on the nature of affected cognitive processes and their putative neural substrates. With this view in mind, the present article selectively reviews major anatomical evidence and experimental data together with clinical observations on prefrontal patients in an attempt to integrate findings in science with behavioral data and ultimately to propose a model of functional organization within the prefrontal cortex.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["4"]}

We found that ginsenosides Rbl and Rg3 significantly attenuated glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. Brief exposure of cultures to excess glutamate caused extensive neuronal death. Glutamate-induced neuronal cell damage was significantly reduced by pretreatment with Rbl and Rgl. Ginsenosides Rbl and Rg3 inhibited the overproduction of nitric oxide which routinely follows glutamate neurotoxicity and preserved the level of superoxide dismutase in glutamate-treated cells. Furthermore, in cultures treated with glutamate, these ginsenosides inhibited the formation of malondialdehyde, a compound produced during lipid peroxidation, and diminished the influx of calcium. These results show that ginsenosides Rbl and Rg1 exerted significant neuroprotective effects on cultured cortical cells. As such, these compounds may be efficacious in protecting neurons from oxidative damage produced by exposure to excess glutamate.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["4"]}

Precipitation showed no significant correlation with the lake water level for time lags of 0, 1, and 2 months. This suggests that variation in land-surface hydrological processes are key to the interannual variability in water levels in the lake. In contrast, SST in the central tropical Pacific was strongly correlated with the lake water level for all time lags. No significant correlation was found between the lake water level and SST in the Indian Ocean adjacent to Kenya, although significant correlations were found between regional precipitation and SST in the Indian Ocean.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["4"]}

The ratio of the length of the diffuser entrance to the nozzle exit diameter was set to 0, 50, and 100%. In addition, flow characteristics were studied for a range of length-to-diameter ratios of the secondary throat diffuser. An insufficient diffuser entrance length caused contraction of the plume immediately after the nozzle exit. When the length-to-diameter ratio was less than 8, a strong Mach disk was formed inside the diffuser, resulting in a sharp increase in pressure. In addition, flow characteristics in the diverging part of the diffuser were investigated for a range of diverging part lengths. A short diverging part may lead to abrupt pressure recovery, resulting in the possible application of mechanical load to the diffuser.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["4"]}

We present here a case of primary gastric leiomyosarcoma in a 79-year-old man who presented with a 10 day history of epigastric pain and gastric subepithelial tumor. Endoscopic examination showed a 5 cm in diameter, subepithelial tumor located in the body of the stomach. Radiological investigations showed nonspecific findings except for the primary gastric lesion. Complete histological evaluation including immnuohistochemical staining after complete surgical resection revealed a true leiomyosarcoma of the stomach. One year later, the patient presented with dyspepsia. Endoscopic and radiological evaluation showed a recurrent leiomyosarcoma with multiple liver metastases. Our experience suggests that a careful clinical follow-up after surgical resection should be recommended in patients with gastric leiomyosarcomas because of their aggressive clinical behavior.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["4"]}

Although LV dP/dt measured by Doppler echocardiography has been shown to be a good marker for LV contractility, it is limited clinically due to the complexity of the measurement and the difficulty in obtaining appropriate Doppler tracings in patients with eccentric MR. We hypothesized that systolic mitral annulus velocity (S') can be a good marker of LV dP/dt.MethodsWe studied 62 patients (25 men, age: 47\u252c\u259215 years) who had 3+ or 4+ MR with normal LV systolic function (ejection fraction> 50%). Two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography was performed. LV dP/dt-Doppler was measured using MR jet tracing as previously reported. S'velocity was measured at the septal annulus using Doppler tissue imaging. In 10 patients undergoing mitral surgery, LV pressure was measured with micromanometer-tipped catheter and peak dP/dt-cath was calculated.ResultsMean LV ejection fraction was 60\u252c\u25926% and regurgitant fraction was 59\u252c\u259215%. S'velocity correlated well with LV dP/dt-Doppler (r= 0.50, p< 0.01). In 10 patients who underwent LV catheterization, LV dP/dt-Doppler correlated well with peak dP/dt-cath (r= 0.68, p= 0.03). Whereas S'velocity could be measured in all patients, LV dP/dt-Doppler could not be measured in 31 patients (50%) due to eccentric jet direction.ConclusionSystolic mitral annulus velocity is a simple and feasible marker of LV dP/dt and, therefore, may be useful for assessing myocardial contractile function in patients with MR.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["4"]}

Analyzing vessel formation and elongation towards the concentration gradient of the tumor-derived angiogenetic basic fibroblast growth factor, bFGF, we assumed that prior to the blood vessels reaching the tumor surface, the resulting pattern of tumor growth is symmetric, circular with a common center point. However, after the vessels reach the tumor surface, we assumed that the growth rate of that particular cancer region is accelerated compared to the tumor surface section that lacks neo-vascularization. Therefore, the resulting asymmetric tumor growth pattern is biased towards the site of the nourishing vessels. The simulation results show over time an increase in vessel density, a decrease in vessel branching length, and an increase in fracticality of the vascular branching architecture. Interestingly, over time the fractal dimension displayed a sigmoidal pattern with a reduced rate increase at earlier and later tumor growth stages due to distinct characteristics in vessel length and density.

In India, JFM was started during 1992 and it was implemented in many states. However success rate of JFM activity was not promising. Though there are many factors attributed to the failures, one of the main factors is the JFM site. This paper deals with the significant ground works to be done before planning for JFM using recent technologies such as remote sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS). Also it deals with the advantages of weighted overlay analysis in selecting suitable sites for JFM taking into consideration the various criteria. As a result of weighted overlay analysis, there were four types of suitability classes viz., less, moderate, highly and un-suitable. The moderately suitable class occupied maximum area (13209.64 ha) than less and highly suitable classes. If JFM is implemented on the suitability area, then the failure could be avoided in the future.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["4"]}

Since the first blade has a low thermal conductivity coefficient, the heat generated in the coils is prevented from being transferred to the objective lens, whereas the second blade having a high thermal conductivity coefficient radiates the heat generated by the coils to the outside. Thus, the heat distortion of the objective lens can be suppressed, and damages to the coils or rigidity reduction of the blade can be avoided.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["4"]}

In order to realize automatic ship berthing, it is indispensable that the berthing assistant system on the ship should continuously trace a target in the berth to measure the distance to the target and the ship attitude, such that we can make the ship move to the specified location. The considered system is made up of 4 apparatuses compounded from a CCD camera, a camera direction controller, a popular PC with a built in image processing board and a signal conversion unit connected to parallel port of the PC. The object of this paper is to reduce the image processing time so that the berthing system is able to ensure the safety schedule against risks during approaching to the berth. It could be achieved by composing the vector code image to utilize the gradient of an approximated plane found with the brightness of pixels forming a certain region in an image and verifying the effectiveness on a commonly used PC. From experimental results, it is clear that the proposed method can be applied to the measurement system for automatic ship berthing and has the image processing time of fourfold as compared with the typical template matching method.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["4"]}

It exists in either its reduced (homo cysteine, RSH) or oxidized form (homocystine, RS SR), and the oxidized form the major one in human blood plasma. 1, 2 Since it contains sulfur in its structure, it was also used to modify the electrode surface for the electrocatalytic detec tion of another compound, such as catecholamine. 3 Homocysteine is usually determined by using fluore scence, 4 UV/Vis, and electrochemical6 detection methods. Spectroscopic detection requires derivatization of homo cysteine, and electrochemical detection needs electrodes that enable continuous measurements. However, electrochemical detection has a representative advantage, which is to be able to detect homocysteine without any additional derivati zation, if electrodes are free from adsorption. Modified electrodes can solve the problem caused by adsorption and then have high reproducibility for repetitive measurements. A self-assembly technique for electrode modification is simple and has diverse materials for modification. A number of organic compounds containing the thiol group can readily adsorb on the electrode surface, such as gold, and form a self-assembled monolayer (SAM). Macrocyclic complexes with an electrocatalytic effect can be used to determine homocysteine for higher sensitivity and reproducibility, if they can form a SAM on the electrode surface.

{"title": "Electronic neurons: From biomimetic robots to blast neurorehabilitation\n", "abstract": " We are developing controllers for biomimetic robots and neuro-rehabilitative devices based on electronic nervous systems (ENS). These networks are formed from artificial neurons based on nonlinear dynamical models of neuron and synapse behavior. UCSD electronic neurons (ENs) are analog computers that solve the Hindmarsh-Rose equations relating the four degrees of freedom of neurons [1]. Discrete Time Map-based (DTM) neurons are computationally efficient models based on a simple iterative map [2]. Chemical-based synapse models are present for both types of models and allow the generation of realistic neuronal circuits. We have performed feasibility studies to demonstrate that EN networks can realize all of the fundamental integrative processes to allow biomimetic robot control including, central pattern generation, graded command, intersegmental coordination and proprioceptive modulation. DTM networks are also used to construct CPG networks and are well suited to the rapid prototyping of higher order command and exteroceptive reflex networks. ENS controllers are also suitable for the development of neurorehabilitative devices for blast injury. Constraint Induced (CI) Movement therapy has recently been shown to be efficacious for traumatic brain injury (TBI). CI therapy is capable of reversal of the learned nonuse components of brain trauma. TBI and presumably blast victims often present more severe deficits than many stroke victims.

OPG-knockout mice develop early-onset osteoporosis and arterial calcification. Recent studies report that serum OPG levels are elevated in diabetic patients with cardiovascular disease and are associated with the presence and severity of coronary artery disease. We examined the relationships between serum OPG levels and insulin resistance, bone metabolism and cardiovascular risk factors in diabetic patients.METHODSIn 84 diabetic patients (33 men, 51 women, mean age 56.7 years old) were studied. Blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose, postprandial 2-hour blood glucose, fasting insulin and lipid profiles were measured. Serum OPG levels were measured with sandwich ELISA method. Bone mineral density (BMD) s were checked and serum osteocalcin and urine deoxypyridinoline levels were checked as bone turnover markers. 24-hour urine microalbumin were checked and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) were evaluated with echocardiography. From simple chest X-ray, the presence of aortic calcification were confirmed by a trained radiologist. Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)-insulin resistance (IR), quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) were calculated as insulin resistance indices.RESULTSSerum OPG levels were positively correlated with age, LVMI, HOMA and negatively correlated with lumbar spine BMD and QUICKI.

The Wiener system consists of a linear time-invariant system (LTI) in cascade with a static nonlinear part (y) at the output. We assume that the uncertain static nonlinear part is sector bounded and decoupled. In this research, we treat the static nonlinear part as multiplicative uncertainty by dividing the nonlinear part (y) into (y):= (y)-y and y, and then we reduce this stabilizing problem to a Lur'e problem. As a result, we show that the servo system with no steady state error for step references can be constructed for the Wiener system.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["4"]}

{"title": "Insulin requirement for Korean type 1 diabetics using continuous insulin infusion with portable external pumps\n", "abstract": " BACKGROUNDInsulin pumps can be extremely effective in achieving a normal or near-normal blood glucose level in type 1 diabetic patients. For designing a pump program in western countries, it has been recommended that approximately half of the daily insulin dose should given in the basal infusion, and the other half make up the meal-related bolus dose. However, peoples' diet composition is quite different among the many countries. The carbohydrate composition in the Korean diet is higher (60~ 65%) than that in the western diet (45~ 50%). Carbohydrate is much more glycemic than protein or fat. Therefore, we evaluated the basal and meal-related insulin requirements for Korean type 1 diabetics by using continuous insulin infusion with portable external pumps.METHODSTwenty three type 1 diabetic patients were admitted for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), and they were given a calculated diet (60% carbohydrate, 20% protein, and 20% fat). The Basal rates were set for the blood glucose levels to remain in the target range during 12 hour fasting state. The meal related bolus dose was set to remain in the target range at the premeal state.RESULTSThe daily total insulin requirement was 99.7+/-0.3% of prepump insulin dose, and 0.57+/-0.21 unit per kilogram of body weight. The basal and mealrelated insulin dose among the daily total insulin requirements were 33.7+/-8.6 and 66.3+/-8.6%, respectively.

The newer lower-osmolar nonionic contrast agents cause significantly lower adverse reactions than the high-osmolar ones. However, anaphylactoid reaction to nonionic contrast agent can cause life-threatening events and even death has been rarely reported. Iodixanol (Visipaque (R)) is a nonionic, dimeric contrast agent, which is currently used in cardiac catheterization. Here we report a case of anaphylactoid reaction to Iodixanol, a nonionic radiocontrast agent, during cardiac catheterization. A 45-year-old male patient underwent cardiac catheterization for evaluation of substernal pain during exercise. Five minutes after this contrast injection to the left coronary artery, he complained itching and dizziness. Subsequently, generalized urticaria, cyanosis and hypotension were developed. His coronary angiogram showed normal findings. He was treated with intravenous fluids, intravenous diphenhydramine, sucutaneous epinephrine and sympathomimetics and one hour later he recovered. This case suggests that anaphylactoid reaction to a radiocontrast media, iodixanol, should be considered in the list of differential diagnoses for cardiopulmonary arrest during cardiac catheterization.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["4"]}

Joint phase synchronization and detection are implemented by means of a set of suboptimal adaptive soft-input soft-output (SISO) algorithms.

Among mono-substituted benzyl radicals, the fluorine sub stituted radicals have been well examined due to the strong emission intensity. 3 The highly symmetric p-fluorobenzyl radical has been extensively studied by many experimental techniques. 3-6 Many of the vibrational modes have been assigned by the LIF-DF spectra4 and theoretical calculations. Recently, the vibronic emission spectra of meta-and ortho isomers8 have been observed by the technique of corona excited supersonic expansion. Although chlorine substituted benzyl radicals are believed to be important intermediates in the combustion process of chemicals containing chlorine atom, the spectroscopic studies are limited due to the weak intensity of fluorescence in the visible region. It has been well known that the fluorescence intensity of aromatic compounds quickly decreases with the increasing mass of substituents on the aromatic ring. Of three chlorobenzyl radical isomers, the p-chlorobenzyl radical has been observed in the liquid phase9 as well as in the gas phase, 10, 11 in which several vibrational modes were assigned from\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["4"]}

In Korea, it is the fourth common malignancy and the incidence has been rising over the past 10 years. We studied respectively to analyse prognostic factors in patients with colorectal cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS893 patients with primary colorectal carcinomas who were operated at our hospital between 1989 and 1997 were reviewed. We examined possible prognostic factors such as, age and sex of patients, size and location of tumors, preoperative serum CEA and CA19-9 level, modified Dukes stage, operative methods, and lymph node metastases.RESULTSOverall 5-year survival rate was 61.8%. The 5-year survival rates in modified Dukes stage A, Bl, B2, Cl, C2 and D were 100%, 89.4%, 72.5%, 63.3%, 55.1% and 21.5%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that age, modified Dukes stage, preoperative serum CEA and CA19-9 level, and lymphatic metastases were significant factors. The size of tumor was a significant factor in rectal carcinomas but not in colon carcinomas. In extraperitoneal rectal carcinomas, there were no survival differences between low anterior resection and abdominoperineal resection groups.

The crystal growth characteristics are such that the insulating layer does not allow crystal growth on its upper surface. During its growth, the buffer layer makes reverse sloped side edges which join to form a void. A gate electrode formed above the void separates a channel from the substrate. In the \u256c\u2524-MESFET, side walls are formed at both sides of the gate electrodes and an N+-well region is formed by using the side walls as an ion implanting mask. Accordingly, the void separates the channel from the semiconductor substrate, thereby preventing leakage current through the buffer layer, backgating effects in an integrated circuit, and completing crystal growth without an undue effort for lowering the impurity concentration of the buffer\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["4"]}

The architecture takes advantage of the knockout principle to obtain tradeoff between the hardware complexity and the cell loss probability.

The hardware complexity of the switch, O(LNlog(LN)) where L is the number of cells allowed into an output queue in a single time slot and N is the number of ports, is comparable to the input queuing Batcher-banyan switch (O(Nlog/sup 2/N)), but performance is consistent with other more complex output queuing architectures.< >", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["4"]}

The amplified 5'-side fragment of GLUT2 cDNA was inserted into pGEM4Z and named pGLGT1, and the 3'-side fragment of GLUT2 cDNA was inserted into the HindIII site of pGLGT1 to construct pGLGT2 which contains an entire open reading frame of GLUT2 cDNA. The GLUT2 cDNA in pGLGT2 was transferred to an eukaryotic expression vector (pMAM) to construct pMLGT, which was expressed in the insulin-sensitive Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Western blot analysis showed that the GLUT2 gene in pMLGT was expressed in the transfected CHO cells successfully. The GLUT2 content in the plasma membrane fraction of insulin-treated CHO cells expressing GLUT2 increased 3.8-fold compared to that of the control group. This result suggests that GLUT2, which is not subjected to translocation by insulin in the cells of its major distribution, can be translocated if it is expressed in the suitable cells sensitive to insulin action.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["4"]}

It may be difficult to compare the control performances of two types. But, if we consider this problem in point of usefulness, we can easily find out that the winch control system is more useful and applicable to the real field than the thrust control system except a special use. Therefore, in this paper we consider a single type mooring winch system and control system design problem in which accurate position control is needed. Because this result can be extended to the general type mooring system in which a number of winch are installed.

The Cd content in the soybean was 0.02~ 0.05 mg/kg, which is within the safety level set in the standard, and that of Pb was 0.02~ 0.15 mg/kg, which is also within the safety level except for IS 45 Mg/ha. The soybean harvest quantity was higher in the treatment groups than the control group in the first year. However, in the second year, SS had lower harvest and IS had the same level or a decreasing tendency, compared with the control group. In the first year, the content of amino acid which followed handling of SS was increased in the sludge groups more than in the control group in the case of glutamate. However, the influence of continuous application was increased in the sludge groups in the case of amino acids of 12 types.

Introduction nmanned aircraft systems have recently attracted the attention of researchers. Numerous studies have attempted to develop the unmanned aircraft for not only military applications, such as reconnaissance and attack operations, but also civilian applications, such as traffic monitoring. The most important for the aircraft system is the navigation system which estimates its current position. The INS (Inertial Navigation System) is one of early techniques and commonly utilized in conventional aircraft navigation1. An INS estimates current position, velocity, and attitude of an aircraft by integrating sensory data of accelerometer and gyro rate sensor, given initial conditions. Consequently, the INS suffers from error accumulation. That is, the error of estimated value tends to drift as the time goes. Hence, in order to recalibrate INS solutions, GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) is usually integrated to the INS2\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["4"]}

Genotyping was carried out using the TaqMan assay, and differences in genotype frequency distributions were analyzed using logistic regression models. Results: Nominal associations were found between ZNRD1rs1150740and risk of AERD via codominant and dominant genetic inheritance (P=. 03; odds ratio, 1.14 [1.14-10.16]). The same polymorphism was found to be significantly associated with a decrease in forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration, an important diagnostic marker of AERD, even after multiple testing corrections (P=. 006, Pcorr=. 03 in codominant and dominant models). Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest a possible relationship between ZNRD1 and aspirin-induced respiratory dysfunctions in a Korean population and provide essential information on the etiology of AERD.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["4"]}

An automatic berthing system is a solution to relieve psychological and physical strains on the operator in berthing maneuvering that is the most difficult and delicate phase. Usually, a sensor system for the automatic berthing system should accommodate ship movements such as rolling, pitching, and yawing, in order to continuously measure the relative distance from the ship to a dock in a port. For acquiring the accommodation to the ship movements, the proposed measurement system is composed of two movable image sensors, and measures the relative distance by detecting and tracking a target on the dock. Additionally, a template matching method robust to light fluctuation in outdoor environment, named the vector code correlation, is employed to the movable image sensor for the target detection\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["4"]}

Renal function was estimated by Cockroft-Gault equation at 6 month, 1 year, 2 year after transplantation and creatinine reduction ratio on post-transplant day 2 (CRR2).RESULTSThe mean age of deceased donor was 41.1+/-10.4 (male: n= 55; female: n= 22) and the mean last eGFR before procurement was 72.6+/-4 and HLA mismatching was 3.46+/-1.4. Renal function at 6 months was associated with donor age and last eGFR before procurement. Deceased donor score was ranged from 2 to 26. The number of each grade using the score system by Nyberg et al was 18 in A, 39 in B, 19 in C. The score showed negative correlation with eGFR at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years (P< 0.05), but the R-square values were low.

To get better performance in there, many layer-2 spanning tree based Ethernet routing schemes have been proposed, such as spanning tree protocol(STP), multiple spanning tree protocol(MSTP), shortest path routing(SPB) and a special backbone routing scheme called ENDIST. We deal with analytic models that can analyze and compare these routing schemes. Previously an ideal model was proposed that calculate perfect scheduling and allows packet loss only at the source node to maximize the throughput. The analytic model in this paper practically assumes that packets are transmitted as much as possible and allows packet loss fairly during transfer at each node. We mathematically define this greedy analytic model and compare and analyze Ethernet backbone routings from the point of throughput.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["4"]}

Methods: We reviewed 17 medical records of chronic renal failure patients who underwent RTx from April 1992 and June 2004 at Busan Paik Hospital. Age and sex distribution, cause of disease, donor analysis, patient and graft survival rate, and the status of growth after RTx were analysed by retrospective study. Results: Eighteen RTx were performed in 17 patients (8 boys, 9 girls). The mean age at the time of RTx was  years and the mean duration of dialysis therapy before RTx was  months. The 1 year and 5 year patient survival rate were each 100%, and the 1 year and 5 year graft survival rate were 88%, 36% respectively. The most common cause of graft failure was chronic rejection. The mean final height of male patients was  cm (143.0-172.5 cm) and of female patients was  cm (135.8-160.0 cm).

The KSTAR superconducting magnet system consists of 16 D-shaped toroidal field (TF) coils, 3 pairs of poloidal field (PF) coils, and 4 pairs of central solenoid (CS) coils. Two kinds of SC coils have been fabricated and tested in the coil test facility in the Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI). One of the coils was a prototype TF coil, TF00 coil, which has been fabricated in the same size as the real coils using Nb3Sn SC cable-in-conduit conductor (CICC). The other was a pair of CS model coils, which were fabricated as a part of a background field system to test the superconductor in a pulsed field environment. The major objectives of the SC coil tests were (i) to verify the coil design and fabrication process in the KSTAR coil development, (ii) to measure the coil performances during cool-down, current excitation, and discharge scenarios, and (iii) to achieve the operational experience of the SC coil test facility and the SC magnet system in the KSTAR device.

{"title": "Stock Market Condition and Pricing of Initial Public Offerings: A Theory and Evidence from the KOSDAQ Stock Market\n", "abstract": " In this paper we incorporate downward sloping demand curve into the well-known winner's curse model of Rock (1986) that explains the underpricing in IPOs, and examine the additional implications that this has in the pricing of the IPO. Specifically, we derive theoretical implications on how the degree of underpricing changes both in the size of IPOs and in the size of active investors. Our theory predicts the same relationships as the basic winner's curse theory of Rock in the \"cold issue\" markets. Unlike Rock's theory, however, our model shows that these relationships may change in the \"hot issue\" markets. This possibility of systematic dependence of the relationships on the market condition as indicated in our theory, is shown to be empirically supported by the IPo data in the KOSDAQ stock market.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["4"]}

Materials and Methods: From February 1992 through January 1997, 120 patients with early breast cancer were treated with conservative surgery and postoperative radiotherapy. The types of conservative surgery were quadrantectomy and axillary node dissection for 108 patients  and lumpectomy or excisional biopsy for 10 patients . Forty six patients  received adjuvant chemotherapy (CMF or CAF). Cosmetic result evaluation was carried out between 16 and 74 months (median, 33 months) after surgery. The cosmetic results were classified into four categories, ie, excellent, good, fair, and poor. The appearances of the patients' breasts were also analyzed for symmetry using the differences in distances from the sternal notch to right and left nipples. A logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent variables influencing the cosmetic outcome. Results: Cosmetic score was excellent or good in (91/120), fair in (23/120) and poor in (6/120) of the patients. Univariate analysis showed that tumor size (T1 versus T2)(p= 0.04), axillary node status (N0 versus N1)(p= 0.0002), extent of surgery (quadrantectomy versus lumpectomy or excisional biopsy)(p= 0.02), axillary node irradiation (p= 0.0005) and chemotherapy (p= 0.0001) affected cosmetic score.

Sprague-Dawley male rats weighing 100 10g were randomly assigned to one normal group and three cadmium poisoned groups. Cadmium groups were classified to catechin free diet (Cd-0C group) 0.25% catechin diet (Cd-0.25 C group) and 0.5% catechin diet (Cd-0.5 C group) according to the levels of catechin supplement. Animals were raids for 20weeks. Cadmium were supplied as drinking water of 50ppm Cd2+ Morphological changes shown through a light microscope and an electro-microscope revealed the mitochondria and tubule epithelial cell edema in Cd-0C group but they were alleviated in catechin supplementation. The urinary 2-microglobulin that measured to observe the glomerular injury were higher in Cd-poisoned groups than in normal group but they was lowered by catechin supplementation. Glomerular filtration ratios (GFR) in Cd-poisoned groups were significantly lower than in normal group but that of catechin supplementation group was similar to normal group. This suggested that catechin protected the kidney from the functional damage. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity and blood pressure (BP) in Cd-poisoned groups were significantly higher than in normal group. Heart rate was tended to increase in Cd-poisoned groups. The results indicate that green tea catechin supplementation on chronic cadmium-poisoned rats normalized the renal dysfunction and blood pressure system.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["4"]}

The objective of the study was to investigate the effect of heat shock response by heat-pretreatment on the acute lung injury of the rats induced by intratracheally administered TNF-alpha. METHODS: We intratracheally instilled either saline or TNF (R&D, 500ng) with and without heat pretreatment in Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250-350 g. The heated rats were raised their rectal temperature to 41degrees C and was maintained thereafter for 13 minutes at 18 h before intratracheal administration of saline or TNF. After 5 h of intratracheal treatment, lung leak, lung myeloperoxidase activity (MPO) and heat shock proteins were measured in rats. Lung leak index was defined as counts per minute of I125 in the right lung divided by counts per minutes of I125 in 1.0 ml of blood. All data are expressed as means+/-SE. RESULTS: There is no difference in acute lung leak index (0.099+/-0.024 vs 0.123+/-0.005) among the rats given saline intratracheally with and without heat pretreatment, but MPO activity showed a decreased tendency in heat-pretreated rats (4.58+/-0.79 U/g) compared with heat-unpretreated rats (7.32+/-0.97 U/g)(P= 0.064). Rats administered TNF intratracheally with heat-pretreatment had decreased lung leak index (0.137+/-0.012) and lung MPO activity (5.51+/-1.04 U/g) compared with those of heat-unpretreated and TNF-administered rats (0.186+/-0.016, 14.34+/-1.22 U/g)(P< 0.05 in each).

In this paper, we propose a robust corner detector improved from FAST in terms of the localization accuracy and the computational time. First, we construct a gradient map using the Haar-wavelet response by integral image for efficiency. Second, we define a corner candidate region which has large gradient magnitude enough to be corner. Finally, we detect the corner on the corner candidate region by FAST.

We are usually well-trained in the administration of these drugs and aware of their actions and side effects. How about antibiotics? The anesthesiologists do not seem to have as much interest in antibiotics as their own favorite drugs. Antimicrobial agents can be used for prophylaxis to reduce the incidence of postoperative infections or for treat ment of obvious preexisting infection. It is frequently requested to the anesthetic part to administer the prescribed antibiotics perioperatively. Many institutions have much debate as to the actual administration of the antibiotics, as well as the responsibility for their actions and side effects between anesthesiologists and surgeons. The truth is, each institution has its own protocol for antibiotic administration for the prophylaxis of surgical site infections and updates the protocol occasionally according to the rapid change of the drugs and information.

{"title": "Self-consistent kinetic simulation of RMP-driven transport: collisionality and rotation effects on RMP penetration and transport\n", "abstract": " Full text: Control of the edge localized modes (ELMs) is one of the most critical issues for a more successful operation of ITER and the future tokamak fusion reactors. This paper reports ITER relevant simulation results from the XGC0 drift-kinetic code, with respect to the collisionality, plasma density, and rotation dependence of the RMP penetration and the RMP-driven transport in diverted DIII-D geometry with neutral recycling. The simulation results are consistent with the experimental results, and contribute to the physics understanding needed for more confident extrapolation of the present RMP experiments to ITER. It is found that plasma-responded stochasticity becomes weaker as the collisionality gets higher and RMP-driven transport (i.e., density pump-out) is much weaker in the high collisionality case compared with that in the low collisionality one, which is consistent with the recent experimental results on DIII-D and ASDEX-U tokamaks. As for rotation effect, low rotation is found not to affect the stochasticity much in the edge region, while high rotation significantly suppresses the RMPs in the core. The clear difference in RMP behavior between the low and high collisionality regimes can be understood by examining the perturbed current Fourier amplitude profiles within the range of resonant poloidal mode numbers (m = 8 - 15, n = 3). It can be seen that primary shielding currents are strongly concentrated around the steep pedestal region just inside the separatrix, which naturally produces very strong suppression of RMPs there, in low collisionality case. However, in high collisionality case, primary shielding currents are very weak and\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["4"]}

There were no significant differences in weight gain or food intake, but food efficiency ratio (FER) of CaMP in the high Ca group was higher than those of other groups. Ca and P concentrations in serum were within normal range in all experimental rats. There was no difference in Ca content of the femur among all of the groups. Although there was no statistical significance in bone breaking force of the femur among the groups, the CaMP groups had a higher breaking force compared to other groups. Further, Ca absorption rate significantly increased in the CaMP groups (p< 0.05).

{"title": "6 Variations in the STK10 Gene and Possible Associations With Aspirin-Intolerant Asthma in a Korean Population\n", "abstract": " \u0393\u00fb\u00e1 AbstractBackground and objective: Lymphocyte-oriented kinase deficiency encoded by the serine/threonine kinase 10 (STK10) gene correlates with the intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1)/lymphocyte function associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) complex in aspirin hypersensitivity. This study investigated the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of STK10 and aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA). Methods: A total of 54 SNPs were genotyped in 163 AIA patients and 429 aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA) controls. Results: Logistic regression revealed that a synonymous variant (rs2306961G> A) had the most significant association with AIA (P=. 008 under the codominant model; P=. 004 under the dominant model), suggesting that tissue-specific codon usage between Lys_TTT and Lys_CTT could play a role in regulating expression of STK10 in airway epithelium. Haplotype analysis revealed that 4 haplotypes, including STK10_BL4-ht1, which is unique to rs2306961G> A, were significantly associated with aspirin hypersensitivity in asthmatics (P<. 05). Conclusions: Although replications in independent cohorts and further functional evaluations are needed, our preliminary findings suggest that STK10polymorphisms might be susceptible genetic markers of AIA and that gene expression could be mediated by tissue-specific codon usage.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["4"]}

{"title": "Necessity for a Whole-body CT Scan in Alert Blunt Multiple Trauma Patients.\n", "abstract": " Purpose: Whole-body CT is a very attractive diagnostic tool to clinicians, especially, in trauma. It is generally accepted that trauma patients who are not alert require whole-body CT. However, in alert trauma patients, the usefulness is questionable. Methods: This study was a retrospective review of the medical records of 146 patients with blunt multiple trauma who underwent whole body CT scanning for a trauma workup from March 1, 2008 to February 28, 2009. We classified the patients into two groups by patients' mental status (alert group: 110 patients, not-alert group: 36 patients). In the alert group, we compared the patients' evidence of injury (present illness, physical examination, neurological examination) with the CT findings. Results: One hundred forty six (146) patients underwent whole-body CT. The mean age was  years. One hundred four (104, 71.2%) were men, and the injury severity score was . In the not-alert group, the ratios of abnormal CT findings were relatively high: head 23/36 (63.9%), neck 3/6 (50.0%), chest 16/36 (44.4%) and abdomen 9/36 (25%). In the alert group, patients with no evidence of injury were rare (head 1, chest 6 and abdomen 2). Nine (9) patients did not need any intervention or surgery. Conclusion: Whole-body CT has various disadvantages, such as radiation, contrast induced nephropathy and high medical costs. In multiple trauma patients, if they are alert and have no evidence of injury, they rarely have abnormal CT findings, and mostly do not need invasive treatment. Therefore, we should be cautious in performing whole-body CT in alert multiple trauma patients.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["4"]}

{"title": "The Formation Behavior of Non-metallic Inclusion in the Ce-added Hyper Duplex STS\n", "abstract": " Rare earth metal Ce has a relatively low melting point and high specific gravity. Because of its significantly high affinity to oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur, it is highly usable as a steel refining agent. However, because Ce compound has relatively high specific gravity, it is difficult to be separated from molten steel through floatation, and it degrades the purity of molten steel, or may clog the nozzle in continuous casting. Such problem may be solved by using an appropriate deoxidation agent together with Ce and settling molten steel sufficiently after refining. Thus a fundamental study in the formation behavior of non-metallic inclusion in Ce added Hyper Duplex STS melts was investigated. The addition amount of Ce, melt temperature were considered as experimental variables. A main non-metallic inclusion in mother alloy is 51 (wt% MnO)-27.6 (wt% SiO )-10.9 (wt% ). Non-metallic inclusion was dramatically decreased and the particle size was fined as the amount of Ce increased. Moreover (% MnO) and (% SiO ) of non-metallic inclusion were decreased. But (% ) were relatively increased. The number of non-metallic inclusion were decreased and the large particle size were increased by increasing the temperature of molten steel.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["4"]}

{"title": "Sonic Hedgehog Expression in Colorectal Neoplasms\n", "abstract": " BACKGROUND/AIMSDysregulation of the hedgehog pathway has been implicated in regeneration and carcinogenesis, leading to the expression of the sonic hedgehog (Shh) protein in gastrointestinal neoplasms. The expression of Shh in colon neoplasms and paired normal colonic mucosa was therefore investigated. METHODS: Forty-four colon cancers and 73 colon adenomas that were removed by surgical colectomy or colon polypectomy between August 2005 and August 2006 were included. Colorectal neoplasms and the adjacent normal colon tissue were examined by immunohistochemistry using rabbit polyclonal Shh antibody. RESULTS: Expression of Shh was up-regulated in adenomas and adenocarcinomas of the colon compared to normal colon tissues (p< 0.001). The degree of Shh expression was not associated with the size, shape, or, location of the tumor, or as the age and gender of the patient. In normal colonic epithelium, Shh was expressed at the apex of the crypts and in a few basally-located cells. CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of Shh expression in colonic adenoma and adenocarcinoma suggest that Shh is required during epithelial proliferation in the colon. Hedgehog signaling is likely to be associated with early tumorigenesis in colonic neoplasms.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["4"]}

This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of molting induced by various feeding methods on productivity and egg quality in laying hens. We used 400 flocks of 60-week-old leghorn laying hens in four treatments (five replicates of 20 hens each): fasting method (C), feeding single corn grain diet (T1), feeding single wheat bran diet (T2) and feeding single alfalfa meal diet (T3). As the result of the experiment, egg production and daily egg mass significantly decreased only in T1 compared with the control during the  week after the secondary egg laying (P< 0.05). Although the amount of feed intake was significantly less in T1 group during the  week compared to the control, no significant difference was detected during the total period (P> 0.05). In addition, no significant difference of feed conversion was observed between treatment groups. In terms of egg quality, the egg shell thickness was significantly improved in T1 group than the control group by feeding only corn at the 10th and 14th week after the secondary egg laying (P< 0.05), but the significant decrease was observed at the corn (T1) and wheat bran (T2) fed treatment groups than the control group at the 26th week of the experiment (P< 0.05).

Among these extracts such as methanol extract (SS-7), methylene chloride extract (SS-8), ethyl acetate extract (SS-9), n-butanol extract (SS-10), and residual fraction (SL-11), SS-8 exhibited the most cytotoxic activity against Jurkat T cells. The methylene chloride extract (SS-8) possessed the apoptogenic activity capable of inducing sub-G1 peak along with apoptotic DNA fragmentation in Jurkat T cells. Western blot analysis revealed that SS-8 induced apoptosis via mitochondrial cytochrome c release into cytoplasm, subsequent activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and cleavage of PARP, which could be blocked by overexpression of Bcl-xL.

Their importance notwithstanding, continued mining leads to depletion of natural resources and the reisolation of previously identified metabolites. Metagenomic strategies aimed at localizing the biosynthetic cluster genes and expressing them in surrogate hosts offers one possible alternative. A fundamental question that naturally arises when pursuing such a strategy is, how large must the genomic library be to effectively represent the genome of an organism(s) and the biosynthetic gene clusters they harbor? Such an issue is certainly augmented in the absence of expensive robotics to expedite colony picking and/or screening of clones.

Propagation and Growth in Perlite Hydroponic Systems\n", "abstract": " Rhizomes of black cohosh (Actaea racemosa L.) grown in the deep woodland shade of eastern North America have been used historically as medicinals, but wild populations have declined because of collection pressure. The purpose of this study is to determine the potential for black cohosh production in perlite. Currently, cultivated plants represent just 3% of the total harvest. Perlite production should also result in clean, uniform plant material. Rhizomes were grown at 18 \u252c\u2591C in controlled environment chambers in the North Carolina State University (NCSU) Phytotron in perlite for 42 days with fertigation 3, 6, or 12 times daily and 18.5, 21.5, or 24.5 \u252c\u2591C root zone temperatures adjusted using heating cables. Leaf areas of the 21.5 and 24.5 \u252c\u2591C root temperature treatments were greater than the 18.5 \u252c\u2591C treatment. Stem number and new root number was highest in the 21.5 \u252c\u2591C treatment. No effects of the fertigation treatments were significant. The second experiment was conducted 7 June\u0393\u00c7\u00f431 Oct. 2004 in a naturally lit temperature-controlled (22/18 \u252c\u2591C) glass greenhouse in the NCSU Phytotron at nutrient solution EC levels of 0.7, 1.1, or 1.5 dS\u252c\u2556m-1 and shading levels of 0%, 50%, and 75%. Highest leaf area and increase in fresh weight of the rhizomes over the experimental period was in the 50% shading treatment, but no significant effects of EC treatments were observed. Rhizome fresh weight increased 310% in the 50% shade, compared to 193% and 196% in the 0% and 75% shading treatments, respectively.

The coherence function approach appears able to separate the correlated system when the noise sources were coherent. In this study, we identify contribution of structure-borne-noise of vehicle HVAC system using MDSA method. Firstly, to identify the applicability of MDSA method, 4-inputs of vehicle HVAC system were the signals measured by accelerometers attached on the selected noise sources which were composed of blower, evaporator, heater and duct. While 1-output which was driver's position sound was the SPL signals measured by a remote microphone, when the blower motor was operating. We identify efficiency of systems modeled with four Inputs/single output through ordinary coherence function (OCF) and partial coherence function (PCF). As a result of experiment, the blower accounted for  of the overall level of sound energy density. Also, according to the analysis of acoustic signal and vibration signals measurement, an investigation of the noise source identification in the vehicle HVAC is presented. With the sound intensity method, the major sources of the vehicle HVAC radiation are verified. Also the method of improving the noise reduction is proposed by attaching damping patch access to blower motor and noise reduction is verified.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["4"]}

The CMC of PEG-esters with long polyoxyethlene unit showed a higher value than that of PEG-esters with short polyoxyethylene unit. Meanwhile, the CMC of PEG-esters with adipic acid moiety was not distinct due to their high hydrophilic character. As the results of contact angle and cutting time aginst aluminum, the contact angle ranged from  to  depended on the concentration of PEG-esters. The cutting time of aluminum showed the shortest value at CMC, but the longest value above CMC.

This monomer was copolymerized with various amount of acrylamide (AM) to obtain polymers of varing hydrophilicity. The polymerization was carried out in dimethylformamide at 70 degrees C using azobisisobutysonitrile (AIBN) as the initiator. The copolymers were placed in buffer solutions of various pH and the amount of IPA hydrolyzed from each polymer was determined at different temperatures. The release rate of IPA increased as the amount of AM in the copolymer and the temperature increased. The release rate was higher in acidic and basic solutions than in neutral solution. These results indicate that the release rate of IPA could be controlled by adjusting the amount of AM units in the polymer, temperature and\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["4"]}

CCAM is a benign hamartomatous or dysplastic tumor that is characterized by overgrowth of the terminal bronchioles. It is typically unilateral and usually involves one lobe or segment with a broad spectrum of clinical presentation. In 1977, Stocker et al. examined 38 cases of CCAM and divided these lesions into three types based on the gross size of the cysts and histologic findings. The overall prognosis of an affected fetus depends on the size of the lung mass and the secondary pathophysiologic derangement. Recently we experienced two cases of congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lung, which was diagnosed by prenatal ultrasonography.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["4"]}

Using pComb3 filamentous phagemid vector, Fab molecule was expressed in fusion form to a phage coat protein in the periplasm of E. coli. A clone of HBsAg binder was selected after panning and designated as B7. In order to select the clones with higher affinity and to examine which chain contributes most to the affinity of B7, the light and heavy chain of B7 was sequentially deleted and replaced with new library. HBsAg-binders were selected and tested by EIA (enzyme immunoassay). It was revealed that the affinity of B7 depends only on the heavy chain of Fd. B7 Fd was constructed without light chain and specificity and affinity was further confirmed by western blot analysis. This human monoclonal Fd antibody was found to react with d antigenic determinant of HBsAg as the original clone did. The nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that VH of B7 could be classified into Kabat's subgroup II and human IgG heavy chain family IV.

The ionic conductivity of the polymer electrolytes was increased with the amount of the plasticizers but optimum content of the plasticizers was about 55 wt% based on the weight of the polymer in the consideration of their mechanical property. The highest ionic conductivity was 1.9 X 10{sup -3} S/cm when the mol ratio of ethylene oxide repeating unit to Li{sup +} was 10. It was found that the temperature dependency of the ionic conductivity followed Vogel-Tamman-Fulcher equation, which indicates that the segmental motion of the polymer chains acts as an important role in transportation of Li ion. The ionic conductivity was varied with the kinds of lithium salts in the rage of 10{sup -3}{approx}10{sup -4} S/cm. The polymer electrolyte with lower crosslinking density had more phase-separated structure and showed higher ionic conductivity comparing with the polymer electrolyte with higher crosslinking density.

In addition to that, in order to find out whether personal norms on littering were changed from 1994 to 1996, data collected at the same campground in 1994 were also partly used. Based on the result of the study, persuasive messages didn't directly affect the users' level of the awareness of the consequences (AC) of littering, personal norms, and littering behavior. People whose awareness of the consequences of littering are higher, however, tended to have stronger personal norms about littering. And also, people whose awareness of the consequences of littering are higher or people whose personal norms are stronger appeared to litter fewer than people whose awareness of the consequences or the strength of personal norms are lower. The extent of personal norms about littering was not changed through 1994 to 1996.

As it was recently shown that morphine and enkephalin, when administered intracerebroventricularly (icv), affect renal function in the rabbit, indicating that the opiate receptors are also involved in the central regulation of renal function, it was attempted to clarify whether the central adrenergic system participates in the center-mediated renal action of morphine, employing phenoxybenzamine (PBZ). Morphine, 10 micrograms/kg icv, produced profound and long-lasting antidiuresis and antinatriuresis. PBZ, 250 micrograms/kg icv, elicited marked diuresis with natriuresis and kaluresis, along with significant increases of osmolar clearance and free-water reabsorption, and these effects were not related to a transient increase in glomerular filtration. When PBZ was given 10 min after morphine, the morphine antidiuresis immediately disappeared and the renal action of PBZ unfolded itself undiminished. Also, when morphine was given after PBZ, the PBZ-diuresis developed fully, unaffected by morphine. These observations indicate that the central adrenergic system is involved in the regulation of renal function through central opiate receptors.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["4"]}

{"title": "Apoptotic Effect of Co-treatment with Curcumin and Cisplatin on SCC25 Human Tongue Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cell Line\n", "abstract": " Curcumin is a widely used flavoring agent in food, and it has been reported to inhibit cell growth, to induce apoptosis, and to have antitumor activity in many cancers. Cisplatin is one of the most potent known anticancer agents and shows significant clinical activity against a variety of solid tumors. This study was undertaken to investigate the synergistic apoptotic effects of co-treatment with curcumin and cisplatin on human tongue SCC25 cells. To investigate whether the co-treatment efficiently reduced the viability of the SCC25 cells compared with the two treatments separately, an MTT assay was conducted. The induction and the augmentation of apoptosis were confirmed by DNA electrophoresis, Hoechst staining, and an analysis of DNA hypoploidy. Western blot, MMP and immunofluorescence tests were also performed to evaluate the expression levels and the translocation of apoptosis-related proteins following the co-treatment. In this study, following the co-treatment with curcumin and cisplatin, the SCC25 cells showed several forms of apoptotic manifestation, such as nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation, reduction of MMP, increased levels of Bax, decreased levels of Bcl-2, and decreased DNA content. In addition, they showed a release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, translocation of AIF and DFF40 (CAD) to the nuclei, and activation of caspase-7, caspase-3, PARP, and DFF45 (ICAD). In contrast, separate treatments of  of curcumin or  of cisplatin, for 24 hours, did not induce apoptosis.

The characteristics (formation density and morphology) of as-grown carbon coils were investigated as a function of SF6 flow injection time. 5-min SF6 flow injection time is appropriate to produce the dominant microsized geometry for carbon coils without the appearance of the nanosized carbon coils. The geometry for the microsized carbon coils follows a typical double-helix structure and the shape of the rings constituting the coils is a flat-type. Fluorine's intrinsic etching characteristics for the nanosized carbon coils during the initial deposition stage seems to be the cause for the dominant formation of the microsized carbon coils in the case of 5-min SF6 flow\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["4"]}

{"title": "A new approach for ship motion control based on experiment\n", "abstract": " In this paper, the authors propose a new approach to control problem of the marine vessels which are moored or controlled by actuators. The vessel control system is basically based on the Dynamic Positioning System(DPS) technology. And, using DPS and sensing system, the actuators are installed in the vessel to be positioned in the specified area. There are many types of actuator system in the real applications. The useful and widely applicable systems are thruster and mooring winch based systems. It may be difficult to compare the control performances of two types. If we consider this problem in point of usefulness including cost, we can easily find out that the mooring winch system is more useful and popular to the real field than the thrust system except the special purpose.

METHODS: From January 1995 to July 2007, 80 patients (47 adults and 33 children) were diagnosed with Burkitt lymphoma at our institution. The clinical and endoscopic manifestations were analyzed in the adult patients (n= 20, median age= 52 yr) with GI Burkitt lymphoma. RESULTS: The most frequent symptom was abdominal pain (50%) followed by epigastic soreness (30%). Among the 20 patients with GI Burkitt lymphoma, 11 (55%) had gastric lesions, 4 (20%) had colonic lesions, 3 (15%) had both gastric and duodenal lesions, 1 (5%) had both gastric and colonic lesions, and 1 (5%) had gastric, duodenal and colonic lesions. For the 13 patients who had endoscopic pictures available, the most common type of disease was the ulcerative type (38.5%) followed by the ulcerofungating and ulceroinfiltrative types (23.1% and 23.1%, respectively). Most of the patients were diagnosed with advanced disease. The most common clinical stage was stage IVE (60%) by the Musshoff staging system. All 20 patients received combination chemotherapy, and the 5-year survival rate was 64%. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with GI Burkitt lymphoma, the most commonly involved site was the stomach.

Testes obtained from neonatal and adult mice were manually decapsulated. GSCs were collected from seminiferous tubules by a two-step enzyme digestion method and plated on gelatin-coated dishes. Over 5-7 days of culture, GSCs obtained from neonates and adults gave rise to large multicellular colonies that were subsequently grown for 10 passages. During in vitro proliferation, oct-4 and two immunological markers (Integrin ) for GSCs were highly expressed in the cell colonies. During another culture period of 6 weeks to differentiate to later stage germ cells, the expression of oct-4 mRNA decreased in GSCs and Sertoli cells encapsulated with calcium alginate, but the expression of c-kit and testis-specific histone protein 2B (TH2B) mRNA as well as the localization of c-kit protein was increased. Expression of transition protein (TP-l) and localization of peanut agglutinin were not seen until 3 weeks after culturing, and appeared by 6 weeks of culture. The putative spermatids derived from GSCs supported embryonic development up to the blastocyst stage with normal chromosomal ploidy after chemical activation. Thus, GSCs isolated from neonatal and adult mouse testes were able to be maintained and proliferated in our simple culture conditions.

A combined Schr\u251c\u2562dinger and Poisson equation is solved numerically to obtain self-consistent subband wavefunctions and energies of the holes in the DMS QWs. Self-consistent spin-resolved subband structure shows that (i) the spatial distributions of the majority and minority spin carriers are separated in the DMS QW below the Curie temperature and (ii) the spontaneous magnetization of the Mn-doped magnetic nanostructure depends sensitively on doping profiles of the magnetic ion and the strength of exchange couplings.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["4"]}

The activation of proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) by trypsin appears to play a role in inflammation. In the present study, we examined the inhibitory effects of Tetragonia tetragonoides water extract (TTWE) on the production of tumor necrosis  and tryptase in trypsin-stimulated human leukemic mast cells (HMC-1) expressing PAR-2. HMC-1 cells were stimulated with trypsin in the presence or absence of TTWE (10, 100, and ). The level of  secretion from HMC-1 cells was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).  and tryptase mRNA expression were examined by reverse transcription-PCR. Also, extracellular signal-regulated kinese (ERK) activation was assessed by Western blot analysis. Trypsin activity was measured using the substrate Bz-DL-Arg-p-nitroanilide (BAPNA). It was observed that  secretion, tryptase mRNA and  mRNA expression in trypsin-stimulated HMC-1 cells were inhibited by pretreatment of TTWE (). Furthermore, the pretreatment of TTWE () resulted in the reduction of ERK phosphorylation and trypsin activity. These results suggest hat TTWE might have the inhibitory effects on the PAR-2-dependent inflammation processes and it is likely to function as PAR-2 antagonist.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["4"]}
{"title": "Structural deformation of single-wall carbon nanotubes during field emission process\n", "abstract": " Stable electron emission from CNT emitters at required current densities is necessary to apply to the commercial devices. Generally, the current degradation during field emission has been understood as evaporation of emitter or breaking apart of tip end under intensive electrical field. In this report, we suggest one more possible mechanism that the emission current degradation may occur by increased resistance of emitters through structural deformation under field emission. The effect of current density and time on the structure of SWNT emitters was studied with TEM, low current density (100 /spl mu/A/cm/sup 2/ for 1 h) application gave no detectable structural deformation with comparison to pristine SWNTs. However, the bundles of SWNTs were deformed to amorphous structure starting at tip ends or defect sites when a high current density (500 /spl mu/m/cm/sup 2/ for more than 1h) was applied.

The purpose of the guidance is to achieve a required velocity vector at the thrust cut-off. Trajectory optimizations for four cost functions are performed to investigate implementable trajectories in the pitch plane. It is observed from the optimization results that high angle of attack maneuver in the beginning of the flight are required to satisfy the constraints. The proposed guidance algorithm consists of the pitch program to produce open-loop pitch attitude command and the yaw attitude command generator to nullify the velocity to go. The pitch program utilizes the pitch attitude histories obtained from the trajectory optimization.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["4"]}
{"title": "Adsorption characteristics of reactive dye onto biosorbent\n", "abstract": " Reactive dyes are typically azo-based chromophores combined with different types of reactive groups eg, vinyl sulfone, chlorotriazine. They differ from all other classes of dyes in that they bind to the textile fibers such as cotton through covalent bonds. They have the favourable characteristics of bright color, water fast, simple application techniques with low energy consumption. They are used extensively in textile industries. Hence their removal is also of great importance.It is difficult to remove the dyes from effluents since they are stable to light, heat and oxidizing agents and are biologically non-degradable. Although some existing technologies-conventional chemical coagulation/flocculation, ozonation, oxidation, adsorption-may have a certain efficiency in the removal of reactive dyes, their initial and operational costs are so great that they constitute an inhibition to dyeing and finishing industries. Activated carbon is the most widely used adsorbent for the removal of color and treatment of textile effluents but due to its high price it is not used on a great scale. This has led many workers to search for the use of cheap and efficient alternative materials such as bagasse pith, carbonized bark, peat, soil, tree and eucalyptus barks, chitosan, rice husk, wood and fly ash. Using microorganism as adsorbents for textile dyes also offers a potential alternative to existing methods for detoxification.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["4"]}
{"title": "Effects of Pressure Overload and its Recovery on Vascular Reactivity and Remodeling of the Rat Carotid Artery\n", "abstract": " Materials and MethodsBy partial transverse aortic constriction (TAC), the right CCAs were made to lie under a high pressure environment, while the left CCAs remained under normotension, the latter being used as control vessels. The ligations were removed after two weeks, to enable the recovery process to begin.ResultsThe vessel contractility, two weeks after the TAC, was nearly abolished. The recovery process from high pressure showed an initial hypercontractile period of around 1-2 week after recovery, prior to the subsequent decline to a normal contractility after 2 weeks. The relaxation response due to acetylcholine was minimal at the end of the hypertensive period, recovered slowly, and reached a normal magnitude after 4 weeks. A high pressure increases the medial thickness & area, and enhances the adventitial tissue formation. These changes persist during the first 4 weeks of recovery, after which normotension returns. Apoptosis at the endothelial layer was significantly increased two weeks after the TAC, but normalized two weeks after recovery. The expression of ecNOS was not detect 2 weeks after the TAC, but gradually returned to a basal level at 2 weeks after the untying.ConclusionA high blood pressure causes decreases in the contractility and endothelium-dependent relaxation. It also increases endothelial apoptosis, the medial thickness & area, and enhances the adventitial tissue formation. The recovery processes from high blood pressure are not uniform, but show different normalizations among the structural, contractile and apoptotic parameters.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["4"]}

It is necessary to reveal how brain is affected by excessive use of CG playing and behavioral addiction of it. By using PET, we address the issue seeking to identifying patterns of regional brain activation associated with behavioral addiction and excessive use of CG playing by adolescents. 6 normal control and 8 adolescents who were met by the criteria of behavioral addiction on the survey as addiction groups with an addiction of CG playing were participated. Initial screening survey which is the adapted version of DSM-IV for pathologic gambling was done. PET were performed twice in each participants both during resting state and after 20 min playing of CG. Psychological test including Youth Self Report (YSR), memory and attention test and vocabulary item from KWAIS were performed. Scores of the vocabulary item from KWAIS and social competence from YSR were significantly lower in the addiction group. On PET, addiction group showed higher resting metabolism on inferior frontal, premotor, prefrontal and superior temporal area. Adolescents with addiction of CG revealed different patterns of regional brain activation comparing to control groups. These suggest behavioral addiction and excessive use of CG may result in functional alteration of developing brain in adolescents.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["4"]}

The progression of prostate cancer from androgen-dependent to androgen-independent states involves multiple steps of genetic changes mediated by tumor-microenvironment interactions. To understand the epigenetic factors that lead to progression, we studied if 1) androgen-dependent and non-metastatic LNCaP may interact with prostate or bone fibroblasts under microgravity-simulated conditions in vitro. 2) LNCaP may interact with prostate fibroblasts in vivo, and acquire androgen-independence and metastatic potential.MATERIALS AND METHODSThe LNCaP sublines were generated as follows. 1) LNCaP cells were grown in vitro either alone or with prostate or bone fibroblasts under microgravity-simulated conditions. 2) LNCaP cells were grown in vivo as chimeric tumors with prostate fibroblasts. The LNCaP sublines were characterized by studies of chromosomal analysis, comparative genomic hybridization and, in vivo tumorigenicity and metastatic potential.RESULTSIn comparison to the parental LNCaP cells, the LNCaP sublines underwent permanent genotypic and phenotypic changes manifested in androgen-independence and metastatic potential.CONCLUSIONThese results emphasize the importance of cell-cell interaction as a critical determinant that could\" induce\" or\" select\" progenies favoring enhanced prostate cancer growth and progression.

{"title": "Rectal hyposensitivity in painless normal transit/normal defecatory constipation\n", "abstract": " BACKGROUND/AIMSThe functional constipation consists of slow transit, defecatory disorder and the normal transit/normal defecatory constipation. It can be divided into the group with pain (irritable bowel syndrome) and the group without pain. We evaluated the difference in the rectal motor and sensory function between patients with the painless normal transit/normal defecatory constipation (pNT/ND C) and controls.METHODSRectal barostat was carried out in 13 pNT/ND C (M: F= 4: 9, mean age 46.6 yrs) and 10 controls (M: F= 5: 5, mean age 29.1 yrs). The thresholds for the minimal sense, the call to stool and the urgency were checked as sensory parameters. The compliance was expressed by the slope of the pressure-volume curve. The basal tone was measured by the volume of (minimal distending pressure+ 10) mmHg.RESULTSThe thresholds for the minimal sensory pressure of patients and controls were 16.7+/-6.1 vs. 6.6+/-3.3 mmHg. The thresholds for the minimal defecatory pressure were 22.9+/-7.1 and 15.7+/-3.7 mmHg and those for the urgency pressure were 23.8+/-7.3 vs. 21.4+/-5.9 mmHg. These results indicated that the three thresholds were significantly increased in the pNT/ND C than in the controls (p< 0.01). However, the compliance and basal tone were not significantly different in both groups.CONCLUSIONSThe visceral hyposensitivity may play a pathogenic role in developing painless normal transit/normal defecatory constipation.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["4"]}
{"title": "Energy regenerative damper using pulse width modulated (PWM) step-up chopper\n", "abstract": " This paper describes a new technique of improving the efficiency of an energy regenerative damper. It is intended for an electro-dynamic type vibration damper to regenerate vibration energy efficiently. Normally regenerative damper can regenerate vibration energy only at high speed motion. For low speed motion, the damper has nonlinear characteristics with dead zone and the energy is not regenerated. In order to overcome the problem of dead zone, a step-up chopper is introduced between the actuator and the charging circuit. The energy is regenerated from the low speed and low voltage actuator to high voltage charging circuit. This paper also proposes a new control technique to the step-up chopper by using pulse width modulated (PWM) signal. The proposed damper is applied to a dynamic damper system and is simulated on a computer.

Using the Riemannian geometric framework developed in Park and Kim (1996) for closed chain manipulability analysis, we classify closed chain singularities into three basic types: (i) those corresponding to singular points of the joint configuration space (configuration space singularities), (ii) those induced by the choice of actuated joints (actuator singularities), and (iii) those configurations in which the end-effector loses one or more degrees of freedom of available motion (end-effector singularities). The proposed geometric classification provides a high-level taxonomy for mechanism singularities that is independent of the choice of local coordinates used to describe the kinematic chain.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["4"]}

{"title": "Acute Basophilic Leukemia\n", "abstract": " A case of acute basophilic leukemia with primitive basophilic differentiation is presented in a 57-year-old man on the basis of ultrastructural and cytochemical evidence. Ultrastructural analysis revealed both peroxidase-positive basophil granules and mast cell granules in blasts. Basophil granules demonstrated positive reaction with toluidine blue and acid phosphatase. Clinical findings of chronic myelocytic leukemia were not noted although cytogenetic studies showed the Philadelphia chromosome and bcr-abl gene rearrangement. Immunophenotype of leukemic blasts was TdT+, HLR-DR+, CD13+, CD33+, CD19-, CD5-, CD14-, CD41-, which was interpreted as TdT positive acute", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["4"]}

The inoculation methods and varietal resistance to mycoplasma-like organism.\n", "abstract": " The mycoplasma-like organism was transmitted to Z. jujuba [Ziziphus sativa] by green-wood grafting and hard-wood grafting, but not by injection of extracts. Following grafting, symptoms were not apparent after 4 months but developed during the following year. In order to obtain results from varietal reaction trials as soon as possible, the root cut and transplanting technique was the most effective. The infection rate by hard-wood grafts, using MLO-free scions and infected rootstocks, was only 3.6% in cv. Moodeung and 7.2% in Sanjo B compared with 94.1% in Je-8 and 100% in Jg-10.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["4"]}
{"title": "Histological and histochemical studies of the squirrel epididymis\n", "abstract": " In order to investigate the morphological characteristics of epididymal duct of the squirrel, the histological and histochemical studies were carried out. The results obtained were summarized as follows: The epididymal duct can be divided into 9 segments by histological and histochemical features. Segments 1 to 5 were located in the head, segments 6 and 7 in the body, and segments 8 and 9 in the tail of the epididymis. The apical cells were numerous in the segment 1. Clear cells which has a compact, deeply staining nucleus and a characteristically clear cytoplasm were scattered in the epithelium throughout the duct. Interepithelial clear cells which had PAS-positive granules tended to increase in number caudally. Strong PAS-positive reaction was detected at the intralumen of the segments 3, 8 and 9. Acid phosphatase activity was relatively high in the basal cytoplasm of the segment 7, and then in the supranuclear region of the segments 8 and 9. Alkaline phosphatase activity was weakly positive or negative except the segments 3 and 4. ATPase activity was strong in the free surface of the epithelium in the head and the entire cytoplasm in the body and tail, a, nd SDH activity was generally weak except for the body where it was more intense.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["4"]}

They have many similarities to a previously described clinical syndrome called quadriceps-confined myopathy. The pedigree demonstrates an apparent sex-linked recessive condition which has not been demonstrated previously. Information gained from a review of the literature is related to these three cases. It is suggested that these cases are part of a poorly defined clinical entity and that a new classification of quadriceps-gastrocnemius muscular dystrophy be introduced.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["4"]}

The predicted results show that the E\u0393\u00c7\u00c9band in KCl: Ag is not due to the impurity AgI located at a substitutional site of the host crystal. From present theoretical results we then propose two speculative models for the origin of the E\u0393\u00c7\u00c9band: 1. The E\u0393\u00c7\u00c9band is due to the impurity AgI located at an interstitial site tetrahedrally surrounded by four alkali ions as well as by four halide ions. 2. The E\u0393\u00c7\u00c9band is due to the interstitial impurity AgI perturbed by some complex whose perturbation is very small.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["4"]}

The method employs a construction on the k (t)-x (t) plane and leads to a solu-tion similar to the phase-plane solution in studying second-order ordinary differential equations.The procedures which lead to the solu-tion of differential-difference equations with time-variant lag will be outlined as follows: 1) The value of x (t) must be specified for the interval-h< t< O. By appropriate differentiation, x (t) can also be obtained for this initial interval. A curve is then drawn on the phase plane, with?(t) as a function of x (t) for this interval, as shown in Fig. 1. 2) Choose the increment Ai for the step in the succeeding construction.
