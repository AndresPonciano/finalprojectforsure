The linearity of the radar system, which is strictly related to the circuit saturation problem in noncontact vital sign detection, has been thoroughly analyzed and discussed. It shows that larger body movement does not necessarily mean larger radar baseband output. High gain configuration at baseband is required for acceptable SNR in noncontact vital sign detection. The phase compensation at radar RF front-end helps to relieve the high-gain baseband from potential saturation in the presence of large body movement.

It is clarified that the epitaxy can be attained even at surprisingly low temperatures (less than 200\u2009\u00b0C). A substrate temperature above 850\u2009\u00b0C leads to rather poor crystallinity due to an exponential increase of residual gas pressure.

{"title": "New approaches in the treatment of hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage.\n", "abstract": " A comparison of the long-term outcome after surgical and nonsurgical treatment of hypertensive putaminal hemorrhage was performed in Japan over the last 15 years to determine the appropriate role of surgery. The overall results show a poor response to surgical treatment, but neurosurgeons also know that hematoma evacuation may bring about a dramatic result in some cases. In addition, experimental studies have shown that hematoma evacuation improves neuronal function at the penumbra. The discrepancy between the results of this study and the neurosurgeon's clinical impression is probably a reflection of the following. In the past, the decision to operate was determined mainly by the location of the hemorrhage as determined by computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging. However, this method of deciding surgical indications is probably not correct. We are trying to change the method of determining the surgical indications from morphological to physiological criteria as follows: All patients are initially treated with hyperbaric oxygen, and those who show improvement of their symptoms are clearly indicated for surgery. If the somatosensory evoked potential or auditory brain stem response shows an improvement after administration of mannitol or glycerol, this is also an indication that surgery should be performed.", "num_citations": "95\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

Furthermore, accumulation of inclusions and pinholes to the surface due to electromagnetic force does not occur, together with the electromagnetic stirring in the mold, when EMC frequency enhances to 100 kHz. Based on these results, plant trials were put into practice. As far as operational conditions are concerned, a new method of meniscus control was developed, and lubrication between the mold and the initial solidified shell is improved as the reason that friction force decreases, and mold powder consumption increases.

The pathogenesis of the long QT syndrome is not well understood and little is known about the QT interval in the patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis. We evaluated changes in the QTc interval and investigated factors that contribute to its prolongation in 42 patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis. We also examined the association between the QTc interval and ventricular arrhythmias on 24-h ambulatory electrocardiograms. Comparison of standard 12-lead electrocardiograms of 42 patients and of 30 healthy controls matched for age and sex showed that the QTc interval in the patients was significantly prolonged (432.6+/-24.9 vs 402.0+/-21.0 ms, p< 0.001). Multivariate analysis using stepwise multiple regression identified diabetes mellitus and the ejection fraction measured by echocardiography as independent risk factors for QTc prolongation. The QTc interval was significantly prolonged in patients with complex VPCs (couplets or salvos)(n= 13, 447.9+/-14.4 ms) on 24 h ambulatory ECG compared with simple VPCs (none or occasional)(n= 29, 425.6+/-25.8 ms)(p= 0.03). In conclusion, the QTc interval was prolonged in patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis and QTc prolongation was associated with complex VPCs.

Although hCG synthesis in lung cancers is frequent, primary pulmonary choriocarcinoma (PCC) is rare. To clarify the differences between primary choriocarcinoma and hCG-producing giant cell carcinoma (GCC) of the lung, we compared the clinicopathological and immunohistochemical findings of these tumours. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three patients, one with PCC and two with hCG-producing GCC, were included in this study. They were all middle-aged men and habitual smokers. The growth of these tumours and the progression of the clinical courses were extremely rapid, and the patients all died within 8 months after the pulmonary tumours were found. Haemorrhagic appearance was a common macroscopic feature of the specimens obtained. Microscopically, both types of tumours mainly consisted of atypical polygonal cells. While PCC contained many syncytial trophoblast-like multinucleated cells that had strong immunoreactivity for anti-hCG, such cells were relatively few in hCG-producing GCC. These histological and immunohistochemical findings reflected the serum test result for hCG, which was higher in the case of PCC. CONCLUSIONS: There are a few differences between PCC and hCG-producing GCC, as described above. Reliable distinction between them seems to be difficult for pathologists and worthless for clinicians.", "num_citations": "68\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

Muscle invasion was missed with CT in one patient. Ultrasound was not accurate for diagnosing tumor invasion of the esophagus, carotid artery, and lymph nodes. The survival of patients without extrathyroidal spread was significantly (p< 0.05) better than that of patients (n= 5) with extrathyroidal spread. CONCLUSION: Palpable thyroid masses should undergo palpation-guided FNA for diagnosis and nonpalpable masses US-guided FNA. Tumor extent and staging should be determined with MRI, which will contribute to initiating appropriate therapy and prediction of prognosis.", "num_citations": "61\n", "authors": ["1172"]}
{"title": "Intragenic homozygous deletion of the WT1 gene in Wilms' tumor.\n", "abstract": " One example of intragenic homozygous deletion of the WT1 gene on chromosome 11p13 was found after screening 42 samples of Wilms' tumor DNA from Japanese patients. After construction of a restriction map for the genomic sequence covering the 3'half of the gene, the deletion was analysed at the nucleotide sequence level. The deletion occurred in the patient's germline on his paternal chromosome, and most of the short arm of his maternal chromosome 11 was subsequently lost in the tumor. The size of the deletion was about 8 kb, removing exons 6 and 7 and resulting in premature termination. The deletion seemed to be created by recombination between short homologous sequences found in an Alu repeat, with a 16-bp duplication left at the junction. This case conforms to a two-hit model for the genesis of a certain group of tumors, and supports the hypothesis that WT1 is one of the recessive oncogenes responsible for Wilms' tumor.", "num_citations": "61\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

Mutations of the p53 gene which were identical to those in the cell lines were observed in three of the fresh samples. In the other three samples, p53 gene mutations were not detected by the conventional PCR-SSCP method. However, when analyzed using allele-specific gene amplification, less than 10% of the leukemic cell population of the three samples, which were below the detection threshold of PCR-SSCP, were shown to have p53 gene mutations. Two samples taken at the initial presentation of two patients, whose relapse samples were shown to contain p53 mutant clones, were also available for analysis. A small population of clonal cells, comprising less than 1% of the population, was shown to have p53 gene mutations in both of these initial samples. These observations provide a potential biologic basis for the frequent findings of p53 mutations in leukemia cell lines and also suggest a potential role for p53 mutations in the clonal overgrowth of cells responsible for relapse of the disease.", "num_citations": "60\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

We examined the effects of pravastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, on IDL levels as well as other lipoprotein parameters in 19 uremic patients treated with hemodialysis (HD, n= 11) or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD, n= 8). The patients were administered 5 mg/day pravastatin for the initial 4 weeks and 10 mg/day for the subsequent 12 weeks. In the analysis of the total subjects, IDL-cholesterol was reduced by 31% as well as low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. Cholesterol in very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) also decreased whereas that in high density lipoprotein (HDL) did not. Significant decrease of serum triglycerides was due mainly to reduced IDL-and LDL-triglycerides. Apolipoprotein (apo) AI did not change, whereas apo A-II, B, C-II, C-III, E, and B/AI ratio were significantly lowered. Pravastatin did not affect measured activity of lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase, post-heparin plasma lipoprotein lipase or hepatic triglyceride lipase. HD and CAPD patients responded almost equally to the treatment. IDL elevation was present independent of serum total cholesterol, and it was lowered by pravastatin even in non-hypercholesterolemic subjects. There was no critical adverse effect besides transient and asymptomatic increase of serum creatine kinase level.

Because of time-zone differences and other such contingent factors, this condition can often be hard to fulfill. One solution may lie in time-shifted communication. A person can enjoy a meal while watching an earlier recorded video of a remote person's dining. However, in a time-shifted environment, achieving dining synchronization is a challenge. In this research, we propose a time-shifted tele-dining system (KIZUNA) enabling people to enjoy a meal together in a virtual environment. The system adapts the displayed video's playback speed to the difference in dining progress between the local and remote person. This is likely to enhance communication and increase enjoyment while dining.

A 15-year-old Japanese female was referred to our outclinic because of hypertension. The physical examination showed no abnormal findings except mild hypertension, but the laboratory data revealed low levels of plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone and serum potassium. A comprehensive analysis of steroid hormones showed only high levels of urinary free cortisol and 17-hydroxycorticosteroids. During loading tests, blood pressure and serum potassium responded well to triamterene and slightly to spironolactone, but did not respond to dexamethasone. In addition, the normal ratio of tetrahydrocortisol plus 5a-tetrahydrocortisol to tetrahydrocortisone in a 24h urinary excretion test strongly suggested a diagnosis of Liddle\u2019s disease rather than apparent mineralocorticoid excess syndrome. DNA sequence analysis of members of this family revealed a single cytosine base insertion at Arg-597 of the b human ENaC in the proband and her mother, leading to a loss of the last 34 amino acids from the normally encoded protein as the result of a frameshift.

The technique is shown to provide superior decode video quality over wide variety of channel errors, bit-rates and test sequences. In order to enable effective error concealment the partitioned motion and texture data are separated by a motion marker.

However, little has been known about the nucleation site of a crack and the factor controlling the propagation of the cleavage crack. Turkalo (1) used the electron fractography technique to show that the cleavage facet is limited primarily by the martensite needle size, which appears to control the fracture behavior.

With these mathematical expressions an apparent emission lifetime <t>, relative emission yield \u0426i of the ith process and average number <n> of absorption-emission cycles can be defined. It is found that when the value of <n> is less than 1.10 the emission decays practically remain single exponential though the lifetimes get longer with increasing concentration. A further increase in the value of <n> causes the emission decay to deviate from a single exponential and to assume a convex form. Over a wide range of concentration (10-7-10-3 M) the observed emission decays of rhodamine B and cresyl violet are satisfactorily analyzed in terms of these parameters.

To clarify the role of NO in inflammation, we studied carrageenin-induced pleurisy in rats treated with an NO donor (NOC-18), a substrate for NO formation (L-arginine), and/or an NO synthase inhibitor (S-(2-aminoethyl) isothiourea or               N              G           -nitro-L-arginine). We assessed inflammatory cell migration, nitrite/nitrate values, lipid peroxidation and pro-inflammatory mediators. NOC-18 and L-arginine reduced the migration of inflammatory cells and edema, lowered oxidative stress, and normalized antioxidant enzyme activities.

{"title": "Application of a global nonhydrostatic model with a stretched-grid system to regional aerosol simulations around Japan\n", "abstract": " An aerosol-coupled global nonhydrostatic model with a stretched-grid system has been developed. Circulations over the global and target domains are simulated with a single model, which includes fine meshes covering the target region to calculate meso-scale circulations. The stretched global model involves lower computational costs to simulate atmospheric aerosols with fine horizontal resolutions compared with a global uniform nonhydrostatic model, whereas it may require higher computational costs compared with the general regional models, because the stretched-grid system calculates inside and outside the target domain. As opposed to general regional models, the stretched-grid system requires neither a nesting technique nor lateral boundary conditions. In this study, we developed a new-type regional model for the simulation of aerosols over Japan, especially in the Kanto areas surrounding Tokyo, with a maximum horizontal resolution of approximately 10 km. This model usually reproduces temporal variations and their averages of the observed weather around Japan. This model generally reproduces monthly mean distributions of the observed sulfate and SO2 over East Asia, with high correlations (R > 0.6), but the underestimation of the simulated concentrations by 40% (sulfate) and 50% (SO2). Their underestimation of the simulated sulfate and SO2 concentrations over East Asia are strongly affected by their underestimation in China and possibly by the uncertainty of the simulated precipitation around Japan.

In previous work, we identified e-acetolactic acid in fermenting wort and showed it to be excreted by yeast cells and spontaneously converted to diacetyl (9-11, 16). This acid is labile and converts readily into diacetyl not only during fermentation, but also during analysis (9, 16). To avoid interference by this acid with the determination of diacetyl in fermenting wort, an\" acid-treatment\"(9, 10) was formerly used.

{"title": "Afadin regulates puncta adherentia junction formation and presynaptic differentiation in hippocampal neurons\n", "abstract": " The formation and remodeling of mossy fiber-CA3 pyramidal cell synapses in the stratum lucidum of the hippocampus are implicated in the cellular basis of learning and memory. Afadin and its binding cell adhesion molecules, nectin-1 and nectin-3, together with N-cadherin, are concentrated at puncta adherentia junctions (PAJs) in these synapses. Here, we investigated the roles of afadin in PAJ formation and presynaptic differentiation in mossy fiber-CA3 pyramidal cell synapses. At these synapses in the mice in which the afadin gene was conditionally inactivated before synaptogenesis by using nestin-Cre mice, the immunofluorescence signals for the PAJ components, nectin-1, nectin-3 and N-cadherin, disappeared almost completely, while those for the presynaptic components, VGLUT1 and bassoon, were markedly decreased. In addition, these signals were significantly decreased in cultured afadin-deficient hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, the interevent interval of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents was prolonged in the cultured afadin-deficient hippocampal neurons compared with control neurons, indicating that presynaptic functions were suppressed or a number of synapse was reduced in the afadin-deficient neurons. Analyses of presynaptic vesicle recycling and paired recordings revealed that the cultured afadin-deficient neurons showed impaired presynaptic functions. These results indicate that afadin regulates both PAJ formation and presynaptic differentiation in most mossy fiber-CA3 pyramidal cell synapses, while in a considerable population of these neurons, afadin regulates only PAJ formation but not presynaptic\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "27\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

We evaluated the clinical availability of a newly developed two-site immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) for human BGP and determined the serum BGP concentrations using this methodology in patients with abnormal calcium metabolism including those with end-stage renal disease undergoing maintenance dialysis. A cross-reactivity test revealed that this assay system specifically recognizes intact molecules (1-49) of BGP and excludes fragments of the molecules (1-19, 12-33, 23-33). Serum BGP levels in dialysis patients were positively correlated with those by conventional radioimmunoassay (RIA)(r= 0.918, p less than 0.00001, n= 37) as well as normal individuals (r= 0.935, p less than 0.0001, n= 16). However, the levels of BGP determined by IRMA were estimated to be significantly lower than those by RIA (23.6+/-9.8 vs. 29.6+/-9.1 ng/ml, p less than 0.00001). These results suggest that this IRMA system, with a rapid and easy procedure, excludes fragment forms of BGP in the circulation, which are found in uremic sera and probably attributed to increased bone resorption. Further studies are needed to ensure that serum intact BGP levels mainly reflect BGP production in osteoblasts, particularly in end-stage renal disease.", "num_citations": "27\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

{"title": "Analysis and experiment on the modulation sensitivity of Doppler radar vibration measurement\n", "abstract": " This letter analyzes the modulation sensitivity of Doppler radar vibration measurement using both 24 GHz and 2.4 GHz Doppler radars. A rigorous analysis is developed in terms of radar modulation sensitivity. In contrast to the common observation that the modulation sensitivity increases as the carrier frequency increases, it is shown that, for a given vibration motion, there exists a specific carrier frequency for optimal measurement. Experimental demonstration was carried out using both 24 GHz and 2.4 GHz radars to measure the same vibration, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver input was compared. It is shown that for cm scale movement, 2.4 GHz radar has a higher modulation sensitivity, while the 24 GHz radar has the optimal modulation sensitivity in the mm scale.", "num_citations": "26\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

{"title": "Effect of immobilization on insoluble collagen concentration and type I and type III collagen isoforms of rat soleus muscle\n", "abstract": " Immobilization is often associated with decreased muscle elasticity. This condition is known as muscle contracture; however, the mechanism remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to clarify the mechanism governing muscle contracture in rat soleus muscle by identifying changes in ankle joint mobility, insoluble collagen concentration and type I and type III collagen isoforms following 1-and 3-week immobilizations. Following a 1-week immobilization, range of motion (ROM) of dorsiflexion declined to 90% of the control value; additionally, ROM dropped to 67.5% of the control value after a 3-week immobilization. This finding suggested that ankle joint mobility decreases in conjunction with extended periods of immobilization. Insoluble collagen concentration in soleus muscles, which was unchanged after 1 week of immobilization, increased 3 weeks after immobilization. These results may be indicative of collagen fibers with strong intermolecular cross-links contained in the muscle was made increased relatively by 3 weeks of immobilization. Therefore, the change in intermolecular cross-links may be significant in terms of progress of muscle contracture with longer periods of immobilization. On the other hand, the ratio of type III to type I collagen isoforms in muscular tissue increased following a 1-week immobilization; moreover, this ratio remained constant after 3 weeks of immobilization. These data suggested that muscle immobilization may induce type III collagen isoform expression. The increase in the ratio of type III to type I collagen isoforms do not change in parallel with the increase in the limitation in ROM; however, this phenomenon\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

This study aimed to compare the effects of denosumab on bone mineral density (BMD) and bone turnover markers to those of alendronate in patients with GIOP.   Methods A prospective, single-center study of 32 patients (18 men; median age, 66.0 years) with glomerular disease receiving prednisolone (PSL) who were diagnosed as having GIOP and had not received bisphosphonates before was conducted. Participants were randomized to either alendronate (35 mg orally once a week) or denosumab (60 mg subcutaneously once every 6 months), and all subjects received calcitriol. The primary endpoint was the percent change in lumbar spine (LS) BMD at 12 months of treatment.   Results The demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline were not significantly different between the groups. Denosumab treatment markedly decreased serum levels of t-PINP, BAP, and TRACP-5b at 12 months compared to baseline (-57.4%, p<0.001; -30.9%, p<0.01; -57.7%, p<0.001, respectively). After 12 months of alendronate treatment, serum levels of t-PINP, BAP, and TRACP-5b were also significantly decreased compared to pretreatment (-38.9%, p<0.01; -16.3%, p<0.05; -43.5%, p<0.01, respectively). However, no significant differences in the changes of bone turnover markers were found between the two groups. As for the effects on BMD, denosumab treatment markedly increased LS BMD from 6 months compared to baseline, whereas no significant difference compared to pretreatment was found in the alendronate\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

Non-allelic homologous recombination (HR) between them can result in gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs). In fission yeast, Rad51 suppresses isochromosome formation that occurs between inverted repeats in the centromere. However, how the HR enzyme prevents homology-mediated GCRs remains unclear. Here, we provide evidence that Rad51 with the aid of the Swi/Snf-type motor protein Rad54 promotes non-crossover recombination between centromere repeats to prevent isochromosome formation. Mutations in Rad51 and Rad54 epistatically increased the rates of isochromosome formation and chromosome loss. In sharp contrast, these mutations decreased gene conversion between inverted repeats in the centromere. Remarkably, analysis of recombinant DNAs revealed that rad51 and rad54 increase the proportion of crossovers\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

However, for the laminated samples, there were slight variations in the shock-absorption efficiency for samples with the same density. The graded materials showed higher shock-absorption efficiency compared with non-graded single materials with the same density.

Econazole, an imidazole antimycotic, directly interacts with unsaturated fatty acids in the yeast cell membrane, where it also inhibits the synthesis of ergosterol and decreases the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids. In contrast, alcohol acetyltransferase (AATase), which catalyzes the synthesis of isoamyl acetate, is inhibited by unsaturated fatty acids. Fifty econazole-resistant mutants were isolated from a sake yeast, Kyokai no. 701, several of which produced approximately 1.4 to 2.4 times more isoamyl acetate and an almost equal amount of isoamyl alcohol compared with the parental strain. The AATase activities of the mutants in koji extract were 1.2 to 1.4 times higher, and the unsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratios were lower, than in the parental strain.", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

These HPVs have two oncogenes, E6 and E7, that have transforming activities in established murine cells. Tumorigenicity and decreased serum requirement for cell growth are conferred by the E6 gene, whereas anchorage\u2010independent growth is mainly governed by the E7 gene. To understand the mechanism of cellular transformation by the HPV16 E6 gene, we examined three mutant E6 proteins defective for p53 binding, p53 degradation, or transactivation of the adenovirus E2 promoter for the ability to induce tumorigenicity and decreased serum requirement. The results showed that tumorigenicity and decreased serum requirement were associated with the ability of E6 to bind to p53, although the subsequent degradation of p53 was not required for these functions.

Here, we provide a review of the theory underlying HAL treatment as well as our clinical experience and recommendations for future clinical studies using HAL in acute stroke patients. We performed a PubMedbased literature search, a retrospective data review of our acute stroke case series, and included a sample case report of our findings. Given past animal studies and functional imaging results, iBF therapy using the HAL in the acute phase of stroke seems an appropriate approach for preventing learned non-use and interhemispheric excitation imbalances. iBF therapy may furthermore promote appropriate neuronal network reorganization. Based on experiences in our stroke center, HAL rehabilitation is a safe and effective treatment modality for recovering motor impairments after acute stroke, and allows the design of tailored rehabilitation programs for individual patients. iBF therapy through the HAL system seems to be an effective and promising approach to stroke rehabilitation; however, the superiority of this treatment to conventional rehabilitation remains unclear. Further clinical studies are warranted. Additionally, the formation of a patient registry will permit a meta-analysis of HAL cases and address the problems associated with a controlled trial (eg, the heterogeneity of an acute stroke cohort).

Responses in a speech perception task were measured for speed, accuracy, and stability in two conditions that varied stimulus presentation rate: high rate and same rate conditions. TD children exhibited significantly more stable responses in the high rate condition than they did in the same rate condition. Multiple regression analyses indicated that response stability in the high rate condition accounted for a unique amount of variance in reading and mora deletion. As a group, children with RD performed less accurately than did TD children in the high rate condition, but not in the same rate condition.

{"title": "Validation of cross-genotype neutralization by hepatitis B virus-specific monoclonal antibodies by in vitro and in vivo infection\n", "abstract": " Vaccines based on hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype A have been used worldwide for immunoprophylaxis and are thought to prevent infections by non-A HBV strains effectively, whereas, vaccines generated from genotype C have been used in several Asian countries, including Japan and Korea, where HBV genotype C is prevalent. However, acute hepatitis B caused by HBV genotype A infection has been increasing in Japan and little is known about the efficacy of immunization with genotype C-based vaccines against non-C infection. We have isolated human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from individuals who were immunized with the genotype C-based vaccine. In this study, the efficacies of these two mAbs, HB0116 and HB0478, were analyzed using in vivo and in vitro models of HBV infection. Intravenous inoculation of HBV genotype C into chimeric mice with human hepatocytes resulted in the establishment of HBV infection after five weeks, whereas preincubation of the inocula with HB0116 or HB0478 protected chimeric mice from genotype C infection completely. Interestingly, both HB0116 and HB0478 were found to block completely genotype A infection. Moreover, infection by a genotype C strain with an immune escape substitution of amino acid 145 in the hepatitis B surface protein was also completely inhibited by incubation with HB0478. Finally, in vitro analysis of dose dependency revealed that the amounts of HB0478 required for complete protection against genotype C and genotype A infection were 5.5 mIU and 55 mIU, respectively. These results suggested that genotype C-based vaccines have ability to induce cross-genotype\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

Although no standard treatment for DIC has been established, recent reports have indicated that recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rTM) is effective against DIC.Methods To elucidate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of DIC, we retrospectively analyzed 92 DIC patients who were treated with rTM at Miyazaki Prefectural Hospital over a 4-year period (62 patients had infectious diseases and 30 patients had hematological diseases). A diagnosis of DIC was made based on the diagnostic criteria of the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine (JAAM) and Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare (JMHW) for infectious diseases and hematological diseases, respectively. In addition to treating the underlying disease, rTM was administered for six consecutive days.Results In this study, 49 of the 92 DIC patients (53.3%) experienced resolution of DIC seven days after administration (46.8% patients with infectious disease and 66.7% with hematological disease). A higher survival rate was observed after a 28-day observation period in 69 of the 92 patients (75.0%)(72.6% of the patients with infectious disease and 80.0% of the patients with hematological disease). A lower DIC score at the initiation of rTM treatment was closely related to a higher rate of resolution of DIC.Conclusion Our findings indicate that rTM therapy is an effective, safe and feasible treatment for DIC patients.

{"title": "Effects of long-term oral administration of arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid on the immune functions of young rats\n", "abstract": " Natural killer (NK) cells have many functional activities, including cytotoxicity and the capacity to produce cytokines and chemokines. NK cell activity is regulated partly by eicosanoids, which are produced from arachidonic acid (ARA) and eicosapentaenoic (EPA) acid. In this study, we investigated the effects of long-term therapy with ARA or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on the cytotoxic effects of the NK cells of young rats, which were fed on a nonfish oil diet for two generations. Control oil, ARA (240 mg/kg BW/day) or DHA (240 mg/kg BW/day) were orally administrated to the rats for 13 weeks before determining the cytotoxic activity of NK cells from the spleen against YAC-1 mouse lymphoma cell line, as well as the plasma levels of docosanoids or eicosanoids and inflammatory cytokines. Long-term ARA administration significantly suppressed the cytotoxic activity of NK cells. Moreover, ARA administration significantly increased the plasma levels of ARA, prostaglandin (PG) E 2, and PGD 2. However, DHA administration did not produce any different effects compared with those in the control rats. Furthermore, the inflammatory cytokine levels were not affected by the administration of ARA or DHA. These results suggest that long-term ARA administration has an inhibitory effect on the tumor cytotoxicity of NK cells in rat spleen lymphocytes owing to the enhanced synthesis of PGE 2 and PGD 2 from ARA because of the elevated plasma ARA levels in young rats.

Because theater involves various technical elements, such as stage design and lighting, the production team must work in cooperation among various departments to design a theatrical production. When planning a theatrical production, it is difficult to visualize the stage as a whole and to incorporate the ideas of production team members from various departments. In this paper, we propose a system for reproducing the theatrical stage by means of a virtual stage linked to a physical miniature stage. The miniature stage is presented on a tabletop interface, and the virtual stage is created by computer graphics to reflect the actions on the miniature stage in real time. By actually presenting theatrical production ideas in two spaces, users can more easily collaborate and gain a comprehensive view of the stage.", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

A total of 131 burn patients were classified into two groups: burn patients with smoke inhalation injury (Group IB: 73 patients) and burn patients without inhalation injury (Group B: 58 patients). Fluid resuscitation was commenced according to the Parkland formula and the infusion rate was modified to meet the main resuscitation goal of an hourly urine output of 1.0 to 2.0 ml/kg. Regression analyses were performed on the volume of fluid administered during the initial 24 hours after injury by burn size for each group. The linear equations obtained were Y (ml/kg/24 hrs)= 71.0+ 5.08 x% TBSA (Group IB) and Y= 39.7+ 5.14 x% TBSA (Group B). A substantial effect of inhalation injury on fluid requirement was speculated to be reflected in ay intercept difference of about 30 ml/kg/24 hrs.

{"title": "Abundance of prereplicative complexes (Pre-RCs) facilitates recombinational repair under replication stress in fission yeast\n", "abstract": " Mcm2\u20137 complexes are loaded onto chromatin with the aid of Cdt1 and Cdc18/Cdc6 and form prereplicative complexes (pre-RCs) at multiple sites on each chromosome. Pre-RCs are essential for DNA replication and surviving replication stress. However, the mechanism by which pre-RCs contribute to surviving replication stress is largely unknown. Here, we isolated the fission yeast mcm6-S1 mutant that was hypersensitive to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and camptothecin (CPT), both of which cause forks to collapse. The mcm6-S1 mutation impaired the interaction with Cdt1 and decreased the binding of minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins to replication origins. Overexpression of Cdt1 restored MCM binding and suppressed the sensitivity to MMS and CPT, suggesting that the Cdt1-Mcm6 interaction is important for the assembly of pre-RCs and the repair of collapsed forks.

Grain size within sediment cores from the middle of Mishou Bay decreased from the beginning of the 1800s to the 1900s. In contrast, a grain size profile from the river mouth shows a gradual increase in grain size up through the sediment core. These changes in grain size indicate a decrease in tidal current velocity within the middle of the bay and that the delta system is gradually prograding from the river mouth. Records of organic matter composition and sulfur contents indicate that the effect of the river on seafloor sedimentation became stronger during the nineteenth century. These changes are related to reclamation during the late 1700s\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

Laser welding of butt joints, which were different in location and thickness of oxide film, were performed. Examinations were made on the weld characteristics which were: bead geometry, defect, and microstructure. Light emitted from laser induced plasma was also analyzed to understand welding phenomena. The results of these experiments lead to understanding that oxide film, especially on the joint face, causes substantial spatters, an underfilled surface, the disappearance of the nail head, porosity formation, and reduction of hardness. It is considered that these are attributed to oxygen, which reduces surface tension of molten metal and reacts with carbon, manganese, and silicon.

After the scanning annealing at a preheating temperature of 800\u00a0\u00b0C, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation was then used to confirm 10\u201350-nm nanoparticles in FeSi2=8.4\u00a0at% composite films. Amorphous and single-phase FeSi2 films were also crystallized by the scanning annealing to determine the type of crystal phase of the nanoparticles. Lower preheating temperature (<800\u00a0\u00b0C) yielded \u03b2-FeSi2 films, whereas higher preheating temperature (>900\u00a0\u00b0C) yielded \u03b1-FeSi2 films.

The present study deals with the structure-activity relationship of plactins and their effects in U937 cells and mice. The results obtained from 50 plactin D analogues with a single amino acid substitution demonstrated that the following substitutions were detrimental: the enantiomer for each of the five residues; a polar, an acidic or a basic residue for D-Val, L-Leu, D-Leu or L-Phe; a polar, a hydrophobic or an acidic residue for D-Arg. On the other hand, a compound with L-Leu or L-Val in place of L-Phe was seven times as active as plactin D. These results suggest an essential role of a sterically restricted arrangement of four hydrophobic residues and the adjacent basic residue. The enhancement of fibrinolysis was dependent on plasma, ranging from 2- to 3-fold when U937 cells\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

Both oc, AGP and oa, AT had suppressive effects on immunoglobulin synthesis, and these effects were more evident on IgM than on IgG synthesis. Hp had a slight suppressive effect on IgM synthesis. Studies on the binding of \u2018Z51-labeled oc, AGP and oc, AT to lymphocytes revealed no measurable binding of 0\u00a2, AGP, but there was a significant binding of oc, AT to the lymphocytes. Therefore, the mechanism of the suppressive effects of oc, AGP on immunoglobulin synthesis is probably indirect, in that o\u00a2, AGP may interfere with an effective factor or factors which are secreted from macrophages or T-lymphocytes and stimulate B-lymphocytes to synthesize immunoglobulin. On the other hand, cx, AT binds to lymphocytes and thereby affects the metabolism involved in immunoglobulin synthesis.Kamrin (17) was the first to report the finding of a. substance with an immunosuppressive function, in rat serum.

{"title": "On the cleavage plane of tempered martensite\n", "abstract": " The main characteristic of cleavage is the orientation relationship between the plane of the crack and the crystal structure through which the crack passes. It has already been proved that cleavage occurred along the {100} plane in the ferritic steel (1). The most evident fracture surface features associated with cleavage are the flatness of the facet and the formation of river patterns. A large number of tempered martensitic steels fracture along transgranular paths producing fracture surfaces similar to those caused by cleavage of the ferritic steel. For this type of fracture in tempered martensitic steels\" the quasi-cleavage\" has been proposed, since the fracture path has not yet been related to the orientation of the crystal structure through which the cracks passed (2).The present investigation was carried out to prove directly the relationship between the fracture facets and the crystal lattice planes of a low carbon tempered martensite.

The prognosis of mucinous carcinomas is generally thought to be poor, but their clinical and histological features are not well known. In this study, we attempted to clinicopathologically characterize colorectal mucinous carcinomas. Of the 607 colorectal cancer patients, a group of 20 mucinous carcinoma patients (3.3%) and a group of 553 control patients were included in this study. The mucinous carcinomas were subclassified into the following two types to analyze clinicopathological parameters and outcomes: the papillotubular (PT) type and the mucocellular (MC) type. Clinicopathologically, the MC type showed higher rates of venous invasion, lymph node metastasis, liver metastasis, and peritoneal dissemination and higher frequencies of TNM stage III and IV cancers than the PT type. The MC type had a significantly poorer 3-year survival rate of 27% compared with 60% for the PT type. The MC-type mucinous carcinomas showed a significantly higher expression rate (37.5%) of MMP-9 than that (16.6%) in the PT-type mucinous carcinomas. Overall, the colorectal mucinous carcinomas progressed more rapidly and had a poorer prognosis than the control (nonmucinous) cancers. The histological subclassifications MC and PT tended to be molecular-biologically different, and the MC type was poorer in terms of clinicopathological parameters and outcomes.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

Bronchoalveolar lavage disclosed an increase in the total number of cells and a marked increase of lymphocytes. A lung specimen obtained by transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) was pathologically diagnosed as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). Withdrawal of minocycline led to rapid remission without treatment. The clinical course and histological findings for TBLB suggested that this case was minocycline-induced BOOP.

For SDD test, filter paper saturated with antiserum was placed on agar gel, and filter paper disks for sample antigens were arranged around it. Solution of 24% NaCl was used successfully for dissociating CMV (including 5 isolates) into fast diffusible and immunoreactive antigen. Immunoreactions were finally read after overnight period at room temperature. The serological detection of CMV was found to be as sensitive as, or in some cases, more reliable than bioassay on cowpea.

Although this regimen has been widely accepted in Japan, the adverse effect of CDDP such as gastrointestinal and renal toxicity may sometimes be the cause of interruption of the treatment, especially among the elderly patients. Cis-diammine-glycolatoplatinum (nedaplatin: CDGP) is a new platinum agent, which was developed with the aim of decreasing renal and gastrointestinal toxicities but maintaining the effectiveness of CDDP. We reported the efficacy and safety of CRT using CDGP and 5-FU for locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the esopahagus. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2001 and December 2007, 65 patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer (39 patients with unresectable tumor (cT4) and 26 patients with distant lymph node or bulkey lymph node metastasis) were eligible and given informed consent and cared by the Department of Surgical Oncology of Osaka City University. Patients received a continuous infusion of 5-FU (250 mg/body) on days 1-21. CDGP was administered at the dose of 10 mg/body by bolus infusion for 1 hour on days 1-5, 8-12 and 15-19 just before radiotherapy. Radiotherapy was delivered in 1.8 Gy fractions, 5 days/week for 4 weeks.

In a manner analogous to insulin and mechanical stimuli such as stretch, IGF-I stimulates glucose transport through recruitment of glucose transporters to surface membranes in skeletal muscles. It is known that IGF-I is secreted from skeletal muscle cells in response to stretch. Therefore, we examined whether IGF-I is involved in the mechanism by which mechanical stretch regulates glucose transport using cultured C2C12 myotubes. IGF-I increased 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) uptake, and this created an additive effect with mechanical stretch, suggesting that these stimuli enhance glucose transport through different mechanisms.

Kokubo et al. reported that HAp can be chemically coated onto a titanium surface by sequential immersion in aqueous NaOH solution, heat treatment, and soaking in a simulated body fluid (SBF). 1\u20134) They also confirmed that HAp can be formed in vivo on alkali-and heat-treated titanium. Nishiguchi et al. showed, however, that alkali-treated titanium without heat treatment had no bone-bonding ability in vivo because of delamination of the bioactive film. 5) They suggested that both alkali and heat treatment are essential for preparing bioactive titanium. Their results imply that the cohesion of the film on alkali-treated titanium can be increased by heat treatment. Kim et al. examined the cohesion of a HAp layer on alkaliand heat-treated titanium by tensile testing with loading normal to the HAp\u2013titanium interface. 6) Because of the lack of adhesion of the glue used to attach the specimen, the effect of heat treatment on cohesion of the HAp layer on alkalitreated titanium was not clarified. Fracture during tensile testing did not occur at the HAp\u2013titanium interface, but at the HAp\u2013glue boundary. Because a film on alkali-and/or heattreated titanium in vivo would be in contact with living bone and be subjected to a shear stress from it, a scratch test appears to be more appropriate than a tensile test for evaluating the cohesion of the film.

When the AO-60 content is 15 wt%, CPE/AO-60 is an incompatible system. The crystals on the surface of samples changed sequentially from a polyhedron shape to a platelet shape and then to a needle shape as the annealing temperature was reduced. The annealed samples showed two melting peaks. The high temperature peak is due to the melting of the AO-60 crystals observed. In contrast, in the case of a compatible CPE/AO-60 (5 wt%) system, AO-60 crystals also were observed but there was no change in the shape of crystals. The crystal growth of AO-60 within a CPE matrix is thought to depend on the compatibility of CPE/AO-60.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

However, this may not operate in advanced renal failure. The present study was designed to evaluate the influence of serum phosphate levels on PTH secretion in oral 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1, 25 (OH) 2D3] pulse therapy. 22 patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism [carboxy-terminal PTH (c-PTH) concentration: 19.5+/-13.9 ng/ml, mean+/-SD] received oral doses of 1, 25 (OH) 2D3 (3.0-4.0 micrograms) twice a week, each at the end of hemodialysis, for 12 weeks. Doses of phosphate binders remained unchanged throughout this period. Patients were divided into two groups: group A (11 subjects) with mean serum phosphate levels of less than 6.0 mg/dl and group B (11 subjects) with levels of 6.0 mg/dl and above. There was no significant difference in the average corrected serum calcium levels. The reduction in serum intact PTH levels was greater in group A than in group B. A negative correlation (r=-0.48; p< 0.05) was observed between mean serum phosphate levels and the percent decrease in serum c-PTH levels. The findings of this study indicate an important role for dietary phosphate reduction in oral 1, 25 (OH) 2D3 pulse therapy and suggest that serum phosphate reduction may play a part in suppressing PTH secretion through a mechanism independent of 1, 25 (OH) 2D3 and plasma calcium levels.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

Thirteen patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction due to old anterior myocardial infarction (OMI) and nine normal subjects were used as controls. The right ventricular end-diastolic pressure and volume index, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, and total pulmonary vascular resistance index were almost the same in the DCM and OMI patients. The right ventricular ejection fraction was 44.2+/-6.0%(mean+/-SD) in DCM patients and 47.1+/-7.9% in OMI patients, both significantly lower than those in the normal subjects (54.5+/-5.3%), but with no difference between the two case groups. The right ventricular peak filling rate was significantly reduced in both case groups as compared with the normal subjects (2.46+/-0.81 EDV/sec). The reduction was significantly greater (p< 0.05) in the DCM group (0.97+/-0.47 EDV/sec) than in the OMI group (1.61+/-0.46 EDV/sec). Cineangiography showed that the wall motion abnormality of the interventricular septum was remarkable in OMI patients, but was relatively mild in DCM patients. Lesions of the interventricular septum may be of major importance in right ventricular dysfunction in OMI, while extensive severe damage to the right ventricular free wall may be important in DCM. 81mKr blood pool scintigraphy is useful in the study of the right ventricular systolic and diastolic function.

Three-dimensional finite element simulation (FE simulation) was utilized for this purpose, and the caliber-rolling process of square/foval pass was investigated from the viewpoints of a large strain accumulation and cross-sectional shape variation in a bar. The UFG steel bars were fabricated by using the commercial caliber-rolling with the grooves designed from FE simulation.

On day +140, the patient developed CMV retinitis of her left eye despite the continuing antiviral therapy. DLI at a dose of 1\u2003\u00d7\u2003105 CD3+ cells/kg was added to ganciclovir and foscarnet therapy. Eighteen days after the DLI, the funduscopic findings revealed improvement of the retinitis and the development of vitreous inflammation. Simultaneously, the number of CD4+ cells in the peripheral blood rapidly increased. Thus, we consider it likely that DLI induced a local immune response against CMV antigens, which resulted in the immune recovery vitritis\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

Data of discharge intervals were measured with an IEC (b) electrode system. The maximum Lyapunov exponents calculated from these data were estimated to be positive values. Additionally, the calculated correlation dimension showed non-integer value, and also autocorrelation rapidly converged on a near zero value.

However, development of the algorithm for the recognition has been based on the trial and error method. Many researchers have reported that neural networks are suitable for pattern recognition because of the ability of selforganization, parallel processing, and generalization. In this paper, we present a new bill money recognition method with neural network and show the effectiveness of the present algorithm compared with the conventional method by discrimination functions. Furthermore, we transform bill money data by FFT into frequency domain to reduce influence of the noise due to conveyed fluctuation. Then we adopt these Fourier coefficients or its amplitudes as input of the neural network.

One of the most prevalent non-neoplastic causes is portal hypertension mostly due to liver cirrhosis. On the other hand, liver cirrhosis may underlie various extrahepatic manifestations including development of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Here, we report a case of primary follicular lymphoma of the spleen in a patient with liver cirrhosis related to hepatitis C and alcohol. The lymphoma was incidentally found in an enlarged spleen resected palliatively to alleviate symptomatic pancytopenia of the patient. The main characteristic of our case is an incidental finding of a rare situation brought by careful pathological examination.

However, various side effects, including liver dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, anorexia, hyperammonemia, and pancreatitis have been reported in association with the administration of VPA. Recently, renal Fanconi syndrome associated with VPA treatment has occasionally been reported. However, the mechanisms and detailed characteristics of this adverse effect remain unknown. We herein report three cases of Fanconi syndrome associated with VPA treatment. All of these patients were severely disabled children, who had been previously treated with multiple antiepileptic drugs, and also required tube feeding. The possible risk factors of Fanconi syndrome in these three cases were similar to those previously reported in the literature. In addition, all three patients developed Fanconi syndrome after the onset of bacterial infections. Before developing Fanconi syndrome, hypouricemia was observed in all three and an increased urinary level of beta2 microglobulin (beta2MG) was also noted in one of the patients. None of these patients had hypophosphatemia. Two patients had an appropriate serum VPA level, while the other had an inappropriately high level. We therefore recommend that severely disabled children receiving multiple antiepileptic drugs and tube feeding be periodically checked for urinary beta2MG and uric acid, especially during the course of any infectious episodes.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

However, the stimulating point determined in this way is not supposed to be plausible because electric field induced in TMS is dispersed over the brain vectorially. The present study proposed the novel method for the accurate estimation of stimulating points of the cortex in TMS. In our proposed method, the cortical structure and property of neural excitation in magnetic nerve stimulation were taken into account.

Endoscopic examination was performed because of stomach-ache revealed advanced gastric cancer of Borrmann 4. Desiring for a conservative therapy, he was discharged and moved to a hospice. In literature review, MGN is the most frequent lesion among various glomerular diseases associated with malignancy, such as the lung, stomach, and colon, particularly at an elderly ages, and sometimes antedates the detection of malignancy, as in the present case. In several cases with MGN, immune-complexes composed of tumor antigens, such as carcino-embryonic antigen, and antibodies have been reported to deposit in basement membrane of glomeruli, causing MGN.

The best way to study the secretory activity of the parathyroid glands directly may be to measure the biologically active intact PTH molecule. Recently, it has become possible to overcome these limitations by application of the two-site immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) to the measurement of intact PTH. The two-site immunometric technique has been applied to the two-site immunochemiluminescent assay (ICMA) for the measurement of circulating intact PTH. To evaluate the utility of measurements of serum intact PTH by two-site ICMA in hemodialysis patients, two-site ICMA and IRMA were compared in 104 hemodialysis patients. We found a good correlation (r= 0.93) between values obtained by ICMA and by IRMA. Although serum intact PTH by ICMA was significantly suppressed by rising plasma ionized calcium after a session of hemodialysis in 29 patients, mid-region PTH did not show a significant change. This result suggests the intact PTH assay is more suitable for the earlier detection of secondary hyperparathyroidism than the mid-region assay and may be useful for precise assessment of clinical status and response to therapeutic intervention designed to correct the progressive bone disease in hemodialysis patients. We conclude that two-site ICMA for serum intact PTH which could be measured without radioisotopes nor scintillation counter is as useful as IRMA in hemodialysis patients.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

Relationships between the IgM concentration in swine colostrum and each item were analyzed. Of the 12 items, 3 items--season, breed, and vaccination of swine erysipelas live-organism vaccine--were the most influential on the IgM concentration in colostra of farm-raised sows. Five items--district, age, kind of feed, vaccination with transmissible gastroenteritis live-virus vaccine, and number of sows raised on a farm--were moderately influential.

Although \u03b2-alanine (\u03b2) substitutions in 8-ring PI polyamides have been well analyzed, efficacy of double \u03b2 substitutions for lengthened DNA minor groove recognition has not been elucidated in vivo. Here, we show effectiveness of double \u03b2 substitutions in PI polyamides to retain high affinity of specific lengthened DNA binding and suppress target gene expression in cells. Initially we synthesized four 12-ring PI polyamides targeting the AP-1 site within MMP-9 gene promoter, 1-4, including a \u03b2/\u03b2 pair (3) and two adjacent Py/\u03b2 and \u03b2/Im pairs (4) and investigated the binding kinetics with oligoDNA containing preferred sequence (5\u2019-AGTCAGCA-3\u2019) by surface plasmon resonance assays and MMP-9 mRNA expression in MDA-MB-231 cells. The PI polyamides 3 and 4 showed high affinities of target DNA binding (KD= 4.33\u00d7 10-8) and (KD= 5.00\u00d7 10-8), respectively and significant down regulation of MMP-9 expression. We then considered adjacent Im/\u03b2 and \u03b2/Im pairs should solve the problem of repeating GC sequence. A PI polyamide 5 targeting the E2F site, 5\u2019-TTGGCGC-3, within the MYCN promoter was synthesized and tested binding affinity and MYCN suppression in MYCN amplified CHP134 human neuroblastoma cells. The PI polyamide 5 showed high affinity (KD= 3.07\u00d7 10-8) binding of the target sequence and significantly suppressed MYCN mRNA expression.

The diagnosis of pleural sarcoidosis using thoracentesis may be less invasive when sarcoidosis is already diagnosed histologically in more than one organ specimen. Here we report the case of a 64-year-old woman with pleural sarcoidosis diagnosed on the basis of an increased CD4/CD8 lymphocyte ratio in pleural effusion fluid obtained by thoracentesis. This case report is important because it highlights the usefulness of the CD4/CD8 lymphocyte ratio in pleural effusion as an indicator of pleural involvement of sarcoidosis. A 64-year-old Japanese woman visited our hospital with an initial symptom of dyspnea on exertion for a period of 4 months.

Among voice-quality features, we find that the spectral tilts depend on the type and degree of emotion.

On the other hand, the spectral-tilt quantities were found to decrease as the degree of \u201cdispirited-and-whispering-type (cold) sadness\u201d increased. We formulate a transfer function that converts spectral-tilt quantities of \u201cneutral\u201d speech to those of emotional speech in various degrees.

Enteral feeding has become an important means of providing nutritional support to seriously ill patients. Placement of the feeding tube through the pyloric ring and past the ligament of Treitz into the proximal jejunum is critical to reduce the risk of gastroesophageal regurgitation and microaspiration. We started utilizing transnasal endoscopy for intestinal feeding tube place ment, placing enteral tubes for 40 patients between March 2008 and February 2009.

Deformation of the nuclear geometry reduces the orbital energy gap for which the EOVC is nonzero, and enhances the attractive force for superconductivity.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

{"title": "Effect of magnetocrystalline anisotropy on the low temperature heat capacity of HoAl2\n", "abstract": " Rare earth\u2013aluminum compounds of the composition RAl2 crystallize in Laves phase cubic structure. Low temperature magnetic and thermal properties of these compounds have been investigated thoroughly during the past decade. The occurrence of large magnetocrystalline anisotropy results in significant modifications of magnetic and thermal properties of these materials. In the present study the heat capacity of ferromagnetically ordered HoAl2 was measured in the temperature range 1.5\u201312 K. An examination of the data reveals that the measured heat capacity Cp can be described by the relation Cp=CN(T)+CM(T)+\u03b3T+\u03b2T3, where CN is the nuclear term, CM the magnetic term; \u03b3T and \u03b2T3 are electronic and lattice heat capacities, respectively. A detailed analysis of the magnetic heat capacity term indicates a dependence of the form CM=AT3/2 exp(\u2212\u0394/kT) with \u0394/k=6.0 K.

However, it often suffers practical difficulties since most of organic compounds are insoluble in water. One promising methodology to improve the reactivity in water is to use surfactants that emulsify the organic/water mixture. Efficient extraction from the emulsified mixture is necessary to reduce the usage of organic solvent. Methods: We designed polymer micelle that can be turned on and off by temperature-stimuli. Poly(Nisopropyl acrylamide), known as thermoresponsive polymer, was copolymerized with the acrylate ester of 4-hydroxy-Lproline using a reversible addition/fragmentation chain transfer polymerization (RAFT) reagent that contains a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chain to obtain a polymer-tethered organocatalyst.

The CCD imaging technique was examined to evaluate the displacement under the various d.c. potential patterns. Two different d.c. potential patterns with or without a rest were applied to the electrodes at 0.1\u2009Hz. It was better to take a rest at 0\u2009V for the polarization back and forth between +2 and \u22122\u2009V to give lower current consumption and longer displacement. The actuator produced the force of ca. 0.95\u2009g at 3.25\u2009V in air. The result also demonstrated that higher overpotential has to be avoided to maintain the maximum force. The generative force is in inverse proportion to the length of the actuators. The dimension of the film strongly governs the force production and its performance.

Using SiO2 concentration, stream discharge during rainstorms was sq3a~ l into direct runoff and baseflow. Baseflow accounted for 80% of discharge during rainfall events. Additionally, The strong correlations between TP and SS load to the direct runoff, and N03-N and TN load to the baseflow were shown. Particularly, it was confirmed that suspended component loads such as TP and SS were transported with direct runoff and dissolved components such as TN andN03-N were carried with baseflow. On the basis of those results the TN lode was separated into the direct runoff component and the base flow component by statistical method The results indicate that 76% of TN load was baseflow load. It was concluded that TN originating from the shallow uplard soil layer dominates the TN load. Since it is difficult to control the baseflow nitrogen load, it become more important to reduce nitrogen input itself to the upland field.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

Rats were injected ip with BGD (2mmol/kg) immediately after iv injection of DDP (20\u03bcmol/kg). A scanning electron micrograph of the jejunum after DDP treatment showed damage in the villi, and that BGD protected the DDP-induced jejunal damage. BGD treatment also had a protective effect against DDP-induced diarrhea. BGD significantly reversed the reduction in maltase and sucrase activities of jejunal mucosa of rats treated with DDP. Platinum (Pt) concentrations in the gastrointestine as well as in the kidney and liver after DDP injection decreased following BGD treatment. The reduction of leukocytes following DDP injection returned to control values after BGD treatment. Biliary and urinary excretions of Pt after DDP injection was remarkably increased by BGD treatment. The results of this study indicated that the injection of BGD to rats treated with DDP can effectively remove Pt from the body through biliary and urinary excretions, resulting in protection of the gastrointestinal and bone marrow toxicities induced by DDP treatment.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

Namely, it is perovskite below 1160\u00a0\u00b0C, at which the garnet structure starts to appear, while an unknown structure appears at 1250\u00a0\u00b0C. On the other hand, the sample surface also shows drastic changes if the temperature exceeds 1160\u00a0\u00b0C. Furthermore, many elliptical spots are induced after the annealing at 1200 or 1250\u00a0\u00b0C. Moreover, hydroxyl groups are generated at 1300\u00a0\u00b0C. It is desirable to take these structural changes into\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

A 52-year-old woman was admitted with a ruptured right VAD involving the origin of the developed PICA. Endovascular internal trapping of the enlarged distal VAD was performed (Stage 1). After 1 month, following confirmation of platelet inhabitation (Stage 2) an Enterprise stent (Cordis Neurovascular, Miami Lakes, FL) placement from the PICA to the proximal VA with coil embolization for proximal VAD was performed under dual antiplatelet therapy. The dissected VA segment was occluded by coil embolization and the PICA was preserved. Advantages of this staged treatment are the avoidance of ischemic/hemorrhagic complications due to antithrombotic therapy when stent placement to the PICA is planned during the acute stage of SAH and confirmation of platelet inhabitation before stent placement in second treatment. VAD can be occluded, and this challenging endovascular treatment can be a therapeutic option for a ruptured VAD.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

To regulate endometrial function in fertility treatment, prednisolone (PSL) is administered for suppression of increased natural killer cells and stimulation of endometrium embryo transfer (SEET) to enhance communication between embryo and maternal tissues. We attempted to improve the endometrial condition by PSL administration and SEET during frozen\u2013thawed blastocyst transfer (FBT). Patients took PSL (5 mg) 3 times daily for 3 days after ovulation during the FBT cycle. To analyse effects of PSL combined with SEET, we determined rates of chemical pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, foetal heart movement (FHM) and live birth. Rates of chemical pregnancy, clinical pregnancy and FHM were significantly higher in the PSL(+)/SEET(+) (57.7%, 50.0% and 46.2%, respectively) and PSL(+)/SEET(-) (53.3%, 46.7% and 46.7%, respectively) groups than in the PSL(-)/SEET(+) (30.3%, 18.2% and 18.2%, respectively) and PSL(-)/SEET(-) (22.4%, 22.4% and 18.4%; P = 0.0043, 0.0081 and 0.0055, respectively) groups.

Our aim is to investigate clinical significance of ICT-CLEIA in patients with HBV. METHODS: Of 829 HB carriers in our hospital and 167 commercial panels, performance of ICT-CLEIA (detection range 0.0005-2.5 IU/mL) was compared with two quantitative HBsAg detection systems (Architect HBsAg QT assay [0.05-250 IU/mL] and HISCL HBsAg assay [0.03-2500 IU/mL]) and COBAS TaqMan HBV-DNA assay (CTM, 2.1 Log copies/ml) using serum samples from patients or panels. RESULTS: The ICT-CLEIA had good accuracy and reproducibility. The sensitivity of wild type and HBsAg escape mutants (I126S, D144A, G145R) by ICT-CLEIA was 2--5 to 2--6 times higher than that of Architect HBsAg QT. For clinical practice, ICT-CLEIA assay could detect HBsAg even in the presence of anti-HBs during window periods in acute hepatitis B panel. HBsAg has been detectable for around 9 years in a patient with HBsAg clearance by Architect. In a patient with HBV reactivation after bone marrow transplantation followed by systematic chemotherapy, HBsAg by ICT-CLEIA was detectable at the same time point when HBV-DNA was detected by PCR. In conclusion, the ICT-CLEIA assay permits not only an earlier detection of acute hepatitis B infection but also may be useful for monitoring hepatitis B patients.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

{"title": "Motion adaptive orientation adjustment of a virtual teacher to support physical task learning\n", "abstract": " Watching a real teacher in a real environment from a good distance and with a clear viewing angle has a significant effect on learning physical tasks. This applies to physical-task learning in a mixed-reality environment as well. Observing and imitating body motion is important for learning some physical tasks, including spatial collaborative work. When people learn a task with physical objects, they want to try and practice the task with the actual objects. They also want to keep the referential behavior model close to them at all times. Showing the virtual teacher by using mixed-reality technology can create such an environment, and thus has been researched in this study. It is known that a virtual teacher-model\u2019s position and orientation influence (a) the number of errors, and (b) the accomplishment time in physical-task learning using mixed-reality environments. This paper proposes an automatic adjustment method governing the virtual teacher\u2019s horizontal rotation angle, so that the learner can easily observe important body motions. The method divides the whole task motion into fixed duration segments, and seeks the most important moving part of the body in each segment, and then rotates the virtual teacher to show the most important part to the learner accordingly. To evaluate the method, a generic physical-task learning experiment was conducted. The method was revealed to be effective for motions that gradually reposition the most important moving part, such as in some manufacturing and cooking tasks. This study is therefore considered likely to enhance the transference of physical-task skills.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

{"title": "Dual modulation of prothrombin activation by the cyclopentapeptide plactin\n", "abstract": " Plactin, a family of cyclopentapeptides, enhances fibrinolytic activity by elevating the activity of cellular urokinase\u2010type plasminogen activator (u\u2010PA), a protease involved in a variety of extracellular proteolytic events. Factor(s) in the blood plasma is an absolute requirement for this plactin activity. In this study, we found that plactin promoted plasma cofactor\u2010dependent conversion of inactive single\u2010chain u\u2010PA to active two\u2010chain u\u2010PA on U937 cells.

Recent advances using non-myeloablative strategies have established the feasibility of allo-SCT in elderly patients (pts).

With an increase in the number of oxyethylene units (m), the molecular form of the triblock compounds in the solid state changes from an all-trans planar form (\u03b3 form) to a planar/helical/planar triblock form (\u03b2 form) at m = 5. The melting points of the \u03b3 form C6EmC6s are much lower than the melting points of n-alkanes with similar molecular masses. This result is interpreted as due to the higher Gibbs energy of crystal for C6EmC6s.

{"title": "Circulating blood volume in burn resuscitation.\n", "abstract": " Circulating blood volume (CBV) was prospectively measured in patients with almost solely smoke inhalation injury (Group I: 10 patients) and in patients with severe cutaneous burn (Group B: 6 patients) consecutively until 96 hours after injury, to assess the effect of either injury on intravascular volume status by the pulse dye-densitometry method. All participants were treated by an ordinary fluid regimen based on the Parkland formula with an hourly urine output of 1.0 to 2.0 ml/kg for the resuscitation endpoint. CBV was also measured in 15 elective surgical patients for a control value (76.7+/-9.0 ml/kg). The level of CBV values in Group I was low, ranging from 54.4+/-6.9 ml/kg to 59.6+/-6.2 ml/kg (from 70.9% to 77.7% of control value), while in Group B from 48.5+/-5.5 ml/kg to 55.6+/-17.3 ml/kg (from 63.2% to 72.5%) until 72 hours after injury. There was no significant difference in CBV values between the two groups throughout the study period. We could elucidate the existence and extent of intravascular volume depletion in spite of optimal fluid treatment in both solely smoke inhalation injury and solely severe cutaneous burn. Almost solely inhalation injury was found to decrease CBV to less than that of severe cutaneous burn, which presumably led to the increased fluid requirement.

Forty-nine children were treated by similar fluid resuscitation and physiologic support protocols. Using a retrospective chart review, the children were divided into three groups as follows: Group N (no lung injury, n= 33, 41.4+/-18.7% TBSA burned), Group M (mild-to-moderate lung injury, n= 11, 73.7+/-17.1% TBSA burned) and Group S (severe lung injury, n= 5, 67.2+/-16.6% TBSA burned). Information about fluid resuscitation during the first 24 hr post-injury was collected and compared among the three groups. There was no significant difference in the hourly urine output and the resuscitation volume estimated by body weight and burn size among the groups. The volumes estimated by ml/kg/% TBSA burned were 7.0 ml/kg/% TBSA burned, 8.0 ml/kg/% TBSA burned, and 9.4 ml/kg/% TBSA burned in Groups N, M, and S, respectively. According to the fluid volume estimated by the burn index (BI; 1/2 of% second-degree burns plus% third-degree burns), the volumes were 13.8+/-4.0 ml/kg/BI, 14.4+/-4.4 ml/kg/BI, 18.8+/-3.7 ml/kg/BI in Groups N, M, and S, respectively (Group N< Group S, p< 0.05). There was a significant positive correlation between the maximum respiratory index (AaDO2/PaO2) during the first week and the initial total volume administered (ml/kg/BI).

{"title": "Suppression of immune responses by cloned T cells and their products.\n", "abstract": " We have established a number of IL-2 dependent T cell clones with a definite suppressor function for the antibody response. Our collection included CD4+ helper (Th) and suppressor T cell (CD4+ Ts), and CD8+ cytotoxic (Tc) and suppressor T cell (CD8+ Ts) clones. Ts clones were defined by their suppressive activity on antigen-induced proliferative response and on helper functions of other CD4+ Th clones without detectable cytotoxicity and production of known helper type interleukins. The IJ expression was found to be present on both Th and Ts clones, and was generally associated with the H-2 restriction specificity of TcR of these clones. We have shown that the activated CD4+ Ts cells could inhibit the increase of intracellular Ca2+ of Th clones induced by antigen-pulsed antigen-presenting cells (APC). The identity of MHC restriction-specificities was required for the instant suppression of Ca2+ influx of Th clones, while a longer period of activation of Ts clones was needed to suppress the response of Th clones having different MHC restrictions. A strict selectivity was found in the suppressive activity of Ts clones in that Ts clones could suppress the Ca2+ responses of Th1 or Th2 clones but not of other CD4+ Ts clones. Ts clones could suppress the Ca2+ influx of Th clones induced only by antigen-pulsed APC or anti-TcR antibody but not by Con A or IL-2.

Notably, the risk of HCC is 20-fold higher in patients with HCV than in those without HCV (2), indicating a major carcinogenic role for chronic HCV infection. Factors such as older age, male gender, and liver fibrosis have been reported as predictors of the risk of hepatocarcinogenesis in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC)(3). Specifically, because the presence of advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis prior to treatment is widely recognized as a major risk factor for HCC development, even after SVR is achieved (4), the assessment of fibrosis stage is of great importance for CHC patients (3). The histological assessment of a liver biopsy specimen is the mainstay for the diagnosis and staging of chronic liver disease (5). However, the liver biopsy procedure is not without problems, including a risk of mortality and sample variability (5). Therefore, several alternative laboratory methods for the diagnosis and staging of liver fibrosis have been proposed, including the aspartate: 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase (AST)-toplatelet ratio index (APRI)(6) and the fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index (7). The limitations of these methods stem from a lack of specific markers for liver fibrosis. Either an increase or decrease in the levels of APRI and FIB-4 index can markedly affect the results, for reasons independent of liver fibrosis. Therefore, noninvasive and reliable methods that evaluate liver fibrosis and can predict the progression of liver disease are still needed.

Differences in revascularization procedures have been observed in the USA and Canada, but little is known about regional variation in revascularization procedures in Japan.Methods and Results: Diagnostic procedure combination summary tables for 2013 issued by the Japanese government were used. The rates of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) per 100,000 population aged\u2265 40 years in each prefecture were summarized by angina and myocardial infarction (MI). Linear regression analysis was performed to investigate the factors associated with regional variation in the rate of PCI for angina. The mean PCI rates were 189 and 67 per 100,000 population for angina and MI, respectively. The ratios between the highest and lowest regions were 4.9-fold in angina and 1.8-fold in MI. The factor most associated with generating regional variation in the use of PCI for angina was the rate of coronary angiography (CAG; P< 0.001).Conclusions: Wide regional variation was observed in the use of PCI both for angina and for MI. The variation was larger for angina, in which PCI were mostly elective and positively associated with the use of CAG. Further research is needed to prevent overuse and underuse of PCI to ensure more appropriate health-care delivery and to control health-care expenditure.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

The purpose of this study was to compare the neuronal correlates of viewing self-face images (i.e. images of familiar face) and stranger-face images (i.e. images of an unfamiliar face) in female adolescents with and without AN. We used near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to measure hemodynamic responses while the participants viewed full-color photographs of self-face and stranger-face. Fifteen females with AN (mean age, 13.8 years) and 15 age- and intelligence quotient (IQ)-matched female controls without AN (mean age, 13.1 years) participated in the study. The responses to photographs were compared with the baseline activation (response to white uniform blank). In the AN group, the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) significantly increased in the right temporal area during the presentation of both the self-face and stranger-face images compared with the baseline level. In contrast, in the control group, the concentration of oxy-Hb significantly increased in the right temporal area only during the presentation of the self-face image.

{"title": "Postural and conditional variations of nasal patency in patients under general anesthesia approximating sleep as assessed with acoustic rhinometry\n", "abstract": " Nasal obstruction is a known risk factor associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Multiple methods of measuring nasal abnormalities including anterior and posterior rhinomanometry and acoustic rhinometry (AR) have been used to better quantify the relationship. These measurements are usually used in the sitting and awakening situation, which differ from the situations in the supine position and while asleep. The goal of this study was to evaluate the nasal patency in patients under general anesthesia approximating sleep as assessed with AR. The nasal minimal cross-sectional area (MCSA) and nasal volume in 50 patients who underwent general anesthesia were compared with subjects in the sitting, supine, and supine position under general anesthesia using AR to measure the nasal dimensions and patency. MCSA and nasal volume decreased more significantly in the supine than in the sitting subjects and these decrements were shown more in the supine position under general anesthesia than in the supine position without anesthesia. Furthermore, regarding nasal volume, the difference between in the sitting and in the supine was larger than the difference between in the supine position with and without general anesthesia. These results suggested that the decrements regarding nasal volume under positional change were greater than those under conditional change. The positional variation can affect the airway patency hydrodynamically and these alterations indicate the relationship of the pathophysiology in patients with OSA.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

A table system to recommend additional dishes according to the dining status is introduced.

In this study, we have developed the positioning TMS system with a three-dimensional (3-D) digitizer and a multi-articular system. We proposed a method for the accurate measurement of a subject's head and cortex, in which the location data of the subject's face surface captured by a 3-D digitizer were superimposed on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of the subject's face surface. Using this system, the precise estimation of the stimulated sites of the cortex in TMS was achieved.

{"title": "Modified conjugate gradient method for ADSL echo cancellation\n", "abstract": " In recent years, high speed data communications over twisted pair cables has gained tremendous demand. Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) was standardized for use over twisted pair cables. A critical component in ADSL system is the echo canceller which is intended to discriminate unwanted echo signals caused by twisted pair interface circuit called the hybrid. An echo signal is characterized by the hybrid and the line type the hybrid is connected to. Recently, there has been a great concern that the echo signal displays wide variations when the twisted pair cable is shared with a telephone. The amount of echo signal present in the receiver will directly influence the ADSL system performance. Hence, high performance echo canceller with good tracking capability is required. In this thesis, a new adaptation scheme called Modified Conjugate Gradient method is proposed and applied to ADSL echo canceller. It is shown that superior tracking capability is obtained compared to previously proposed echo canceller using Least Mean Square (LMS) method while compromising small amount of computational complexity.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

The clinical use of cisplatin, however, can be complicated by myelotoxicity, intestinal toxicity and nephrotoxicity. We reviewed CDDP nephrotoxicity in 244 cases with primary lung cancer retrospectively. The enzyme histochemically localized in proximal tubular cells, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) and beta 2-microglobulin (BMG), a low molecular weight peptide normally reabsorbed by the renal tubular cells that has been used as an indicator for renal proximal tubular damage, were measured. And fractional excretion of Na (FENa%) and serum magnesium (Mg) levels were also measured before and after CDDP administration serially. The following results were obtained; 1) Over 45% of patients with lung cancer showed transient hyperexcretion of urinary NAG and BMG after CDDP administration. And peak excretion of NAG and BMG appeared to occur within 36 hours after administration of CDDP. 2) Almost all cases with persistent azotemia after CDDP administration showed high values of FENa (%), in spite of gradual normalization of urinary NAG and BMG excretion. 3) Hypomagnesemia was a common complication of CDDP nephrotoxicity that might be caused by a defect in renal Mg reabsorption. CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity seemed to be initiated by an acute, mainly proximal tubular impairment that reflects alterations in excretion of urinary enzymes and low molecular weight protein. In cases with persistent azotemia after CDDP administration depressed renal function might be attributed to the impairment of proximal as well as distal tubular\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

Starting neurostimulation early brought about better clinical effects. 3) The clinical effects appeared 1-12 months after the start of the neurostimulation. 4) CT findings in the cases which had been treated effectively showed no marked cerebral atrophy, and no bilateral large diffuse low-density areas not involving the thalamus. Neither did they show any definite and large low-density areas in the brainstem.

Statistical study of spinal accumulation cases.\n", "abstract": " This is a review of bone scintigraphy performed in patients with breast cancer, pulmonary cancer, uterine cervix cancer, and prostatic cancer from 1980 to 1985. The incidence of accumulation in the spine was 25.0% in breast cancer, 29.5% in lung cancer, 24.3% in cervical cancer, and 47.0% in prostatic cancer. The predominant location of the accumulation was the lumbar vertebra (68.9%), followed by the thoracic vertebra (45.0%), sacral vertebra (37.5%), and cervical vertebra (23.6%). The survivability after spinal accumulation was determined by the Kaplan-Meyer survival curve. The 1-year survival rate of breast cancer, pulmonary cancer, cervical cancer, and prostatic cancer was 88%, 19%, 74%, and 90%, respectively, the record of pulmonary cancer being significantly lower. Hence, in the treatment of patients with metastatic spinal tumors, the therapeutic method should be selected according to the underlying disease.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

{"title": "The Effect of Degree of Spheroidization on the Cold Forgeability of Steel\n", "abstract": " The cold forgeability has been studied using a medium carbon steel,(0.48% C), spheroidizeannealed to give a wide variation of degree of spheroidization. The degree of spheroidization varies with the temperatures and insufficient degrees are brought about with both higher and lower temperatures than the optimum. A spheroidization treatment with lower temperatures gives the structure containing the unresolved pearlite, whereas the treatment with higher temperatures reforms well-defined pearlite.The degree of spheroidization has a minor effect on the deformation resistance (strength), it, however, has a pronounced effect on the formability (ductility). Although the unresolved pearlite deteriolates the ductility to a less extent, the reformed pearlite impairs it noticeably. The microscopic observation has been carried out by means of scanning electron microscopy on the ductile fracture process to interpret the results mentioned above. The observation substantiates that voids associated with fully or partially spheroidized carbides tend to grow separately along the tensile axis and to consume a considerable amount of the strain to fracture after void initiation. On the other hand, voids with reformed pearlite are ready to grow to the size as large as pearlite nodules and to propagate in the transverse direction.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

The aim of the present study is to elucidate the morphological, immunohistochemical and genetic characteristics of SMCs in colorectal adenomas. Five colorectal adenomas having SMCs were resected from five patients endoscopically. On immunohistochemical examination (four cases), all SMCs were positive for cytokeratin 5/6 in their cytoplasm and positive for \u03b2-catenin in their cytoplasm and nuclei. A nuclear positivity of p63 was detected in one SMC. All SMCs were negative for p53, chromogranin A, synaptophysin and NCAM. There was no Ki-67 expression in any of the SMCs. We detected none of mutations of \u03b2-catenin, KRAS and BRAF by microdissection and polymerase chain reaction-direct sequence in any of the four examined SMCs. SMCs are a rare but problematic finding in colorectal adenomas\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

{"title": "Comparative study for anti-Hepatitis B surface antigen titers based on two measurement methods: using monoclonal antibodies isolated from Hepatitis B vaccinated recipients\n", "abstract": " As anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) titers vary depending on the measurement methods, we compared two different methods to measure anti-HBs titers in sera and HBs monoclonal antibodies. The sera from 182 HB virus-resolved patients who were negative for HBsAg but positive for antiHB core protein (HBc) and/or anti-HBs were obtained. The measurement of anti-HBs was compared using either Lumipulse G1200 or Architect i2000SR. Six different monoclonal antibody (mAbs) clones isolated from healthy individuals inoculated with hepatitis B vaccine Bimmugen (genotype C) were used. A statistically significant correlation in anti-HBs titers was found between the two methods tested (Y= 0.951 X+ 100.7, R= 0.813, p< 0.001), although anti-HBs titers in 72 samples (39.6%) measured by Architect were less than 50% of that by Lumipulse and 12 (6.6%) were opposite results. Measuring 2 mAbs with HBV neutralizing activity, the titers of the 116 antibody (1.0 \u03bcg/mL) were comparable (689.3 mIU/mL by Lumipulse and 440.7 mIU/mL by Architect), whereas those of the 478 antibody (1.0 \u03bcg/mL) were much lower by Architect than by Lumipulse (42.6 vs. 818.6 mIU/mL, respectively). Of four other mAbs without HBV neutralizing activity, equal titers were observed for one; two mAbs had less anti-HB titers by Architect; and one was below the cut-off index (< 5 mIU/mL). Anti-HBs titers measured by Architect are likely to be lower than by Lumipulse, and the potential ability to detect the 478 antibody with neutralizing activity is low, indicating that Architect might underestimate anti-HBs titers. Future studies should standardize the anti-HBs titer\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

Thirty-one women who repeatedly failed to conceive by intracytoplasmic sperm injection took the herbal medicine before breakfast and dinner from the start of menstrual cycle in the ovum pickup cycle. Average patient age was 38.5 \u00b1 0.7 years, and the average ovum pickup frequency on the first dosage day was 7.9 \u00b1 1.5. To analyze the effects of herbal medicine intake, the number of recovered and mature oocytes, their morphology and physical qualities, as well as the rates of fertilization, oocyte development, and pregnancy was compared before and after intake. The recovered and mature oocyte numbers, oocyte morphology and physical qualities, and fertilization rate were not significantly different before and after drug intake. However, the oocyte development rate was significantly higher(58.0%) after herbal medicine intake than before (32.5%; p = 0.0003). Moreover, the successful pregnancy rate was significantly higher after intake than before (6.9% versus 0%; p = 0.0111).

Furthermore, it may facilitate a powerful graft versus leukemia/lymphoma (GVL) effect to help combat hematological malignancies by directly targeting the mismatched HLA expressed on leukemia/lymphoma cells [3]. On the contrary, leukemia/lymphoma cells escape from the surveillance of the donor-derived GVL effect by losing the target HLA (mismatched HLA in GVH direction). This mechanism has been called loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the HLA gene region on chromosome 6 [4,5]. Taking the above into account, in this case report, we present a case of lymphoma with monosomy 6, which means natural LOH of HLA, and suggest that selection of a haploidentical family donor matched with the missing HLA\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

{"title": "Being Here: Enhancing the Presence of a Remote Person through Real-Time Display Integration of the Remote Figure and the Local Background\n", "abstract": " Videoconferencing continues to emerge as a popular means of connecting remote participants. One of its goals is to establish a sense of presence through video imagery. One way to achieve a highly realistic presence is to generate a life-sized image of a remote person on a large display. However, in this case, the display conceals a large region of the local person\u2019s front view, and replaces it with the remote site background. This may affect the viewer\u2019s sense of the remote person\u2019s presence. To resolve these conflicting effects, we propose a method involving the superimposition of the remote person\u2019s figure on the local site front view. In this way, the local person may feel as though the remote person is before him/her in his/her spatial environment. The method has been implemented in the Being Here System accordingly. A system evaluation experiment revealed that the proposed method significantly enhanced the perceived presence of the remote person, in comparison with conventional videoconferencing", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

{"title": "Questionnaire survey to investigate correspondence of medical doctors and dentists in Japan for antithrombotic therapy at surgeries or biopsy\n", "abstract": " PURPOSE: We examined correspondence of doctors and dentists at the time of surgeries or biopsy in patients treated with antithrombotics by questionnaire survey. METHODS: We investigated management of antithrombotic therapy at dental extraction, biopsy or polypectomy under an endoscope, an operation of a cataract, pacemaker implantation by questionnaire survey for doctors and dentists in 64 national hospital organization hospitals (NHO-hospital) and doctors in 163 hospitals participated in the Japan Multicenter Stroke Investigators' Collaboration (J-MUSIC) study. We compared the results between NHO-hospitals and J-MUSIC hospitals. RESULT: The doctor questionary survey got an answer from 103 institutions (63%) out of the 163 J-MUSIC hospitals and 26 institutions (40%) out of 64 NHO-hospitals. The dental extraction under continuation of warfarin therapy in patients with past history of stroke and non-valvular atrial fibrillation or mechanical heart valves was accepted in 35% and 45%, respectively. They were 58% and 69%, respectively in J-MUSIC hospitals and were significantly higher than those in NHO-hospital (p= 0.031 and p= 0.023, respectively). There were no significant differences in antithrombotic management strategies in correspondence to the biopsy, polypectomy or pacemaker implantation between the two groups of hospitals. Continuation of the antithrombotic therapy at surgery to cataracta was more frequent in J-MUSIC hospitals than in NHO-hospitals (nonvalvular atrial fibrillation 48% vs 22% p= 0.015, mechanical heart valve 51% vs 30% p= 0.059).

One of the important approaches of this development involves closing the gap between persons with severe disability and advanced technologies; eg via voice recognition, image recognition, EMG detection, stereo vision technologies. Each of the advanced technologies was incorporated into the human interface and security system of the electric powered wheelchairs and all were evaluated by actual users in the real world during use.

{"title": "Development of a flow-type taste sensor.\n", "abstract": " Among the five senses of humans, the senses of sight, hearing and touch are physical senses produced by receiving physical quantities; it is relatively easy to detect or reproduce the function of these senses. On the other hand, the senses of taste and smell are chemical senses which function through the reception of a variety of chemical substances. It has been difficult to reproduce these two chemical senses, because the first three senses treat a type of physical quantity such as light, sound or pressure, but the last two senses treat many kinds of chemical substances. In biological systems, these chemical substances are classified into various groups dependent on their taste. Many kinds of chemical substances form one characteristic smell, eg, of apple, in the olfactory sense. Therefor , it is important to detect them in a way similar to the gustatory or olfactory system.

Measurements of the thermal linear change of ZrO2-containing materials (five types containing Al2O3-ZrO2 and one type of zirconia mullite) showed different behaviour such as differences in the thermal expansion rate due to the zirconia phase transformation and differences in the starting transformation temperature. Addition of zirconia-containing materials causes microcracks in the alumina-based bulk, resulting in improved spalling resistance. Microcracks occur due to expansion caused by transformation of the zirconia phase in the cooling stage. The spalling resistance of SG plate refractories can be improved by optimising the degree of expansion of the zirconia-containing raw\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

Plasma resides both outside and inside the keyhole, and is known as and respectively. In this paper, we developed a light emission measurement model and a plasma intensity density distribution estimation scheme to determine the plasma distribution inside the keyhole along the keyhole depth direction. The results show that the peak plasma intensity is located close to the keyhole opening, which can affect laser beam absorption and weld shape.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

Liver specimens were obtained by biopsy or autopsy. In one patient, the peripheral blood contained blastoid cells, a typical hematological feature of the transiently abnormal myelopoiesis of Down syndrome. Ascites and hepatosplenomegaly were found in all patients. The intralobular hepatic fibrosis was pericellular and perisinusoidal, and the narrowing of the central veins resembled that in venoocclusive disease of the liver. We found some megakaryocytes in the liver, which were stained for von Willebrand factor and platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. In one specimen, collagen type IV and alpha smooth muscle actin were stained by immunohistochemical methods, so the fibrosis in this case was probably caused by cells such as Ito cells derived from myofibroblasts. Overall, the findings suggest that megakaryocytes in the liver of these three patients produce collagen-stimulating cytokines such as transforming growth factor beta, and that Ito cells were involved in the hepatic fibrosis we observed.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

With the expansion of the elderly portion of the population in society, the number of cases of osteoporosis and its related fractures must correspondingly increase. Regarding the effect of the level of decreased bone mass or bone mineral density of patients with vertebral body or hip fracture, the incidence rate of fractures significantly increases when the bone mass level of patients becomes less than-3 SD of the peak bone mass level at each of the respective sites. As a result, areas of under-3 SD area of te peak bone mass level are considered to be fracture risk area. When treating osteoporosis patients, special consideration must be given to other age-related complications. One third of hip fracture patients already have dementia, hypertension, or cerebrovascular disorders at the time of injury.

Analysis of condylar displacement\n", "abstract": " Part of the biting force is believed to be transmitted to the temporomandibular joint and cause interarticular pressure. This pressure's degree and function, however, are not clarified. In this paper, I shall examine this pressure from condylar movement measured by the face-bow. For the measurement of condylar movement caused by biting-pressure, I used an intraoral appliance which consisted of a pair of Co-Cr clutches and a pivot. While the patient exerted both maximum and medium biting force on the pivot located at the first molar, mandibular movements were measured. Both sides of the condyle tended to move anterosuperiorly. Condylar movement averaged 0.29 mm on the working side, and 0.46 mm on the balancing side during maximum bite force. Distance and direction of the condylar movements were equal to the results of previous investigations, excepting the direction of working side condyle. The difference was considered to be primarily due to experimental variables. The condylar movement during biting was smaller than that during pushing the jaw upward with manual forces. This suggests that interarticular pressure is only slight on both sides during first molar bite action.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

{"title": "Dynamic Melting of Driven Abrikosov Lattices in an Amorphous MoxGe1\u2212x Film in Tilted Field\n", "abstract": " We report a comparative study of the dynamic melting of driven vortex lattices in magnetic field tilted (by \u03b8 = 36\u00b0) from the normal to the film surface and that of a driven Abrikosov lattice in untilted field (\u03b8 = 0). From the mode-locking (ML) resonance, we confirm that vortex lattices in tilted field are stretched in the tilt direction and that, with increasing dc velocity at ML, the shape and orientation of the driven lattice change. Associated with this structural change, the dynamic melting field at which the driven lattice melts also changes. Our results show that, regardless of the lattice shape and orientation, dynamic melting occurs as the shorter side of the distorted lattices reaches close to the side at which the isotropic lattice melts dynamically.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1172"]}
{"title": "On finite time optimal control for discrete-time linear systems with parameter variation\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we propose a method of finite time optimal control for discrete time linear systems with parameter variation. This paper introduces the stochastic parameters independent of time to describe variations among products and derive optimal control law to cope with them. The optimal control input is derived by minimizing the expectation of cost function with respect to system parameters. Moreover, the sample size of parameters which is needed in the calculation of the optimal input is given by the Matrix Bernstein inequality. It is further applied to model predictive control for the infinite time horizon case. In the end, numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

This research was conducted between a period of 2-3 years passed since the accident of Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. More than 95% of radioactive caesium still remained in the first upper 5 cm soil layer. Also, penetration of radioactive caesium to the deeper layer of the soil was not observed during investigation period. In spite of same sampling area (within 150 m\" 2), there were 2-3 times of horizontal variations of radioactive caesium depending on sampling point. The soil collected in this study did not show dependent relation between the particle size distribution of the soil and the concentration of radioactive caesium. This phenomenon might be due to the cause of characteristic properties of Kanto Loam particles.(author)", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

Computer tomography (CT) scan showed massive pericardial and pleural effusion. We performed pericardial drainage, and the cytological diagnosis of the pericardial effusion was class V. Because endoscopic examination revealed advanced gastric cancer, we diagnosed it as gastric cancer complicated with carcinomatous pericarditis. The serum tissue polypeptide antigen (TPA) level was markedly elevated. In August 2005, we started combination chemotherapy using oral S-1 (100mg/body/day; day 1-21) and intravenous CDDP (100mg/body/day; day 8) for 5 weeks. After 2 courses, TPA was reduced and pericardial effusion disappeared. However, after 3 courses, pericardial effusion recurred. We changed treatment to weekly docetaxel. After 2 courses, we changed it to paclitaxel/CDDP. However, TPA was increased and pleural effusion and dyspnea occurred. There-fore, we changed to a course of combination chemotherapy using oral S-1 (100mg/body/day; day 1-14) and intravenous CPT-11 (100mg/body/day; day 1 and 8) for 4 weeks from March 2006. After 10 courses, we were unable to control pleural effusion, and dyspnea recurred. She died in December 2006.

In this paper, we present experimental results of quench protection tests of a cryocooler cooled 6 T NbTi superconducting magnet (self inductance 15.5 H), which is a commercial size magnet made by Tamakawa Co., Ltd. We confirmed that our proposed system could inhibit the maximum temperature of the superconducting magnet (initial temperature 4.3\u00a0K) after the quench to less than about 44\u00a0K at operation magnetic field 5.5 T.

Four months later, he developed vomiting and consciousness disturbance. CT revealed gastric volvulus recurrence along the gastrostomy axis. Endoscopic repositioning failed and fistula perforation necessitated emergency surgery. The upper position of the stomach was twisted counter-clockwise and revolved on the gastrostomy axis sliding between the lower stomach and abdominal wall. The fistula showed necrotic perforation and was thus resected. The anterior stomach wall was fixed to the abdominal wall at 3 triangular points. Thereafter, gastric volvulus did not recur. PEG is reportedly effective for preventing gastric volvulus, but there are rare cases of postgastrostomy recurrence. This successfully managed case provides valuable clinical insights.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1172"]}
{"title": "Anxiety disorder\n", "abstract": " We reviewed recent advances in biological studies of anxiety disorders. The most important achievement was the discovery of the neural circuits of fear in the 1990s by using an animal model in which conditioned fear was induced. In the 2000s, this discovery led to further elucidation of neurotransmitters involved in fear and the precise neuronal mechanism of fear conditioning, thereby improving the understanding of neuroimaging findings of patients with anxiety disorders. The amygdala is a central region that is associated with the generation of fear, and its inactivation diminishes fear. In humans, amygdala activation has been consistently reported in anxiety disorders, indicating that hyperactivation of the amygdala is involved in the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders. Serotonin plays a key role in the treatment of anxiety disorders, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are currently regarded the first-line drugs used as anxiolytics. From animal studies, the mechanism underlying the anxiolytic effect of SSRIs is hypothesized as follows: SSRIs inhibit the neuronal activities of the amygdala, and this inhibition decreases the level of fear and anxiety. Animal studies of fear conditioning have proposed new treatment strategies for anxiety disorders: D-cycloserine, propranolol, and reactivation-extinction procedure. Among them, D-cycloserine, which is used as an adjunct to psychotherapy to facilitate extinction of fear, has been investigated in several randomized controlled trials, and its efficacies for several anxiety disorders have been established.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

But most of these technologies require that both sides are available at the same time to have communication . In this research we propose a time-shifted tele dining system \u201cKIZUNA\u201d for family members to enjoy a meal together even when they are unable to physically meet together.  A person can enjoy a meal while watching a pre-recorded video of a remote family members dining . The system adapts the displayed videos playback speed according to the local diners eating behavior.

{"title": "Clinicopathological analysis of colorectal cancers in the elderly.\n", "abstract": " The average life expectancy of Japanese is 78 years for males and 85 years for females, being the longest in the world. In this study, elderly patients with colorectal cancer who underwent surgery and their non-elderly counterparts were compared to characterize the elderly patients. Of 387 colorectal cancer patients, 98 were over 75 years old, and 106 were between 45 and 60 years of age. These two groups of patients were analyzed for clinicopathological parameters, prognosis, and the expression of matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP-9) and E-cadherin molecules as indicators of the invasive and metastatic ability of colorectal cancer. The elderly and non-elderly groups did not significantly differ in the clinicopathological findings. Molecular genetic analysis showed that the rates of MMP-9 or E-cadherin protein expression in the elderly and non-elderly groups were not significantly different. Considering that colorectal cancers in the elderly do not significantly differ from those in the non-elderly in tumor stage or malignancy grade, treatment policies should be comprehensively based on individual coexisting diseases and the general condition including physiological age.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

The proposed algorithm controls packets based on a deadline for each packet determined from QoS parameters. The feature of our algorithm is that it can simply control the various QoS classes defined in the standard using the deadline. As a result, QoS parameters, such as minimum traffic rate and maximum latency, would be guaranteed by scheduling packets based on the deadline. We then implemented and evaluated the algorithm with a testbed. There have been few reports of an evaluation on IEEE 802.16 hardware before. We confirmed that QoS with high priority is guaranteed with the proposed algorithm.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

During the administration of G-CSF, each time the donor had a feeling of fullness in the breasts, the milk was expressed artificially using a milking device, and part of the gross quantities of human milk collected was used as a sample for measuring the G-CSF concentration. G-CSF levels were measured in the whole milk, not in the aqueous phase of milk by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To monitor the serum G-CSF level, blood samplings were performed just before the first G-CSF administration once a day. As shown in figure 1, the serum G-CSF level, which was as high as 30,100 pg/ml 12 h after the start of G-CSF treatment, thereafter decreased rapidly despite continuing administration of the agent, and reached 306 pg/ml 24 h after the end of G-CSF treatment.

In the first case, NHL was diagnosed in a 37-year-old male (diffuse pleomorphic, T cell type, stage IE). After 4 courses of chemotherapy, he achieved complete remission. The second case, was a 56-year-old male who was admitted to our hospital with melena and abdominal pain. A diagnosis of NHL (diffuse mixed, B cell type, stage III E) was made. Complete remission was achieved with 2 courses of chemotherapy. Levels of hematological and neurological toxicity were moderately severe but tolerable. Pharmacokinetics of ADR and VP-16 in these patients were similar to those in patients with normal renal function.

It is well known that nonverbal communication plays an important role in interpersonal communication. However, nonverbal communication has not been used in traditional character based network communication until now, yet the need for conveying feelings has increased. Due to the development of multimedia networks, it is thought that nonverbal communication can be valuable for network communication. The research is based on the importance of expressing feelings through nonverbal communication, especially gestures. It has not yet been determined what kind of feelings can be conveyed by gestures so the evaluation of feelings expressed by gestures has been done using animated cartoons. From this, it has been shown that feelings expressed by gestures on display are distinguished in five ways by the Japanese. Furthermore\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

{"title": "192Ir brachytherapy\n", "abstract": " Modern high technology has recently brought a precision treatment modality in the field of brachytherapy for cancer patients. Ir-192 manual afterloading (hair pin technique of Ir-192 wire) replaced the technique utilizing Ra-226 needles at our department in 1973. In May 1991, microSelectron-HDR (Ir-192 micro-source of 370 GBq) was installed in Osaka University Hospital. Preliminary analysis of phase I/II study resulted in no significant differences between the incidence of an acute mucosal reaction as well as early tumor response after high and low dose rate interstitial brachytherapy for oral cancer. Since April 1992, a phase III study has been under way to completely eliminate the problem of hospital personnel exposure to radiation in the field of brachytherapy. The introduction of remote after-loading of Ir-192 micro-source has resulted in improvements in elderly patient care during the interstitial brachytherapy for malignancies. The indications for HDR brachytherapy have been expanded, and new technology was developed to improve the local cure of the disease, such as linked double button technique for oral cancer, template interstitial brachytherapy for perineal cancer, and postoperative brachytherapy using intraoperative flexible catheter placement for locally unresectable disease or microscopically residual disease. Through these meticulous efforts, HDR interstitial brachytherapy will soon become a satisfactory substitute for traditional LDR interstitial brachytherapy.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

It was established after maintaining the tumor in  the subcutaneous tissue or peritoneal cavity of DA rats  conventionally for over 30 generations. When the  soybean-sized original FF-6 tumor was transplanted  subcutaneously, it became an oval, hard, whitish, solitary  and thumb-head-sized nodule within one month. After  intraperitoneal transplantation of FF-6, it formed many  nodules ranging from miliary to thumb-head size, which  adhered andlor metastasized to many abdominal organs.  When FF-6, cut into small pieces, was injected into the  lower lip, the tumor grew bigger in situ, and  metastasized to regional lymph nodes. Histologically,  FF-6 was characterized as a well-differentiated  squamous cell carcinoma, showing positive staining with  anti-keratin, anti-laminin, anti-collagen type IV, antifibronectin  and UB- 14 antibodies.  This transplantable tumor may be useful for  analyzing the mechanisms of proliferation and  metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma in vivo, and the  host defence mechanism in rats, as well as being a  suitable model of human squamous cell carcinoma.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

{"title": "Resistance characteristics of high speed hull form with air-ship form bulb\n", "abstract": " In recent years, many ideas are proposed in order to pursue the high speed vessel. Many of those ideas are based on unconventional concepts such as the application of hydrodynamic lift generated by wings. In those cases, however, we have many problems for the purpose of sizing up and long range operation. As well known, conventional ship, that is a displacement type, has more merits than unconventional ones at least from point of view of buoyancy. Therefore it can be considered as one of the effective ways to pursue the high speed vessel based on the concept of displacement type. In the present study, minimization of wave resistance of a special type ship in high speed range is discussed according to the concept of wave making interaction between a main hull and an air-ship form bulb. This bulb is formed by the combination of a hydrodynamic point source and a line sink, semi-splitted from the main hull of displacement type and supported by the strut. Wave resistance of this special type ship is minimized under some design conditions by means of nonlinear programming. In this paper, experimental investigations are carried out for 2 selected models which have the air-ship form bulb and the mathematical water lines and frame lines based on the present theory. After showing the model test results of fixed trim conditions and free trim conditions, some discussions about the direction of model improvements are given. In order to adopt the air-ship form bulb as the practical bulbous bow, the effect of an entrance angle of the main hull, the control of the trim and so on are investigated experimentally.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

Alkali content of fly ash has little correlation with the expansion. The expansion may depend on not only the reactivity of Pyrex but also the stiffness of the mortar.

Control of the expansion due to alkali-aggregate reaction can be evaluated by the proposed index using amorphous Si02 content, mean diameter and the replacement ratio of fly ash.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

{"title": "Deboronization in Boron Steel and a Model for Its Calculation\n", "abstract": " Deboronization behavior during austenitizing of 0.2% C-0.85% Mn boron-treated steels was investigated in the various atmospheres. A considerable amount of boron removal was observed during the heat treatment in the air, and neither an atmosphere of argon nor a nickel-plating on metal surfaces had detectable effect in preventing this phenomenon. Deboronization could be eliminated only in the vacuum of 10-4 Torr with a zirconium oxygen getter.Boron concentration profiles after deboronization occasionally showed some anormalous appearances which were unexplainable by a diffusion control mechanism. One was a two-step fashion in a boron concentration profile and the other was an enhancement of deboronization at a certain temperature range. The latter, for instance, involved a lower residual boron concentration at 850\u2022 \u017d rather than at 950\u2022 \u017d. A probable model for deboronization kinetics was discussed taking a dissolution of fixed boron as precipitates together with a diffusion of free boron into consideration. In addition, the effect of formation of ferrite owing to a simultaneous occurrence of decarburization was also taken into consideration.

Concentration of AHA decreased during lagering according to first-order kinetics in which the velocity constant was virtually a function of temperature. Concentration of VDK was determined by integrating the difference in the rates of the following two reactions: 1. Its stoichiometric formation from AHA and; 2. Its absorption by yeasts. Concentration of VDK remained virtually constant from the time, after several days of lagering, when the concentration of yeast cells began to decrease according to first-order kinetics. According to these results, the total concentration of AHA + VDK in filtered beer could be calculated at an early stage of lagering from the concentrations of AHA + VDK and the yeast cells at the day of calculation and the predetermined temperature\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

To reduce power consumption, the proposed receiver uses CMOS topology in the CDR stage. This architecture needs signal level conversion from CML to CMOS, but the conversion circuit is difficult to stabilize. We solve this problem by feedforwarding the LA output offset voltage to CML-CMOS converter. The feedforwarding suppresses the degradation of the eye-opening of the CML-CMOS conversion by 40%. Additionally, in the CDR, we reduce power consumption by more than 30% by using Transmission-Gate Delay Flip-flop (TG D-FF) instead of conventional C 2 MOS D-FF. The measured power consumption of the proposed receiver is 19.3 mW at 25-Gb/s operation, 80% lower than that of a receiver with CML-CDR.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

In this paper we analyze the data sets of multiple media files and typed materials collected through the experiment, and investigate the use of keyword in a collaborative dialogue. Consequently it was found that speaking was earlier and typing was 2.6 seconds behind of relevant speech, which met the requirement that real-time transcript was beneficial when its shown within 5 seconds. Besides, noun phrases that were typed as keywords were categorized referring to utterance. It was consequently found that 55% of all\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1172"]}
{"title": "Combination treatment of perioperative rehabilitation and psychoeducation undergoing thoracic surgery\n", "abstract": " Postoperative pulmonary complications are a risk associated with thoracic surgery. However, there have been few reports on cases at high risk of postoperative complications. Cancer patients often have negative automatic thoughts about illness, and these negative automatic thoughts are associated with reduced health behavior and physical activity. This case series demonstrates the successful combination treatment of perioperative rehabilitation and psychoeducation for negative automatic thoughts in two cancer patients who underwent thoracic surgery. One patient underwent pneumonectomy with laryngeal recurrent nerve paralysis; the other patient, who had a history of recurrent hepatic encephalopathy and dialysis, underwent S6 segmentectomy. Both patients had negative automatic thoughts about cancer-related stress and postoperative pain. The physical therapists conducted a perioperative rehabilitation program in which the patients were educated to replace their maladaptive thoughts with more adaptive thoughts. After rehabilitation, the patients had improved adaptive thoughts, increased physical activity, and favorable recovery without pulmonary complications. This indicates that the combination treatment of perioperative rehabilitation and psychoeducation was useful in two thoracic cancer surgery patients. The psychoeducational approach should be expanded to perioperative rehabilitation of patients with cancer.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1172"]}
{"title": "Clinical Significance of Two Real-Time PCR Assays for Chronic Hepatitis C Patients Receiving Protease Inhibitor-Based Therapy\n", "abstract": " The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of two hepatitis C virus (HCV) real-time PCR assays, the COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HCV test (CAP/CTM) and the Abbott RealTime HCV test (ART), for predicting the clinical outcomes of patients infected with HCV who received telaprevir (TVR)-based triple therapy or daclatasvir/asunaprevir (DCV/ASV) dual therapy. The rapid virological response rates in patients receiving TVR-based triple therapy were 92% (23/25) and 40% (10/25) for CAP/CTM and ART, respectively. The false omission rate (FOR) of ART was 93.3% (14/15), indicating that CAP/CTM could accurately predict clinical outcome in the early phase. In an independent examination of 20 patients receiving TVR-based triple therapy who developed viral breakthrough or relapse, the times to HCV disappearance by ART were longer than by CAP/CTM, whereas the times to HCV reappearance were similar. In an independent experiment of WHO standard HCV RNA serially diluted in serum containing TVR, the analytical sensitivities of CAP/CTM and ART were similar. However, cell cultures transfected with HCV and grown in medium containing TVR demonstrated that ART detected HCV RNA for a longer time than CAP/CTM. Similar results were found for 42 patients receiving DCV/ASV dual therapy. The FOR of ART was 73.3% (11/15) at week 8 after initiation of therapy, indicating that ART at week 8 could not accurately predict the clinical outcome. In conclusion, although CAP/CTM and ART detected HCV RNA with comparable analytical sensitivity, CAP/CTM might be preferable for predicting the clinical outcomes of patients\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

Computed tomography (CT) of the head revealed a chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) on the left side. The patient underwent single burr-hole irrigation and drainage on the same day. In addition to the burr hole, a cross-shaped dural incision was made which revealed a thick outer membrane and solidified hematoma. We removed as much of the clotted hematoma as possible using a curved suction tube under neuroendoscopy. The postoperative CT revealed that the hematoma was partially removed and the mass effect was reduced. As a result, the patient's neurological deficits improved. We reached a diagnosis of organizing CSDH following histologic examination of the removed hematoma that showed inflammatory cell infiltration and multiplication of fibroblasts. Neuroendoscopic hematoma evacuation via a burr hole is minimally invasive and may be a useful procedure in the treatment of some cases of organizing CSDH.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed an infarct in the left middle cerebral artery area. Echocardiography revealed mobile vegetations on the mitral valve and aortic valve, and the patient was diagnosed as having infective endocarditis. She was treated conservatively by appropriate antibiotic therapy. Four days after hospitalization, the patient developed brain hemorrhage due to ruptured mycotic cerebral aneurysm, and craniotomy for removal of the hematoma and brain aneurysm clipping were performed on the same day. As 3-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) obtained 2 weeks after the surgery suggested the existence of other brain aneurysms, it was determined that continued conservative management of the infection might not be feasible, and mitral valve and aortic valve replacements were performed 3 weeks after the craniotomy. The postoperative clinical course was satisfactory, without the complications of bleeding, aggravation of the cranial nerve disorders or recurrence of the infection. Ruptured mycotic cerebral aneurysms are usually associated with a poor prognosis.

A computed tomography scan revealed a left renal tumor (76\u00d7 54\u00d7 67 mm) without a metastatic lesion. Laboratory examination showed an elevated white blood cell count of 23,200/\u03bcl. The patient underwent left radical nephrectomy and the histopathological diagnosis was spindle cell renal cell carcinoma (G3-4, pT4, pN2) with positive staining for granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. One month later, a computed tomography scan showed an enlarged locally recurrent tumor mass. Three cycles of combination chemotherapy consisting of gemcitabine (1,500 mg/m2, day 1) and doxorubicine (50 mg/m2, day 1) resulted in an 83% reduction of the tumor mass. A follow-up computed tomography scan after 2 weeks revealed rapid regrowth of the recurrent tumor. The patient died 199 days after the surgery. Combination chemotherapy consisting of gemcitabine and doxorubicin is a treatment option for patients with spindle cell renal cell carcinoma.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

{"title": "Rhodolith-bearing gravelly carbonate sediments on the shelf off Kikai Island, Kagoshima Prefecture\n", "abstract": " On the outer shelf off Kikai Island, Kagoshima Prefecture, a complex of mound-shaped submerged reefs with irregular surfaces surrounded by gravel-sized carbonate sediments are widely distributed between 70 and 100 m water depth. Each mound ranges from a few m to 10 m in height and from 5 to 100 m in width. They consist of a variety of reef-building organisms, such as hermatypic corals and coralline algae. On the other hand, the gravel-sized carbonate sediments are composed of rhodoliths, large benthic foraminifers and fossil coral fragments, and they often form dune structures. During the dredging campaign of the R/V Tansei-maru (KT-09-16 Cruise) in August 2009, abundant modern rhodoliths and large benthic foraminifers, such as Cycloclypeus sp., and some fragments of live and dead corals were recovered from deep shelf environments. This provides important information on the nature and distribution of carbonate sediments on the modern deep fore reef to island shelf area in the Ryukyus and their interpretation in the fossil record.

{"title": "Diamondtheater: A system for reproducing theater and supporting creative activities\n", "abstract": " This paper describes a system called DiamondTheater that supports creative activities in theater using a tabletop tangible interface. This system is used to aid in the planning of certain aspects of theater production, such as actor positioning, and sound and lighting cues. Without having some considerable experience in production, it is difficult to create a mental picture of an actual production. Thus, a miniature theatrical stage is reproduced on the tabletop surface to facilitate the user\u2019s creation of such a picture and the sharing of ideas. Users collaboratively construct a stage by placing small dolls to represent actors and many kinds of miniature stage sets. In addition, the system allows users to reproduce other aspects of theater production such as sound and lighting. We performed a user study of this system and demonstrated that DiamondTheater appears to effectively assist the user\u2019s activity in theater\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

{"title": "Precise coil positioning system using multi-articular arm for location of stimulated brain area in transcranial magnetic stimulation\n", "abstract": " We developed a precise coil positioning system for determining stimulated sites in transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) by using a multi-articular mechanical arm. A figure-of-eight coil used in TMS can induce a focal electric field beneath the coils center in the cortex; therefore, the point on the cortex beneath the center of the figure-of-eight coil has been conventionally regarded as a stimulating site. However, a stimulating site determined in this manner is not believed to be plausible, because the electric field induced in TMS is dispersed over the brain vectorially. Our system was developed on the basis of the cortical structure of the brain cortex and the direction of the induced electric field. In order to verify the system accuracy, Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs) elicited by TMS at the hand muscles innervated by the primary motor cortex (M1) were measured as electromyogram (EMG).

{"title": "Analysis of the Learners\u2019 Assessment Activity in a Collaborative Learning Support System Based on Question-posing\n", "abstract": " A collaborative learning support system based on question-posing by learners named Concerto III has been developed. It has been applied to a distributed asynchronous environment since 2006. In previous study, learning effectiveness based on number of question-posing and quality of posed question has been analyzed. As the analytical results, it was revealed that posing many questions or posing high-quality question had a positive effect on learners\u2019 learning effectiveness. In this study, assessment activity in the learning support system is analyzed. As for analysis of learners\u2019 assessment activity, learners\u2019 action log data stored in Concerto III was visualized. As the result of visualization and more analysis, it was revealed that a learner who made assessment of the question immediately after answering it marked higher score in post-test than those who did not.

{"title": "Spark of Japanese Sparkler\" senkoh-hanabi\" under Microgravity\n", "abstract": " We have performed combustion experiments of Japanese sparkler called \"senkoh-hanabi'' in 20 sec microgravity conditions by parabolic flight of airplane. TheJapanese sparkler in a closed chamber was ignited by hot wire and the occurrence of spark was observed by video camera. Under the microgravity condition, Japanese sparkler was not sparking. However, after the change of gravity from 0 G to 1.5 G, Japanese sparkler suddenly began to spark. From the observation we conclude that the convections of air around the fire-ball of Japanese sparkler are important to generate sparks.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1172"]}
{"title": "Drying-rate limit in condenser drying of thin film coatings\n", "abstract": " Two different drying regimes were observed in air-free condenser drying of solvent-polymer solution coatings. The measured solvent drying rate for the constant rate period increases with an increasing solvent partial pressure gradient in the low pressure gradient regime. This drying behavior was quantitatively consistent with the previously proposed one-dimensional theory. At higher pressure gradients above a critical value, however, the solvent evaporation rate reaches a constant value, showing a particular drying-rate limit. The experiments revealed that the configuration of the grooves, on which the condensed solvent forms a continuous liquid layer, plays a key role in the retarded solvent diffusion in the condenser drying system.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

The 100-\u03bcm-focus x-ray generator consists of a main controller for regulating the tube voltage and current and a tube unit with a high-voltage circuit and a fixed anode x-ray tube. The maximum tube voltage, current, and electric power were 105 kV, 0.5 mA, and 50 W, respectively. Using a 3-mm-thick aluminum filter, the x-ray intensity was 26.0 \u03bcGy/s at 1.0 m from the source with a tube voltage of 60 kV and a current of 0.50 mA. Because the peak photon energy was approximately 38 keV using the filter with a tube voltage of 60 kV, the bremsstrahlung x-rays were absorbed effectively by iodine-based contrast media with an iodine K-edge of 33.2 keV.

The simultaneous perturbation method is adopted as a learning rule of the neuro-controller. Using a direct inverse control scheme by a neural network; we control the flexible arm. Then the neural network must learn an inverse system of the flexible arm. If we use the gradient method as a learning rule of the neural network Jacobian of the plant is required. On the other hand, our control scheme described here does not require information about the plant such as Jacobian, because the simultaneous perturbation method estimates the gradient using only values of the error defined by output of the plant and its desired one. Simulation results and actual control results of a real flexible beam system are described to confirm the feasibility of the proposed method.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

{"title": "Organophosphorous chemistry: Selective transformation of benzoin to benzil, desyl bromide, or benzyl phenyl ketone\n", "abstract": " Reaction of benzoin with dibromotriphenylphosphorane under various conditions has been closely investigated. Benzoin was selectively converted to desyl bromide by treatment with dibromotriphenylphosphorane in the presence of triethylamine, while benzyl phenyl ketone was formed in the presence of an excess amount of triphenylphosphine. On the other hand, benzoin was effectively oxidized to bend by treatment with only bromine. The mechanism of producing these was also proposed. Desyl bromide was formed from the reaction of benzoin with dibromotriphenylphosphorane as a primary product and converted to benzyl phenyl ketone via the Perkow reaction, and benzil was formed by the oxidation of benzoin by bromine.

{"title": "An approach to the synthesis of synchronizable finite state machines with partial scan\n", "abstract": " Initialization of sequential circuits is one of time-consuming processes in test generation for sequential circuits, and hence synthesizing sequential circuits of which synchronizing sequences are short is an important approach to reducing the cost of test generation for the circuits. In this paper, we propose an approach to the synthesis of finite state machines (FSMs) with partial scan. We focus on repeating partial scan for synchronizing FSMs, and present an extended synchronizing sequence which consists of scan inputs and normal inputs, and which takes a circuit to a single specific state, regardless of the initial state. To synthesize synchronizable FSMs, we formulate a problem of minimizing extended synchronizing sequence length, and present a heuristic algorithm for the problem. We show the experimental results of the minimization of extended synchronizing sequence length on MCNC'91 benchmark FSMs. The\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

{"title": "Performance analysis of stationary double-acting wave-energy pump\n", "abstract": " Authors have suggested floating wave-energy pumps which convert wave-energy to reciprocating motion of float and pump up sea water. A suction pipe connects the piston to the float which serves as a wave energy absorber. The pump operates in double-action that water is sucked in and pumped up during both up-and-down reciprocating motions of the float-piston. As a first stage to establish a performance analysis model for floating wave-energy pumps, a simple analysis model for stationary caisson pump is proposed. The equation of vertical motion for the float-piston in regular water waves was solved by a personal computer. In-cylinder pressure was concerned with an external force acting to the float-piston and caisson, and was calculated by the equation for conservation of mass and the Bernoulli's equation for unsteady flow. The calculated performance of the stationary pump is compared well with that of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

{"title": "Lexical Representation in semantic memory and phonological priming effects\n", "abstract": " The structure of lexical representations in semantic memory and their processes were investigated through phonological priming effects in lexical decision task. The SOA condition between prime stimuli and target stimuli was varied in three experiments. In each experiment, subjects were 16 graduate or undergraduate students, and 24 three-letter-words (phonologically related/unrelated) or plus signs (neutral) were used as prime, followed by target composed of 12 three-letter-words and 12 three-letter-nonwords. The priming effects occurred in all the experiments, particularly when prime and target shared adjacent two letters. The effects at SOA 400 ms were not stable enough. At SOA 700 ms, only facilitation effects were obtained, but at SOA 1,000 ms, the effects of both facilitation and inhibition were obtained. These results suggested that in lexical representations phonologically similar words were closely related to each other in their structure, and that especially the phonological similarity between the sets of adjacent two letters was important regarding three-letter-words. The results also suggested that it might take longer time to spread activation in lexical representation than in conceptual representation.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

Five-year recurrence free survival of T1N0 glottic carcinoma has increased to 95% from 77% over the past 30 years by means of improved therapeutic equipment and use of additional treatment devices, such as immobilization shell and wedge filter. On the other hand, arytenoid edema which resulted in husky voice after radiation therapy was more infrequently observed in patient treated with lesser treatment volume. Overall 5-year survival of nasopharyngeal cancer patients has been also improved to 52% from 42% during the past 20 years.

A 56-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital on April 27, 1988, because of easy fatigue and double vision. She was diagnosed as having myasthenia gravis from her neurological and laboratory findings. On the 14th hospital day, she developed fever, jaundice, hematuria, purpura and consciousness disturbance. Hematological examination revealed marked anemia, thrombocytopenia, fragmented red blood cells, elevated bilirubin and LDH level. Coagulation studies were almost normal. She was diagnosed as having TTP and treated with corticosteroid, antiplatelet agents and plasma exchange. Clinical condition and laboratory findings improved by the 23rd hospital day. It has been reported that TTP is associated with various autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. However TTP associated with MG appears the first report. This case may suggest that one of pathogenesis of TTP is autoimmune mechanism.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

Although there was some difficulty with plant materials and cell nuclear preparations, beautiful separation patterns were obtained with most materials and analyzed by an image analysis system to demonstrate many isoforms of skeletal muscle troponin T and tropomyosin, coordination or otherwise in accumulation between troponin subunits, T and C, and between lens crystallin isoforms, and tissue-specific distribution of tropomyosin isoforms.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

The mean daily dose was 0.53\u2022} 0.16 \u0192\u00cag/day. OC was increased from 24.6\u2022} 20.4 ng/ml to 49.7\u2022} 42.6 ng/ml (p< 0.05) after the l\u0192\u00bf(OH) D3 treatment. The natural course of hemodialysis and/or less efficient dialysis technique were not responsible for the increase in OC because of the insignificant relation between the OC level and duration of dialysis, and insignificant changes in BUN, creatinine, and PTH levels during the treatment. Significant positive correlations were found between the daily VD dose and the increase in OC level(r= 0.513, p< 0.02), and the serum OC level(r= 0.701, p< 0.01) after the VD treatment. These data suggest that long-term treatment with l\u0192\u00bf(OH) D3 in creases the serum OC level in dialyzed patients, possibly due to improvement of the relative vitamin D deficiency in these patients, followed by an increase of OC synthesis.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1172"]}

{"title": "A Study on Subsurface Tearing\n", "abstract": " In T or corner joints, a type of crack which is caused by subsurface oxide inclusions and shrinkage stresses due to welding is likely to occur. Therefore, this cracking is similar to lamellar tearing. In this paper, the phenomenon has been named \"subsurface tearing\". Subsurface tearing has the following features: (1) The oxide inclusions exist too near to the surface to be detected with ordinary ultrasonic testing (U.T.). However, after welding the joint the subsurface tearing is easily detected by U.T. as a result of vanishing back echo. (2) The oxide inclusions are sparsely distributed in the plate. Therefore, destructive tests, for example, short transverse tensile tests, cannot be used to reveal susceptibilty because most specimens will probably not contain oxide inclusions. (3) The size of the subsurface tearing is small because the inclusions are small and isolated and cracking can occur near them.
