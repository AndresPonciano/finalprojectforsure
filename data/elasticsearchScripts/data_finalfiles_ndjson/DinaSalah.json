{"title": "A framework for the integration of user centered design and agile software development processes\n", "abstract": " Agile and user centered design integration (AUCDI) is of significant interest to researchers who want to achieve synergy and eliminate limitations of each. Currently, there are no clear principles or guidelines for practitioners to achieve successful integration. In addition, substantial differences exist between agile and UCD approaches which pose challenges to integration attempts. As a result, practitioners developed individual integration strategies. However, success evaluation of current AUCDI attempts has been anecdotal. Moreover, AUCDI attempts cannot be generalized to provide guidance and assistance to other projects or organizations with different needs.", "num_citations": "28\n", "authors": ["1384"]}
{"title": "Maturity Models in the Context of Integrating Agile Development Processes and User Centred Design\n", "abstract": " Integrating Agile development processes and User Centred Design (UCD) gained increased interest arguably due to three reasons: first, the reported advantages of UCD in enabling developers to understand the users needs, and how the software can support their goals. Second, the deficiency of Agile methods in: providing guidance for developing usable software; and discussing usability, user requirements elicitation and usability evaluation methods. Third, differences between Agile methods and UCD that can make their integration challenging. Agile and User Centred Design Integration (AUCDI) research  did not exploit Usability Maturity Models (UMMs) potential. Organizations aspiring to achieve AUCDI can utilize UMMs in assessing its UCD capability, identifying organization's UCD weaknesses and strengths, and planning for improvement. This thesis aims to investigate the suitability of utilizing UMMs in the context of Agile processes. In order to achieve this aim, this thesis conducted: first, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) that identified and classified AUCDI challenges and explored the proposed practices to deal with them. Second, an interview study of industrial AUCDI attempts that identified the AUCDI difficulties and integration methods. Third, an interview study that evaluated the suitability of two UMMs; Nielsen model and Usability Maturity Model-Human Centrdness Scale (UMM-HCS) for utilization in assessing usability maturity levels in the context of Agile projects. The results of these studies revealed that both models are deficient in their theoretical maturation foundations and scoring scheme and in addressing the activities\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1384"]}
{"title": "Blockchain Applications in Human Resources Management:  Opportunities and Challenges\n", "abstract": " Blockchain is perceived as a revolutionary technology offering considerable impact on a vast magnitude of sectors including healthcare, supply chain, Internet of Things (IoT), finance, voting systems, property and real-estate management, e-government, higher education, etc. This paper examines the results of an empirical study that conducted ten in-depth, one-to-one semi-structured interviews with Human Resources Management (HRM) experts in order to identify the potential opportunities related to blockchain technology utilization in the HRM domain as well as the anticipated adoption challenges that may hinder its utilization. The study is of significance to both blockchain and HRM researchers who can utilize the proposed opportunities as a future research agenda and work towards mitigating the anticipated adoption challenges.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1384"]}
{"title": "Using Pattern Languages to Design Intelligent Tutoring Systems: A Case Study\n", "abstract": " Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) in the domain of language learning are becoming very common. Software engineering best practices and frameworks should be used to ease the process of developing new intelligent tutoring systems. In this research, we show how a Pattern language for intelligent tutoring systems (PLITS) was used to develop modules of the Arabic Tutor. The Arabic tutor is a web-based ITS for teaching Arabic Grammar. We focus on how PLITS was used to develop both Tutor and interface modules of the Arabic Tutor.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1384"]}
